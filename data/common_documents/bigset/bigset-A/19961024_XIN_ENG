<HEADLINE> China Plays Unique Role in UN, Qin Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qin
Huasun said that China has always insisted on the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter, firmly opposed hegemonism and
power politics, safeguarded the interests of the developing
countries and made important contributions to maintaining world
peace and promoting development.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 25th anniversary of China's resumption of its
legitimate seat in the United Nations, the Chinese permanent
representative to the U.N. told Xinhua that China is the founding
member of the United Nations and one of the five permanent members
of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China in 1949, the People's Republic
of China has been entitled to inherit the seat in the United
Nations. But, New China was excluded from the organization for 22
years due to the obstructions of some countries. Thanks to the
consistent efforts of the majority of developing countries, the
26th session of the U.N. General Assembly adopted resolution 2758
with an overwhelming majority of votes, resuming China's all
legitimate rights in the organization.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Qin said, China has always supported Asian, African
and Latin American peoples' struggle for national independence and
made efforts to the peaceful solution of major international and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, he said, China has played a
unique balancing role in accelerating multi-polarization and
safeguarding world peace.
</P>
<P>
Qin noted that in the past 25 years China has expanded and
deepened its cooperation and exchange with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
China has participated in U.N. activities in the political,
economic, disarmament, social, human rights, legal, scientific and
environmental protection fields. China has supported and attended
all the important international conferences sponsored by the U.N.
and organized the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
While insisting on the principles of the U.N. Charter and norms
of international law, Qin said, China has showed flexibility in
dealing with specific issues in order to seek solutions acceptable
to all parties.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, the United Nations and its agencies
have become an important channel for China to import funds,
technology and information. The U.N. system has assisted a number
of projects in China in the energy, transport, agriculture,
education, public health, environment and disaster relief sectors.
On the other hand, in addition to its donations to the U.N.
agencies, China's efforts to eliminate poverty, increase
employment and realize social harmony are a contribution to the
U.N.'s endeavor to promote social development, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's attempt to "return" to the U.N., Qin said that no
one of the 28 members of the General Committee voiced support for
Taiwan's "representation" in the organization when the agenda of
the 51st session of the U.N. General Assembly was discussed on
September 18. This was the fourth time the General Committee
resolutely rejected the item advocated by a very small number of
countries. The fact proves the firm stand of the overwhelming
majority of countries which are determined to maintain the
authority of the U.N. Charter and resolution 2758, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of the U.N. in the coming decades, Qin said
that the organization is confronted with both opportunities and
challenges as various forces will continue to cooperate and at the
same time compete in the organization at the turn of the century.
However, he said, the role of this most authoritative
intergovernmental organization cannot be replaced by any other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
With the development of China's modernization program, China
will play a greater role in the U.N. and further strengthen its
cooperation with the organization, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Duma Sets Up Budget Conciliatory Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma, the lower house
of the parliament, set up a "conciliatory commission" Wednesday to
deal with the government's 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
At its first hearing a week ago, the Duma rejected the 1997
draft budget proposed by the government, describing it as
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
The commission, chaired by Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov,
comprises "Our Home Is Russia" party leader Sergei Belyayev,
Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov and Yabloko party leader Grigory
Yavlinsky and leaders of other political factions.
</P>
<P>
It also includes the heads of the major committees of the Duma.
</P>
<P>
The government planned to review the draft budget at its
meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Alexander Livshits said, in response to
suggestions by lawmakers, that the government would make "certain
corrections" in the budget, including adding a separate provision
for financing military reform and increasing social and investment
spending.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he would urge changes in the system of
taxation for individuals because a considerable portion of income
had been concealed from taxation.
</P>
<P>
Livshits also said he hoped the government and the Duma would
cooperate constructively and try to finalize the budget by the end
of the year.

<HEADLINE> China to Renovate Technology for Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China is to renovate its power
generating facilities on a large scale to control pollution,
increase economic efficiency and guarantee the safe operation of
power grids, Lu Yanchang, vice-minister of power industry, said
today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference on power technology, Lu said
that by 2000, China should complete the technological renovation
of 7.5-8.0 million kilowatt medium- and low-pressure condenser
tube generating units, which have operated for at least 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to improve the capability of the units to meet
peak hour demands in power consumption, increase security, lower
consumption of energy, and improve environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a consumption reduction, Lu said in the coming
five years, the average coal use in power plants nationwide must
be reduced by 34 grams per kilowatt hour.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 95 percent of the voltage in major
cities across the country should meet the standard, and the
reliability rate of power supply must hit 99.9 percent at least,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Lu said various power grids in China should strengthen
coordination in electricity supplies, so that the capability of
the country's five major regional power companies, and 15
provincial power companies, in the transfer and control of
electricity supplies could reach international advanced levels.

<HEADLINE> Queen Elizabeth Unveils Government Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth II opened this
morning the new session of parliament, the last one before the
general election, by outlining the British government policy, with
crime, education and health at the top of the program.
</P>
<P>
The government program announced by the queen at a traditional
parliamentary ceremony today included 13 bills.
</P>
<P>
She confirmed that there would be a bill to increase choice in
schools and improve discipline and standards, another aimed to
reform the sentencing of serious and persistent offenders and
moves to crack down on welfare fraud.
</P>
<P>
The government's plan to outlaw most handguns except low
caliber guns used in target shooting was also in the queen's
speech.
</P>
<P>
Other measures were to improve and develop primary health care
services, to strengthen powers to protect the coastline from
pollution from shipping and to support the fight against organized
crime, including the setting up of a National Crime Squad.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major hailed the policy plans as a
"meaty" pre-election package, saying that the program showed the
government had not run out of ideas.
</P>
<P>
But Labor leader Tony Blair complained the program did little
to help the economy or long-term unemployed, and accused the
government of leaving the country in limbo, afraid to call an
election.
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said the Tories were
looking to win the election rather than helping the nation.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Vow to Fight Till End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
today vowed to fight till the end to defend Kabul and other areas
of Afghanistan under their control while military threats are
mounting around Kabul, said reports from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"We will defend the areas we have captured and where we have
implemented Shariat (Islamic law) until the last drop of our blood
and as long as one Talib (religious student) is still alive,"
acting Minister of Information and Culture Amir Khan Muttaqi was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, military chief of the former government Ahmad Shah
Masood issued orders to his frontline troops amassing north of
Kabul today in preparation for a major offensive against the
Taliban religious army.
</P>
<P>
"We have brought security and normality to Kabul and the
militia (ex-government) has been driven from the capital.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want insecurity to come back to the capital and we
promise to defend Kabul to the best of our ability," Muttaqi said.
</P>
<P>
Masood's combined force of several thousand moved into
positions near Mir Bacha Kot, about 20 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Masood, who was pushed out of Kabul last month by the Taliban
troops, earlier said he wouldn't launch a direct attack on the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban warned that its forces would strike back at Rashid
Dostum, the northern Afghan warlord controlling seven provinces,
if his troops attacked the Taliban north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi said if General Dostum attacked the Taliban alongside
the forces of the ousted government, the Taliban would have no
choice but to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
The warning came hours after a spokesman for the ex-regime said
Dostum's forces had joined Masood's troops in attacking the
Taliban north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Masood and Dostum and another Afghan party have formed a
three-party opposition alliance against the Taliban after Masood
was driven out of Kabul.

<P>
LUSAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's biggest opposition
United National Independence Party (UNIP) today refused to take
part in the general elections scheduled for November 18 for what
it described as irregularities in the voters' registration.
</P>
<P>
UNIP President Kenneth Kaunda said the serious omissions and
errors in the voters roll have dis-enfranchised thousands of
eligible voters, adding the entire process has been characterized
by "irregularities which have caused lack of public confidence."
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, the former Zambian president, also accused the
government of "corruptly" choosing Nikuv, an Israeli company
which has conducted the voters registration exercise for the
elections, instead of more experienced companies.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said the UNIP party officials would call upon all the
party members to boycott the presidential and parliamentary
elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Kabul will be defended at all
cost, top leader of the Taliban militia Mulla Mohammad Umar told
Afghan Islamic Press today in the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban leadership in Kabul made similar pledge today amid
mounting pressures on the Taliban around Kabul.
</P>
<P>
According to the Peshawar-based press, the 36-year-old
spiritual leader of the Taliban with one eye and a wooden leg said
education is a must for all men and women.
</P>
<P>
However, he said education for women would start after the
establishment of a central government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that a Taliban government would be
recognized by the United Nations and other countries very soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar
returned to Mazar-i-Sharif, stronghold of powerful northern Afghan
warlord Rashid Dostum, after Dostum refused to sign a ceasefire
agreement with the Taliban unless they leave Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Babar is expected to hold talks with Dostum, who earlier agreed
in principle to a ceasefire agreement brokered by Pakistan during
Babar's shuttle diplomacy last week.
</P>
<P>
UN special envoy to Afghanistan Nobort Holl also reached
Mazar-i-Sharif for a meeting with Dostum.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kabul said Ahmad Shah Masood, military commander
of the former government, has launched a big offensive with the
help of Dostum against the Taliban 20 kilometers north of Kabul
today.
</P>
<P>
Taliban spokesman Maulvi Abdul Ghafoor here claimed that the
offensive has been repulsed.

<HEADLINE> China Protests Dalai Lama's Visit to European Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Tibet is an integral part of
China and no other nation, organization or individual should
interfere with the internal affairs of China, a spokesman for
the Chinese Mission to the European Union said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remark here today in response to Dalai
Lama's ongoing visit to the European Parliament (EP) and the
European Commission (EC).
</P>
<P>
As an integral part of China, Tibet is now an autonomous region
under the Chinese sovereignty, he said, adding that no other
nation, parliament, organization or individual should interfere
with China's internal affairs in whatever way.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that instead of being an ordinary
religious person, Dalai Lama was only a political exile who has
long been engaging abroad in activities aimed at splitting up
China.
</P>
<P>
Backed up by some foreign governments and organizations, Dalai
Lama has been intensifying his efforts abroad to split up China,
undermine its national solidarity and destabilize this autonomous
region of China, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A number of EP members have lately invited the Chinese
political exile to visit and make speeches at the parliament and
some EP and EC leaders were even meeting him, which, according to
the spokesman, has constituted a serious violation of Chinese
sovereignty and rude interference with China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
China is paying close attention to developing its relations
with the EU, but such a relationship should be built on the basis
of mutual respect, mutual benefits, equality and non-interference
in each other's internal affairs, the spokesman believed.
</P>
<P>
It should be known that the Chinese government and its people
are always steadfast in their stand as far as their territorial
sovereignty and national dignity are concerned, and that they will
never give in to any outside pressure, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He finally asked the European Parliament and the European
Commission to take the interests of the whole into account to
avoid causing any undue harm to China-EU relations.

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Issue Card of Honor to Ex-Fighters in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
will issue the Card of World War II Fighters to former French
members of the International Brigade which participated in the
Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939 engaging fascist forces.
</P>
<P>
The French government, which began to issue the card in 1993,
only has given it to the resistance fighters during World War II
and not the members of the International Brigade, because France
did not officially join the Spanish War.
</P>
<P>
Chirac expressed the will in a recent letter sent to Jean-Claude
Lefort, a member of the National Assembly from the Communist Party
and a member of the Association of the Friends of Fighters in
Republican Spain (ACER), according to the daily L'Humanite.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his hope that "this measure could be
effective at the time of the transfer of the cinders of Andre
Malraux to the Pantheon on November 23."
</P>
<P>
Andre Malraux, a well-known French writer and resistance fighter
who joined the Spanish War, will have his cinders removed to the
Pantheon in the Latin Quarter of Paris, where are buried the cinders
of many great figures in French history.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the government has asked the Council of State,
which is the supreme jurisdiction body of France, to make the new
measure into a law, said L'Humanite.
</P>
<P>
A presidential decree on issuing the card, which will cover all
the former French members of the International Brigade still alive,
is being prepared by the Ministry of Former Resistance Fighters,
said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 former French members of the International Brigade, most
of them Communist Party members, are still alive today, while the
rest of the 8,500 Frenchmen and Frenchwomen who participated in the
Spanish War on the Republican side have died, according to the ACER.
</P>
<P>
However, many of the Communist fighters also joined the
Resistance War against Germany and therefore have already got the
card, said the association.
</P>
<P>
The International Brigade, manned by 35,000-50,000 volunteers
from 53 countries, combated the fascist forces of General Franco who
was supported by Italy and Germany.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Women Driven Into Prostitution in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- More foreign women in Greece
have been driven into prostitution in the last five years, said
local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
According to Grigoris Lazos, a researcher at the Athens
Panteion University, between 1991 and 1996 the number of foreign
women involved with prostitution in Greece increased by 387 percent
while that of Greek women dropped 22 percent. The ratio between
Greek and foreign prostitutes has also changed -- from 70 Greek to
30 foreign in 1991 to 40 to 60 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Prostitution is legal in Greece under certain conditions.
Prostitutes must have a license, be over 18 and work in licensed
brothels.
</P>
<P>
Lazos estimated there are about 10,500 women prostitutes in
Greece, including 6,100 foreigners. Most of the latter (53 percent)
come from Eastern Europe and 31 percent come from Central Europe
and the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The majority of foreign prostitutes work for an average 22
months in Greece and then go back to their country.
</P>
<P>
Another social activist and president of the Greek Human Rights
Foundation Aliki Yiotopoulou-Marangopoulou said prostitution had
become an organized crime, functioning under mafia rules. She
attributed much of the responsibility to the so-called civilized
and democratic Europe which had been turning its back on the
problem as long as victims remained within the third world.
</P>
<P>
She added the problem became more acute after the Soviet Union
broke up and Western Europe started being flooded by Eastern
European women in search of a way out from poverty.

MAPUTO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Beira Port in central
Mozambique is striving to improve its handling capacity as part
of the implementation of the "Beira Corridor" plan aimed at
boosting the regional trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by David Gomes, the chief executive of the
Mozambican Port and Railway Transport Company.
</P>

The port had handled 530,000 tons of railway cargo by the end
of June, with its yearly capacity estimated to surpass 100 tons,
as compared with last year's 74 tons of goods.
</P>
<P>
The total handling capacity -- by land, sea and railways --
reached 420,000 tons last year and a higher figure is expected.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mandela Appoints S. Africa's New Chief Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, October 23 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today appointed Justice Ismail Mahomed as the
country's first post-apartheid Chief Justice to succeed Justice
Michael Corbett.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Cabinet Secretary Jakes Gerwel in
Cape Town after Wednesday's cabinet meeting. Corbett will retire
next year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cape Town, Mahomed, who is also
deputy president of the Constitutional Court, said it is vital
for the country's judiciary to restore the law's legitimacy in
the post-apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Mahomed became South Africa's first black senior counsel in
1974 and was overlooked several times for the bench by the
former apartheid government.
</P>
<P>
He also served as a judge in neighbouring countries including
Swaziland and Lesotho, and later served as Chief Justice of
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
His 35-year practice at the bar included considerable civil
and criminal litigation although he concentrated on human rights
and appeared in numerous trials on behalf of some leading
anti-apartheid activists.
</P>
<P>
Mahomed was appointed as a permanent judge in South Africa in
1991.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Mahomed was appointed by Mandela to serve on the country's
first constitutional court.
</P>
<P>
And in 1996 he was appointed the Chairman of the South African
Law Commission, a statutory body which reviews and initiates
legislation in the country.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Burundi Reject Zaire's Accusation of Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda and Burundi, two tiny
central African states neighboring their regional giant Zaire,
today categorically rejected an accusation by Zaire that their
troops have attacked the Zairean territory.
</P>
<P>
"The Zairean accusations are groundless," the Agence France
Presse (AFP) quoted Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana as
saying at a press conference today in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Burundian Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama also described the
Zairean accusation as "groundless," and he urged Zaire "not to
give up itself to passion and dramatization," AFP quoted Radio
Burundi as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France again urged the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity to call an international conference
in the Great Lakes region in Africa to discuss the worsening
situation there.
</P>
<P>
Fightings have lasted for several months between Zairean troops
and the Banyamurenges, an ethnic Tutsi people who were originally
from Rwanda but have long settled in eastern Zaire, triggering the
exodus of some 230,000 Hutu refugees from their camps in eastern
Zaire's South Kivu province.
</P>
<P>
Zaire Tuesday for the first time accused the troops of Rwanda
and Burundi of invading North Kivu and South Kivu provinces, and
Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, who is hospitalized in
Switzerland now, has ordered the government to take all means
necessary "to defend national territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
Rwanda said today that although it is trying to exercise
restraint in the confrontation with Zaire, it will definitely
defend its territory if attacked.
</P>
<P>
"The (Rwandan) government is faced with the challenge of
reconstructing its country, and we don't have any intention of
engaging ourselves in conflict with the neighboring country," said
the Rwandan foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Zaire of supporting Hutu extremists who fled
Rwanda after inflicting a genocide against Tutsis and moderate
Hutus in 1994, in which at least half a million people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
"We were the victims of a genocide. There are fugitives (in
Zaire), and among them there are former military men of the
Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR), the Interahamwe militias, and the
politicians, who call for genocide," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister recalled that Zaire supported the FAR,
Hutu troops of the former government of Rwanda, in its war with
the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front from 1990 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
"It is no surprising that there is today complicity between
them," he said in reference to the alleged support given by the
Zairean government to Hutu extremists now taking refuge in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Claude Dusaidi, advisor of Rwandan Defense Minister Paul
Kagame, said that Zaire's accusation is only "an excuse for
continuing to exterminate its own citizens," the Banyamurenges.
</P>
<P>
"I imagine that the young Zairean Tutsis have decided to defend
themselves," he said, in reference to the Banyamurenges who are
regarded as Zairean citizens by Rwanda, but now called "rebels" by
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"Zaire is a problem for all the region," said Dusaidi, while
calling on the international community to stop thinking that "one
can do nothing about Zaire, because Zaire is like this."

JOHANNESBURG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 2,600 trucks were
hijacked in South Africa during the past 12 months, an official
figure released today said.
</P>

The arrests were part of the national anti-crime plan which

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Gives Funds for Voters' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has released
100 million Naira (about 1.25 million US Dollars) to the National
Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON) for the compilation of a fresh
voters's register.
</P>
<P>
But the sum is far from a propasal for 596 million Naira (about
7.45 million Dollars) NECON forwarded earlier to the presidency, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency, the amount released would
not cover the cost of printing the voters' cards and their
registration forms which is estimated at 124 million Naira (about 1.55
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The production of authenic voters' register should have been
finished in the third quarter of this year, according to the
military government's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
The work was delayed by the rainy season, which usually ends in
October, said NECON Chairman Chief Sunmer Dagogo-Jack last week during
the presentation of certificates of registration to the five political
parties whose establishment was announced at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the compilation of the voters' register might
not begin as planned if adequate funds were not made available on time
to NECON to enable it to take care of logistics and the erection of
sheds at the 110,700 voting centers in the country.  enditem

<HEADLINE> 36 States to Attend African Women Conference in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- 36 African countries
have confirmed participation in the second African women's
conference to be opened by President Benjamin Mkapa in Dar Es
Salaam tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference will focus on how to promote
solidarity among women leaders in Africa, Minister of Community
Development, Women and Children Affairs Mary Nagu told a press
conference at the international press center here today.
</P>
<P>
Nagu said the conference will be attended by 26 women
ministers, eight women deputy ministers and 43 members of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The first African women's conference was held in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Nagu said the conference, financed by the U.N. Population Fund
(UNFPA), will also be attended by representatives from the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Nafis Sadik will also attend the
conference, she disclosed.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, participants will discuss how to
promote solidarity among women leaders in sub-Saharan African
countries through proposed regional or national networks and ways
to promote resources mobilization by training African women
policy makers.
</P>
<P>
The conference, to be organized into several training
workshops, is aimed at enhancing the capacity of African women
policy makers in moulding and utilizing public opinion in favor
of issues affecting women, adolescents and children.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian minister appealed to women in the country to
come up in big numbers to join the participants in a precession.

<HEADLINE> Duma Claims Black Sea Fleet Russia's Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma, the lower house
of the Russian parliament, today adopted a bill, claiming the
Black Sea Fleet Russia's property and banning the division of the
fleet with Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed on the eve of Russian President Yeltsin's
scheduled meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, would
prevent the Russian government from signing an agreement with
Ukraine dividing up the fleet.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also instructed the Russian Foreign Ministry to
notify Ukraine of its decision.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet, a major former Soviet fleet, is based on
the Ukrainian Peninsula of Crimea. Russia and Ukraine both claimed
it after the former Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine have reached a tentative agreement on
dividing the fleet, but there have been disputes over the status
of Sevastopol, the headquarters of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
Duma's bill banning the division of the fleet now goes to the
upper chamber, the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
Some Duma deputies told reporters after the voting that if the
upper house approves the split-banning bill, it is sure to face
resistance from Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's envoy to the Duma told reporters at the same time
that "the bill should not have been passed without taking into
consideration the president's opinion."
</P>
<P>
An informed Kremlin source said that the Kremlin does not share
the optimism of the Ukrainian side which says the issue is
resolvable in the near future.
</P>
<P>
But Russia is going to continue the talks on the division and
basing of the fleet, the source said.

</P>
<P>
He said Clinton's statement, for the first time, defined the
timing and prospects for those nations in central and eastern

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Under Secretary
on Women and Development Issues, Getrude Mongella, today urged
African nations to cherish the Beijing conference spirit by
empowering women in various position of leadership and
guaranteeing them political and social rights in the society.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News quoted Mongella as saying at the
University of Dar es Salaam that empowering of women was vital if
the African countries were to realize development changes.
</P>

continue to experience development legacy if they would neglect
the concept.
</P>
<P>
She appealed to African governments to initiate deliberate
strategies for uplifting women education standards to enable them
to fair favourably in various fields and participate effectively
in the social, economic and political activities.
</P>
<P>
The under secretary said the more the african women were
educated the less infant mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
She said that when women were addressing their issues, "they
were not intending to stage a coup detat against any government".
</P>
<P>

green revolution to African countries, to bridge up the
socialization process gap and end women suppression in the
continent.
</P>

<P>
MAPUTO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Marcelo Rebelo De Sousa, leader
of Portugal's Social Democratic Party, today praised Mozambique
for "achieving peace and democracy" not long after experiencing
long years of a destructive war.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese opposition leader made the remarks to reporters
here after holding talks with President Joaquim Chissano on
Mozambique's democratic process and economic development, the
Mozambican News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said he told Chissano that Portugal has all along been
watching the peace process going on in Mozambique with warm and
admiring feelings.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique and Portugal can have "a positive big leap forward"
in bilateral ties of the two countries, he said, but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
As leader of the second largest party in Portugal, Sousa
arrived here on Monday on a five-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
He met with Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the opposition
Mozambican National Resistance Movement (MNR) here on Tuesday and
promised to help train cadres of the MNR and the ruling party
Frelimo.
</P>
<P>
He is now in Beira, a central city and will call on local
officials there. He will go to Tete province and visit Cabora

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Peace Process Not Easy: Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major warned the Irish Republican Army (IRA) today that "soft
words" alone would not earn its political allies a seat at the
talks table.
</P>
<P>
As the British parliament opened for its last session before
the country's general election, Major sounded pessimistic about
the chances of restoring momentum to a peace process that has been
stalled since the IRA resumed bombing British targets in February.
</P>
<P>
"I can not look into the minds of the terrorists and predict
what they will do. But I do know that the road to a settlement
will not be easy," Major said.
</P>
<P>
He said the IRA, by shattering its 17-month ceasefire, had
excluded itself and its political wing, Sinn Fein, from
multi-party talks that started in Belfest in June.
</P>
<P>
"But the talks will continue without them. The IRA and Sinn
Fein should be under no illusion that they can join the process
until they have demonstrated real commitment to democratic and
non-violent methods," Major said.
</P>
<P>
"So even if a new ceasefire is declared, there will have to be
more than soft words to convince the government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Major was speaking a day after a London police chief said
Britain faced "dangerous months" in which IRA guerrillas could
launch further attacks on the British mainland.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR Es SALAAM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania government
owes the Desert Locust Control Organization (DLCO) 414 million
U.S. Dollars as an outstanding contribution to it.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Agriculture and Cooperativen Paul Kimiti said here
today that the government is ready to pay the sum but has failed
to do so due to economic constraints.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania News Agency quoted Kimiti as telling visiting
Chairman of DLCO Tesfai Ghermazien that the government is
prepared to pay the outstanding contribution between January and
February next year, if economic conditions permit.
</P>
<P>
Ghermazien, who is also Eritrea's Minister for Agriculture, is
in the country to make a follow-up of the Tanzania's
contributions to the DLCO.
</P>
<P>
Minister Kimiti further said the DLCO is important to Tanzania
and that the organization has been in the forefront to assist
Tanzania during locust outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
He cited the recent locust outbreak in Dodoma, Central
Tanzania, where DLCO actively participated in combating the
issue, saying "there was no country which could fight locusts by
its own."
</P>
<P>
Explaining the current financial situation of DLCO, Ghermazien
said the DLCO condition is worse to the extent that it has failed
to pay salaries to its workers for the past six months.

<HEADLINE> SADC States Unhappy with Savimbi's Non-commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAMM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Defense and Security
Ministers in Southern Africa are not happy with Angola's former
rebel movement UNITA's non-commitment toward the peace process in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Defense and National Service Maokola Majogo told
a press conference here today that the ministers from 12 SADC
countries who met in Lilongwe, Malawi last week, expressed regret
on the non-committal attitude displayed by UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi turned down an invitation to attend the special
Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit convened in
Luanda, Angola on October 2, which was aimed at strengthening the
peace process in the zone and in Angola in particular.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers strongly appealed to Dr. (Jonas) Savimbi to
honor the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol, and subsequent peace
agreements, without any further delay," Majogo said.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government and the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) signed the peace accord in Zambia
in 1994, pledging to end their 19-year civil war and realize
peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi refused to attend the summit held in Luanda, saying
he feared his security would be in danger if he attended the
meeting in the Angolan capital.
</P>
<P>
Member states to SADC include Mauritius, Angola, Mozambique,
South Africa, Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabweque,
Botswana, Swaziland, and Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania delegation led by Defense Minister Majogo,
included minister for Home Affairs Ali Ameir Mohammed, Chief of
Defense Forces General Robert Mboma and Inspector General of

<HEADLINE> Party Conventions Cost More Than Anticipated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- This summer's Republican
National Convention in San Diego cost both public and private
agencies about 45 million dollars, according to Federal Election
Commission financial statements.
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego and its private host committee reported a
combined 31 million dollars in spending. Roughly three-fifths of
the total was funded by individual and corporate contributions.
</P>
<P>
The Port of San Diego and the San Diego Convention and Visitors
Bureau add some three million dollars to the total.
</P>
<P>
The rest was 12.2 million dollars the Republican National
Committee received from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
FEC statements released this week indicate San Diego's spending
was higher than originally announced by city officials.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Susan Golding initially estimated the city's convention
bid at a maximum 26 million dollars in public and private funds.
</P>
<P>
When the Republican National Committee later pegged the
host-city commitment at 31 million dollars, Golding said it was
"capped" at 23 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chicago had a similar experience with the 1996 Democratic
National Convention. It announced an initial bid of 32 million
dollars, later revised it downward to 28 million dollars and
finally reported host-city expenditures of 33.5 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Buying more U.S. Stocks This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors are
flocking to U.S. Stocks this year as U.S. stock prices is going
up, The Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners bought a net 6.9 billion dollars of U.S. stocks in
the second quarter of this year, the latest period for which data
are available, according to the Securities Industry Association, a
Wall Street trade group.
</P>
<P>
That was 87 percent more than they bought in the first three
months of this year and the highest amount since overseas
investors added 7.2 billion dollars of the U.S. stocks to their
portfolios in the first quarter of 1994, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In all, foreigners purchased a net 10.6 billion dollars in the
first half of this year, putting them on track to possibly match
the record 21.6 billion dollars they acquired in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors bought a net 2.3 billion dollars of U.S.
stocks in the second quarter after dumping 789 million dollars in
the first three months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Europeans remain fickle. The largest buyers in the
second quarter were the Swiss, who purchased 556 million dollars.
But the French and Italians actually sold shares.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the steady climb of U.S. stock prices and a
strengthening dollar have produced an inviting environment for
foreign investors, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Vigils to Protest U.N. Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Vigils will be held in
27 cities throughout the world this evening -- the eve of the
United Nations Day -- to protest the U.N.'s financial crisis and
to demand that all countries, especially the U.S., pay their U.N.
dues on time, in full and without condition, according to
organizers.
</P>
<P>
"Citizens are fed up with the hypocrisy of governments trashing
the United Nations and ignoring international law," William Pace,
Executive Director fo the World Federalist Movement, told
reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are especially concerned at the refusal of the United
States, the host government, to pay its legally-obligated dues and
arrears," he added.
</P>
<P>
For over a year, the U.N. has been on the verge of financial
collapse. Member states now owe the organization 2.5 billion
dollars, and the U.S. alone owes 1.44 billion dollars, more than
all the other members combined.
</P>
<P>
The organizers, including World Federalist Movement, Global
Policy Forum and World Federation of the U.N. Association, noted
that the current U.S. share of the regular U.N. budget -- 321
million dollars -- is only 0.02 percent of federal spending or
less than one percent of New York City's annual outlays.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the total U.N. system, including peace-keeping,
health care, human rights, programs for children and women, food
and humanitarian relief, comes to less than 10 billion dollars per
year. By contrast, countries spent 36 billion dollars in 1994 on
the global arms trade and 850 billion dollars on military forces.
</P>
<P>
The organizers strongly criticize the U.S. which withholds the
payment to put pressure on the organization for its own political
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The vigils will be held in 13 U.S. cities such as New York
City, Boston, San Francisco, Philadelphia and Chicago and in 14
cities of Japan, Malaysia, Canada, France and other countries.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales Fall by 0.3 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- An unexpected 12.0 percent drop
in shoe sales contributed to a 0.3 percent fall in retail sales in
Britain last month, according to figures released Wednesday by the
Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The figures, compared with a 0.9 percent rise in August, helped
slow the rate of year-on-year sales growth to 3.5 percent from the
4.3 percent seen in the year to August.
</P>
<P>
City economists had expected a fall of 0.1 percent or so. But
the ONS said that the trend was positive, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
Prices of clothing and footwear rose sharply by 5.2 percent in
September and retail sales in this sector also fell sharply by 3.0
percent after jumping 2.2 percent in August, dragging down overall
retail activity in September.
</P>
<P>
However, the government welcomed the figures as evidence that
the consumer-led recovery is still well on track with little sign
of inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the figure will offer Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke more support to resist Bank of England
governor Eddie George's call to raise interest rates.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government OKs Direct Aid Flights to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has
permitted American aid planes to fly directly to Cuba to deliver
food, clothing and medicine for Cuban victims of Hurricane Lili.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said today the
Treasury Department approved an application from the Catholic
Relief Services for an emergency flight to help large numbers of
Cubans left homeless by the hurricane last week.
</P>
<P>
The cargo plane could be headed to Cuba by the weekend, U.S.
Burns said. The flight is consistent with the U.S. policy of
people-to-people exchanges with Cuba, he added.
</P>
<P>
Direct flights to Cuba were halted in March, a month after
Cuban MiGs shot down two small planes belonging to a Miami-based
exile group.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. report, the hurricane destroyed 5,460 homes
and damaged 78,855 others. It also devastated more than 1.6
million acres of sugar cane plantations, 53,000 acres of banana
plantations and 90,000 acres of other crops.

<HEADLINE> A Bidding War Breaks out for Rail Meager in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A bidding war broke out
today in a U.S. rail meager when Norfolk Southern Corp. announced
an offer for the Conrail which is nearly 1 billion dollars more
than CSX's offer last week.
</P>
<P>
Norfolk Southern is offering 8.1 billion dollars in cash for
the Conrail. The CSX cash and stock offer last week was initially
worth 8.4 billion dollars, but its stock price has fallen more
than 6 percent since then, pulling down the value of the total CSX
bid to a little under 7.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
Either merger would create one of the biggest railroad in the
U.S., a giant that would dominate the rail freight industry in the
East area in the country.
</P>
<P>
Norfolk Southern, which had been rumored earlier this year to
be interested in buying Conrail, had signaled its willingness to
disrupt the CSX deal when it was announced last week.
</P>
<P>
"A combined Norfolk Southern-Conrail will create a more
balanced eastern rail system and will do so by increasing, rather
than diminishing, competition in the industry," Norfolk Southern
chairman David R. Goode said in statement.
</P>
<P>
Goode said he had suggested a combination as recently as 11
days before the CSX deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
A combined Norfolk Southern and Conrail would, like a
CSX-Conrail deal, create the second largest railroad in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
A merged CSX and Conrail would serve the eastern half of the
United States from Chicago and New Orleans to Boston, New York and
Miami. CSX tracks are more evenly spread across the East than
Norfolk Southern's.
</P>
<P>
The bidding war for the meager of Conrail between CSX and
Norfolk Southern Corp. spotlights the harsh competition between
the U.S. rail transportation companies.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Economic Growth Rate Reaches 6.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's economic growth
rate increased from 4.4 percent in 1994-95 to 6.1 percent in
1995-96 with the industrial sector growth rate standing at 6.1
percent, almost double that of the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Annual Report of State Bank of Pakistan issued
today, the growth rate of the three main sectors -- agriculture,
industry and services -- accelerated to a range of 5.8-6.7
percent, with the largest increase recorded in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector registered a 6.7 percent increase in
1995-96, exceeding the target of 6.2 percent for the year and up
from the average growth rate of 5.6 percent in the preceding two
years and a negative growth rate of 5.3 percent in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
Amongst the major crops, cotton production registered the
largest increase of 22.2 percent, indicating success in
controlling the leaf curl virus problem which had badly marred the
cotton performance in the preceding three years.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate, according to the Commercial Price Index,
decelerated from 13.0 percent in 1994-95 to 10.8 percent in
1995-96, although it was above the target of 9.5 percent, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the inflation rate was more pronounced in terms of
the wholesale price index, which decelerated from 15.0 percent to
10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Investment activities showed considerable buoyancy in
large-scale manufacturing and electricity and gas.
</P>
<P>
Real investment increased by 35.6 percent in large-scale
manufacturing and by 24.0 percent in electricity and gas in
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of total investment to the gross national products
(GNP) increased from 18.6 percent in 1994-95 to 19.4 percent in
1995-96, with the large increase in private sector investment more
than offsetting the decline in the ratio of public sector
investment to the GNP.
</P>
<P>
The credit plan for 1995-96 was formulated to achieve the twin
objectives of controlling inflation and ensuring sufficient
availability of bank credits to meet the genuine financing needs
of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Net domestic assets increased by 20.2 percent, compared with an
increase of 12.3 percent in the previous year and the target of
14.3 percent for 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The major factor behind the excessive increase in net domestic
assets was government borrowings for budgetary support, which, at
53.6 billion rupees (1.34 billion US dollars), was well-above the
target of 28.1 billion rupees (703 million dollars) in the credit
plan.

<HEADLINE> Zaire to Complain About Rwanda, Burundi at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Zaire will lodge a complaint
against Rwanda and Burundi at the United Nations Security Council
over what it alleges was "the attack" launched by the two
countries against its territory.
</P>
<P>
The National Radio of Zaire reported today that, on Wednesday,
a vice foreign minister of Zaire met with the ambassadors of the
five permanent member countries of the U.N. Security Council in
Kinshasa. The minister told them of the "the determination of
Zaire to lodge a formal complaint with supporting evidence."
</P>
<P>
It was certainly an attack by Rwanda and Burundi, and not an
interior rebellion as some wanted the people to believe, the vice
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The Banyamurenges have always lived in peace with the local
population and their problem rises out of a question of
nationality, which will be solved by the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been going on for more than two months between
Zairean troops and the Banyamurenges, an ethnic Tutsi people who
were originally from Rwanda, but have long been settled in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Burundi Wednesday rejected the accusation by Zaire
that their troops attacked the South Kivu and North Kivu provinces
of Zaire, and said the accusation was only an excuse for
"terminating" the Banyamurenges.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government, which regards Banyamurenges as Zairean
nationals, said youths of the minority tribe were defending
themselves against government forces.
</P>
<P>
Zaire does not recognize the Banyamuranges, who number between
250,000 and 400,000, as its nationals. It has accused Rwanda of
providing arms and training to the "rebels."
</P>
<P>
At least 83 people, most of them local villagers, were killed
earlier this week in fighting between the Zairean troops and the
Banyamurenges.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Newspaper Accuses Foreign Powers of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi newspaper Al-Thawra,
mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party, today accused foreign
powers of interfering in the Kurdish affairs in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"These forces, chiefly the United States, bear the greater
part of the responsibility for the deterioration of situation in
northern Iraq," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The conflicting Kurdish factions should have the boldness to
restrain themselves, to reconsider their attitudes and to place
the interests of their homeland above maneuvers and narrow
interests..." the paper added.
</P>
<P>
It called on the rival Kurdish factions to enter into a
dialogue in order to put an end to their bloody conflict.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) have agreed in principle to a
cease-fire in northern Iraq, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Robert Pelletreau announced in Ankara Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau made the announcement after concluding his talks
with Massoud Barzani, the leader of the KDP, and PUK's leader
Jalal Talabani.
</P>
<P>
He said that more talks will be held in Ankara next week in a
bid to end the clashes in northern Iraq between the KDP and PUK.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy, who arrived in Turkey Sunday, said that the
KDP and PUK agreed to attend the talks which will be held with
the participation of representatives from the U.S., Britain and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the KDP and PUK leaders would take part in the talks,
Pelletreau said: "I think they will send delegations, we will be
in an effort to lay the foundations of reconciliation agreement."
</P>
<P>
The latest clashes between the two rival factions erupted when
Barzani, aided by Baghdad's troops, took over northern Iraq in a
move which triggered U.S. military strikes on Iraqi missile
targets in early September.
</P>
<P>
Talabani retaliated two weeks ago and retook some of the lost
towns.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Namibian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today that the Chinese government is confident about the further
consolidation and development of Sino-Namibian traditional
friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li was speaking in Beijing during a meeting with Namibian
President Sam Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with "his old friend", Li recalled their
meeting in September 1992, when Nujoma visited China, saying that
they had a very good meeting then, and that the successful visit
had promoted the development of Sino-Namibian friendship and
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Four years have passed since then, Li continued, adding that
Nujoma's current visit indicates that he attaches importance to
the development of bilateral friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li said he believes that the current visit is certain to
contribute to the enhancement of mutual understanding, and promote
even more bilateral cooperations in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma talked about his important and fruitful talks yesterday
with his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin, saying that both sides
agreed to support each other in politics and diplomacy, and
decided to expand bilateral friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said he views his current visit as one of significance.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that China and Namibia, although far away from each
other, established brotherly relations with mutual trust long ago,
which has enabled them to share weal and woe.
</P>
<P>
As early as the time when the Namibian people were struggling
for national independence, the Chinese Communist Party had good
relations with the South West Africa People's Organization, noted
Li.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries established diplomatic relations, Li
went on to say, the two countries have conducted effective
cooperation in various fields, on the basis of mutual respect,
equality and reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China values Sino-Namibian traditional
friendship, and pays much attention to the development of sincere,
friendly, equal, united and cooperative ties with Namibia, aiming
at a common development.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma reiterated that his country adheres to a "one China"
policy, and opposes any attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
Expressing his congratulations on the upcoming resumption of
China's sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, Nujoma said he hoped
that the Taiwan issue can also be resolved at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Li voiced the Chinese government's appreciation for the
Namibian government's support for China on the Taiwan issue, and
in international affairs, as well as Namibia's support for the
reunification of the motherland of China.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in southern Africa, Nujoma said that Africa
was once a victim of foreign manipulation, and now, there are
still some foreign powers trying to continue their exploitation in
Africa, and save no benefit for African people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Southern African Development Community is an
organization aiming at development and stability, and it will
cooperate with the Organization of African Unity in removing some
regional unstable elements.
</P>
<P>
He held that the non-aligned movement should be strengthened,
and his country appreciates China's participation in the movement
as an observer, which is a good way of enhancing south-south
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On state-to-state ties, Li pointed out that China always holds
that it is up to the people of each country to choose their path
to development in accordance with their own conditions, and
opposes any interference in the internal affairs of other
countries by any country, no matter what the reason or excuse.
</P>
<P>
The deeds by some developed countries, which exert pressures on
developing countries by using the means including economic one and
human rights, are bound to meet opposition from most developing
countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
On UN affairs, Nujoma said the Cold War has come to an end, and
the international community should make joint efforts to give an
end to the fact that the voice of developing countries have been
neglected.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the status and role of developing countries are
improving, their rational views should be respected by the
international community, and their legal rights and interests
should be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Namibian government, Nujoma invited Li and his
wife to visit Namibia at their convenience, and Li accepted the
invitation with pleasure.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Praises China's Contribution to Children's Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior United Nations
Children's Fund official today praised China for its remarkable
achievements in child welfare.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Lewis, UNICEF executive director, recalled its
successful co-operation with China on the development of Chinese
children's welfare and education.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference that UNICEF has so far invested a
total of 220 million US dollars in a number of projects in China's
culture, education and public health.
</P>
<P>
"Many indicators used to determine the situation of Chinese
children have reached, or surpassed the requirements set forth in
the Manila Consensus, adopted by the 1993 Ministerial
Consultation, for the East Asia and Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
He also praised China for providing 240 million Chinese
children - 80 percent of the total children in the country - with
regular medical tests, which has helped lower the rate of
vaccine-preventable diseases dramatically.
</P>
<P>
China's child population accounts for one-fifth of the world's
total.
</P>
<P>
Pratima Kate, UNICEF regional director for East Asia and the
Pacific, said that the mortality rate of infants in China was much
lower than 5.5 percent in the region, representing a decline of
14.5 percentage points from the figure 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Keshat Mathema, UNICEF representative to China said that the
UNICEF will conduct further cooperation in the fields of child
education and welfare in the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Few Canadians Use Internet: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite all the fanfare about
Internet, few Canadians seem to have been lured into actually
surfing the information highway.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some 32 percent of Canadian households have a
personal computer, but only 7.4 percent of them actually use the
Internet from their home computers.
</P>
<P>
The figures are far lower than most Internet experts had
predicted, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
In other words, 92.6 percent of Canadian households don't use
the Internet, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than half of Canadian who had computers with modems were
hooked up, the paper quoted the latest Statistics Canada survey as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Quebec had the lowest usage of the Internet of any Canadian
province, with 4.1 percent of households hooked up, compared with
8.7 percent in neighboring Ontario, and about 10 percent in Albert
and British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
While lots of Canadians are buying computers, the machines are
often for their school-aged children, said Jim Carrol, holder of
the 1996 title Canadian Internet Person of the Year.
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, half of the people who have a modem don't know
what to do with it," he said, adding that Canadians remain largely
confused by computers in general, much less the intricacies of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
"The technology has outstripped the ability of people to deal
with it," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, hooking up to the Internet cost 15 to 23 U.S.
dollars a month, which may also help explain the fact fewer
Canadian are enthusiastic about the Internet.

<HEADLINE> UN Day Celebrated in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Reasonable reforms of the
United Nations are necessary, but to enable the UN to maintain its
normal operation, all member states should meet their financial,
and other obligations under the Charter, Chinese Vice Foreign
Minister Li Zhaoxing said in Beijing today, at a meeting to mark
UN Day.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the reforms should give expression to the
principle of sovereign equality, and take such an approach of
democratic consultation, to fully reflect the aspirations and
demands of developing countries, which make up two-thirds of UN
membership.
</P>
<P>
October 24 was designated as UN Day by the second UN General
Assembly in 1947, and tomorrow will mark the 25th anniversary of
the restoration of legal rights of the People's Republic of China
in the UN.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 25 years, China discharged faithfully its duties
and obligations as a member state of the UN, and a permanent
member of its Security Council, Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has taken part in the work of the UN in
political, economic, disarmament, social, human right and legal
fields with a positive, pragmatic, earnest and responsible
attitude, adding China had become an active contributor to the
affairs of the UN through its effective work.
</P>
<P>
Li, on behalf of the Chinese government, expressed gratitude to
all those working in UN offices in China, who made praiseworthy
efforts over the years in promoting cooperation between the UN and
China.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of holding this function is to propagate the spirit
of the UN Charter, to let the 1.2 billion Chinese people have a
better understanding of the UN, and to support its activities and
cause of justice, said Xie Qimei, president of the UN Association
of China (UNA-China).
</P>
<P>
N. Holcombe, resident coordinator of UN operational activities
in China, pointed out that 1996 and 1997 will likely be critical
years for the UN, saying it needs the full support of member
states in clarifying and agreeing upon its future mandate,
structure and staffing.
</P>
<P>
On the difficulties in budget and other areas, Holcombe
said: "China regularly pays its dues to the UN, and is not one of
the 100 delinquents. The United States is the biggest delinquent,
owing over half the total, or 1.6 billion US dollars, for past and
current payments."
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the function, sponsored by UNA-China,
were representatives of the UN agencies in Beijing, diplomatic
envoys and diplomats to China, and scholars and specialists
engaged in UN studies.

construction as the central task, have the overall interests of
the Party and the people in mind, handle relations between

increase the attractiveness, instructiveness and persuasiveness of
propaganda work, and build a news contingent with strong political

</P>
<P>
He said that the press work is important to the Party and the

changes, and reflect the all-round vitalization of the Chinese
nation in an honest way, and encourage the people of all
nationalities to plunge into the great practice of reform, opening
up and modernization drive.

line and principles, and Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese Characteristics, serve the people and
socialism, give priority to positive propaganda, and the interests
of the country as a whole, and conscientiously observe the media
disciplines.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Price Index Goes Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Sensitive Price
Indicator (SPI) for the week ending October 21 showed an increase
of 0.33 percent over the index of the previous week.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the Federal Bureau of
Statistics, the SPI, with 1990-91 as the base, stood at 190.65 for
the week ending October 21 against 190.02 for the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The SPI is higher by 11.98 percent as compared with the index
of the corresponding week of last year.
</P>
<P>
This upward movement is mainly due to rises in the prices of
wheat, flour, wheat, eggs, cooking oil and sugar.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Statistics compiles the SPI every week,
with 1990-91 as the base, in respect of 46 essential commodities
mostly consumed by industrial, commercial and government employees
earning up to 1,500 rupees (37.5 US dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
The price index of 19 daily food items for the week ending
October 21, 1996, rose by 0.65 percent from the previous week and
by 12.26 percent from the corresponding week of last year.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Congratulates Arch-Foe on Election Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Thursday congratulated his arch-foe, Alexander Rutskoi, on being
elected governor of the Kursk region by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
In a greeting to Rutskoi, who was a former vice president,
Yeltsin said he hoped Rutskoi would "on this high post promote
stabilization of the social and economic situation in the region,
and further economic reforms aimed at improving the life of the
population."
</P>
<P>
The new post will give 49-year-old Rutskoi a place in the
Federal Council (upper house of the parliament) and a fresh role
in Moscow politics.
</P>
<P>
Rutskoi was Yeltsin's running mate when Yeltsin was first
elected in 1991. But they soon fell out, personally and
politically, and Rutskoi was jailed for leading the 1993 revolt
against the president.
</P>
<P>
Rutskoi and other mutiny leaders were arrested after a crack
down, but was freed later under the State Duma (lower house of the
parliament) amnesty.
</P>
<P>
Rutskoi, a decorated Afghan war veteran, went back into
politics after release by forming a nationalist movement called
Derzhava, or Great Power.
</P>
<P>
Failing to win enough support to enter the presidential
election race earlier this year, Rutskoi allied his party with the
opposition communists.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the alliance resulted in Rutskoi's
victory in Sunday's elections in the Kursk region, central
Russia. He gained 79 percent of votes, so staging a political
comeback despite the barriers in his way.
</P>
<P>
Rutskoi was initially barred from the regional elections, but a
"court decision" only 36 hours before the vote gave him a chance
to join the polls, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Yeltsin wished Rutskoi "success for the sake of
a flourishing of the Kursk region and the revival of Russia."

<HEADLINE> Offshore Oil Workers Encouraged to Produce More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China's top leaders have
encouraged the country's offshore petroleum workers to
step up efforts for greater development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and Vice-Premier Zou
Jiahua wrote to participants in a national conference today to
commend outstanding workers in the offshore oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin's inscription was, "develop the blue territory, and
promote the offshore petroleum industry".
</P>
<P>
Li Peng's inscription was, "establish a modern enterprise
system, and develop the offshore petroleum industry".
</P>
<P>
The offshore oil and gas industry stands out for its promotion
of national industries with high speed and efficiency, said Vice
Premier Zou Jiahua at the conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Zou, China has signed more than 1000 contracts
with over 60 overseas companies to co-develop offshore oil and
gas, utilizing more than five billion US dollars in direct
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
As a key energy source, Zou pointed out, oil and gas are of
great significance to China's accomplishment of its development
goals across the century. And exploitation of gas should take
priority because of the growing demand for clean energy.
</P>
<P>
This year, China is expected to produce 14 million tons of
crude oil and three billion cubic meters of natural gas from its
offshore fields.

<HEADLINE> Russia "Definitely" Against NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia is definitely against the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's eastwards expansion plans,
though it is ready to continue dialogue with it on strengthening
European security, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Tarasov, head of the ministry's information department,
said Russia was open to joint efforts to form a basis for its
relations with NATO in a bid to set up a European security system
involving all European nations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent statement by United States President
Bill Clinton on admitting some Central and Eastern European
nations into NATO, Tarasov said Russia was "definitely against
NATO's expansion," but would not "turn its back on (maintaining)
contact with NATO."
</P>
<P>
He said NATO's expansion would directly affect Russia's
national interests and would inevitably lead to new division lines
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said it was necessary to adjust NATO to new political
conditions in Europe, including cooperation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
NATO's expansion was under discussion in the Organization for
Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE), ahead of its
forthcoming Lisbon summit, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador: Cairo Offers Multi-Entry Visas To </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli businessmen now can
get a single "multi-visa" for as many visits to Egypt as they
want in any six-month period, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed
Bassiouny in Tel Aviv Wednesday. The news was greeted with
delight by some 30 top businessmen, who had expressed concern
about what they called bureaucratic difficulties of traveling to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador called on all sides to exert great efforts to
make the forthcoming third Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference a major success.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will be proud to hold the conference next month," said
Bassiouny. "I believe that you recognize the economic potential
of the Middle East. In spite of all the challenges, which we do
not exaggerate nor underestimate, there are bridges which could
be crossed."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador indicated that as the host, Egypt is waiting
to see the response abroad before clarifying how many domestic
companies will take part.
</P>
<P>
"Not less than 300 Egyptian businessmen will participate," he
said.
</P>
<P>
So far 3,000 people from the international business community
have accepted invitations to attend, with 700 company
confirmations and 99 countries sending government delegations.
</P>
<P>
A number of Israeli businessmen canceled or refused to
attend the summit out of concern about the political atmosphere
and personal safety.
</P>
<P>
While the number of companies attending the conference is
increasing, there is still uncertainty about participation at the
 political level.
</P>
<P>
It now seems increasingly likely that Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and other world leaders will be invited to attend the
conference, according to Israel's Foreign Ministry deputy
director-general Oded Eran.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walmer, who is now in Israel,
said that Secretary of State Warren Christopher is likely to
lead the U.S. delegation, but the matter would depend on the
outcome of the U.S. presidential election scheduled to take
place on November 5.
</P>
<P>
The first two summit conferences were held respectively in
Morocco's Casablanca in 1994 and Jordan's Amman in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Qian: African Nations' Sovereignty Should be Respected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The maintenance of stability in
Africa should rely on the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and
each African country's own efforts, Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Every African country's independence and sovereignty should be
respected," he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed the viewpoint during a meeting with Namibian
Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab, who is accompanying Namibian
President Sam Nujoma on a China trip.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome to Gurirab, Qian said that President
Nujoma's China visit, which follows Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's visit to Namibia, shows that Sino-Namibian ties are very
close and friendly, and the friendship between the two peoples is
getting closer and closer.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, Jiang and Nujoma held fruitful talks on developing
bilateral friendly co-cooperation, and they also exchanged views
on international and regional issues of common concern, Qian said,
adding that the two presidents reached an extensive consensus,
voicing that Nujoma's current visit has further strengthened
bilateral friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Qian, Gurirab said that his president is
satisfied with the result of the talks between the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
He said that both countries have a long history, and with joint
efforts, the traditional friendship between the two peoples will
develop continuously.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Qian on the latest situation of southern Africa,
Gurirab stressed that his country devotes itself to the regional
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
In June of this year, the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) established institutions of politics, security
and defense, which will benefit the regional stability, Gurirab
noted.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned that Namibia fully supports the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence, and they also can be the
basis for his country's foreign policy and diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating Gurirab's briefings, Qian said southern Africa is
continuing its move towards a positive direction, and the region
has come into a new period of seeking stability and development.
</P>
<P>
SADC plays an increasingly important role in advancing regional
economic co-cooperation and development, and it has become a most
vigorous regional organization in Africa, which has attracted the
attention of the international community, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of its politics, security and defense
institutions shows that this organization has been improved, Qian
said, adding that China appreciates the improvement.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his belief that the international community
should offer Africa more support and aid, while interfering less,
saying that the turbulence of Africa is mostly the result of
external interference and power politics.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Namibia adheres to a non-aligned and
good-neighborly foreign policy, plays an active role in
international and regional affairs, and has made its contribution
to regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Qian also expressed his thanks for Namibia's "one China" stance
against any act aiming at creating "two Chinas".

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Reaffirms Need For UNPREDEP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA. October 24 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia today restated its
reasons for requesting the extension of the mandate of the United
Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in the former
Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonia Information Center reported that the Macedonian
Foreign Minister, Ljubomir Frckovski, said the U.N. Force had set
a good example in conflict prevention.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking at the closing ceremony of a seminar
on "preventive diplomacy".
</P>
<P>
Frckovski called the U.N. peacekeeping mission the "Macedonian
Model". He said it had accumulated a wealth of experiences and
supplied a firm ground for preventive diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
He also repeated the three reasons for the extension. Firstly,
areas along the border between Macedonia and Yugoslavia's Kosov
province, populated mainly by ethnic Albanians, remained tense
even after the Dayton peace agreements on Bosnia was signed last
November.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, territorial disputes between Greece and Turkey were
another source of instability. Thirdly, the Macedonian army did
not have the capability to defend the republic's northern and
southern borders.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, in Skopje, capital of Macedonia, was attended by
deputies from more than 40 countries. It focused on how to prevent
military conflicts.
</P>
<P>
An international conference on Europeanization and harmony
among Balkan neighbors would be held in Macedonia in January
1997, and attended by U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
and leaders of European Union member states, the foreign minister
said..
</P>
<P>
In response to a request by the Macedonian government, the
U.N. Security Council recently agreed to extend the UNPREDEP
mandate for six months, from November 31.
</P>
<P>
The 1,100-member UNPREDEP, at the invitation of
newly-independent Macedonia, was deployed in late 1992 along the
country's northern and eastern borders because of fear of the
Bosnian war spreading.

<HEADLINE> Iran Predicts Oil Price Drop Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian oil specialist
predicted a price drop in the world oil market in 1997,
saying the oil price would fluctuate between 17 and 21 dollars
per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Hojjat Ghanimi, Director of the National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC), said that the oil prices in the coming year would not be
much higher than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Persian daily Akbar quoted him as saying that "there are
projections that the price of North Sea Brent crude would
swing round 17-21 dollars and no more."
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran should not take for granted artificially
high oil prices at present for next year's economic planning. The
recent rise in oil price in the international market has been
caused by political rather than economic factors.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the oil price hike in the past few weeks to
tension in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad's push into the Kurdish
occupied northern Iraq, the approaching U.S. presidential
elections, early cold spell in the northern hemisphere and the
drop in stockpiled oil in the industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The oil price hike could be also due to the massive
paper trading of oil in the international energy market, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the second largest oil exporter in the world,
which pumps 3.7 million barrels of crude and exports 2.5
million barrels of crude every day in line with the OPEC
quota.
</P>
<P>
Iran is expected to earn an oil export revenue of 18
billion dollars this year -- about 2 billion dollars more than
the previous projection thanks to oil price hike in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
"There are strong indications in the market that the oil
exporting countries should not be very optimistic about the
continuation of the present oil prices for the next year,"
he added.

MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
plans to sign a treaty on friendship and cooperation with Ukraine
during his visit to Kiev scheduled after his November heart

</P>
<P>
His spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told a news conference

problems relating to the Black Sea Fleet dispute were resolved.
</P>

She said that the 1997 draft budget was prepared as a
"balanced budget," and that this would be tested for the first
time since 1970.
</P>
<P>
For a balanced budget, the tax revenues have been raised from
27 billion U.S. dollars to 32 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decisive factor in this increase has been the rise in the
number of tax payers, which has gone up from 2 million to 7
million, she said, adding that by the end of the year 1997 the
number of registered tax payers in the country would rise to 20
million.

<P>
PARIS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Olympic Champion Liu Guoliang
rallied from first set deficit to beat Zoran Primorac of Croatia
19-21, 22-20 and 21-12 in the World Cup table tennis tournament in
Nimes, France on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Penholder Liu, also the world championship silver medallist,
trailed Primorac by a game and 20-14 therefore facing six
consecutive match points.
</P>
<P>
But through powerful smashes and an excellent block defence,
the world number three held his nerve to win eight points in a row
to level at one game all.
</P>
<P>
Primorac, World Cup champion three years ago, missed countless
topspins on both wings as he lost his rhythm against his Chinese
opponent in this group b match.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus, who won the European Masters
title last month, easily swept aside New Zealand's world number
114 Peter Jackson 21-10, 21-13 in just 17 minutes in another
group B game.
</P>
<P>
While in in group a, World number one Kong Linghui of China
defeated France's Patrick Chila 21-18, 16-21 and 21-17.

<P>
ANKARA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto has sent a letter to her Turkish counterpart
Necmettin Erbakan, asking him to be peacemaker in stopping the
current infighting in Afghanistan, according to local newspaper
Daily News today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the letter was given to Erbakan Wednesday
by Anwar Saifullah Khan, the Pakistani petroleum and natural
resources minister, who was in Istanbul as a special envoy for
the Pakistani prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Khan as saying: "I brought a letter from
Prime Minister Bhutto to Prime Minister Erbakan, which requests
Erbakan, as an older brother, to play his role and bring all the
contrary groups together."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish prime minister could use his
influence over both Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as other
countries that are backing many Afghan groups, to stop fighting
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan agreed to play a role; he
agreed to do that because it is a historical role which Turkey
will play," said the Pakistani minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Forty-one rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in the
military operations staged by the Turkish security forces in
southeastern Turkey, according to two statements issued today.
</P>
<P>
One of the statements, issued by the office of the emergency
rule region, said that the security forces had wiped out 11 PKK
militants in two Turkish border towns of Hakkari province, 12 in
Catak town of Van province, seven in Sirnak province, two in
Diyarbakir province. The security forces also captured three PKK
members in this region, it said.
</P>
<P>
But the statement failed to disclose the time when the PKK
rebels were shot dead or captured.
</P>
<P>
Another statement issued by the office of Erzurum province said
 that the Turkish security forces had killed nine PKK militants
in four-day continuous military operations against the PKK
guerrillas in Erzurum province.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year-old guerrilla war for
self-rule, which has claimed the lives of more than 21,000 people
including PKK militants, civilians and government troops in
southeastern Turkey since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> IMF Delegation to Visit Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) will arrive here soon for
discussions on the release of the second tranche of its loans
under the 600 million dollars standby arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said here today that "the delegation is
expected to reach here either on Friday or Saturday" and is likely
to stay here for two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is to hold talks with Pakistan's government officials
and complete its review on the country's economic performances
before presenting it to the IMF executive body in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The executive body will then deliberate on the review, and in
case of a positive conclusion, the release of 80 million dollars
will stand approved "immediately," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the tranche will be made available
immediately as no new agreement is required to be signed.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources admitted that it would take a few days to
complete the transaction.
</P>
<P>
The IMF had refused in March to release the second tranche of
the standby arrangement, signed in October last year to bail out
Pakistan from its economic difficulties, due to its
dissatisfaction with the country's economic performances.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan sent two delegations to Washington for talks with the
IMF after failing to persuade the IMF to send a delegation to
Pakistan to review its economic performances, as required every
three months for the release of the loan.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the IMF put forward tough conditions,
including a huge cut in government expenditures, increases in
taxation and containing budget deficit to four percent of the
gross domestic product, for the release of the loan.
</P>
<P>
The news of the IMF forthcoming visit came after the Pakistani
government announced a rational economic reform package on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Denies Premier's Possible Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has categorically denied rumors about Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin's possible dismissal, presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said today.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky told a briefing in the Kremlin: "Prior to the
briefing, the president specially instructed me to deny such
speculations, categorically."
</P>
<P>
Amid these rumors, former Russian security chief Alexander
Lebed said on Wednesday that Chernomyrdin, who became the Russian
premier in December 1992, would be dismissed probably by the
middle of November.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who was sacked last week as Russian Security Council
secretary, presidential national security adviser and presidential
special envoy in Chechnya, stressed that both he and Chernomyrdin
were victims of Anatoly Chubais, the interior minister and
presidential chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Chubais was behind the dismissals. "He
(Chubais) is the only person who can have access to the
president. He is the person who has created this artificial
isolation of not only me but of other state figures from the
president."
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin would give a radio address
to the nation on Friday to urge all the Russian politicians to
"cool down" after the election race.

<HEADLINE> European Free Air Market Brings Cheaper Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Europe's free air travel
market has delivered cheaper fares, new airlines and a wider
choice of routes, but there is more room for improvement, a study
says.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission (EC) has published a report of its
study of the impact of the third and final stage of
liberalization, from 1993 to 1996, to assess progress so far and
outline future action.
</P>
<P>
The EC Transport Commissioner, Neil Kinnock, said more work
was needed to ensure that the traveling public was better served
at lower cost.
</P>
<P>
The number of air routes had increased, monopolies broken up,
20 new airlines had opened for business and fares had fallen since
1993, when the EC dismantled national barriers to air travel, and
began the final stage of opening Europe's air transport up to
competition.
</P>
<P>
Given the drop in the ticket prices for many scheduled routes
and the fact that the charter market accounted for more than half
the total market, around 90 percent of all passengers now
traveled on cheap fares, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The EC's approach to creating a single market in European air
travel, first launched in 1987, was deliberately phased in three
stages to avoid the market disruption experienced in the United
States "Big Bang" approach to liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The last barrier will fall in Europe in April 1997, after which
any EU airline may fly between two points anywhere in the Union.
</P>
<P>
However, Kinnock pledged to use EU legislation for prizing open
those sectors of the market which still remained closed to open
and free competition.

<HEADLINE> Tomba Misses First First Leg of Alpine Skiing Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- SOLDEN, Austria, Oct 24 (AFP) -
Triple Olympic champion Alberto Tomba will miss the start of the
alpine skiing season -- as usual -- when two giant slaloms are
scheduled in Solden, Austria this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Italian prefers to join the series when it gets underway
properly in December but an injury in training ruled him out
anyway.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old, who has changed his mind about retiring for
the second year running, injured his left knee and right wrist.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 World Cup winner, who has twice won the Olympic grand
slalom gold and a gold in the slalom, said his decision to
continue had been influenced by the fact that Italy will be
hosting the world championships next February at Sestriere.
</P>
<P>
The favourites for Sunday's race will be Michael Von Grunigen,
who won five of nine giant slaloms last season, and fellow Swiss
Urs Kaelin, runner-up to Tomba in last season's world
championships in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Austrian-born Marc Girardelli, the 33-year-old who races for
Luxembourg, starts his 18th year on the World Cup circuit he has
won five times.
</P>
<P>
Also in the starting lineup is Norwegian Lasse Kjus and
Austria's Mario Reiter.
</P>
<P>
Kjus, the 1993 world champion and 1994 Olympic champion, was
runner-up to Girardelli when he won his third World Championship
combined title in February.
</P>
<P>
Reiter, nicknamed the 'ice eater', won the Sestriere slalom and
Furnao giant slalom last season.
</P>
<P>
Tomba may be absent but his compatriot Deborah Compagnoni, the
world and Olympic champion, will start her year-long campaign for
the overall title against German stars Katja Seizinger, the World
Cup holder, and Martina Ertl.
</P>
<P>
Seizinger, Olympic downhill champion, also won the super-giant
World Cup last season.
</P>
<P>
Austria's Anita Wachter, whose win here in 1993 led to her
overall World Cup triumph, is looking up again at 29.
</P>
<P>
Wachter, took a year to recover from the death of her best
friend Uli Meier who broke her neck in a fall at Garmisch in 1995,
has recovered from an operation after tearing ligaments in her
left knee in training in February.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Offshore Oil Output to Reach 14 Million Tons This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China's offshore oil and gas
wells are expected to produce a record 14 million tons of crude
oil and three billion cubic meters of natural gas this year,
marking a major breakthrough for the nation's 14-year-old offshore
oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Production already reached 10 million tons, a record high, by
September this year, according to the China National Offshore Oil
Corp (CNOOC).
</P>
<P>
Chinese vice-premier Zou Jiahua today told a national
conference commending model workers of the offshore oil sector,
that China's offshore oil sector has typically boosted the
national industry with high speed and good efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The booming offshore oil sector has greatly benefited from
large-scale Sino-overseas cooperation, and CNOOC's own efforts,
the vice-premier added.
</P>
<P>
According to CNOOC president Wang Yan, China has so far
verified offshore oil and gas geological reserves of 1.25 billion
tons and 240 billion cu m, respectively, with 17 oil fields and
two gas fields operational offshore.
</P>
<P>
Through four rounds of international bidding and numerous
negotiations, CNOOC has signed 119 oil and gas contracts with 65
overseas oil companies from 18 countries and regions, absorbing a
total overseas investment of 5.24 billion US dollars, or 58
percent of China's total for the offshore oil sector.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC president disclosed that China will build another 10
oil and gas fields offshore in the coming five years, including
eight run by CNOOC itself.
</P>
<P>
The senior official added that between 2000 and 2010, the
average annual oil and gas output to be generated by the existing
offshore oil and gas fields will be stabilized at 12 million tons,
and 15 billion to 20 billion cu m, respectively.

<P>
NEW DELHI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian former prime minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao was re-summoned by a Delhi court today to
personally appear before the special court at Vigyan Bhawan
(international meeting center) in New Delhi on November 6 for his
involvement in a cheating case of 100,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Delhi court had summoned him to appear in person
in Tis Hazari court premises on September 30.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi police and the Special Protection Group (SPG)
responsible for the security of the prime minister and former
prime ministers made a petition to the Supreme Court for a change
in the trial venue as Tis Hazari court complex was not considered
to be a safe place.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court, therefore, directed the Delhi High Court to
select a new place for the trial of Rao within the New Delhi
security zone.
</P>
<P>
Rao, who is also an accused in the St. Kitts forgery case, has
been exempted from personal appearance in this case scheduled to
come up for hearing at the new venue on October 30.
</P>
<P>
The stage has been set for the trial of Rao, who is facing
charges of cheating and forgery. He will be the first former
prime minister in India's history to be hauled up before a court
on charges of this nature.

<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang
Chunyun said here today that China is able to rely on itself to
feed its 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
Meeting participants in Beijing at a Sino-US seminar on
agricultural science and technology, Jiang said China has scored
remarkable developments in agriculture since the founding of the
People's Republic in 1949, particularly since the implementation
of reforms and opening policy in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that China's agricultural economy is growing in an
all-round way, and the farmer's living standards have been greatly
improved.
</P>
<P>
He said China, during the ninth Five-year-plan period
(1996-2000), wishes to secure steady output increases in grain,
cotton, oil-crops and other essential agricultural produce, while
ensuring a faster increase in farmers' income. China will also
provide enough food for the 65 million people who are still living
below the poverty line, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier noted that China will always take agriculture
as a top priority of the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China will deepen rural reform, rely on
science and technology to boost agriculture, strive for a
sustained development, and strengthen international exchanges and
cooperation in agricultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Jiang welcomed agriculture experts from foreign countries,
especially those of Chinese origin, to conduct more academic
research and exchanges in China.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier congratulated the convening of the seminar,
which has attracted 31 American and Canadian agriculture experts
of Chinese origin.
</P>
<P>
He said the suggestions made by the experts will benefit
China's agricultural growth.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Kuchma Agree on Black Sea Fleet Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his visiting Ukrainian counterpart, Leonid Kuchma, reached an
agreement here today "concerning all questions related to the
problem of the Black Sea Fleet."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said the two
presidents also agreed that in the first half of November, Russian
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would visit Kiev to sign a
package of agreements associated with the fleet's division, and
relevant financial issues.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were reached at the Barvikha sanatorium outside
Moscow, where Yeltsin is preparing for heart surgery in November.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Yeltsin was planning to sign the
long-anticipated "big" treaty on friendship and cooperation
between Russia and Ukraine. It would be done during a visit to
Kiev, as soon as he recovered from the operation.
</P>
<P>
The visit would be Yeltsin's first trip abroad after the
planned operation. It would become possible only after the
comprehensive treaty was completely prepared for signing and all
questions relating to the problem of the fleet were resolved.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma arrived in Moscow earlier this morning and left the
Vnukovo-2 airport directly for the sanatorium to meet Yeltsin. He
was expected to meet with Chernomyrdin later today.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian president told reporters at the airport that
Russia and Ukraine were "as close as ever to signing a big
political treaty."
</P>
<P>
He was accompanied by his Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko and
Deputy Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Igor
Podolev.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Association
of China (UNA-China) supports the World Federation of the UNA's
(WFUNA) proposition for settling the UN's current financial
crisis, its President Xie Qimei said today.
</P>
<P>
Xie was speaking in Beijing at a function marking United
Nations Day.
</P>
<P>
UNA-China is a member of WFUNA, which is the world's only
non-governmental organization dedicated entirely to supporting the
UN.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Xie also called on the governments of all
UN member states, particularly the US government, to fulfill their
membership obligations under the UN Charter, by promptly and fully
paying their membership dues and peace keeping assessments.
</P>
<P>
All member states should take part with a practical attitude in
negotiations on financial reform, conducted by the UN General
Assembly, and reach an early agreement on a reform program to lift
the UN out of the present crisis, Xie proposed.
</P>
<P>
Although the UN is faced with many difficulties at the moment,
it's founding was a wise choice by mankind after drawing painful
historical lessons, Xie stressed, adding that UN membership had
increased from 51 to 185.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, UNA-China had been given the "Peace
Messenger Award" by the UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
in 1988, in recognition of its contribution to peace. It has also
been active domestically in initiating mass activities in support
of UN endeavors for peace and development, noted Xie.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of holding the function today was to
propagate the spirit of the UN Charter, to give the 1.2 billion
Chinese people a better understanding of the UN.
</P>
<P>
In the future, UNA-China is ready to strengthen and increase
cooperation with concerned organizations, by increasing publicity
on the UN, and make greater efforts to promote the cause of peace
and development, Xie said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned National Railway
Company of France (SNCF) suffered a loss of 7.5 billion francs
(1.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the first six months this year, the
SNCF management said today.
</P>
<P>
The company was also expecting a net loss of 12.5 billion
francs (2.5 billion dollars) for the whole of 1996, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
The SNCF sales figures for the first half of 1996 amounted to
27.475 billion francs (5.5 billion dollars), a 0.7 percent drop
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The SNCF, after years of losing money, might have to adopt an
austerity plan to keep running.
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of the SNCF employees joined the national
strike on October 17 to protest the austerity plans of Prime
Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
The unions of state-owned companies are opposed to Juppe's 1997
budget which will cut the government deficit to less than three
percent of the nation's gross domestic product, a prerequisite for
joining the European Monetary Union in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The latest government belt-tightening measures include plans
for the privatization of the Thomson SA electronics group, the
Compagnie Generale Maritime shipping company, and the Air Liberte
company.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Hold International Conference on Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait will hold an
international conference on November 18-20 on the impacts of the
Gulf War in 1991 on the environment in the Gulf region and other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
A fax transmitted to Xinhua today by the Kuwait Institute for
Scientific Research (KISR), which is one of the conference
organizers, said that the meeting, the first of its kind in
Kuwait, aims to "provide an opportunity for experts from the Gulf
and other parts of the world to exchange current information on
the regional and global implications of the Gulf War."
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Gulf region, the U.S., Britain, Japan and
other countries are expected to take part in the meeting, which
will be organized by the KISR, some other Kuwaiti research
institutes and petroleum establishments and the Gulf Cooperation
Council General Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf War triggered off by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
1990 led to the attack on Iraq by U.S.-led allied forces. The war
resulted in one of the worst environmental catastrophes in the
history of mankind. About 6 to 8 million barrels of crude oil was
released into the marine environment.
</P>
<P>
Around 800 oil wells in Kuwait remained burning for several
months after the end of the war, emitting huge quantities of
pollutants to the atmosphere. And 60 million barrels of crude oil
gushed from the burning wells created oil lakes over a vast area
of the desert land.
</P>
<P>
The damage to the desert environment has also resulted from
trenching and movement of heavy military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, several national and international environmental
agencies have participated in the monitoring of pollution caused
by the war. Experts and scientists have also attempted to assess
the global and regional impacts and predict future problems.

Wu Lianyuan, deputy head of the Organizational Department of
the CPC Central Committee, said at the meeting that the party
officials have been showing an increasing zeal in studying the
law, following repeated calls by Jiang and other top party
officials.
</P>
<P>
"But we must clearly realize that because of the influence of
the feudalist ideology, rooted for thousands of years, and
old-fashioned traditional concepts, especially the chaotic
situation and flagrant violations of law and order in the period
of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), a considerable number of
our cadres have a weak understanding on the concept of the rule of
law," Wu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Quite a few comrades are not used to, or not good at seeking
legal methods to deal with their work, so that illegal activities
of replacing the law with personal arbitration, blocking
law-enforcement with personal power, in addition to illegal policy
making, and illegal judgements, are frequently found," he said.
</P>
<P>
in certain cases, "the legitimate rights of the people are
violated, major economic losses were suffered by the state and
collectives, and the image of the party is harmed, and relations
between the party and the people are adversely affected," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
"Intensifying education for the officials on the knowledge of
the law is by no means a hollow slogan," he stressed.

Committee of the CPC Central Committee, was editor-in-chief of the

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Introduce Business Visa Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
announced here today that his country will implement a new type of
business visa next year for member economies of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the Philippines will introduce APEC business visa in
1997 "with multiple-entry privilege, valid for five years, which
is meant exclusively for bona fide business people". He added that
the visa shall be offered on "a reciprocal basis" to all APEC
economies.
</P>
<P>
The president made the above remarks when accepting a report
presented by the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) which
called on the APEC leaders to promote freer business travel in the
Asia Pacific region among other recommendations.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Ramos also accepted the ABAC proposal to set
up special business immigration lanes at major Philippine ports
of entry to reduce border restrictions.
</P>
<P>
He said the creation of the business visa and special
immigration lanes in major ports will facilitate travel to the
Philippines by business executives from other APEC members.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier before that Australia raised the idea
of creating a visa-free smartcard that ensures free move for
accredited businessmen in the APEC region, but some APEC members
opposed the proposal.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today reaffirmed his objection to any constitutional amendment to
lift his term limit or extend his six-year term.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a media group here this morning, Ramos said that he has
nothing to do with the reported moves for "a people's initiative"
in provinces, including his home province of Pangasinan, to amend
the constitution to extend the term of the president and other
elected officials.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine constitution, Ramos cannot seek a second
term and will have to retire in June 1998 when his term ends.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that he is looking forward to retirement and a role
as "an elder statesman."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that "under our democratic system" he could
not stop people from initiating moves to amend the charter.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that even if he were to go on the radio and
television for a whole day to assert his opposition to any
constitutional amendment, "people will always do their thing."
</P>
<P>
A campaign for constitutional amendments is underway in the
country while opposition forces are accusing Ramos of
masterminding the drive.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Immediate Implementation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today urged all parties in the Arab-Israeli peace talks to
implement "completely and immediately" the agreements reached so
as to push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
"The agreements reached must be implemented fully and without
delay," said the visiting French president in his address to
Jordan's parliament here today.
</P>
<P>
He also called for more negotiations between the Arabs and
Israelis and expressed his support for an independent Palestinian
 state.
</P>
<P>
"There must be negotiations, and still more negotiations,
until all the problems related to the final status are settled,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who is on his seven-day official visit to the Middle
East region to salvage the stalled peace process, gave a vivid
description of "a reconciled Middle East" in his address.
</P>
<P>
"A reconciled Middle East, with the co-existence of a
peaceful and prosperous Palestinian state, an Israel accepted by
all and freed of the threat of terrorism, a Hashemite Jordan, an
example of democracy and development, a Syria in full control of
all its territory and at peace with its former enemy, a Lebanon
completely free, sovereign, dynamic, and a strong and wise Egypt,
a pioneer of peace," the president told Jordanian lawmakers both
in the Upper House and the Lower House of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of peace in the region, saying
that "if there is no peace, there will be no security."
</P>
<P>
He also voiced his confidence that it is possible to save and
win peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"I remain convinced that our march towards peace is
irreversible," he said, adding that "despite the tragedies, the
obstacles placed on our path, the efforts of the extremists, I
believe it is possible to save the peace. I think it is possible
to win the peace."
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who is on his mission to promote a French and
European effective role in the peace process, said his country
will not suggest to the parties "the clauses of a treaty,"
adding that France will give advice on the principles on which a
lasting peace should be based.
</P>
<P>
The principles, he said, are "the exchange of land for peace,
the exercise by all countries of the region of their sovereignty
over the whole of their territory, security for all... (and) the
free determination by the Palestinians of their own future, in
other words the foundation of a state."
</P>
<P>
On Iraq, Chirac expressed his country's concern over Iraqi
humanitarian situation, and pressed the international community
to implement U.N. Resolution 986, which provides for the
resumption of Iraqi oil exports against the purchase of food and
medicine in order to save the Iraqi people from tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Franco-Jordanian relations, he described the
ties between the two countries as "strong and trustful," noting
that his country will continue press for the association of
Jordan with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries can work for peace "side by
side."
</P>
<P>
"Through our dialogue and joint efforts, peace can move
forward, because Jordan is a central actor in the stability of
the region," he said before the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The French president arrived here late Wednesday and will
leave for the Lebanese capital of Beirut after concluding his
two-day official visit to the kingdom later today.

CANBERRA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
surged to a new high in the expectation of an interest rate cut
today.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index surged 30.9 points, or 1.32 percent,
to 2377.6, the highest close in history.
</P>
<P>
The local bourse set consecutive records earlier this month. It
broke through the crucial resistance level of 2300 points in the
beginning of October and reached an all-time-high of 2363.3 points
on October 14.
</P>
<P>
Weak wage increase, coupled with benign inflation figures,
heightened hopes of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates will make investment in equities more
attractive, because it will reduce companies' borrowing cost and
boost consumer demand. Lower interest rates will also make
investment in stocks more profitable in terms of relative yield.
</P>
<P>
A bullish New York Stock Exchange and takeover activities in
local industries also added impetus to the bourse.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index soared 52.6 points, or 1.46 percent,
to 3663.5.

The all resources index rose 13.7 points to 1395.4.

CANBERRA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar weakened
against major currencies today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 79.23 US cents from 79.54 US
cents on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was pulled down by an increasing
possibility of an interest rate cut before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today that
the full-time adult average weekly ordinary time earnings
increased by 0.7 percent in the three months to August, making an
annual rate of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figure fell into the lower end of market expectations,
which centered around an increase of one percent. The wage
increase figure was viewed as a leading indicator of inflation.
</P>
<P>
ABS figures released yesterday also showed that inflation rate
fell to 2.4 percent annually from 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello hailed
the figures as good news for the economy and called for the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to cut interest rates.

The Australian dollar softened in the expectation that the
interest rate differential between Australia and other western
countries was likely to shrink.

<HEADLINE> European Parliament President's Meeting with Dalai Accused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China today made a stern
protest against and expressed its strong dissatisfaction about a
meeting between the Dalai Lama and presidents of European
Parliament and Commission of European Union.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang outlined
details of the formal protest this afternoon at a press conference
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Shen said Tibet is an inalienable part of Chinese territory,
and Tibetan affairs are purely China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"No foreign government, parliament, organization or individual
person has any right to intervene," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Shen, Dalai, who decks himself out as a religious
person, has been engaged in political activities outside China for
a long time, in an aim to separate the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of the European Union Commission and European
Parliament were bent on meeting Dalai, disregarding
representations and firm opposition by the Chinese side many
times, he said, adding that the European Parliament even offered a
forum for Dalai to openly support and instigate Dalai's separatist
activities. Their acts, he noted, have interfered with China's
internal affairs, and seriously hurt the feelings of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China has expressed strong dissatisfaction, and
lodged a stern protest to the European side.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, relations between China and Europe
could only be established on the basis of mutual respect and
non-interference with each other's affairs. Any act in the other
direction will bring damage to the healthy development of
bilateral relations, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China requests that European Union institutions and their
leaders earnestly abide by its stand of "acknowledging Tibet as a
part of China's territory", and set the general interests of
Sino-European relations above everything else, not instigating,
and supporting the Dalai group in their separatist activities,
Shen said.

<HEADLINE> Immigrants Healthier, More Law-Abiding Than </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Statistics have shown that
immigrants in Australia are generally healthier and less likely to
appear in courts and jails than the wider Australian community,
Immigration Affairs Minister Philip Ruddock said today.
</P>
<P>
"Immigrants as a class are healthier than Australians and less
represented in our hospitals and other health costs because they
are subjected to a health check before they come to Australia,"
Ruddock said in a program on ABC Radio.
</P>
<P>
He also dispelled theories that immigrants were responsible for
a higher crime rate.
</P>
<P>
The minister's remarks were clearly in response to the
Australians Against Further Immigration campaign that started
early this month, which put blames on immigrants for pollution,
traffic jams, unemployment, crime, the hospitals crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said that a "properly balanced" immigration program,
which the government was putting in place, meant immigrants would
have a higher employment rate than the Australian population as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
"If the program is balanced, if you have got relatively large
numbers of people coming to Australia with skills and capital,
they help Australia grow and create new job opportunities for
other Australians," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, it helps unemployment, rather than hinders it.
And in that sense it's beneficial. You need to be very careful in
the way to structure the immigration program if it's going to have
a positive impact on unemployment in Australia," he said.

and fined 116,000 U.S. dollars for bribery here today.
</P>

U.S. dollars each to the pair in bribes in return for their
support.

reasons for cooperation and no reasons for confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Chi made the remarks at a meeting with general Arturo
T. Enrile, chief of staff of the armed forces of the Philippines,
in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
"China and the Philippines have one thousand and ten thousand
reasons to strengthen exchange and cooperation and have not a
single reason to trigger off confrontation," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and
State Councillor, said China and the Philippines are good
neighbors. To maintain and develop the momentum of the bilateral
friendly relations, including the exchanges between the two
armies, benefits not only the two peoples but also peace,
stability and development in the region, the minister said.
</P>

China and the Philippines have the similar history in the past
and common interest at present, and face the same task of building
up their respective countries, Chi added.

development, Chi said China would not practise expansion or power
politics even after it becomes much stronger economically.
</P>
<P>
"China has stationed not even one soldier overseas and China's
national defense policy is entirely defensive. In any sense, the
so-called 'China Threat' is just totally groundless," Chi stressed.

Enrile said he was honored to meet minister Chi and believed
his China trip would have positive role in reinforcing the
friendship between the two armies and pushing ahead the bilateral
relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Experts Meet on HK Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) today started their 20th expert meeting on
defense and public security in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chinese JLG representative Chen Zuo'er told a press briefing
that the major subject of the meeting was the discussion of the
advance party of the HK garrison troops of the People's Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that the Chinese side has, at the experts
level, unofficially informed the British side of the drafting of
the Garrison Law.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the task of the advance party is to make various
preparations for the PLA garrison troops to smoothly take over
Hong Kong's defense on July 1, 1997, instead of assuming the
defense responsibility in advance. The British side will remain
responsible for Hong Kong's defense until June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the advance party is an important part of the
smooth transfer of Hong Kong's defense. As there are only more
than 200 days before the transfer, it is necessary for the two
sides to make concerted efforts to speed up the pace of work.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions, Chen pointed out that issues
concerning the Garrison Law will not be discussed at the JLG
expert meetings, because the formulation of the law is purely
China's domestic affair.
</P>
<P>
He said that the formulation of the Garrison Law will lead to a
comprehensive legal system of the garrison troops in HK which
fully reflects the principle of "one country, two systems", so as
to ensure that PLA garrison troops will carry out their defense
responsibility according to the law.
</P>
<P>
He said that as provisions of the Garrison Law belong to the
national defense and related affairs administered by the Central
People's Government, it is the right of the Central Government to
draft the law.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, considering that the law will be implemented
in the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), and
some of its provisions will have direct or indirect relations with
the SAR government and local residents, the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress will, while deliberating the law,
listen to the opinions and suggestions from Hong Kong in
appropriate forms.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, many good ideas from Hong Kong people have been
considered or adopted during the studying and drafting of the
Garrison Law," he added.

<HEADLINE> Bank Reports: Nigeria's budget deficit Surpasses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria
Wednesday reported a fiscal deficit of about 82 million
U.S.Dollars in the first half of the 1996 national budget, about
seven weeks after a surplus of 100 million Dollars was declared
for the same period by the Finance minister.
</P>
<P>
The deficit, representing about 0.4 percent of the Gross
Domestic Product, was attributed largely to the outlay on debt
servicing which is above the amount budgeted for, and the
shortfall in the projected revenue from the autonomous foreign
exchange market (AFEM) surplus, the Central Bank report said.
</P>
<P>
In its ''Economic Report For The First Half Of 1996'', the
Central Bank said the difference between the figure of the
Central Bank and that of the federal Finance Ministry is
accounted largely for:
</P>
<P>
''While the ministry recorded 22 billion Naira (275 million
Dollars) and six billion Naira (75 million Dollars) for external
and domestic debt service payments respectively, actual payments
in the central bank indicated 26.804 billion Naira (335 million
Dollars) and 120 billion Naira (1.5 billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
''Secondly, the statutory share of the federal government from
AFEM intervention surplus held with the Central Bank was 26.783
billion Naira (335 million Dollars) as against 31 billion Naira
(388 million Dollars) reported by the ministry.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank report said, the outstanding
public debt of the federal government at the end of June this
year fell by 0.6 percent to 1.1 billion naira (13.75 million
dollars), representing a debt ratio of 62.1 percent compared with
78.4 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
''The domestic debt components fell by 6.6 billion (82.5
million Dollars) or 1.6 percent at 402.9 billion Naira (5.04
billion Dollars) at the end of june 1996, while the external debt
outstanding declined marginally to 31.9 billion Dollars from 32.5
billion as at December 1995,'' the Central Bank said.
</P>
<P>
according to the central bank, the total actual external debt
service payments during the first half of this year anounted to
1.2 billion dollars, representing 23.07 percent of the projected
annual debt service payment.
</P>
<P>
The main goals of the government's fiscal policy in 1996 are
to strengthen the fiscal position of the federal government and
stimulate private sector activities through aggressive revenue
drive, public sector expenditure restructuring and tax
incentives.
</P>
<P>
The budget aimed at achieving a surplus of 19 billion Naira
(238 million Dollars) or 1.15 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) at current market prices, as against the 6.8
billion Naira (85 million Dollars) or 0.5 percent of last year's
GDP.

MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 25 rebels have been
killed in the hinterlands of Basilan province in the southern
Philippines as government troops entered the fourth day of
operations against armed men who attacked a military detachment in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Antonio Santos who was supervising the operations in
the province, was quoted by the Philippine News Agency as saying
today that the heavily armed rebels were members of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).

<P>
He said that more than 25 rebels had been killed with their
leader wounded. Although the military did not report any
casualties, a dozen soldiers have reportedly been airlifted to
nearby cities from the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the MILF launched the attack in order to
get a chip in the coming peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been opposing the peace agreement signed between
the government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). With
many disgruntled MNLF members having defected to it, the MILF has

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Top Italian high jumper Antonella
Bevilacqua will quit athletics because of a longstanding doping
controversy.
</P>
<P>
Bevilacqua, fourth in the Atlanta Olympics, twice tested
positive for the stimulant ephedrine during May and June, but was
cleared by the Italian Athletics Federation (FIDAL).
</P>
<P>
FIDAL accepted she took the susbtance, which was contained in a
herbal medicine, without knowing. However, her case is still in
arbitration with the International Amateur Athletic Federation.
</P>
<P>
"She's given up, and she's got my full support," said her
mother and coach Maria Sigillino. "Her name is now forever
associated with doping and it's had a devastating effect on her.
</P>
<P>
"She's exhausted. Being linked with drugs is something really
serious, it's a mark which is going to stay with her forever. So
it's better if she gives up athletics and everybody forgets about
her."
</P>
<P>
Bevilacqua's sister Marcella said: "She hasn't trained since
coming back from America. She's just devoted herself to her
studies and has already taken three exams at the Academy of Fine
Arts."
</P>
<P>
However, Italian sports officials have not given up hope on
Bevilacqua, whose case was recently switched by the IAAF's
arbitration panel from October 26 to November 25.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Bans Insurance Broker from Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Insurance brokers in China's
largest city have been given a caning - for flooding Shanghai's
middle and primary schools with insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
School children and students have virtually been forced into
signing up for policies because of the hard-sell actions of the
brokers.
</P>
<P>
Now city officials are to hand out a tough lesson by ordering
the closing of school doors to all of the enthusiastic insurance
brokers, under a newly-issued official circular.
</P>
<P>
"People are permitted to buy insurance policies on a voluntary
basis, but the activities of some insurance companies in schools
goes seriously against the rules, which in turn has smeared the
reputation of the business," says the People's Bank of China's
Shanghai Branch. It has warned all the insurance companies in the
circular.
</P>
<P>
The circular said that insurance brokers in schools seriously
interfered with the students' normal lives, and imposed pressure
on students because buying insurance policies has become a 'must'
in some schools, instead of a voluntary act.
</P>
<P>
All the insurance companies have been banned from handing out
any insurance leaflets, survey forms, and policies in schools in
the circular, which also ordered the companies to immediately
withdraw policies and refund students when required.
</P>
<P>
Brokers who have breached the rules will receive an offical
warning and be fined 10,000 yuan. Their business activities will
also be suspended for three months.

<HEADLINE> Health Meeting Points to Total Tobacco Ads. Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Speakers at an international
conference opened here today called on a total ban on tobacco
advertising so as to bring the Western Pacific to a
tobacco-advertising-free region.
</P>
<P>
The two-day 1996 conference on smoking and health gives a clear
signal that the participants are striving for materializing the
goal by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
"At the heart of the WHO Western Pacific Region Action Plan on
Tobacco or Health 1995-99 to fight against tobacco use is a call
for a 'Tobacco-advertising-free Region by the Year 2000," said
S.T. Han, Regional Director of the World Health Organization
(WHO) Regional Office for the Western Pacific, at the opening
ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first of its kind here, is organized by the
Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health with the support from the
WHO Regional Office.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we have to protect our populations, especially
our young people, from the influence of advertising and the
effects of direct and indirect advertising through sponsorship of
sport and cultural events," Han added.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the decreasing of smoking population in Hong Kong over
the last 13 years, from 23.3 percent in 1982 to 14.8 percent in
1995, there is a rising trend of smoking among young people and
women," said Katherine Fok, Hong Kong's Secretary for Health and
Welfare.
</P>
<P>
"Although the percentage of teenaged smokers is low, the trend
is nonetheless worrying," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco control is an area where there is no rooms for
complacency and the government takes the problem of smoking,
especially among youth, very seriously," she added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Continue Peace Effort in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has not abandoned
its peace efforts in Afghanistan, which focused on a ceasefire
among the warring factions, a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, the spokesman said that
Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar, who visited
Afghanistan six times recently, had brought the Taliban and the
three-party alliance led by Rashid Dostum closer.
</P>
<P>
"But the ousted Afghan government troops led by Ahmad Shah
Masood demanded the inclusion of "demilitarization of Kabul" as
part of the ceasefire agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That condition is a new thing with which the Taliban have not
come to grips as they have not yet thought about it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, the spokesman said the condition of
demilitarization of Kabul has held up the proposed ceasefire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said, "it could be unrealistic at this point of time but we
are not shutting our mind on any issue as it is possible we may
come at a stage where demilitarization is defined in such a manner
when both sides find it acceptable."
</P>
<P>
Replying to another question, the spokesman said that the U.N.
special envoy to Afghanistan Nobert Holl is currently meeting
Taliban leaders in Kandahar, the Taliban headquarters in southern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We are now waiting for the outcome of Holl's talks with
Taliban leadership," he added.

<HEADLINE> Macao Aims to Be Regional Center of World Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Macao is making efforts to become
a regional center of world trade, a top Macao government official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Vitor Rodrigues Pessoa, secretary for economy and coordination
of the Macao government, said at a seminar that it has been the
objective of the government to make Macao a platform for
international trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The government has been working hard to enhance Macao's role
as an international trading post in the region, and make Macao a
platform for world entrepreneurs to exercise their strategy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said the government has been making efforts in
many aspects, including the introduction of an open liberal
economy and the improvement of the investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The Macao government has adopted the policy to allow free flow
of capital and goods, levy lower taxes and tariffs and fix the
exchange rate between the local currency pataca and the Hong Kong
dollar.
</P>
<P>
In addition, transportation and telecommunications facilities
in Macao have been updated.
</P>
<P>
The Macao International Airport, which was inaugurated last
November, has brought about a rise of local tourism and relevant
industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications facility in Macao has become one of the most
advanced in the world. International direct dialing telephone
service is now available to 219 countries and regions around the
world, and the number of Internet users has been growing fast in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Macao is also training personnel to meet the demand in such
fields as law, engineering, enterprise management, trade and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Macao's role of a trading post is based on
such favorable conditions as its vicinity to China's Guangdong
Province and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The role of a trading center is closely related to China's
open policy," he said. "China has a huge consumption market and is
also an important producer. Macao can function as a bridge between
China and the rest of the world in trade, finance and labor."

<P>
TIANJIN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin has decided to close
down 89 rural plants that cause heavy pollution. Their business
licenses will be revoked by the city's industrial and commercial
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The plants share a common feature of severe pollution and low
economic efficiency, according to the municipal environmental
protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the 89 plants were responsible for 25 percent
of the total water contamination caused by the city's 10,000-plus
rural enterprises, while their output value accounts for only 0.2
percent of the total rural industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has demanded that departments
concerned strictly implement a State Council decision on
environmental protection to prevent and control water
contamination along the Haihe river, by striving to reach the
target for total amounts of waste discharged into the river and
its tributaries.
</P>
<P>
It has also demanded district and county authorities to revoke
the business licenses of heavily polluting enterprises, stop
energy and water supplies to them, and dismantle the equipment and
seal up raw materials in the plants.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is carrying out a trans-century green program, which
involves 28 projects in prevention and control of industrial
pollution, and protection of natural ecological systems and
regional environment. The program is estimated to cost about 10
billion yuan.

HANGZHOU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- As more farmers find work in
non-agricultural sectors in east China's Zhejiang Province, the
provincial government has come up with a series of measures to
increase construction of small cities or towns.
</P>
<P>
It has also set up a group in charge of comprehensive reforms
in small towns, and has household registration reforms in six
townships. Economically developed towns account for a third of the
province's total output value, and small towns are bringing
greater prosperity to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has encouraged local governments,
collective firms, and individuals to invest in developing towns.
</P>
<P>
Wukang Township, in Deqing County, used to be a small
village. In the early 1990s, it became the county seat and
developed a series of policies to encourage departments or
individuals to invest in Wukang's development. After five years, a
new township was erected on barren hills, and the government's
input in the new township was not more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new hi-tech and private industry zone in Wukang has not
only reduced industrial smoke that caused pollution, but has also
saved large tracts of farmland.
</P>
<P>
With the favorable policies, small towns have mushroomed in
Zhejiang. Statistics show that there are now 965 cities and towns
in the province, six times more than the figure for 1978.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
arrived here today for an official visit to the Kingdom amid high
hopes of an effective French role in the Middle East peace
process and stronger relations with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who arrived in Amman from the West Bank town of
Ramallah as part of his one-week regional tour, will confer with
King Hussein of Jordan in a one-to-one meeting.
</P>
<P>
The French president, who has visited Syria, Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule territories, will address Jordan's
80-member Parliament Thursday before leaving for Lebanon. He was
also scheduled to visit Egypt.
</P>
<P>
His tour to the region is seen as a move to seek a new and
political role in the Middle East peace process for the European
Union (EU) countries, especially France.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel, especially under the leadership of the new
right-wing government, has resisted attempts to strengthen the
Europeans' hand in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis have publicly expressed dissatisfaction over
recent political initiatives by Paris and other EU capitals.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had not only welcomed but had also urged for an
increased French and European role in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We think Europe should get involved in the region," said
Jordan's Ambassador to France Sharif Fawwaz Sharaf.
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason whatsoever for (any country) to try to
deprive Europe from having a role," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the French president's two-day visit, an 80 million
French francs (about 16 million U.S. dollars) financial protocol
will be signed between France and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Total French assistance to Jordan this year is estimated at
400 million francs (about 80 million dollars) in addition to the
French aid through the EU which is estimated at 130 million
francs (about 26 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chirac will leave Amman for Lebanon Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Caspian Sea States to Divide Seabed Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Five deputy foreign ministers
from Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan
gathered here today in a bid to iron out their differences on how
to divide the seabed resources of the oil-rich Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamadov, Iranian Deputy
Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi and their counterparts from three
other neighboring countries participated a two-day meeting of the
Caspian Sea littoral countries on legal regime of the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The five deputy foreign ministers will prepare a joint
statement, which will be signed and announced in the foreign
ministerial meeting in Ashkhabad, Turkmenistan, in November.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea, the largest land-locked lake in the world, is
rich in oil and gas resources. It has an estimated 75 trillion
cubic meters of gas and 150 billion barrels of oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the rich resources, the five littoral states
want to launch development projects.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a press
conference held here today that there are three ideas of dividing
the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Russia supports the idea of giving a 20-mile continental
shelf to the sharing countries.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan maintains to divide the seabed among the five
littoral states.
</P>
<P>
There is a call for extending the continental shelf to 40
miles instead of 20 miles and sharing the rest among the littoral
states.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said in the opening address that it is imperative for
the littoral states to work together to draw up appropriate legal
regime for setting the scopes and limits of the sovereignty of
states for rich resources.
</P>
<P>
"I am of the firm conviction that given the political
determination that the littoral states have so far demonstrated,
problems of the Caspian Sea and its legal regime will be
resolved," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft copy of the joint statement to be signed
by the foreign ministers, the five littoral states will conclude
a convention on the basis of the agreement by all the Caspian
states on the legal status of the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The convention will incorporate fundamental principles of
regulations of issues of navigation, the use of biological and
mineral resources, environmental protection as well as
sovereignty rights.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Welcomes Chirac's Visit to Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz today expressed his welcome to the current visit by French
President Jacques Chirac to the Middle East, saying that the visit
demonstrated France's "new dynamism" in handling problems in the
region.
</P>
<P>
During his ongoing tour of the region, Chirac has visited
Syria, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas. He will also
visit Lebanon and Egypt before winding up his tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in his office, Boueiz said that
Chirac's visit to the region demonstrated France's new dynamism in
handling problems and crisis in the Middle East and in
clarifying France's position on establishing peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that France's position on calling for peace gave it a
"bigger size" after absenting from the Middle East arena in the
past years.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Europe and France should play a role in the
region with which they have common history and old relations,"
the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 Madrid peace conference which brought for the
peace process, France has been demanding an effective European
role, the Lebanese foreign minister said. "Today, we do welcome
this role," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on what happened to the French president in the Old
City of East Jerusalem Tuesday, the Lebanese minister noted that
different views had come up since Chirac started his visit in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In what was called by Chirac a "provocation," Israeli security
men jostled the French president and manhandled journalists as he
was touring East Jerusalem, and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu apologized afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"It was clear yesterday (Tuesday) that the Israeli authorities
were attempting to prevent President Chirac from contacting, or
at least shaking hands with the Palestinian people who were
welcoming him," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Israel had refused to allow a visit by
Chirac and his Foreign Minister Herve de Charette to Orient
House, the PLO headquarters in East Jerusalem, "since it regards
the visit as a recognition of the Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
Describing Chirac's position as "brave," Boueiz underlined
that the position "expressed France's openness and feelings
toward the friendly peoples in the world and rights of the
ill-treated and oppressed peoples."
</P>
<P>
During his Middle East tour, the second of its kind in six
months, the French president repeatedly said that Europe
should have a role in the peacemaking in the region, and that
there could be no security in the region without full peace.

<P>
AMMAN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein and
French President Jacques Chirac called here today for a complete
and immediate implementation of the signed agreements among all
the parties concerned in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state made the appeal during their talks at
the Royal Palace here shortly after Chirac arrived in Amman
from the West Bank town of Ramallah for his first official visit
to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed bilateral relations and the Middle
East peace process in all aspects, especially means of salvaging
the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Hussein lauded French efforts and vital role in the peace
process, saying that France is dedicated to achieving a just,
comprehensive and durable peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch also praised France for its "courageous
initiatives and just, principled stances regarding world events
and the various issues affecting the peoples in the region."
</P>
<P>
People in the region "look for an active and supportive
European role," he told Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The king expressed appreciation of the help and support France
has extended to Jordan in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
"We are particularly grateful for France's firm and unwavering
 support throughout all the hardships Jordan and the region
endured through decades of conflict," said King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The king reiterated Jordan's commitment to a comprehensive
peace based on international legitimacy and relevant
U.N. resolutions. He called for international collective efforts
to achieve peace and reap its benefits.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-French talks started with closed-door
discussions between the Jordanian king and the French president,
which were followed by an enlarged meeting attended by senior
officials from both sides.

SEOUL, October 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Foreign Minister
Gong Ro-myung left here today for Paris to sign an agreement on
South Korea's entry into the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
This came at a time after the OECD Council officially invited
South Korea to join the club of advanced countries on October 11.
Seoul applied for membership in March last year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister will sign the accord with OECD
Secretary-General Donald Johnston. He will also speak on South
Korea's plan for cooperation with the existing 28 OECD members.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government plans to submit a bill on OECD
entry to the National Assembly for ratification next month.
</P>
<P>
The ruling New Korea Party (NKP) has expressed support of the
country's accession to the OECD, while the opposition parties
voiced the concern that the free flow of capital and other market
opening measures will seriously disturb South Korea's domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will become the 29th OECD member when it deposits
an admission document with the French government after its
parliament ratification before December 25.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long visit to Europe, Gong will also visit
Luxembourg to sign a framework cooperation agreement and a joint
political declaration between South Korea and the European Union
(EU) with his EU counterparts and Leon Brittan, vice president of
the EU commission, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The two documents will lay the legal groundwork for a
comprehensive partnership between South Korea and the EU, a
Foreign Ministry official said here.

Following the signing of the two documents, Gong and EU foreign
ministers will hold the 12th Korea-EU ministerial meeting which

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said here today that the peace process in the Middle East
was still "suspended" in spite of so much "side activities aimed
at keeping the hope and making the cooked food remaining on fire."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on an optimism expressed by Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu on the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, Boueiz said
that the statement was only aimed at cheating the public media.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, who is currently touring the
region, delivered a message Tuesday to Netanyahu from Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister described the message as "positive,"
but declined to disclose its details.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that what was stated by Netanyahu was not a move for
gaining time, nor another action for propaganda which Netanyahu
has accustomed us in the past months," the Lebanese foreign
minister told a press conference in his office.
</P>
<P>
He repeated a call for the resumption of the peace
negotiations between the Jewish state on the one side and Syria
and Lebanon on the other without returning to the zero point.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that there is really a fundamental progress and that
Israel is seriously and essentially ready for the negotiations
and for a returning to what had been reached in the era of
(former Israeli prime ministers) Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres,"
the Lebanese minister said.
</P>
<P>
But there was no serious signs which "allow us to say that
Israel has a new positive style for returning to the peace
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
After taking office in June, the hardline Israeli prime
minister called for a resumption of peace talks with Syria
without any precondition.
</P>
<P>
Damascus asked Tel Aviv to make a commitment to a withdrawal
from the Golan Heights before the deadlocked peace process is
re-started.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state suspended the negotiations with Syria in
March following a series of suicide bombings in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Warns Against Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid has said Israel could not possibly be
incorporated into the regional economic bloc before freeing the
Middle East from its nuclear threat.
</P>
<P>
Israel's nuclear arsenal, which is not under international
supervision, constitutes a threat to Arab security, disrupts
regional balance and threatens stability and peace in the region,
Meguid said in a lecture at the Nasser's Military Academy here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There were many reports on Israel's nuclear arsenal. But Israel
has neither admitted nor denied the possession of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid noted that Israel has secured many gains from the
peace process since 1992. "The number of states recognizing
Israel has risen to 165 from 85," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's exports have doubled while foreign investment
multiplied six-fold hitting 2 billion U.S. dollars annually, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's GNP grows by about 6 percent and the number of
tourists soared from 2.5 million in 1992 to 7.6 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, Abdul-Meguid said Israel's belligerent policies have
bred a spate of economic difficulties, citing the 14 percent
inflation rate, the mounting deficit in balance of payments,
increasingly unbalanced foreign trade and the government's
free-hand expenditure.
</P>
<P>
"The recent Israeli policies would only make it harvest the
fire of a renewed Palestinian intifada (uprising)," Meguid warned.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Security Services Warn of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
security services are working together to try to foil an attempt
by Islamic Jihad to carry out a suicide bombing attack, Israel
Radio reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
As of midnight, Israel clamped a closure on the entire West
Bank and Gaza Strip and put its security forces on special alert
amid warnings that the Islamic Jihad would stage the attack at
the end of October to mark the first anniversary of the
assassination of its late leader, Faithi Shkaki.
</P>
<P>
Shkaki was shot and killed last October in Malta. Islamic
Jihad members accused the Israeli Mossad secret service of
carring out the assassination. But the Mossad neither denied nor
claimed the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Syria-based Islamic Jihad leader Ramadan Shallah has recently
declared that he wanted to damage the peace process, and avenge
the death of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai ordered the closure
following special consultations with Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, chief
of general staff of the Israeli army, and top security officials.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that the open-ended closure is expected to
last until at least after Saturday, October 26. Shkaki was
assassinated on the same date last year in Malta.
</P>
<P>
During the indefinite closure, all Palestinians are barred
from entering Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian VIPs, 270 medical personnel working in
east Jerusalem and rare humanitarian cases will be permitted in,
provided they have the approval of the Israeli government's
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yigal Pressier, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's
adviser on combating terrorism, has urged the public to be
particularly alert this week and report anything suspicious.
</P>
<P>
A senior security source told Israel Radio that security has
been beefed up throughout the country with police setting up
roadblocks to thwart any attack.
</P>
<P>
"We know that late October is the date they are intending to
attack," the source said, "all the security services are taking
measures to foil this, including speaking with the Palestinian
Authority (PA)."
</P>
<P>
He added that the PA is cooperating with the Israelis and is
carrying out arrests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel Television Channel 1 said Wednesday night that the
Palestinian police had detained 15 Islamic Jihad activists in
the Palestinian autonomous areas, who were reportedly planning
attacks against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police sources said that security measures, which
included roadblocks on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway Wednesday
morning that snarled traffic for hours, will remain in effect at
least during the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector-General Assaf Hefetz issued a statement
calling on commuters to understand the nation's security needs
and the public to look out for suspicious objects and persons.

</P>
<P>
The Spring Bud Plan, which was started by the China Children's
Foundation in 1992, provides free primary-school education and
room and board for extremely poor girls from rural areas.

<P>
To put the plan into work, the women's federation in the
province's Pingyang County made an effort to collect 600,000 yuan
last year to pay for the girls' books, school meals, and housing.
</P>
<P>
The federation also called on people from all walks of life to
sign a one-on-one commitment with the girls to provide support for
their education.

Many people not only offer financial help to the girls, but
also treat the girls as if they were their own children.

FUZHOU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The temple of a Chinese prime
minister of about 1,000 years ago, known for having produced 10
million descendants, has been restored in Shaowu city, in Fujian
province.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qiao held office during the Five Dynasties (907-979) and

Historical documents record that, on his 82nd birthday, he sent
21 sons away, telling them to develop their own lives, marking a
break from the tradition of people living with their family
members nearby.

A thousand years passed, and Huang's offspring could be found
living in many southeastern coastal areas of China, in Taiwan, and
in Southeast Asia, and numbered about 10 million. Taiwan alone
boasted 1.25 million of them.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 of his descendants have come to Shaowu to
visit their ancestral home in the past few years, and have donated
more than one million yuan to restore the temple that commemorates
him.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qiao's tomb has been recognized by the city as a
historical marker since 1986.

15 people in Britain and France.
</P>
<P>

experiencing.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time, a link has been established between the
mad cow disease, or BSE, and the new variant of the

far. The scientific magazine Nature today published the results of
a study by a British team led by Professor John Collinge, which
has found the same bio-chemical signature in the brains of the
people who died of Creutzfeldt-Jokob and those of the animals
infected by the virus of BSE.
</P>
<P>
-- The British Airways, allied with the Bollore-Rivaud group of
France, will renew the French air company Air Liberte by injecting

<P>
BANGKOK, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's political parties
contesting the November 17 general election are spending heavily
to ensure their candidates' election and advertise themselves as
the most suitable to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers predict that more than 20 billion baht (800 million
U.S. dollars) will be spent in the run-up to the polls, on "buying
up" former members of parliament, vote-buying and all sorts of
public relations campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The figure was higher than the about 17 billion baht (680
million dollars) spent in the July 2 general election last year.
</P>
<P>
Political canvassing will also bring windfalls to television,
radio, newspaper and printing firms which produce or carry
advertisements and posters.
</P>
<P>
The New Aspiration Party and the Chart Pattana (Thai
Development) Party, which are contesting in the northeast, are
vying with each other for voter support by spending large sums of
money to project themselves as the national rather than regional
leader.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat Party, on the other hand, focuses on its perceived
strength of honesty and professionalism.

HANOI, October 24 (Xinhua) - The Hanoi post office has set a

<HEADLINE> GDP of Three Central Asian Nations Picks Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan is picking up this
year for the first time since the collapse of former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that the GDP of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Uzbekistan increased by 0.1 percent, 0.3 percent and 1.4 percent
respectively for the first half year of 1996, compared with the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output of the three Asian Nations increased by
0.2 percent, 13.2 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, the Asian
Economy and Life Weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural output of the three countries continued to
decline this year, with a margin of 14.5 percent, 12.6 percent and
2.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
But the grain production of the three nations increased, with
kazakhstan totaling 13.1 million tons, 2.5 million tons more than
last year, Kyrgyzstan becoming one of the few countries which do
not need importing grain among the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
In foreign trade, Kazakhstan's import and export volume
increased markedly, with export increasing by 56 percent and
import 21 percent. Uzbekistan's export increased by 4.8 percent
and import 19 percent. Kyrgyzstan's export declined by 15.8
percent and import increased by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the former Soviet Union, close economic
links between the member states of CIS have been destroyed.
Consequently, their economies plunged into crisis. Between 1991
and 1995, GDP of the CIS member states declined continuously, with
the average rate of 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sino-German Team Probes Mystery of Terra-cotta Warriors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-German team has
discovered a purple chemical compound in the paint of the
terra-cotta warriors and horses in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Scholars say that the find will help in preserving the
terra-cotta figures that served as guards in the afterlife of Qin
Shi Huang Di, who united China and set up the Qin Dynasty (221-206
BC).
</P>
<P>
The joint archaeological team also discovered that the wood
used in the shelter over the figures was fir, dragon spruce,
Chinese hemlock, and elm, and that chalk accounted for the bulk of
the clay used in the pit where the figures were put.
</P>
<P>
That is a clue for further study of the warriors, scholars
noted, without giving any details about what that meant.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists have also co-operated in conservation work
with rare relics found in Famen Temple in the province, where
Sakyamuni's bones were enshrined in the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and
some 1,000 pieces of relics were found in an imperial tomb of the
Northern Zhou Dynasty (557-581).

<HEADLINE> APEC Leaders Urged to Endorse Network for Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Business executives from the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) today called on the APEC
leaders to endorse a proposal to establish a network for small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) by September next year.
</P>
<P>
In a 56-page report presented to Philippine President Fidel
Ramos, the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) also called on
the APEC leaders to help address the financing needs of SMEs,
which account for some 90 percent of employment in the Asia
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The report said the APEC leaders should hold initial roundtable
discussions in their respective economies by bringing together all
relevant government agencies, banks, venture capital and credit
facilities for this endeavor.
</P>
<P>
ABAC Chairman Roberto Romulo, former Philippine foreign affairs
secretary and now chair of the Philippine long distance telephone
corporation, said the proposed APEC network for SMEs will serve as
a "network of networks in each economy" to pursue action programs
in areas needed by the SMEs.
</P>
<P>
He added that the network would pursue an initial action
program that focuses on four key areas, namely human resources
development, access to technology and information, access to
credit and capital, and access to market opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Comfortable Housing For Chinese Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Construction work has begun on
a 13.5-million-yuan teachers' village in Puding, a poor county in
southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the cash-strapped province has given priority
to eduction and helped more than 13,000 teachers move into new
apartments, and the 2.3-hectares village is meant to solve the
housing problem for 300 teachers in the mountainous region.
</P>
<P>
A dozen cities are now building teachers villages for education
improvements in the Puding way.
</P>
<P>
Before 1990, housing shortages were a common phenomenon in
Guizhou, with teachers' living space in the province 20 percent
less than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
In Kaili City, capital of the Qiandongnan Autonomous Prefecture
of Miao and Dong ethnic groups, the living space for teachers
stayed at three square meters for a long time, ranking last in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the city has built two villages for teachers in the
urban district, solving the housing problem for 147 of them. By
1998, per capita living space of the teachers' families will reach
10 square meters, provincial government officials say.
</P>
<P>
Most of the new villages in the province are located in lovely
settings and are close to stores, hospitals, and sports and
recreation facilities. Some have telephones and closed circuit
television.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province set up a housing foundation with 10
million yuan (about 1.2 million US dollars), and gave preferential
treatment to reduce construction costs for teacher villages.
</P>
<P>
The province has also lent support to teachers in rural areas
in building new houses so that they will feel more comfortable in
teaching.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma arrived here this morning for "a working meeting" with his
Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin on the Black Sea Fleet division
issues.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure from Kiev, Kuchma told reporters that he
was flying to Moscow this morning for a working visit designed to
support Yeltsin ahead of his forthcoming heart surgery and discuss
bilateral relations between Russia and Ukraine, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
However, a source close to the Kremlin said that the two
presidents will mainly discuss the Black Sea Fleet division and
the status of Ukraine's Sevastopol, base of the former Soviet
fleet.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet issue has been a major obstacle in the
development of the two former Soviet republics' relations.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Kuchma would begin his talks with Yeltsin
in the Barvikha sanatorium near Moscow immediately after his
arrival. The Ukrainian leader is also expected to meet with
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin later today.

<HEADLINE> Book-Hungry Peasants Satisfied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A lorry pulled up in a remote
Chinese village in central China's Hunan Province, ready to
offload its supplies to eagerly awaiting peasants.
</P>
<P>
Soon the vehicle's supplies had all be snapped up - and some
people had to go away empty handed.
</P>
<P>
But this was no food-aid program, the lorry had brought a load
of books to villagers in Loudi Prefecture hungry for knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of books were sold soon after they were unloaded from
the vehicle, and one peasant even handed over his last four yuan
to an official, earnestly wanting to buy a book on
poultry-breeding.
</P>
<P>
This was a scene in Shatang Village, Shuangfeng County, Loudi
Prefecture, where local people did not have easy access to books.
</P>
<P>
The official was moved by the peasants' craving for books. The
prefectural government conducted a survey of 1,200 rural
households. It showed that some 93 percent of households were
eager to buy books.
</P>
<P>
A campaign to send books to peasants' homes was then launched
in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
To date, the prefectural government has provided a direct
service for over 800,000 people, which includes selling books,
offering economic information, and setting up libraries and
cinemas.
</P>
<P>
The prefectural government has also organized various training
causes to help peasants learn applied science and technology, as
well as related laws.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Financial Market Opens Wider to Outside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is leading China in its
213 representative offices of overseas financial organizations, with
seven foreign banks setting up branches in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, when the city introduced the first commercial
overseas financial organization, the Mitsubishi Bank of Tokyo, Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Citibank, Hong Kong Nanyang
Commercial Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan, Korea Exchange Bank,
and First National Bank of Chicago, have all opened branches in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The branch banks had 1.07 billion US dollars in assets by
August this year, 2.8 times the 1995 figure, and 260 million US
dollars in balances held on deposit, 2.3 times the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
The branches mainly provide services, covering foreign exchange
deposits, credits and remittances, loans guarantees, and
settlement of import and export accounts, to local overseas-funded
enterprises, foreigners, overseas Chinese people and compatriots
in Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The branches also conduct services of settlement and sale of
exchange for local overseas-funded enterprises, becoming the
country's designated foreign exchange banks.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding loans of the branches rose 240 percent over 1995 to
reach 380 million US dollars in October this year, 340 million US
dollars were granted to local overseas-funded enterprises, and
accounts for 30 percent of total loans granted to local
overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of presentative offices of overseas financial
organizations in Beijing has given impetus to the inflow of
overseas funds to the city, improving the local financial reforms
by enlivening its financial market.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to take steps to introduce more commercial
overseas financial organizations, to increase varieties of
services, to form a local diversified financial market, led by
Bank of China and enriched with overseas-funded sectors.

<HEADLINE> Demise of Foreign Fast Food in East Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Four fast food restaurants
from outside China in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province
closed their doors in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, an American fast food restaurant in the
downtown area of the tourist city, which specialized in fried
fish, went under, and two months before that, another American
fast food restaurant was replaced by a Chinese one specializing in
soy-bean milk.
</P>
<P>
Two others are advertising for someone to buy them out.
</P>
<P>
"It might be because of the prices or taste," said Chen Weimin,
a Chinese partner in the fried fish restaurant. "In a word,
foreign fast food finds it hard to get in with the common people."
</P>
<P>
Chen is planning on opening a hot pot restaurant on the site of
the dried fish restaurant.
</P>
<P>
The failing restaurants usually operated for about three
years. In the first half year after opening, they seemed quite
promising and many people would come in to see the well-decorated
restaurants out of curiosity. But soon the novelty wore off.
</P>
<P>
"We've found no way to keep the old customers," one owner said
gloomily.
</P>
<P>
While all this is taking place, some Chinese-style fast food
stalls are booming: "In the past, we did not pay much attention to
comfort, or the environment, or standardized service," a manager
of a Chinese fast food restaurant said. "It is the foreign fast
food restaurants who taught us all this."
</P>
<P>
Having taught their Chinese counterparts about advanced
management techniques, the foreign fast food people were finally
forced out of the market one after the other because of
unacceptable prices or taste, Wang Lida, member of the Drinks and
Food Association of Hangzhou, commented.

<P>
HANOI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Work-related accidents in Vietnam
are on the rise with 94 incidents causing 120 deaths in the first
six months this year, latest issue of Vietnam Investment Review
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the review, the death toll of work-related
accidents during this period increased almost three times over the
same period in 1995 with only 34 deaths recorded.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Nguyen An Luong, Vice President of the
Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGCL) as saying that the
real figure of death toll was in fact much higher than the
recorded one since 20 provinces did not report the labor accidents.
</P>
<P>
Luong said most of the accidents reported were from state-run
enterprises especially those related to high-rise construction,
high voltage power lines and coal mines.
</P>
<P>
According to Luong, the main cause for fatal accidents was the
violation of working regulations. Moreover, the safety and health
standards in working places have got little improvement although
labor code has been implemented for one year.

<HEADLINE> Kuchma, Yeltsin to Meet Over Black Sea Fleet Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma arrived here this morning to meet his Russian counterpart,
Boris Yeltsin, for the long-disputed Black Sea Fleet issue,
Yeltsin's press officers said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, agreed by the two leaders over a phone talk on
Monday, is scheduled to be held at 12:00 local time (GMT 08:00) in
the Barvikha sanatorium near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet, a major former Soviet fleet, is based on
the Ukrainian Peninsula of Crimea. Russia and Ukraine both claimed
it after the former Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine have reached a tentative agreement on
dividing the fleet, but there have been disputes over the status
of Sevastopol, the headquarters of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma expressed the hope that the agreement would be confirmed
during the upcoming meeting with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The problem will be resolved soon, Kuchma told visiting Russian
Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov in Kiev on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, an informed Kremlin source said on Wednesday that the
Russian leadership did not share optimism with the Ukrainian side.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the scheduled meeting, the state Duma, Russia's
lower house of parliament, adopted a resolution claiming that the
fleet was Russia's property and banning the disputed division of
the fleet.
</P>
<P>
The source also said that the Russian leadership is going to
continue the talks on the division and base of the fleet.

<HEADLINE> China to Use "BOT" to Build Water Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China will use a development
method known as "build, operate and transfer" (BOT) to introduce
foreign investment in its water supply projects.
</P>
<P>
Under the BOT method, projects are built by foreign private
capital and then transferred to China after several years of
operation.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed it is a good way to build infrastructure in
China, where because of its rapid unbanization, about 300 major
cities are facing shortages of basic necessities such as water.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the topic on a seminar co-sponsored by the
Ministry of Water Resources and the Asian Development Bank, which
ended Wednesday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government favors the BOT method for water-related
infrastructure in urban areas because it can help lighten the
financial burdens of construction, Zhang Chunyuan, vice-minister
of water resources was quoted in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said construction of vital water projects has been
restricted by a lack of adequate State investment.
</P>
<P>
However, BOT can be complicated, since it involves a wide range
of legislative, financial and technological issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the major issues, experts noted, is decentralizing the
approval of such projects from central to local government.
</P>
<P>
They said China could work out regulations governing
decision-making authority by expanding existing rules governing
BOT projects. These include the construction of highways and small
hydrological power stations.
</P>
<P>
The central government has started drafting special regulations
on the use of BOT, an official with the State Planning Commission
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Council, China's highest governing body,
has decentralized the right of approving projects with foreign
investment down to the level of provincial government,
substantially enlarging provincial authority to approve
projects.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources is also considering
constructing a number of water supply projects with suitable
conditions through BOT as pilot projects fro extension later.

<HEADLINE> Fertilizer Production Encouraged in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
approved programs to develop the country's fertilizer industry.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Fertilizer Manufacture's Association (VFMA) said,
Vietnamese farmers can use about three million tons of fertilizer
each year and the demand is still increasing, especially in the
Mekong River Delta.
</P>
<P>
According to the VFMA, Vietnam produced 110,000 tons of urea in
1995, only meeting eight percent of the total demand.
</P>
<P>
Each year, Vietnam spends 250-300 million U.S. dollars on
importing fertilizers from China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Because of the country's dependence on fertilizer imports,
world price fluctuations can adversely impact on both farmers and
importers.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the Vietnamese government has endeavored
to encourage domestic fertilizer production, focusing on
microbiological fertilizer used to enrich soil and minimize
environmental pollution.

BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Delegations from 14 cities and
counties along the newly opened Beijing-Kowloon (Jingjiu) Railway
thronged to the Beijing West Railway Station yesterday looking for
business opportunities, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the underground hall of the station, 700 exhibitors
presented their products, mineral and tourism resources at the

</P>
<P>
They solicited investments and conducted business exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The belt, listed by the central government as a priority region
in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), covers seven provinces
and 29 regions and cities, including some of the country's poorest
areas.
</P>
<P>
These areas, with abundant natural resources and a glorious
history in the revolutionary struggle before the founding of the
People's Republic, were once plagued by the lack of convenient
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The week-long event is sponsored by the Jingjiu Investment
Promotion System (JIPS) under the State Council's Development

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Taxes Incur Strong Reaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Everybody calls them the
"mini-budget," except the opposition which describe them as the
"maxi-budget." And both names are right in a sense.
</P>
<P>
The new taxation measures introduced by the Pakistani
government on Tuesday are a "mini-budget" because they are a
revision of the state budget and they are a "maxi-budget" because
of the heavier taxes to be involved.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the name, the new taxes, to raise badly-needed money
to meet revenue requirements in the state budget for the fiscal
year of July 1996-June 1997, have provoked strong reaction in the
country.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time within one fiscal year that the
Pakistani government has announced tough new measures to increase
taxation and revenue.
</P>
<P>
When the government first announced a 40 billion-rupee (1
billion U.S. dollars) increase in taxation, public reaction was
quick and strong.
</P>
<P>
Various organizations, some of them with the backing of the
opposition, held numerous strikes after the announcement of the
new budget on June 13.
</P>
<P>
The government bowed down, giving concessions of 15 billion
rupees (375 million dollars) to different industrial and
commercial groups.
</P>
<P>
The government, again on Tuesday, announced a tough 40
billion-rupee economic reform package.
</P>
<P>
According to the new package, the government is still in need
of 13 billion rupees (300 million dollars) for its revenue after a
27 billion-rupees (700 million dollars) cut in government
expenditure, most of which in development expenditure.
</P>
<P>
And the money will have to come from new taxes.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural taxes, which the federal and provincial
governments agreed to introduce under the pressure of the
International Monetary Fund, contribute a mere 2 billion rupees
(50 million dollars), according to the new measures.
</P>
<P>
Yet in 1995-96, agriculture-related transactions were worth 600
billion rupees (15 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector, which provides most of the support
needed by the government to stay in power, is capable of
generating around 100 billion rupees if taxed properly and fairly,
according to local experts.
</P>
<P>
Other new measures include an increase in the income tax,
import service charge, foreign travel tax, airport tax and
passport fee.
</P>
<P>
Last but not least is a 10-percent rise in petroleum prices and
gas charge.
</P>
<P>
Along with the new taxation, the Pakistani rupee was devalued,
for the 10th time after the announcement of the new budget in
June, by 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the package, "designed to tackle short- and
medium-term problems in the national economic policies," Governor
of the State Bank of Pakistan Mohammad Yaqub said it would help
improve the health of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
It will not affect the poor, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The statement is partly true in that that the poor can never
afford to travel abroad or take a flight and thus will not have to
pay the travel tax, airport tax or passport fee.
</P>
<P>
But they can not live without gas, buses, food and many other
essential daily items which have to be imported.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, with a 10-percent jump in petroleum and
gas charge, the trade circles forecast a sharp surge in the prices
of essential commodities within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Polypropylene already set the trend as its prices shot up by
three rupees per kilogram in the wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
Another three rupees are expected to be added to the prices of
plastic raw materials in the next four to five days when new
shipments arrive.
</P>
<P>
The local cotton, rice and yarn markets Tuesday reacted
strongly to the devaluation of the rupee and their prices
escalated instantly.
</P>
<P>
Yarn prices rose by 15 to 20 rupees per bundle and those of
rice by 15 rupees per 100 kilograms while cotton price moved up by
28 rupees per maund at the Karachi Cotton Exchange.
</P>
<P>
"The mini-budget and massive rupee devaluation by the People
government on Tuesday are set to have adverse effect on common
men's kitchen budget," said Chairman of the Pakistan Commodity
Traders Association Rais Ashraf Tar Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
The landed cost of all imports would go up 8.52 percent
immediately whereas the impact of higher petroleum and gas prices
would also push the prices up in a similar ratio when the
commodities reach the consumers.
</P>
<P>
"The essential and semi-essential commodities will not only
become dearer but a shortage resulting from suspension of imports
will further spiral the prices," he warned.
</P>
<P>
With about 21 billion rupees (525 million dollars) or one-fifth
cut in development expenditure, which is the investment for the
future, the development projects are doomed to a serious setback.
The long-term effect could not be felt until five or 10 years
later.
</P>
<P>
However, bureaucrats can continue to enjoy a comfortable life
with endless facilities available to them free of charge as only 6
billion rupees (150 million dollars) will be eliminated from the
current government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
According to a local report, more than 670 million rupees (17
million dollars) is being spent this year on advisers and special
assistants of the chief minister of Punjab province alone.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance reacted quickly by calling for a
country-wide strike on Saturday to protest against the
government's measures. And more strikes could be expected.
</P>
<P>
This, of course, would not help the country out of the present
economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Kenya liberalizes Coffee, Tea Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government
yesterday announced major reforms in the coffee and tea sectors,
the "Daily Nation" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Minister for Agriculture, Livestock
Development and Marketing Simeon Nyachae as saying that the
government's involvement in the two sectors would be reduced.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Kenyan government would withdraw
from the Coffee Board of Kenya (CBK) which would become purely a
farmers' organization while only three government accounting
officers remain in the Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA).
</P>
<P>
He said growers of coffee and tea were given powers to elect
directors who in turn would choose a chairman and a chief
executive. Previously, the law empowered the Minister for
Agriculture to appoint a chairman from among the directors and a
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform plan, coffee planters and commercial millers
will be free to engage in coffee trade and export at the Central
Auction which remains the only mode of selling coffee in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae noted that the participation of planters and
commercial millers in the coffee trade at the Central Auction
would increase competition and boost efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He said that the KTDA and the CBK will also be restructured by
being exempted from the State Corporations Acts to enable them
take timely and commercially competitive decisions. With the
liberalization of the two sectors, the minister noted, the
government may only intervene in the coffee and tea industry to
make policy guidelines.

NANNING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region is tapping its beautiful scenery in a bid
to turn tourism into a pillar of the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is famous for beautiful natural scenes, a rich variety
of unique folk cultures, and home to a number of ethnic minority
groups, with sunny beaches in the city of Beihai at the southern
tip of the region.
</P>
<P>
The region has boosted the construction of new scenic and

</P>
<P>
Guangxi has also accelerated the development of new tourism
markets, especially overseas-backed projects. It has adopted the
strategy of consolidating the traditional markets in Hong Kong and
Macao, and expanding those in southeast Asia, Europe, and the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
Special marketing groups have been sent to international
tourism exhibitions and fairs in Milan, Paris, Hong Kong and
Australia. And the regional tourism authorities have sponsored
special promotion programs, such as the Guilin Tourism Festival.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the region is co-operating with neighboring
provinces and regions, such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Tibet and Sichuan,
in the initiation of 20 travel routes featuring southwest China's
ethnic cultures and customs.
</P>
<P>
The region has also increased supervision of the service
quality of the tourism business, by formulation and implementation
of regulations on hotel and travel services.
</P>
<P>
There are 108 hotels permitted to receive overseas travelers,
164 travel agencies in the region. More than 30,000 local
residents are employed in the tourism business.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 17 years, the region has received more than 6.3
million overseas travelers, and about 90 million domestic
tourists, and earned 994 million US dollars in foreign exchange
and 10 billion yuan from tourism.

<HEADLINE> Radiation Processing Industry Takes Shape in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Radiation processing technology
in China has developed from laboratory research into
industrialization, according to a conference in Lanzhou, capital
of northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The technique is conducted by exposing objects to gamma rays
emitted by radioactive isotopes, or electronic beams produced by
electronic accelerators.
</P>
<P>
The technique is widely used in seed breeding, petrochemicals,
medical sterilization, food storage and waste treatment.
</P>
<P>
The research of isotope and radiation technology in China
started in the 1950s. At present, China has 120 gamma ray
radiation facilities, and 46 electronic radiation accelerators.
</P>
<P>
The technique produced nearly one billion yuan worth of output
value in 1995, doubling that of 1993. Experts estimated the output
value produced by the technology in China in 2000 will be four
billion yuan.

</P>
<P>
Li Huajie, a peasant-turned-entrepreneur, set aside two million

One of these, to provide support for school dropouts in
poverty-stricken regions, benefited when one local enterprise
alone provided a large number of items, with a total value
reaching 4.5 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Another conspicuous event has been the new Shangyu Wanfeng
Professional Secondary School, the first privately-funded
secondary school in the city, which owes its existence to Gao Hua

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) today announced the approval of 37.5 million
U.S. dollars in loan and equity to finance a shipping company in
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The company to be financed is the holding company of Magsaysay
Lines Inc. of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines mainly rely on shipping services for trade with
the outside world markets. Expansion of the fleet will lower
shipping and trade costs and enhance competitiveness. The
financing will help the Philippines' major inter-island shipping
company to expand its fleet in the international and regional
markets and reduce the age of the existing fleet.
</P>
<P>
IFC's financing includes a loan for its own account and a loan
to be syndicated with international commercial banks. In addition,
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group and the largest multilateral
source of equity and loan financing for private sectors in
developing countries, will provide a convertible loan and make an
equity investment in the company.
</P>
<P>
This is IFC's first shipping investment in the Philippines and
the first to be linked with privately funded and operated training
facilities for seamen.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Accepts Proposals of APEC Business Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today accepted recommendations from business leaders of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) designed to jump-start the
implementation of the free trade and investment goals for the Asia
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"With these comprehensive recommendations, APEC is ready to
move from policy to action," Ramos declared when accepting a
report containing the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "APEC Means Business: Building Prosperity
of Our Community," represents the first ever active participation
of the APEC business sector in designing and developing economic,
trade and investment policies for APEC leaders.
</P>
<P>
It was presented to Ramos by the APEC Business Advisory Council
(ABAC), a group of 53 business executives representing all the 18
APEC member economies. It will be discussed when ABAC holds its
first ever dialogue with APEC leaders in Manila on November 24.
</P>
<P>
"This report constitutes a full response to our goal of fully
integrating the business community into the design and
implementation of APEC's current and future work," Ramos added.
</P>
<P>
In the report, ABAC recommended that the APEC leaders promote
freer business travel in the Asia Pacific region by introducing an
"APEC business visa," provide enhanced investment protection to
encourage lower investment financing costs and increase the
private sector's role in the planning, financing and delivery of
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
it also called for strengthening small and medium-sized
enterprises through the establishment of technology exchange
networks and the creation of an enhanced partnership between
public and private sectors through economic and technical
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed support for these ideas and announced that the
Philippines will immediately implement some of the
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government will introduce next year a new
business visa to facilitate travel to the Philippines by business
executives from other APEC members.
</P>
<P>
The president also ordered concerned government departments to
plan a Philippine public-private sector infrastructure roundtable
and the establishment of an APEC network for economic and
technical cooperation.

HOHHOT, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Inner Mongolia Autonomous

ADDIS ABABA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Africans should remain
united if they want to be seriously heard on the issue of
biosafety, Ethiopian Agriculture Minister Teketel Forssido said
yesterday at an on-going workshop on the draft protocol on
biosafety here.
</P>
<P>
Teketel said biosafety is not an issue peculiar to Africa, but
it is a problem of all the nations in the south.
</P>
<P>
He called for the countries in the south to get together with
each other to find consensus on the issue of biosafety, adding
that the powerful countries usually may not be comfortable when
the countries in the south function together as a southern block.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Africa is a continent where infant
mortality, illiteracy, war, hunger and diseases are among the
highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said: ''There can be no economic development without a
commensurate technological development as its base.''
"Biotechnology is now being seen as the growth industry of the
21st century. we do not want to be left behind once again,''he
added.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Agriculture to Slump Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Grain production in Bulgaria is
expected to drop drastically next year as only half of the
country's planned acreage was planted this fall.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Minister of Agriculture and Food Industry Krastiu
Trendafilov said only 850,000 ha of farmland are planted this
fall, compared with the target of 1.6 million ha.
</P>
<P>
The minister told a national meeting on agriculture that
livestock production was also affected this year by poor harvests
of grain in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The average output of farm produce in Bulgaria in 1995 is one
third of 1992.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, whose agriculture was capable of feeding as much as
three times the population of the country, now has to import grain
to feed its people.
</P>
<P>
Only 15 of the country's 63 pig-raising incorporated
enterprises are operating and the others are being liquidated,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria produced 20,000 tons of less pork in 1996 than the
previous year, and the output of egg and dairy products also
dropped, the agriculture minister said.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the failure of agriculture to the
deconcentration of farmland, and destruction of agricultural
infrastructure and the losses of overseas market share for farm
produce.
</P>
<P>
Farmland across the country was divided up to the farmers as
the co-operatives were dissolved by the Union of Democratic Forces
of Bulgaria after it took office in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Much farmland has been deserted in recent years as little
progress has been made in land reform and substantial agricultural
facilities were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Some members of co-operatives attending the meeting called for
cooperative management of agriculture. They argue that is the only
way to save the country's agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Major Railway Line to Help Ease Poverty in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China's 898-km-long Railway,
from Nanning, in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to
Kunming, in southwestern Yunnan Province, has brought new hope to
people living in a 36,000-sq-km area which is known for its
poverty.
</P>
<P>
As the finishing touches are put on the railway, provinces in
the southwest are working on a number of related projects to
alleviate poverty. The Chinese government has a major aluminum
project, an optical fibre cable along the railway, a series of
hydro-electric power stations with a 2.52-million-kilowatt
capacity, and a coal and phosphorus project set to begin soon.
</P>
<P>
The railway is renowned for the geological difficulties it
faced, the heavy workload, the high cost, and the new technology
used, because it goes through mountainous areas with a 1,900-meter
change in elevation.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi provinces have China's richest
bauxite resources, half of China's phosphorus, a third of its
lead, zinc, and manganese, and a fifth of its iron reserves. Their
coal reserves are the combined total of all provinces south of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is determined to build several major
railways no matter what the cost, in these provinces, because it
believes these major communication arteries can help bring in more
capital to develop rich natural resources and eradicate poverty by
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The Railway from Nanning to Kunming is expected to help
overcome poverty in the areas alongside it, said Wang Shengye,
deputy head of the Qianxi (southwest Guizhou Province) Prefecture
of Bouyei and Miao Ethnic Minorities. He notes that the greatest
difference between the railway and other poverty relief projects,
is that the project will not only help local farmers but will
provide financial support for counties in the locality.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plans to use the railway for several
power and mineral development zones, such the Hongshui River
Hydropower and Mineral Development Zone in Yunnan Province, and
the mineral production exploitation zones in Panzhihua and Xichang
in Sichuan Province, and Liupanshui in Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The railway can also turn the poverty-stricken area into bases
of industries involving coal, iron and steel, aluminum, gold,
building materials, coal chemicals, and phosphorus chemicals.

prevailed to complement investment attraction efforts of the 12
SADC member states.

ZHUHAI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Port construction,
heavy-industry, and enterprise reforms have given Zhuhai, one of
China's five special economic zones, rapid economic growth at the
beginning of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, according to
statistics, the zone, a coastal city in Guangdong Province, had
industrial output value of 18.6 billion yuan (about 2.3 billion US
dollars), up 20 percent from last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
To improve investment, Zhuhai has made a special effort in
harbor construction, building two 20,000-ton berths.
</P>
<P>
Following Hong Kong and Singapore investors, some oil giants
such as Mobil and Shell have built large oil facilities and
wharves, and experts predicted that in three to five years, the
city will become Southeast Asia's largest store and transfer
center for oil, natural gas, and chemical products.
</P>
<P>
An industrial development zone at Zhuhai's port for heavy
industry has become a favorite overseas investment venue,
attracting Sino-US investment of 300 million US dollars in PTA
projects to the 400-square-kilometer zone.
</P>
<P>
In the recent Guangdong provincial foreign economic and trade
fair, Zhuhai attracted up to 1.8 billion US dollars in foreign
investment, a third of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are underway on heavy industrial projects in
petrochemicals, construction materials, and shipbuilding.

HARBIN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Daqing Oilfield has
improved its environmental protection by removing 820 pollutants
and building 132 waste water disposal plants in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has an
annual crude production capacity of some 50 million tons. Daqing
spent 444 million yuan (55.5 million U.S. dollars) from 1990 to
1995 tackling pollution problems caused by the oilfield and

LHASA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Lhasa, the capital city of the
Tibet Autonomous Region, has produced a record 150 million kg of
grain and edible oil this year, an increase of 7.2 percent from

The official attributes the good harvest to the close attention
the local government and farmers pay to improving production,

HARARE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Renewed negotiations between
the Zimbabwean government and civil servants who suspended a
nationwide strike in September, ended in a deadlock on
Wednesday amid threats by the workers to resume industrial action
again.
</P>
<P>
A nine-member government negotiating team led by Public
Service Commission Secretary Lovemore Masoka failed to reach an
agreement with the striking workers after nearly 10 hours of
talks with nine members of the unified civil service negotiating
committee.
</P>
<P>
Six of the seven outstanding issues from the two-week
crippling strike have not been addressed by the government and
this might force the civil servants, who reluctantly agreed to
suspend the two-week strike in September, to take industrial action again.
</P>
<P>
The government only proposed an increase of the funeral
allowance to 550 U.S.Dollars, announced last month by public
service, labour
</P>
<P>
and Social Wellfare Minister Florence Chitauro.
</P>
<P>
The other outstanding issues included bonuses, increases in
various allowances, a unified labour law encompassing all workers
and civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations reached an impasse when the government which
had since September been postponing the meeting failed to offer
anything concrete on the outstanding issues. Instead, according
to representatives of the civil servants, the government
requested another postponement to November 8 to allow the cabinet to
discuss the six issues.

CHANGCHUN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Leading Chinese film director
Chen Jialin has noted that the quality of Chinese films has
dropped in recent years due to a lack of qualified playwrights,

He noted that the low quality of actors and actresses has added
to the deterioration of Chinese films.

In recent years, many actors and actresses were more concerned

To better emphasize traditional culture in Chinese films, the

<HEADLINE> Media Helping Make Chinese Citizens More Aware of Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A new TV program in China,
Court Fax, is helping increase people's awareness of the law in
northeast China, with live transmissions of cases being tried in
intermediate people's courts.
</P>
<P>
The program provides live broadcasts twice a week from the
coutrooms of Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province, for the
city's six million residents.
</P>
<P>
In any case, only a small number of people are present in the
court room, whereas the number of potential viewers of the live
broadcasts is enormous. A recent survey conducted by Shenyang TV
showed that the program has become one of the station's most
popular.
</P>
<P>
For the Chinese government, providing knowledge via the mass
media has become an important means of improving the country's
legal structure and citizens' awareness of the law.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that hundreds of Chinese news sources have
begun special legal affairs columns, which have had an enormous
impact on hundreds of millions of readers, and several of the
country's media giants, People's Daily, China National Radio, and
China Central Television (CCTV) have started legal affairs
programs which have become quite influential.
</P>
<P>
In the Tiexi District of Shenyang, a 40-year-old self-employed
worker said: "By watching Court Fax, I have gained lots of legal
knowledge which, I believe, will be beneficial to my future
business life."
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Chinese government began a publicity campaign on
knowledge of the law around the country, which is now in its
fifteenth year.

<P>
Awareness of the law has increased remarkably and the notion
that "one can protect his or her rights and interests by resorting
to the law" is becoming widely accepted.
</P>
<P>
The different media now select from a variety of cases,
covering everything from armed robbery to intellectual property
rights, most of which touch the lives of ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
Wan Yuliang, vice-president of the city's Intermediate People's
Court, said that a special phone line set up in the People's Court
is very busy anytime Court Fax is airing.
</P>
<P>
People raise all kinds of questions, asking about certain laws
and regulations, trying to predict the outcome of the proceedings,
and even assessing the performance of the judges, lawyers, and
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Some experts say they believe that, with the improvement in
China's legal system, such as the increased role of lawyers in
cases, the media are certain to play a greater role in publicizing
knowledge of the law.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Changing Relations With Other Parts of China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Municipal
Government says that the city will invest 30 billion yuan (about
3.6 billion US dollars) in other parts of China over the next five
years and industrial output value of its enterprises outside the
city will account for five to ten percent of its total.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest financial and commercial center, is
prepared to move part of its traditional industries to Yangtze
River areas and to the river's delta area, and plans to
collaborate with other areas in developing pillar and hi-tech
industries, setting up three to five industrial parks outside
Shanghai, and establishing 50 inter-regional and multi-trade
enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
The city will also get 5,000 enterprises to set up projects in
the city, encourage 500 large enterprises to set up regional
headquarters, and try to get more foreign trade companies to open
subsidiaries in the Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's annual economic growth since 1990 has stayed at 13
percent, a phenomenon not seen elsewhere in the world, but the
city's space limitations and lack of resources have restricted its
development. To deal with this problem, the city has developed an
export-oriented economy and increased ties with other parts of
China.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Shanghai's industrial and commercial
enterprises have established a nationwide sales network, made
investments, bought shares, merged factories, and raised technical
renovation funds to increase their influence.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Changing Relations With Other Parts Of China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What characterizes the new relationship most, experts say, is
the marketplace. Shanghai's unique advantages in technology,
information, commodities, and capital are responsible for economic
and technological co-operation between the city and many other
places.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that the new relationship is conducive not
only to Shanghai's development, but also to that of other parts of
China, with its investment in light industry, and textiles,
metallurgical, automotive, and building materials industries in
other parts of the country amounting to five billion yuan, and
total output value of those industries topping 15 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Those enterprises that invest in Shanghai have also
benefitted. Statistics indicate that they have generated 30
billion yuan in business and paid nearly 400 million yuan in taxes.
</P>
<P>
Two of the more powerful participants in Shanghai's phenomenal
business atmosphere are Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, whose
co-operative projects number more than 8,000 in Jiangsu. Zhejiang
has co-operated with Shanghai in 3,000 projects and sent 200,000
people to work in construction in the city.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Now 2nd Largest Investor in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has overtaken
several Asian countries and regions to become the second largest
foreign investor in Vietnam and is well-positioned to place itself
in the top spot of the list after two major investment projects
are approved, the Business Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said Singapore investment in Vietnam stood at 2.4 billion US
dollars as at last month, while Taiwan was largest investor with
four billion US dollars committed mainly to light industry
projects.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Vietnamese officials as saying that two major
Singapore projects awaiting approval were worth a combined value
of about two billion US dollars, and when approved, they would
pitchfork Singapore into the top slot as the largest foreign
investor in the country.
</P>
<P>
The two projects include a massive tourism project spanning
5,000 hectares in the central highlands of Dalat, and a
development project of a new 150-hectare international town in Ho
Chi Minh City's Thuduc suburb.
</P>
<P>
Singapore investments in Vietnam soared to 1.7 billion US
dollars last year. This year, Singapore overtook Hong Kong and
South Korea to take the second spot. A hefty 61 percent of
Singapore investment is in the property sector, with the next
biggest sector being manufacturing, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Jaruzelski Not To Be Tried Over 1981 Martial Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Poland's parliament today
decided that General Wojciech Jaruzelski and other former
communist leaders will not stand trial for their declaration of
martial law in the country in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The 460-seat lower house, or Sejm, voted 211-146 with 60
abstentions to free Jaruzelski from standing trial before the
State Tribunal, a special court for top officials, for
implementing military rule on December 13, 1981.
</P>
<P>
In separate votes, the deputies also let several other martial
law leaders off the hook.
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski, 73, said he was satisfied with the vote and
repeated his views that martial law had been necessary to avert
the threat of a Soviet invasion and to end the economic crisis
crippling Poland at the time.
</P>
<P>
A special parliamentary committee agreed with Jaruzelski's
reasoning during a debate two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski, who ruled Poland from 1981 to the fall of the
communist regime in 1989, said that even today he deeply regretted
the various wrongs, sufferings and indignities that many people
experienced.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, martial law was "a lesser evil than the
threatening _ internal and external _ catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
During the one and a half years of martial law which started
in 1981, reports say that dozens of opposition activists were
killed and thousands jailed.
</P>
<P>
The case against Jaruzelski was opened five years ago when groups
which had struggled to overthrow communism were still in power.
</P>
<P>
They reached no conclusion because subsequent parliaments were
dissolved ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the ruling coalition of ex-communists and the Peasant
party won the general election which further delayed the debate.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Lech Walesa lost his re-election bid for the
presidency and former communist Aleksander Kwasniewski took over.
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski still faces trial for the shooting by security
forces in 1970 of dozens of demonstrators protesting food price
rises. He was defense minister at the time.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Eyes South Korea For Floriculture Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 24 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka is now targeting South
Korea for florictulture exports, Export Board sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's floricuture exports have steadily increased from
32,000 US dollars in 1980 to 8.1 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
When Europe became commercially non-viable due to import
duties, Sri Lanka turned eastwards for markets. Sri Lankan
floriculture exports to Japan increased from 180,000 US dollars in
1990 to 1.66 million dollars in 1995, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is another emerging market for Sri Lanka. Its
imports of floriculture from the country increased from 6.26
million US dollars in 1988 to 21 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that with Sri Lanka being a closer supply
source to South Korea than many other countries, the potential for
growth is high.
</P>
<P>
At present, Sri Lanka is exporting to South Korea bulbs and
corms, live plants, cut flowers and cut foliage.

<HEADLINE> India's FDI Actual Inflow Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The actual inflow of foreign
direct investment (FDI) in the first eight months of 1996 reached
1.68 billion US dollars, close to the 1995 figure of 2 billion
dollars, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
This shows that despite a change in government in the country,
actual FDI inflow has been indicating a progressive increase since
foreign investment policy was liberalized in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Given this buoyancy, this year's performance is expected to be
repeated if not exceeded, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of actual inflow to foreign investment approvals
has also improved as this was 25.8 percent during the first eight
months of 1996 compared with the 19.8 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The sectoral analysis of FDI, according to the approvals since
1991, shows that the telecommunications and fuel sectors attract
the highest amounts of investment with sectoral shares of 24.17
percent and 20.48 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The financial services sector attracts the third largest
quantity of FDI with a share of 6.92 percent. The latter includes
banking, financial services and non-financial services.
</P>
<P>
This is closely followed by the food processing and
transportation sectors with shares of 6.8 percent and 6.43 percent
respectively.

WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
declared today a state of emergency in Southern California as
wildfires struck a three-county area this week, destroying more
than 100 houses and burning 37,000 acres (15,000 hectares).
</P>
<P>
Clinton ordered his top emergency management official, James
Lee Witt, to tour the disaster sites and also made available
federal funds for disaster housing, debris removal and emergency
protective measures the countries of Los Angeles, Orange and San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the devastating effects of the Southern California
fires, I am declaring that a major emergency exists in the state
of California. As a result, federal funds will begin to flow
immediately to the people and communities of California affected
by this tragedy," Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He also said that federal firefighters have joined with state
and local forces to form a human firewall from Malibu to the
Mexican border to extinguish the flames.
</P>
<P>
Airplanes and helicopters were battling the fires for a third
day Wednesday. The seasonal winds that drove the flames reaching
110 kph on Monday, were down to 40 kph today that helped the
fighting on the ground and in the air.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Top Navy Officials Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's three top Navy officials
resigned today as they opposed President Leonid Kuchma's soft
policy on the division of the former Soviet Union's Black Sea
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Aleksandr Kuzmuk signed a document accepting
the resignation of Navy Commander Vladimir Beskorovainy, Deputy
Commander Nikolai Kostrov and Chief of General Staff of Navy
Aleksei Ryzhenko, who were reported to be going to other posts
soon.
</P>
<P>
Beskorovainy, who attended the Ukraine-Russia negotiations on
the fleet division here between October 22-23, was accused of
"power abuse," the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN reported.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations were mainly focused on the division of the
former Soviet Union's Black Sea Fleet, the status and conditions
for the stationing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Ukraine as
well as accounts settlement for the leasing of Ukraine's Crimean
port of Sevastopol, said Vladimir Gorbulin, Secretary of the
National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As the navy commander who directly participated in the
negotiations, Beskorovainy should be held mainly responsible for
the fact that most of the ships Ukraine has got in the fleet split
with Russia needed to be repaired, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached between Russia and Ukraine
in April 1994, Ukraine got more than 20 ships in the first phase
in March this year and 54 ships in the second phase in August, and
the country is expected to gain some 164 out of the more than 830
ships of the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Russia have reached broad accords on dividing the
Black Sea Fleet but with no decision on the share-out of bases and
the future of its headquarters at Sevastopol, since the
disintegration of the former Soviet Union in 1991, a western news
agency report said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Mikhail Ezhely, an supervisor of the
Defense Ministry, will be appointed as Ukraine's Navy Commander.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Gov't to Revise Downwards Growth Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government is
to revise downwards its economic growth forecast for this year in
the wake of the worse-than-expected export performance in
September and expectations of a weak fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to a Straits Times report today, Trade and Industry
Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said the full figures for the third
quarter would be ready in a couple of weeks and the full year's
economic growth projection would then be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
"I think the fourth quarter will be fairly weak," he said to
local media after presenting this year's National Training Awards
Wednesday. "To what extent, we will only know in the next two
weeks or so", he added.
</P>
<P>
This will be the third time the government revises its Gross
Domestic Product forecast for this year.
</P>
<P>
The government had initially projected a seven to eight percent
growth for 1996. Then it increased the figure by half a percentage
point in May, after the first quarter's robust 10.9 percent
growth. However, the forecast was pared down to between seven and
eight percent in August, because of a slowdown in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said that when the government adjusted this year's growth
forecast to between seven and eight percent in August, it had
assumed that the second half of the year would turn in a similar
performance. Growth in the second quarter actually moderated to
seven percent.
</P>
<P>
He said a further slump in economic growth was likely in the
third quarter, since non-oil domestic exports for the third
quarter had dropped 2.4 percent. The exports figure is a key
indicator of the state of the manufacturing sector of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The drop in trade figures was due mainly to the slump in the
electronics sector, which had spillover effects on supporting
industries, such as the transportation and finance sectors, he
added.

<HEADLINE> FAO: Hunger Strikes One in Every Five in Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 24 (Xinhua) -- While food insecurity is evident
in developed countries and widespread in parts of the former
Soviet Union, hunger afflicts about one in every five people in
developing countries, a top international food agency said today.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 841 million people, or 20 percent of the
developing countries' population, are hungry, the United Nations'
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a report prepared
for the World Food Summit scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
This figure, the Rome-based U.N. specialized agency noted, does
not include the hungry people in the industrialized countries or
in the countries with economies under transition.
</P>
<P>
South Asia, particularly India and Bangladesh, and Sub-Sahara
area were cited by the report as regions with the largest
proportion of undernourished people.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Sahara area is the only major area where the proportion of
undernourished people has risen over the last quarter century from
38 percent in 1969-1971 to 43 percent in 1990-1992, and famine is
still a threat, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the late 1960s, early 1970s or even the 1980s,
the symptoms of famine are evident today only in a few African
countries and localized in war zones, it said.
</P>
<P>
FAO blamed political, economic and environmental shocks and
inadequate preparedness within these countries for the continued
existence of the risk of famine.
</P>
<P>
In developed countries of North America and Europe, economic
problems that began in the 1980s and the more uneven distribution
of income in the past two decades, together with rising
unemployment, are responsible for the growing need for food
assistance, the organization said in the report.
</P>
<P>
In the Russian Federation and particularly in central Asia,
"malfunctioning markets, lack of safety nets, and underemployment"
were behind what the FAO report called "a substantial increase in
the food-insecure population groups" after the breakup of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The document called on policy-makers to recognize poverty as a
major cause of food insecurity and to include appropriate
macro-economic policies and development strategies as
preconditions for tackling nutritional problems.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Food Security and Nutrition," and to be submitted to
the World Food Summit to be held November 13-17, the document also
urged the creation of an international reporting system for
measuring national progress toward nutritional well-being.
</P>
<P>
At the forthcoming meeting, leaders of nearly 200 countries are
expected to discuss ways to achieve universal food security and
agree on a Plan of Action to incorporate efforts by international
and non-governmental organizations, the private sector and civil
society.

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Enforce Law Against Helms-Burton Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Foreign Ministry
announced today that the "Antidote Law" adopted to counter the
Helms-Burton Act will become effective Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The law, approved on October 1 by the Chamber of Deputies,
stipulates that economic sanctions will be imposed on any Mexican
or Mexican company that obeys any foreign resolutions that
prejudice commerce and investment.
</P>
<P>
Mexico believes that the Helms-Burton Act enacted by the United
States in March, in an attempt to drive foreign investors away
from Cuba, "is extraterritorial and violates international law."
</P>
<P>
Under the antidote law, any one who disobeys will be fined up
to 3,000 U.S. dollars. The Mexican Chamber of Deputies adopted
the law with 317 votes for and one against.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry and the Commerce and Industrial Promotion
Ministry will provide counsel to anybody who finds him/herself
affected by an extraterritorial law.
</P>
<P>
The antidote law would ban Mexican companies from answering
U.S. government questions about their Cuba operations, and would
guarantee help from the Mexican government if any lawsuits are
filed under the act.

<HEADLINE> Dole Seeks Perot's Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- With less than two weeks to
go before the U.S. presidential election, Republican presidential
candidate Bob Dole's aides have asked the Reform Party's nominee
Ross Perot to quit the race and endorse him.
</P>
<P>
But, according to a report on CNN (Cable News Network)
television, his request was rejected by the Perot camp.
</P>
<P>
CNN said that Dole campaign manager Scott Reed made the urgent
entreaty at a meeting with Perot in Dallas. Republicans believe
that Perot has drawn support away from their party especially in
Florida, Texas, California and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
However, Perot spokeswoman Sharon Holman said, "Mr. Perot has
no intention of quitting the race, no intention whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
Dole made the plea 12 days before the election as Democratic
Party candidate, President Bill Clinton, was well ahead in
national polls and enjoying a similarly lopsided advantage in
state-by-state electoral vote counts.
</P>
<P>
A new NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, for example, had Clinton at
52 percent, Dole at 35 percent and Perot at 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dole advisers hoped a Perot endorsement could swing several
states in Dole's favor, especially in the Mountain West. Texas
and Florida are also two traditionally Republican states where
Clinton and Dole are running neck-and-neck.
</P>
<P>
Dole's camp expected to get Perot's endorsement because he
faces the prospect of getting less than 10 percent of the vote. He
gained 19 percent of the vote in the 1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
Republicans believe that most of Perot's support in Florida,
Texas, California and Ohio came from voters who would otherwise
vote Republican.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Economic News Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries in the past few
days:
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazil's coffee harvest for 1997-98 will be 24
million sacks (one sack weighs 60 kilograms), 2 million less than
the projected 26 million sacks for the 1996-97 harvest, the
Brazilian Rural Society predicted.
</P>
<P>
The 1997-98 coffee crop will not be able to satisfy the
internal and external demands for Brazilian coffee, which are
estimated at 29 million sacks, and is likely to lead to a serious
shortage unless a production of 30 million sacks were achieved in
the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Rural Society attributed the declining harvest in
the past few years to drought and frost in coffee-growing areas
and the low prices on domestic and foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
CARACAS -- Venezuela's foreign reserves have risen to 13.626
billion U.S. dollars, according to the latest bulletin of weekly
indicators announced by Venezuela's Central Bank. The bulletin
shows the reserves had major gains in the past few months thanks
to higher revenues from petroleum export and the inflow of foreign
capitals.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Milk production is expected to rise 7.2 percent
this year over last year, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food predicted.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the drought that hit the country in the first half
of this year, Argentina's milk output will increase from 8.3
million tons last year to 8.9 million tons this year, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- Costa Rica's production of white corn could
increase from 25,000 tons last season to 50,000 tons this farming
season, which includes the last few months of 1996 and the first
few months of 1997, officials of the Agricultural Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The increased output could satisfy the domestic demand for next
year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the huge rise to new technologies that
helped to promote the yield of corn in this Central American
country to five tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico will invest 1 billion U.S. dollars in the
mining industry between 1998-99, according to the National Mining
Chamber.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that favorable performance on
international markets had prepared conditions for making the
investments to maintain the country's privileged position in the
export of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- The Inter-American Development Bank will grant
Panama 70 million U.S. dollars in 1997 for three low-cost housing
programs, announced Deputy Housing Minister Rogelio Paredes Robles.
</P>
<P>
The programs include a joint financing program, a housing
program based on subsidies and savings and a program of quick
assistance for public housing. They will benefit people whose
monthly household incomes don not exceed 700 dollars.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Chile's investments abroad reached 3.017 billion
U.S. dollars in the first nine months of this year, increasing 6
percent over the same period in 1995, Santiago's chamber of
commerce said. According to the chamber, 1.108 billion dollars
were invested during the Autumn quarter. Chile's investments
overseas since 1990 totaled 11.515 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Italian Central Bank Lowers Discount Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Italy's central bank is to cut its
key discount rate on Thursday by 0.75 percentage points to 7.5
percent, taking it to the lowest rate since May 1994's 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The last rate cut was in July when the Banca D'Italia lowered
it from 9 percent to 8.25 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the cut was made possible by slower growth in the
annual rate of inflation which, for the first time since 1969, is
down to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement, the foreign exchange and stock markets
fell slightly with a small devaluation of lira against the
U.S. dollar and the Deutsche mark.
</P>
<P>
The government said the move, which was welcomed by business
circles, is an important step towards Italy joining the single
European currency.
</P>
<P>
Italy wants to be one of the founders of European Monetary
Union, a unified monetary system of the European Union which will
involve the setting up of a single European currency in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Government Adopts Hospital Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Austria's ministerial council
today adopted a bill on controversial hospital reform designed to
reduce government medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
The reform, described by Prime Minister Franz Vranitzky as a
"vital and right step" to protect the labor force, concerns a
hospital law and plans on hospital set-up and supply of medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The bill has to be passed by parliament before it comes into
effect.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the doctor's working time, some as long as 100
hours a week now, will be shortened. In turn expenses will be
reduced.
</P>
<P>
It also allows small hospitals nationwide to keep one
specialized doctor on shift over weekends and at night, with
others staying at home ready for emergency calls.
</P>
<P>
The reform was favored by most medical personnel and hospitals
but opposed by the Doctors' Association, which said it would hurt
the hospital's medical quality.
</P>
<P>
The government said it will continue to negotiate with the
association and asked departments in charge of health in various
states to ensure that medical quality is guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> GM Workers Accept Deal, Back on Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Workers at General Motors (GM)
Canada voted in favor of a new deal today, ending the 21-day
strike that paralyzed assembly lines and parts plants in North
America.
</P>
<P>
The workers are expected to go back to work as early as
tonight, the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 GM workers in the United States and Mexico will
also return to work once Canadian plants start shipping parts.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) Union and General Motors Canada
reached a tentative deal Tuesday for a new three-year contract
after five days of intensive bargaining.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, GM's 26,000 workers got a two-percent wage
increase in each year of the three-year deal. With cost of living
protection, it could amount to a 10-percent wage increase.
</P>
<P>
GM Canada won the right to sell two parts plants, affecting
3,500 workers. However, the workers will have wages and benefits
protected under any new owner for three years.
</P>
<P>
As to the contentious outsourcing issue, the CAW-GM deal
largely followed a pact signed early with Chrysler Canada, in
which the company agreed on limits of outsourcing. GM reversed
its decision to outsource some 800 union jobs.
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely elated at the outcome of these negotiations,"
said CAW president Buzz Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody won. The Canadian economy wins. General Motors
wins. The employees wins. The customer wins," noted GM's chief
negotiator Dean Munger.
</P>
<P>
The union will next turn to Ford Canada, the last of the Big
Three automakers, to bargain for a new contract. Talks are to
begin on October 28.

<P>
I. New China Has Solved the Problem of Feeding Its People
</P>
<P>
The semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China before liberation
in 1949 was perennially haunted by the specter of starvation. In
old China, 80 percent of the population suffered from starvation
or semi-starvation because of the extreme backwardness of
agricultural production. Natural disasters nearly always resulted
in widely spreading of deaths from starvation. In 1949 when the
People's Republic of China was founded, the national grain yield
per hectare was only 1,035 kg, and the per capita share of grain
was only 210 kg a year.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the
feudal ownership of land was abolished. Under the leadership of
their government, the Chinese people devoted themselves to
developing grain production through self-reliance and hard
work. As a result, China is now able to feed 22 percent of the
world's population on about seven percent of the world's
cultivated land. Total grain output in 1995 was more than four
times that of the 1949 figure, or an average annual increase of
3.1 percent a year. At present, China ranks first in total grain
output in the world, with the per capita share of grain reaching
approximately 380 kg (including legume and tuber crops), which is
the global average. The per capita production of meat, aquatic
products, eggs, fruit and vegetables has reached 41 kg, 21 kg, 14
kg, 35 kg and 198 kg, respectively, which are all higher than the
world's average. Statistics from the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization show that China contributed 31 percent of the world's
increased grain output in the 1980s. China's significant
achievements in developing grain production not only have
basically eradicated the problem of people not having enough to
eat and wear and gradually raised the living standards of the
Chinese people, but also made great contributions to the worldwide
efforts to eliminate starvation and poverty.

<TEXT>
<P>
The development of grain production since the founding of New
China can be divided roughly into three phases:
</P>
<P>
The first phase (1950-1978): China's total grain output
increased from 113.2 million tons in 1949 to 304.8 million tons in
1978, an average annual growth of 3.5 percent. During this 29-year
period, land ownership was first reformed and the peasants were
led on to the road of mutual-aid and cooperation, liberating the
productive forces, and remarkable successes were achieved in
improving agricultural infrastructure and the quantity and quality
of farming equipment, and in promoting the progress in
agricultural science and technology, thus laying a solid
foundation for the continued development of grain production.
</P>
<P>
The second phase (1979-1984): In 1984 China's total grain
output rose to 407.3 million tons, increasing by an average of 4.9
percent a year in 1979-1984. This second phase saw the highest
increase rate in the country's grain production, which was made
possible mainly by a series of reform policies and measures
initiated in the rural areas by the Chinese government, including,
among others, the household contract responsibility system with
remuneration linked to output, the two-layer management system
featuring the integration of centralization and decentralization,
and raising, by a fairly big margin, of the prices of grain
purchased by the state. Those important policies and measures
greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the farmers, brought into
full play the potential for agricultural production accumulated
through years of efforts to improve agricultural infrastructure,
the level of science and technology and the amount of investment,
putting an end to the situation of China's chronic grain shortage.
</P>
<P>
The third phase (1985-present): In 1995 the country's grain
output totaled 466.6 million tons, increasing by an average of 1.2
percent a year over the previous 11 years. While continuing to
develop grain production in this period, the Chinese government
has initiated measures to readjust the structure of agricultural
production and develop a diversified agricultural economy. At the
same time rapid progress was achieved in the production of various
other kinds of foodstuffs, with the output of meat (pork, beef and
mutton), aquatic products, eggs, milk and fruit reaching 42.54
million tons, 25.17 million tons, 16.76 million tons, 5.62 million
tons and 42.11 million tons respectively, or 2.8, 4.1, 3.9, 2.6
and 4.3 times the 1984 figures, respectively. Despite a lowered
increase rate of grain production, the quality of people's life
was greatly improved because of increased non-grain food supply
during this period.

<TEXT>
<P>
The successful experience of New China in solving the problem of
feeding the whole population can be summarized as follows: It has
always stuck to the principle that agriculture is the foundation
of the national economy, giving top priority to agriculture in
national economic development. It has made the increase of grain
production the key point in rural economic work, making all
possible efforts to ensure a steady increase in total grain
output; it has carried out the reform of rural relations of
production, including implementation of the policy of the
household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked
to output and the two-layer management system featuring the
integration of centralization and decentralization, expanding the
scope of market readjustment for grain and the price of grain
adjusted rationally so as to mobilize the enthusiasm of the
farmers for grain production; the basic conditions for
agricultural production have been continuously improved by
expediting scientific and technological advances in agriculture,
improving the quality and quantity of farming equipment,
increasing agricultural input and protecting the ecological
environment; given the precondition that grain production is never
to be compromised, land resources have been developed and made
full use of in a comprehensive way while a diversified economy has
been vigorously developed to increase farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
At present, the great majority of both urban and rural
residents in China have adequate food and clothing. The tasks
ahead for the Chinese government are, while ensuring a continued
increase in grain output, to vigorously promote diversified food
production, readjust the food structure, and continue to raise the
people's quality of life from the stage of simply having enough
food and clothing to leading a relatively well-off and comfortable
life. However, the Chinese government is aware that the level of
balance between the supply of and demand for grain in the country
will have to be further enhanced, and the situation in which the
relations between the supply of and demand for grain tend to be
tense will continue to exist for a long time to come. Meanwhile,
because of adverse natural conditions and shortage of cultivated
land and water resources in some places, there were, by the end of
1995, 65 million people (about five percent of the entire
population) who still did not have adequate food and clothing. To
tackle this problem the Chinese government has initiated the
"poverty-alleviating program" to lift those people above the
poverty line by the end of this century.

II. Prospects for China's Consumption Demand for Grain
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, a scientific and moderate food
consumption pattern which keeps pace with the national economic
growth and conforms to the situation of the nation's agricultural
resources should be brought into being among both the urban and
rural residents. The Chinese government will strive to avoid a
rapid increase in grain demand beyond the supply capacity through
guided grain consumption and tapping the grain producing
potential as well as the potential of non-grain food production.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, though the per capita share of grain has been
relatively stable, the nutritional status of the Chinese people
has markedly improved because of the increased supply of food of
animal origin. Food supply per person per day in terms of calories
reaches 2,727 kilocalories, including those from 70 grams of
protein and 52 grams of fat. This figure is higher than the
figures for those other countries with per capita GNP comparable
to China's. Therefore, it can be said that the food supply in
China has basically reached the average world level.

<TEXT>
<P>
In accordance with the ``China Dietary Pattern Reform and
Development Program in the 1990s'' and the dietary habits of the
urban and rural residents, a food consumption pattern featuring
medium calories, high protein and low fat will be gradually
brought into being among the Chinese people. On the basis of
retaining the traditional food structure, food of animal origin
will be added to a proper extent to improve the food quality. This
gradual change in the food consumption pattern will cause the
staple food consumption to decrease while the supply of grain used
for feed will gradually increase. Based on this assumption and by
making unswerving efforts in grain production, China's per capita
share of grain is estimated to reach approximately 400 kg by 2030
when China's population reaches a new peak. Over half of the 400
kg will be used for staple foodstuffs, while the rest will be used
for producing food of animal origin so as to satisfy the need to
improve the living standard and the nutritional level of the
people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government believes that the above-mentioned food
consumption pattern is likely to be realized. First, China has
great potential for developing diversified food production,
though the per capita grain share will not be increased by a big
margin. Non-staple food will play an increasingly greater role in
substituting for staple food as the supply of meat, eggs, aquatic
products, fruit and vegetables increases. Second, the rapidly
increasing demand for commercial grain used for feed can be
cut down through promoting scientific and technological
advances in aquatic farming, enhancing the feed efficiency and
increasing the proportion of grain-saving products like
herbivorous livestock and poultry and aquatic products. Third,
China today is at a period of low increase in food
consumption. The experience of many other countries has proved that
food consumption tends to be constant after having reached a
certain level. The present-day urban food consumption level in
China as a low-income country has gone beyond the practical limit.
</P>
<P>
This was caused by lack of domestic investment channels and
the fact that people spend a greater proportion of their incomes
on food. In the future the proportion of their increased incomes
spent on housing and transportation will increase along with the
implementation of medical, housing and other social security
reforms. At the same time, the proportion of food expenses in the
total consumption expenses of the people will decrease gradually
and the increase of food consumption will be behind the income
increase.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the above trend of change in consumption
pattern and the estimated population growth, China's demand for
grain in the next few decades is projected as follows: By 2000
the population will reach 1.3 billion and the total demand for
grain will be 500 million tons, based on 385 kg per person; by
2010 the population will approach 1.4 billion and the total
demand for grain will be 550 million tons, based on 390 kg per
person; and by 2030 the population will peak at 1.6 billion and
the total demand for grain will be approximately 640 million
tons, based on 400 kg per person.

III. China Can Basically Achieve Self-Sufficiency in Grain
Supply Through Self-Reliance
</P>
<P>
The basic principle for solving the problem of grain supply
and demand in China is to rely on the domestic resources and
basically achieve self-sufficiency in grain supply. China
endeavors to increase its grain production so that its
self-sufficiency rate of grain supply under normal conditions
will be above 95 percent and the net import rate five percent, or
even less, of the total consumption quantity.
</P>
<P>
China has basically achieved self-sufficiency in grain supply
at the present stage, and there are many favorable objective
factors for it to maintain such achievement by its own efforts in
the course of future development: Natural agricultural resources,
production conditions, technical level and some other conditions
ensure great potential in this respect.
</P>
<P>
-- There is potential for increasing the yield per unit area
on the existing cultivated land. At present, the per unit area
yield of grain varies widely in the same districts, the highest
yield being 7,500 kg to 15,000 kg per hectare, and the lowest
3,000 kg to 5,000 kg. Given a relatively stable sown area, China
can achieve its desired total grain output target if the annual
average increase rate of per unit area yield is one percent from
1996 to 2010 and 0.7 percent from 2011 to 2030. Compared to the
annual average increase rate of 3.1 percent of the per unit area
yield in the past 46 years, it is clear that one percent and 0.7
percent are fairly low. So to achieve the target is totally
possible even if the factor of diminishing land returns rate is
considered. At present, China's per unit area yield of grain is
low compared with the countries with high grain yields. It is
very difficult for China to reach the level of countries with
high grain production in a short period of time, but the gap can
certainly be narrowed through earnest efforts. The grain output
per hectare can be increased by more than 1,500 kg through the
upgrading of medium- and low-yield land, beefing up water-control
projects, enlarging irrigated areas and spreading the use of
advanced agro-technology.
</P>
<P>
-- There is also potential for exploiting untouched arable
land resources. China now has 35 million hectares of wasteland
which is suitable for farming. Of this, about 14.7 million
hectares can be reclaimed. The Chinese government will make
efforts to speed up the reclamation of wasteland suitable for
farming as well as land discarded by factories and mines, while
adopting measures to protect the existing cultivated land. In the
next few decades, China plans to reclaim more than 300,000
hectares each year to make up for the loss of cultivated land
appropriated for non-farming uses and to keep the area of
cultivated land constant for a long period of time. The grain
crop area will be stabilized at about 110 million hectares
through the increase of the multiple crop index.

<TEXT>
<P>
-- There is scope for scientific and technological
improvement. At present, the contribution of science and
technology to agriculture accounts for about 35 percent of the
agricultural production increase, while it exceeds 60 percent in
the agriculturally advanced countries. The Chinese government has
drawn up a strategy for agricultural development through relying
on science, technology and education and is striving to put it
into practice so as to narrow this gap: By 2000 the contribution
rate of science and technology to agriculture will be increased to
50 percent, and by 2030 it will be close to that of the advanced
countries. This will enable China to go a step further in grain
production.
</P>
<P>
-- Non-grain food resources can also be exploited. China has
rich water, grassland and sloping land resources which have great
potential for exploitation. According to statistics, among the
17.47 million hectares of inland waters, 6.75 million hectares can
be used for aquaculture. At present, only 69 percent of the water
area is used. About 6.7 million hectares of rice fields can be
used for fish breeding, but the utilization rate at present is
only 15 percent. And China has an offshore water area of 2.6
million hectares suitable for aquaculture, but the utilization
rate is only 28 percent. China will actively increase the
productivity of its waters so as to keep a continuous and rapid
increase of aquatic products. China's grasslands cover a total
area of 390 million hectares, of which about 320 million hectares
can be used, which places China third in the world in the area of
usable grassland. If the intensification level of livestock
farming in grasslands is improved through the development of
artificial grasslands, animal by-products will increase
greatly. Moreover, mountainous areas account for 70 percent of
China's total territory, and this favorable condition for the
development of arbor foodstuffs will offer China wide prospects
for increasing the supply of such foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
-- Much can be done to save grain. According to estimates by
experts, the loss rate of grain is at least 10 percent in the
course of planting, harvesting, transport, storage, selling,
processing and consumption -- a total of well over 45 million
tons. So it will be possible to save at least 20 million tons of
grain every year if such losses are reduced to within the rational
limits.

<P>
The Chinese government has determined to keep the balance of
the grain supply and demand through increasing grain production,
and is confident of its ability to lead the people throughout the
country to achieve this goal. But at the same time it also knows
clearly that this is not an easy task: First, the average amount
of agricultural resources per capita in China is low compared with
many other countries. China lacks cultivated land and water
resources, and this is the dominant factor restricting its
agricultural development. In these conditions, China must make
great efforts to advance its agricultural productive forces and
make it far higher than the average world level. Second, China's
agricultural infrastructure is weak, means of production lag
behind and it does not have sufficient capability to fight natural
calamities. So a sustained effort should be made in these
respects. Third, grain production will fluctuate in the course of
the transformation of the economy into a socialist market one
because of the small-scale production and decentralized management
of peasant households. So adjustment and control of grain
production should be strengthened. Fourth, because China is in a
period of rapid industrial development, there is a tendency in the
distribution of resources that is unfavorable to grain
production. So effective measures have to be adopted in support of
agriculture, especially grain production. In a word, facing
difficulties squarely, the Chinese Government will continue to
strictly carry out the basic policy of protecting cultivated land
and ecological environment in its economic distribution and its
work guidance and implement the two major strategies: developing
agriculture through science, technology and education and
realizing sustainable development. Thus it expects to promote a
fundamental change in the agricultural economic system and the
method of increasing agricultural production, so as to facilitate
the steady increase of the overall grain production capability.
</P>
<P>
While standing for resolving the balance between the supply of
and demand for grain at home, China will not rule out the use of
international resources as a necessary complement. This will,
however, only play the role of regulation in varieties, in case of
crop failures and to support poor regions. There are the following
three reasons for China to balance its grain supply and
demand: First, grain production plays an important role in
maintaining social stability. China is a country with a population
of more than 1.2 billion, which makes it imperative for the
government to ensure a high rate of grain self-sufficiency as a
necessary condition for stability. Otherwise, it will not be able
to maintain its national economy's sustained, rapid and healthy
development. Second, Grain security. The quantity of grain
consumed in China every year is one fifth of the world's total. If
China was to import a great deal of grain from other countries,
the international grain market would be under severe pressure, and
poorer countries would be unable to obtain enough supplies of
cheap grain from it. Third, the employment of the rural
workforce. At present, China has more than 400 million laborers in
the countryside, and the development of grain production is one of
the main ways of stimulating the employment of the rural workforce
and increasing the income of the farmers. To import too much grain
would have an unfavorable impact on grain production at home as
well as on the employment of the rural workforce. China's striving
for relying mainly on its own efforts to solve the grain problem
will serve only to improve the stability of the world grain market
and strengthen the stabilizing factor of the international grain
trade.

<P>
Historically, China has never relied on the international grain
market too much. From the founding of New China to the eve of the
1960s, China was a net exporter of grain. After that it began to
import more than it exported. Since the reform and opening polices
were introduced at the end of the 1970s, the net import percentage
in domestic grain production has been on the decrease. It was 3.2
percent from 1978 to 1984, 1.2 percent from 1985 to 1990 and 0.4
percent from 1991 to 1995. Therefore, China's import of the small
quantity of grain will definitely not pose a threat to the world
grain security, and the international clamor about a "China threat
in grain supply" is groundless. It is true that China imports
some grain, but at the same time it also exports some foodstuffs
with fairly high added value. From 1985 to 1995, the export volume
of foodstuffs and edible animals and poultry was 75.6 billion US
dollars, while the import volume was 34 billion US dollars, so
China was a net food-exporting country. China is willing to
establish comparatively stable trade relations in grain with the
grain exporting countries on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
IV. Striving to Improve Production Conditions to Increase the
Comprehensive Grain Production Capability
</P>
<P>
To realize the goal of increasing grain output, the Chinese
Government will adopt a series of measures to protect cultivated
land resources, increase agricultural input, and improve water
conservation facilities and upgrade farm machinery and equipment
so as to increase China's comprehensive grain production
capability.
</P>
<P>
Protecting cultivated land is always the foundation for
increasing grain production. Over the years, China have
formulated and improved a series of laws and regulations,
including the Agriculture Law, Land Management Law and Water and
Soil Conservation Law. The result has been an alleviation in the
trend of rapid reduction of cultivated land, the net area of
cultivated land reduction has dropped to less than 200,000
hectares at present from the annual average of 300,000 hectares
preceding the 1990s. Following the speeding up of
industrialization in the future, there will be a growing demand
for land for economic construction. In view of this the Chinese
Government will, in light of the principle of "economization on
land use and little or no occupation of cultivated land," adopt
more effective measures to ensure the dynamic equilibrium of the
total cultivated land: restrict occupation of cultivated land for
non-agricultural purposes, improve the land preservation system
and strengthen the protection of basic farmland; the examination
and approval system for the use of land for construction must be
implemented strictly and the development scale of cities
controlled so as to efficiently use the available land and
increase the land utilization rate; administration of the plans
for village and township construction and township enterprise
development will be strengthened. Scattered township enterprises
will be joined together to form industrial districts and
residential areas concentrated to save as much land as possible
for farming; and a policy of linking the appropriation of land for
non-agricultural construction purposes to land development and
reclamation will be implemented.

Since the founding of New China, led by the Chinese Government,
the Chinese people have harnessed rivers, built 84,000 reservoirs
to improve production conditions, and have improved 20 million
hectares of areas liable to water logging. The irrigated area has
increased to the present 49.33 million hectares from 16 million
hectares in the early Liberation period, and the water supply
capability has reached 500 billion cubic meters, effectively
improving the capability of agriculture to withstand natural
calamities. The Chinese Government will continue to work hard to
build a group of large and medium-sized water control projects to
solve the problem of unbalanced distribution of water resources in
different regions and seasons; farm capital construction will be
undertaken on an extensive scale, so that the effective area of
irrigated land will reach 53.30 million hectares by the year 2000,
56.70 million hectares by 2010 and 66.70 million hectares by 2030,
respectively, accounting for 56 percent, 60 percent and 70 percent
of the cultivated land; the rebuilding and repair of key
irrigation and drainage projects should be quickened to increase
the area with stable yields despite drought or excessive rain to
more than 40 million hectares in 2030 from the present 33 million
hectares, and enable the per unit yield of more than 20 million
hectares of the 2030 figure to reach 15 tons per hectare; the use
of water-saving irrigation methods and dry land cropping are
encouraged and by 2030, the area irrigated by water-saving
irrigation methods will be increased to more than 40 million
hectares from the present 13 million hectares and the effective
utilization rate of irrigation water will be increased to more
than 60 percent from 40 percent. In addition, the effective
utilization rate of natural precipitation will be raised to more
than 30 percent. At the same time, the improvement of medium- and
low-yield fields should be speeded up. China plans to upgrade 14
million hectares of medium- and low-yield fields by 2000, with a
target upgrading of 60 million hectares of medium- and low-yield
fields by 2030.

Since the founding of New China, industries serving agriculture
have developed by leaps and bounds, playing an important role in
ensuring increased grain production. The total output of chemical
fertilizers has increased to the present 24.5 million tons from
39,000 tons in the early Liberation period (calculated in 100
percent effective ingredients -- similarly hereinafter), and the
amount used has increased to 35.70 million tons from 79,000 tons,
averaging 375 kg per hectare of cultivated land; agricultural
machinery power has increased to 360.7 billion watts from 1.21
billion watts in the same period, the number of large and
medium-sized tractors has increased to 670,000 from 1,300 and
that of agricultural trucks to 800,000 from 4,000. Nowadays in the
rural areas 162.8 billion kwh of electricity is used per year,
while in the early Liberation period the figure was only 50
million kwh. As a whole, however, the industries serving
agriculture today are still unable to meet the needs of sustained
agricultural development. For this reason, China will continue to
make great efforts to expand its chemical fertilizer production
and raise the self-sufficiency rate of chemical fertilizers. By
2000 China will be basically self-sufficient in nitrogenous
fertilizer. At the same time, efforts will be made to promote the
production of farm chemicals, plastic film, farm machinery and
electric power and diesel oil.
</P>
<P>
The structure of national income and distribution of social
funds will be gradually adjusted. Priority should be given to
agriculture, especially to grain production, in terms of planning
and capital input, and a higher percentage of the fixed assets
investment, state budgeted funds and bank loans will go to
agriculture so as to increase the total agricultural input. By
2000 agricultural investment in the budget for the capital
construction plan of the central government will increase to more
than 20 percent from the present 17 percent. In light of the
practice of the central government, local governments will also
increase their investment in agriculture; the annual agricultural
input of financial departments at all levels should increase by a
bigger margin than regular financial revenues; the increase rate
of agricultural loans should be higher than that of other loans,
and the proportion of agricultural loans should exceed 10 percent
of the total bank loans and credit cooperatives should increase
the proportion of their agricultural loans; the rural financial
system should be further improved, including the establishment of
a rural policy bank, commercial bank and cooperative financial
organization. The rural policy funds should be guaranteed to be
mainly used for grain production. The Chinese government will
continue to adopt a series of policies and measures for
increasing the efficiency of agricultural input so as to mobilize
the enthusiasm for increasing input in grain production on the
part of rural collective economic organizations and households. In
accordance with the principle of whoever invests gains benefits,
China will extend loans to large industrial and commercial
enterprises which engage in comprehensive agricultural
development. The scale of using foreign investment for
agriculture will be expanded, and preferential treatment provided
for such investment, especially in grain production.

<HEADLINE> WFP Warns of Looming Food Crisis in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Intensified armed fighting and the
worsening security situation in eastern Zaire could lead to a
major hunger crisis affecting over 1 million Rwandan and Burundian
refugees, the World Food Program (WFP) warned today.
</P>
<P>
"Our window of opportunity (to avoid the crisis) is quickly
diminishing as events spiral out of control," said Trevor Rowe,
spokesman of the United Nations agency, which has been unable to
deliver humanitarian supplies to the region since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The worsening conditions in eastern Zaire has led to a cut-off
in humanitarian supplies, Rowe said. And "unless supply lines to
the refugee camps are opened immediately, the humanitarian
consequences in coming weeks could be devastating."
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the international community to exert maximum
pressure to ensure the free movement of humanitarian relief," said
WFP, the largest international food agency based in Rome.
</P>
<P>
WFP has the capability to deliver food stocks from neighboring
Uganda and Tanzania for the refugees in eastern Zaire for the next
two months.
</P>
<P>
However, 75 WFP trucks with more than 2,200 metric tons of food
destined for Goma and Bukavu have been halted by Zairian
authorities since the weekend at the Zairian-Ugandan border for
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
In Goma, WFP has 7,200 tons of food in stock. But while these
supplies are enough to feed 727,000 people for three weeks,
delivery has been blocked by continued fighting in the north where
an estimated 500,000 refugees are camped.
</P>
<P>
To the west of Goma, where there are some 220,000 refugees,
there are no food stocks.
</P>
<P>
In Bukavu, WFP has already distributed food supplies to the
refugees which will last until the end of the month. The Program
now has only enough additional food stocks to feed the 300,000
refugees for an extra week.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Zaire has been set to explode in ethnic violence since
genocide and civil war in Rwanda in 1994 sent more than a million
Hutu refugees streaming in, stoking local rivalries.
</P>
<P>
But fighting has widened in the last six weeks since Zairian
troops reportedly joined ethnic clashes between native Zairians
and Tutsis, who have lived in Zaire for generations and are known
as Banyamulenge.

V. Developing Agriculture Through Science, Technology and
Education and Changing the Grain Increase Mode
</P>
<P>
To change the grain increase mode, we must first carry out
reforms, optimize the industrial structure and farming system,
stress scientific management, enhance the level of intensive
farming in grain production and raise the utilization rate of
agricultural resources. But the most important thing is to rely on
progress in science and technology, step up efforts to develop
grain production through science, technology and education and
concentrate on high yields, high quality, high efficiency and low
consumption. Since its founding, New China has made over 30,000
major agricultural scientific and technological achievements, of
which over 6,000 have won awards from the state or ministries,
and some of them have reached the international advanced
level. The variety of the most important grain crops has been
renewed three to five times, each time resulting in increased
yields of 10 percent or more. In the past decade the total area
sown to hybrid rice has reached 160 million hectares, with an
increased output of 240 million tons; the large-scale
popularization of various comprehensive cultivation technologies
has played an important role in grain production increase; and in
the hi-tech sphere, including bio-engineering, a number of
important technologies, such as the new combination of two-line
hybrid rice, have shown favorable development prospects. But, as
compared to countries with advanced agriculture, China's
agricultural science and technology lag fairly far behind. Hence,
the Chinese Government has chosen and put into practice the
strategy of developing agriculture through science, technology and
education. It will adopt a series of measures to enable science
and technology to play a greater role in increased grain
production.
</P>
<P>
-- Speeding up the implementation of the "Seed Project." China
will perfect the breeding, import, processing, marketing and
extension system of improved strains. By 2000 seeds of all main
grain crops will be renewed; 50 percent of commodity seeds will be
coated; and the unified seed supply rate and the coverage rate of
improved strains of rice, corn and wheat will be raised. China's
advantages of rich germplasm resources and a good seed-breeding
basis will be brought into full play. In addition, China will
strengthen the cultivation of new strains of rice, wheat and corn,
and speed up the replacement of the older generations of strains
by new ones.

<TEXT>
<P>
-- Quickening the transfer of existing scientific and
technological achievements into productive forces, and the
scientific research and import of key technologies concerning
grain production. In the next few years China will concentrate on
spreading the following important agricultural techniques: spread
use of new strains, paddy rice nurture in the dry nursery and thin
planting by throwing rice seedlings, plastic film mulching,
precise and semi-precise mechanical seeding, the integrated pest
control, scientific fertilization, water-saving irrigation, and
dry land cropping. Efforts will be continued to tap the potential
of traditional agricultural technologies for increasing output,
such as intensive cultivation, increased amounts of organic
fertilizers, and the combination of land use and protection, to
form a technical application system integrating traditional and
modern farming. In addition, the country will perfect the
three-level (county, township and village) agro-technique
popularization network step by step, support the development of
various non-governmental special technical organizations and form
a service system for popularizing agricultural technologies in
which the state, collectives and various non-governmental
technical organizations will work in coordination and complement
each other. Scientific research projects with special influence on
grain production will be given extra support and the import of a
number of important grain production technologies will be speeded
up.
</P>
<P>
-- Reinforcing vocational training among the farmers. China
will make full use of its existing 500-odd agricultural and
forestry polytechnical schools, more than 2,000 county-level
agricultural broadcasting and TV schools and grass-roots
agro-technology popularization organs to improve farmers'
abilities to accept and apply new agro-technologies through
extensive vocational training, especially through the "Green
Certificate" project. By 2000, ten million farmers will have
obtained such certificates and large numbers of good hands at
grain growing will have emerged.
</P>
<P>
-- Deepening reform of the system for agricultural science,
technology and education. China will improve its agricultural
scientific research structure and set up a new scientific research
system featuring advanced disciplines and the close integration of
scientific research with production. The state and local
governments will selectively support leading agricultural
scientific research and education institutions to foster a capable
contingent of scientists for important basic practical technology
and new- and hi-tech research. Some people engaged in scientific
research and education will be encouraged in an active way to go
deep into the countryside to spread technology and train
farmers. The government's unified plan for agricultural science
and technology and relevant education should be strengthened to
speed up the integration of agricultural scientific research and
education, and popularization of agro-technologies to improve
grain production.

resources and reduce the loss of grain. Concrete steps will be
taken as follows: Operation of scale in an appropriate degree will
be carried out gradually and the intensification level of grain
production raised where possible. Technologies will be actively
popularized to lower grain production costs, reduce the waste of
materials and improve grain production efficiency. The management
of all grain production links -- sowing, harvesting, storage,
transport and processing -- will be improved and energy-saving
machinery widely applied along with methods to prevent waste; the
quality of seeds will be improved and the quantity of seeds used
will be reduced through selection, processing and coating;
harvesting should be further mechanized; advanced grain-protection
technology should be applied and new packaging technology and
materials adopted for grain storage; traditional transport methods
should be improved with the modernization of railways, highways

VI. Comprehensively Developing, Utilizing and Protecting Land
Resources for the Sustainable Development of Agriculture
</P>
<P>
China has always attached great importance to comprehensive
development and utilization of mountain areas, water surfaces,
grasslands and other resources to increase the output of various
foodstuffs. From now on, China will continue to adhere to the
principle of never slackening grain production and actively
developing a diversified economy, make full use of various
resources and increase the supply of meat, eggs, milk products,
aquatic products, vegetables and fruit. Meanwhile China will pay
attention to the protection of agricultural resources and the
improvement of the ecological environment to realize the
sustainable development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
-- Gradually setting up an animal husbandry production
structure conforming to the characteristics of China's
resources. Since the adoption of the policy of reform and opening
up to the outside world, the production of grass-eating and
grain-saving animal foodstuffs has developed quickly. The
proportion of pork -- which consumes a fairly large amount of
grain -- in the total amount of meat fell from over 90 percent in
1978 to about 70 percent at present, and the proportions of beef,
mutton and fowl meat rose rapidly. By 2000, the proportions of
beef, mutton and fowl meat will increase by 10 percentage points
each. In farming areas, crop stalks should be used mainly to feed
cattle and sheep; forge structure will be adjusted, and great
efforts made to develop the production of compound feed and feed
additives, green feed and southern aquatic forage. In pastoral
areas China will strengthen the exploitation, protection and
utilization of grassland resources to improve its stock capacity,
ameliorate grasslands and grow grass artificially on a large
scale, develop the forage-processing industry and raise
productivity. By 2000 China's total output of meat is expected to
reach 58.5 million tons and that of eggs, 17.5 million tons. The
amount of meat per capita will be 45 kg and that of eggs will
remain approximately at the present per capita level.
</P>
<P>
-- Quickening the development and utilization of shallow
offshore waters, beaches and inland waters. The Chinese government
will persist in the principle of "simultaneously developing
aquaculture, fishing and processing, with emphasis on
aquaculture," seek to expand the area for inland freshwater
aquaculture, further utilize shallow offshore waters and beaches
and develop deep-sea fishing. By 2000 the total output of aquatic
products will reach 32 million tons -- 25 kg per capita.

<P>
-- Increasing the supply of fruit, vegetables and arbor
foodstuffs. The Chinese Government will take measures to develop
fruit production by using non-cultivated land, encourage farmers
to grow fruit trees and vegetables in front of and behind their
houses and develop a courtyard economy. China will produce, by
2000, 62 million tons of fruit, 48 kg per capita. It will
consolidate and improve vegetable production bases around large
and medium-sized cities, and encourage farming areas to expand
vegetable production through intercropping, relay intercropping
and other multi-harvest cultivation measures so as to improve the
balanced supply of vegetables and enhance the capability for the
effective supply of vegetables. In addition, the government is
determined to speed up the reclamation of the barren hills
suitable for farming, readjust the forestry structure step by step
and increase the production of arbor foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
To realize the sustained and stable growth of grain production
and produce diversified foodstuffs China must handle well the
relationship among population, resources and environment, improve
the management of agricultural resources and protect the
ecological environment. Since the 1980s, China has made great
efforts to conduct the construction of ecological agriculture and
has tried every means to find a sustainable agricultural
development mode that not only can increase the output of grain
and other farm produce, but also help improve the ecological
environment. In this period there has been a comprehensive
improvement of soil erosion on over 67 million hectares of land in
small river valleys, and more than 2,000 experimental ecological
agriculture stations of various sizes have been set up at the
county, township and village levels. Moreover, China has unfolded
large-scale projects for water and soil conservation throughout
the country, and constructed a shelter-forest network for fields
in the plains to control soil erosion. Important shelter-forest
and other ecological projects in northeast, north and northwest
China, on the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River and in
coastal areas have taken shape. Pastoral areas have given up
farming and restored animal husbandry when artificial grasslands
have been constructed to prevent them from becoming deserts. All
these measures have played active roles in improving China's
ecological environment. China will continue to promote
agricultural construction in an ecologically friendly way, start
large-scale water and soil conservation, control soil erosion in
small river valleys in a comprehensive way, prevent
desertification and grassland deterioration, and strive to
increase the coverage rate of forests. In the course of
industrialization and urbanization, China will continue to protect
 and improve the natural environment for agriculture. In this
respect, it will focus on controlling environmental pollution
caused by industrial development, and popularize suitable
technologies to help prevent and control industrial pollution. It
will actively develop new sources of rural energy, try to slow
down the destruction of vegetation and the deterioration of soil
quality caused by the shortage of energy in rural areas. It will
speed up the construction of hydropower facilities, reduce the
proportion of coal in the energy structure, and combat the
negative influences of acid rain and global warming.

<P>
In the past decade or so profound changes have taken place in
China's grain production and circulation system, as well as in
the government's regulation and control methods of grain supply
and demand and price fluctuation. The Chinese government will work
hard to consolidate and perfect the existing achievements, and
will deepen the restructuring of the agricultural economy in
accordance with the requirements for the building of a socialist
market economy system:
</P>
<P>
-- Make the rural basic management systems stable for long
periods of time and improve them continuously. The household
contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output
and the two-layer management system featuring the integration of
centralization and decentralization are the basic management
systems Chinese rural areas have adopted since the initiation of
the policy of reform and opening to the outside world. As these
systems have effectively promoted the production of grain and
other agricultural products, and safeguarded the producers' own
decision-making power in management and their economic benefits,
they have won the heartfelt support of the broad masses of
farmers.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Chinese government declared explicitly that the
existing rural basic management systems would remain unchanged
for quite a long time, and the public land contracted out by the
collectives to peasant households could be used by the latter for
as long as 15 years. In 1993 the government made a decision that
upon the expiration of a land contract the term could be extended
for another 30 years and that during the contract term farmers
could freely transfer the land use right with compensation, on
condition that the way of its use remain unchanged. The Chinese
government will continue to encourage rural areas and small towns
to develop secondary and tertiary industries to speed up the
absorption of the surplus rural labor force, propel the
localities, where possible, to gradually implement operation of
cultivated land on an appropriate scale, further improve the
economic benefits of grain production and strengthen the motive
force for grain production development.
</P>
<P>
-- Further reforming and perfecting the grain circulation
system. In 1985 the Chinese government abolished the state
monopoly of purchase and marketing of grain. Now the following
four methods are used to purchase grain:

<TEXT>
<P>
The state purchases grain through fixed quotas; the state
purchases grain through negotiations with producers;
grain-processing enterprises purchase grain from the wholesale
markets; and farmers sell their grain at fairs. In 1993 grain
rationing was abolished in cities and towns throughout the
country. As the retail prices of commodities on the market have
increased by a large margin in the past two years, governments at
all levels have specified that urban residents might purchase a
certain amount of grain from state-owned grain shops at prices
lower than the market price. State-owned grain shops are playing a
more and more important role in guaranteeing the basic livelihood
of urban residents with low incomes.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the requirements for founding a socialist
market economy system, the Chinese government will focus on
continually propelling the reform of the grain circulation system
in the following three respects.
</P>
<P>
First, establishing a pricing mechanism as soon as possible,
whereby grain prices are primarily decided by the market; further
developing and improving the grain market system; and gradually
changing the planned inter-regional allocation and transfer of
grain to the practice whereby the producing and marketing regions
achieve a balance between supply and demand among regions through
market circulation. Subsidization and other policies will be
adopted with regard to the grain consumption of urban and rural
residents with low incomes.
</P>
<P>
Second, China should speed up the pace for the separation of
state-owned grain departments' policy-related business from
commercial business to strengthen state-owned grain circulation
enterprises' competitiveness in the market.
</P>
<P>
Third, China will quicken the fostering of intermediaries
linking the farmers with the market, and guiding and encouraging
them to join hands and participate in grain circulation. The
Chinese government will adopt a series of policy-related measures
to promote the operation of grain by the integration of trade,
industry and agriculture, and gradually set up a high-efficiency
agricultural system with grain as the base. The basic method will
be to realize co-development of crop cultivation, animal husbandry
and aquaculture while actively developing transportation and
marketing and the processing industry with raw materials derived
from crop cultivation, animal husbandry and aquaculture so as to
tightly link grain production with transfer, processing and
circulation, add value by manifold ways, increase the comparative
benefits of grain production and the income of the farmers, and
ensure the sustained, stable development of grain production.

<P>
-- Guiding consumption and reducing waste. The Chinese
Government will continue to conduct education on treasuring and
economizing on grain and formulate corresponding policies to
promote the formation of a new social conduct that stresses thrift
in grain and opposes waste and extravagance. The dietary pattern
will be reformed; supervision of the catering industry will be
tightened; and the production of alcoholic drinks made from grain
-- at present consuming 20 million tons of grain a year -- will be
reduced.
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening the regulation and control of grain
markets. China is a country with frequent natural disasters, so it
is hard for the country to avoid the fluctuation of grain output,
which has an unfavorable impact on the stability of grain
markets. To protect grain producers and stabilize grain markets
the Chinese Government started in 1990 to set up the minimum grain
price protection system and the special grain reserve system for
regulating supply and demand and the prices on grain markets. In
1994 a grain market risk fund system at the central and provincial
levels was set up. Experience over the past few years has proved
that these systems have played positive roles. China will further
perfect these systems, maintain reasonable amounts of grain in
reserve, replenish the grain market risk funds and reinforce the
government's capability to regulate grain markets.
</P>
<P>
In stabilizing the grain market, it is also necessary to make
timely and appropriate use of the international grain market and
regulating the relationship between the domestic grain supply and
demand through import and export trade. In recent years the grain
prices on the domestic market have been approaching step by step
those on the international market. To protect the farmers' basic
interests, the Chinese Government will adopt the policy of
imposing tariffs on imported grain according to the usual
international practice.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the founding of New China, some Westerners
predicted that the Chinese Government would not be able to solve
the problem of feeding the country's population. History has
already shown the futility of such a prediction. In the coming
decades, though China will be confronted with the reality of less
cultivated land, a large population and great demand for grain,
there exists huge potential for development. The Chinese
government has experience and has developed methods for solving
the grain problem, and the farmers have a vast reservoir of
enthusiasm for production. It can be believed with full reasons
that the Chinese Government and people have the ability to solve
the problem of grain supply by relying on their own
efforts. Practice will prove to the world: The Chinese people not
only can feed themselves, but also make their quality of life
better and better year by year. Instead of imposing a threat to
the world's grain security, China will make ever greater
contributions to it.

<HEADLINE> White Paper: The Grain Issue in China (Summary) (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government issued a
white paper here today, noting that in the coming decades, though
China will encounter with the reality of less cultivated land, a
large population and great demand for grain, there still exits
huge potential for development.
</P>
<P>
China has accumulated experience and developed methods for
solving the grain problem, and the farmers have a huge reservoir
of enthusiasm for production.
</P>
<P>
It can be believed with full reasons that the Chinese
government and people have the ability to solve the problem of
grain supply by relying on their own efforts.
</P>
<P>
The white paper issued by the Information Office of the State
Council, entitled "The Grain Issue in China", noted that on the
eve of the founding of New China some Westerners predicted that
the Chinese government would not be able to solve the problem of
feeding th country's population. History has already shown the
futility of such a prediction, its says.
</P>
<P>
The white paper is composed of more than 12,000 words and in
seven parts:
</P>
<P>
I. New China Has Solved the Problem of Feeding Its People;
</P>
<P>
II. Prospects for the Future China's Consumption Demand for
Grain;
</P>
<P>
III. China Can Basically Achieve Self-Sufficiency in Grain
Through Self-Reliance;
</P>
<P>
IV. Striving to Improve Production Conditions to Increase the
Comprehensive Grain Production Ability;
</P>
<P>
V. Developing Agriculture by Relying on Science, Technology and
Education and Changing the Grain Increase Method;
</P>
<P>
VI. Comprehensively Developing, Utilizing and Protecting Land
Resources for the Sustained Development of Agriculture;
</P>
<P>
VII. Deepening Structural Reform and Creating a Favorable
Policy Environment for Grain Production and Circulation.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says after the founding of the People's
Republic, the feudal ownership of land was abolished. Under the
leadership of their government, the Chinese people devoted
themselves to developing grain production through self-reliance
and hard work. As a result, China is now able to feed 22 percent
of the world's population on about seven percent of the world's
cultivated land. Total grain output in 1995 rose by more than
three times over the 1949 figure, or an average increase of 3.1
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
China's significant achievements in developing grain production
have not only basically eradicated the problem of people not
having enough to eat and wear and gradually raised the living
standards of the Chinese people, but also made great contributions
to the worldwide efforts to eliminate starvation and poverty, the
white paper says.

<TEXT>
<P>
The white paper notes that the tasks ahead for the Chinese
government are, while ensuring a continued increase in grain
output, to vigorously promote diversified food production,
readjust the food structure, and continue to raise the people's
quality of life from the stage of simply having enough food and
clothing to leading a relatively well-off and comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
However, it says, the Chinese government is aware that the
level of balance between the supply of and demand for grain in the
country will have to be further enhanced, and the tense situation
between supply and demand will continue to exist for a long time
to come.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says, in the years to come a scientific and
moderate food consumption pattern which keeps pace with the
national economic growth and conforms to the situation of the
nation's agricultural resources should be brought into being among
both the urban and rural residents. The Chinese government will
strive to avoid a rapid increase in grain demand beyond the supply
capacity through guided grain consumption and tapping the
grain-producing potential as well as the potential of non-grain
food production.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the "China Dietary Pattern Reform and
Development Program in the 1990s" and the dietary habits of the
Chinese people, a food consumption pattern featuring medium
calories, high protein and low fat will be gradually brought into
being among both urban and rural residents. On the basis of
retaining the traditional food structure, food of animal origin
will be added to a proper extent to improve the food quality. This
gradual change in the food consumption pattern will cause the
staple food consumption to decrease while the supply of grain used
for feed will gradually increase.
</P>
<P>
Based on this assumption and by making unswerving efforts in
grain production, China's per capita share of grain is estimated
to reach approximately 400 kg by the year 2030, despite the fact
that the population will reach a new peak. Over half of the 400 kg
will be used for staple foodstuffs, while the rest will be used
for producing food of animal origin so as to satisfy the need to
improve the living standard and nutritional level of the people.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that in the light of the above trend of
change in consumption pattern and the estimated population growth,
China's demand for grain in the next few decades is projected as
follows: By 2000 the population will reach some 1.3 billion and
the total demand for grain will be 500 million tons, based on 385
kg per person; by 2010 the population will approach 1.4 billion
and the total demand for grain will be 550 million tons, based on
390 kg per person; and by 2030 the population will peak at 1.6
billion and the total demand for grain will be approximately 640
million tons, based on 400 kg per person.

<TEXT>
<P>
The basic principle for solving the problem of grain supply and
demand in China is to rely on the domestic resources and basically
achieve self-sufficiency in grain, the white paper says. China
endeavors to increase its grain production so that its
self-sufficiency rate of grain under normal conditions will be
above 95 percent and the net import rate five percent, or even
less, of the total consumption quantity.
</P>
<P>
China has basically achieved self-sufficiency in grain at the
present stage, and there are many favorable objective factors for
it to maintain such achievement by her own efforts in the course
of future development: Natural agricultural resources, production
conditions, technical level and some other conditions ensure great
potential in this respect, the white paper adds.
</P>
<P>
There are potentials for China to increase the per-unit area
yield on the existing cultivated land and exploiting untouched
arable land resources by relying on scientific and technological
progress and exploiting non-grain food resources.
</P>
<P>
The white paper points out that the Chinese government has
determined to even increase the grain supply to meet the demand
through increasing grain production, and is confident of its
ability to lead the people throughout the country to achieve this
goal. But, at the same time, it also knows clearly that this is not
an easy task.
</P>
<P>
In a word, facing difficulties squarely, the Chinese government
will continue to strictly carry out the basic national policy of
protecting cultivated land and ecological environment in its
economic distribution and its work guidance and implement the two
major strategies: developing agriculture by relying on science,
technology and education in the countryside, and realizing
sustainable development. Thus it expects to promote a fundamental
change in the agricultural economic system and the method of
increasing agricultural production, so as to facilitate the steady
increase of the overall grain production capability.

<P>
While standing for the resolution of balance between the supply
of and demand for grain at home, China will not refuse to use
international resources as a necessary complement. This will,
however, only play the role of regulation in varieties, in case of
crop failures and to support poor regions. To import too much
grain would have an unfavorable impact on grain production at home
as well as on the employment of the rural work force. China's
striving for relying mainly on her own efforts to solve the grain
problem will serve only to improve the stability of the world
grain market and strengthen the stabilizing factor of the
international grain trade.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that a series of measures will be adopted
in protecting cultivated land resources, increasing agricultural
input, and improving water conservancy facilities and the
standards of agricultural equipment so as to increase China's
comprehensive grain production ability. Only in this way can it
fulfill the task of increasing grain output.
</P>
<P>
In this case, the structure of national income and capital
distribution of society will be gradually adjusted. Priority
should be given to agriculture, especially grain production, in
terms of planning and capital input, and a higher percentage of
the fixed assets investment, state budgeted funds and bank loans
will go to agriculture so as to increase the total agricultural
input.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will continue to adopt a series of
policies and measures for raising the efficiency of agricultural
input so as to promote enthusiasm for increasing input in grain
production on the part of rural collective economy organizations
and households. With the promise of due benefits to investors, the
government should extend loans to large industrial and commercial
enterprises which engage in agricultural development. The scale of
using foreign investment for agriculture should be expanded, and
preferential treatment provided for such investment, especially in
grain production.

<P>
The white paper says that to change the grain increase method
we must first carry out reform, optimize the industrial structure
and farming system, stress scientific management, enhance the
level of intensive farming in grain production and raise the
utilization rate of agricultural resources. The most important
thing is to rely on progress in science and technology, step up
efforts to develop grain production by relying on science,
technology and education and concentrate on high yields, high
quality, high efficiency and low consumption.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has defined and put into practice the
strategy of developing agriculture by relying on science,
technology and education. It will adopt a series of measures to
enable science and technology to play a greater role in increased
grain production. These measures include speeding up the
implementation of the "Seed Project", quickening the transfer of
existing scientific and technological achievements into
productivity, and the scientific research and importation of key
technologies concerning grain production, reinforcing vocational
training among the farmers, deepening reform of the system for
agricultural science-technology and education, making efforts to
raise the utilization rate of resources and reduce the loss of
grain.
</P>
<P>
China has always attached great importance to the all-round
development and utilization of mountain areas, water surfaces,
grasslands and other resources to increase the output of various
foodstuffs. From now on, China will continue to adhere to the
principle of "never slackening grain production and actively
developing a diversified economy," make full use of various
resources and increase the supply of meat, eggs, milk products,
aquatic products, vegetables and fruit. Meanwhile, China should
pay attention to the protection of agricultural resources and the
improvement of the ecological environment to achieve the
sustainable development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that to realize the sustained and stable
growth of grain production and produce diversified foodstuffs
China must handle well the relationships among population,
resources and environment, strengthen the management of
agricultural resources and protect the ecological environment.

Foreign Minister Davorin Krakum and Hungarian Foreign Minister
Kovacs Laszlo about how to strengthen trilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Slovenia and Hungary would be among the first
group of countries to be taken in by the EU and NATO and that the
grouping formed by their three countries would be the only bridge
linking the economic and military blocs to central and eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The three top diplomats also agreed to build a highway linking
the Italian port city Trieste, the Slovenian capital Ljubljana,
the Hungarian capital Budapest and the Ukrainian capital Kiev.
The road is seen as being of vital strategic importance to the
region.

<HEADLINE> White Paper: Grain Issue in China (Summary) (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Therefore, China will continue to promote agricultural
construction in an ecologically friendly way, start large-scale
water and soil conservation, control soil erosion in small river
valleys in a comprehensive way, prevent desertification and
grassland deterioration, and strive to increase the coverage rate
of forests. In the course of industrialization and urbanization
China will continue to protect and improve the natural environment
for agriculture. In this respect, it will focus on controlling
environmental pollution brought about by industrial development,
and popularize suitable technologies to help prevent and control
industrial pollution. It will actively develop new sources of
rural energy, try to slow down the destruction of vegetation and
deterioration of soil quality caused by the energy shortage in
rural areas. It will speed up the construction of hydropower
facilities, reduce the proportion of coal in the energy structure,
and combat the negative influences of acid rain and global warming.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade or so, the white paper says, profound
changes have occurred in China's grain production and circulation
system, as well as in the government's regulation and control
methods of grain supply and demand and price fluctuation. The
Chinese government will work hard to consolidate and perfect the
existing achievements, and will deepen the restructuring of the
agricultural economy in accordance with the requirements for the
building of a socialist market economy system.
</P>
<P>
The main content of the policy is to make the rural basic
management systems stable for a long period of time and improve
them continuously; to further reform and perfect the grain
circulation system; to guide consumption and reduce waste; and to
strengthen the regulation and control of grain markets.
</P>
<P>
The white paper notes that making timely and appropriate
use of the international grain market and regulating the
relationship between the domestic grain supply and demand through
import and export trade are also necessary for stabilizing grain
markets. In recent years the grain prices on the domestic market
have been approaching step by step those on the international
market. To protect the farmers' basic interests the Chinese
government will adopt the policy of imposing tariffs on imported
grain according to the common international practice.
</P>
<P>
The white paper notes that practice will prove to the world
that the Chinese people can not only feed themselves but also make
their quality of life better and better year by year. Instead of
forming a threat to the world's grain supply, China will make
still greater contributions to it, the white paper says.

<HEADLINE> Two killed in Argentine Boeing Jet Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buenos Aires, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Two crew members were
killed and another six injured when an Argentine air force Boeing
707 broke up and caught fire during an emergency landing at Buenos
Aires International Airport Wednesday, officials reported.
</P>
<P>
The military cargo jet, which had left a military base in
Santiago, Chile, earlier in the day, had asked for an emergency
landing after reporting technical difficulties, airport
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the craft was attempting to land on one of the
runways when it suddenly dropped and hit the ground at about 2:30
p.m. local time (1730 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The jet then broke up and caught fire, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The eight crew members, who were thrown from the front section
of the plane, were all alive when rescuers found them.
</P>
<P>
Six were taken to hospital in the Buenos Aires suburb of Ezeiza
with serious burns, but one died shortly after arrival. Another
crew member was pronounced dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
"Three of the injured are in a serious condition, while two
others are conscious but have severe injuries such as fractures
and abdominal injuries," said Carlos Sisko, a doctor at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
The crash was the second Boeing 707 accident in a day. In
Ecuador, a U.S. Boeing 707 cargo plane crashed into
densely-populated houses in the port of Manta on Tuesday night,
killing the three crew members and at least 27 people on the
ground and injuring as many as 80.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Opposition Parties Eye Merger for Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of two opposition
parties in the Philippines have started merger talks that will
lead to the fielding of a single ticket in the 1998 presidential
elections, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Laban Ng Demokratikong Pilipino (Laban),
the biggest opposition party in the country, had agreed to merge
with the Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC) to boost the
opposition's chances of getting the presidency in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Laban and NPC leaders also reportedly hope to bring in the
Liberal Party, the People's Reform Party and other opposition
parties into a single opposition umbrella in preparations for the
elections one year and eight months away.
</P>
<P>
Senator Ernesto Herrera of the Laban said the Laban and the NPC
would create a joint committee in three weeks to thresh out
details of the proposed merger, including leadership of the new
party and rules on the selection of the common presidential ticket
for the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
The Laban and the NPC had already been in alliance in the
senate and the House of Representatives. In October last year,
leaders of the two parties joined hands in ousting Senate
President Neptali Gonzales and installing NPC Secretary General
Ernesto Maceda instead.

<HEADLINE> Chamorro Urges People to Accept Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro today urged Nicaraguans to accept the results
of Sunday's general elections and remain calm.
</P>
<P>
"I am asking you to maintain calm and civility as we await the
final results, which will be announced by the Supreme Electoral
Council (CSE) as soon as possible," said the president in a radio
address to the nation this morning.
</P>
<P>
"We should accept the results of this election which has united
us all around this great civic celebration that we have just
completed," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chamorro also praised the civic spirit of the people during the
democratic process.
</P>
<P>
"We must all have confidence in the election results," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguans cast their ballots Sunday to choose a president, a
national assembly, town councils and the representatives to the
Central American Parliament. The election was carried out
peacefully without incidents.
</P>
<P>
With 73.2 percent of ballots counted, preliminary results
showed Arnoldo Aleman, the Liberal Alliance presidential candidate
and a former Managua mayor, won 48.85 percent of the votes and
maintained a 10.21 percent advantage over Daniel Ortega, of the
Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN).
</P>
<P>
Under Nicaragua's electoral law, the candidate who receives
more than 45 percent of the votes can be declared the winner but a
second round of voting must be held if none of the candidates
passed the 45 percent mark.
</P>
<P>
The final results are expected Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Aleman and Ortega, the candidates of the two major political
forces in the country, have pledged to respect and accept the
decisions of the CSE once it has completed its revision and the
counting of the votes according to the electoral law, Chamorro
said.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan president will hand over the reins of power to
the winner of the elections on January 10, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the FSLN has denounced a series of "serious
irregularities" in the vote and demanded a full-scale revision of
the results.
</P>
<P>
Ortega, the former president, alleged Monday that telegrams
used to report provincial results to the CSE were "altered" and
did not reflect the number of votes his party obtained.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, one of the international
observers monitoring the elections, said the CSE had promised to
provide copies of the telegrams to those political parties to
enable them to double-check the results. International observers
described the elections as "fair."

<HEADLINE> China Solves Problems of Wears and Food, White Paper (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
State Council issued a white paper here today saying that over the
past four decades, China's significant achievements in developing
grain production have not only basically eradicated the problem of
people not having enough to eat and wear and gradually raised the
living standards of the Chinese people, but also made great
contributions to the worldwide efforts to eliminate starvation and
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The "White Paper: the Grain Issue in China" published by the
Information Office of the State Council says that the
semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China before Liberation in 1949
was perennially haunted by the specter of starvation. For long
periods of time in the old days 80 percent of the population
suffered from starvation or semi-starvation because of the extreme
backwardness of agricultural production. Natural disasters nearly
always resulted in widespread deaths from starvation. In 1949
when the People's Republic of China was founded, the national
grain yield per hectare was only 1,035 kg, and the per capita
share of grain was only 210 kg a year.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic, the feudal
ownership of land was abolished. Under the leadership of their
government, the Chinese people devoted themselves to developing
grain production through self-reliance and hard work. As a result,
China is now able to feed 22 percent of the world's population on
about seven percent of the world's cultivated land. Total grain
output in 1995 increased by more than three times over that of
1949, or an annual average increase of 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present, China ranks first in total grain output in the
world, with the per capita share of grain reaching approximately
380 kg (including legume and tuber crops), which is the global
average. The per capita output of meat, aquatic products, eggs,
fruits and vegetables has reached 41 kg, 21 kg, 14 kg, 35 kg and
198 kg, respectively, which are all higher than the world's
average. Statistics from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization
show that China contributed 31 percent to the world's increased
grain output in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The white paper roughly divides the development of grain
production since the founding of New China into three phases:
</P>
<P>
The first phase (1950-1978): China's total grain output
increased from 113.2 million tons in 1949 to 304.8 million tons in
1978, an average annual growth of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The second phase (1979-1984): In 1984 China's total grain
output rose to 407.3 million tons, increasing by an average of 4.9
percent a year during the six years from 1979 to 1984. This second
phase saw the highest increase rate in the country's grain
production.
</P>
<P>
The third phase (1985-1995): In 1995 the country's grain
output totaled 466.6 million tons, increasing by an average of 1.2
percent a year during 11 years. Despite a lowered increase rate of
grain production, the quality of people's life was greatly
improved because of increased non-grain food supply during this
period, with the output of meat (pork, beef and mutton), aquatic
products, eggs, milk and fruit increasing by 1.8, 3.1, 2.9, 1.6
and 3.3 times over the figures of 1984.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that the tasks ahead for the Chinese
government are, while ensuring a continued increase in grain
output, to vigorously promote diversified food production,
readjust the food structure, and continue to improve the people's
quality of life from the stage of simply having enough food and
clothing to leading a relatively well-off and comfortable life.

<HEADLINE> China to Need 640 Million Tons of Grain by 2030, White Paper (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has, in
its report published today, predicted that China's grain
consumption will reach 500 million tons by 2000 and about 640
million tons by 2030.
</P>
<P>
The "White Paper: Grain Issue in China", published by the
Information Office of the State Council, predicts that by 2000 the
population will reach 1.3 billion and the total demand for grain
will be 500 million tons, based on 385 kg per person; by 2010 the
population will approach 1.4 billion and the total demand for
grain will be 550 million tons, based on 390 kg per person; and by
2030 the population will peak at 1.6 billion and the total demand
for grain will be approximately 640 million tons, based on 400 kg
per person.
</P>
<P>
The figures have been estimated in the light of the above trend
of change in consumption pattern and the estimated population
growth.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that in the years to come a scientific and
moderate food consumption pattern which keeps pace with the
national economic growth and conforms to the situation of the
nation's agricultural resources should be brought into being among
both the urban and rural residents. The Chinese government will
strive to avoid a rapid increase in grain demand beyond the supply
capacity through guided grain consumption and tapping the
grain-producing potential as well as the potential of non-grain
food production.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that since 1984, though the per capita
share of grain has been relatively stable, the nutritional status
of the Chinese people has markedly improved because of the
increased supply of food of animal origin. Food supply per person
per day in terms of calories reaches 2,727 kilocalories, including
those from 70 grams of protein and 52 grams of fat. This figure is
higher than the figures for those other countries with per capita
GNP comparable to China's. Therefore, it can be said that the food
supply in China has basically reached the average world level.

<HEADLINE> Juvenile Delinquency Looms Large </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Juvenile delinquency is
alarmingly on the rise in Germany and criminal offenders are
becoming younger and younger, the Allgemeiner Deutscher
Nachrichtendienst news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The number of criminals below the age of 14 increased by 14
percent in 1995 compared with the year before, the news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of youth criminals in the east is higher than
in the west. Young offenders accounted for one fourth of the total
criminals in the west while it is one third in the east.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are especially concerned about the fact that
more children under 14 were involved in crimes. Last year, the
number of juvenile delinquency in the state of Sachsen went up by
25 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
There was also a remarkable increase in violent crimes
committed by youngsters in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Mecklenburg-Vopommern, more than half of the violent crimes
were committed by young people. In certain cities of the state,
the proportion was as high as 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists believe that the rapid increase in juvenile
delinquency is due to the fact that young people are losing hope
for the future as they are increasingly facing the pressure of
unemployment.

<HEADLINE> China to Need 640 Million Tons of Grain by 2030: White Paper (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The white paper says that in accordance with the "China Dietary
Pattern Reform and Development Program in the 1990s" and the
dietary habits of the Chinese people, a food consumption pattern
featuring medium calories, high protein and low fat will be
gradually brought into being among both urban and rural
residents. On the basis of retaining the traditional food
structure, food of animal origin will be added to a proper extent
to improve the food quality.
</P>
<P>
China's per capita share of grain is estimated to reach
approximately 400 kg by 2030, despite the fact that the population
will reach a new peak. Over half of the 400 kg will be used for
staple foodstuffs, while the rest will be used for producing food
of animal origin so as to satisfy the need to improve the living
standard and the nutritional level of the people.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that the Chinese government believes that
the above-mentioned food consumption pattern is likely to be
realized for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
First, China has great potential for developing diversified
food production, though the per capita grain share will not be
increased by a big margin. Non-staple food will play an
increasingly greater role in substituting for staple food as the
supply of meat, eggs, aquatic products, fruit and vegetables
increases.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the rapidly increasing demand for commercial grain
used for feed can be slowed down through promoting scientific and
technological advances in aquatic farming, enhancing the feed
efficiency and increasing the proportion of grain-saving products
like herbivorous livestock and poultry and aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Finally, China today is at a period of low increase in food
consumption. The experiences of many other countries prove that
food consumption tends to be stable after having reached a certain
level.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the white paper says, the proportion of people's
increased incomes spent on housing and transportation will
increase along with the implementation of medical, housing and
other social security reforms. At the same time, the proportion of
food expenses in the total consumption expenses of the people will
decrease gradually and the increase of food consumption will be
behind the income increase.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Panama's ports and airports
have been put on alert for three foreign fugitives who took part
in a bank robbery on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The national police say the three -- a Venezuelan, a Colombian
and a Costa Rican -- have about 250,000 U.S. dollars on them and
must not be allowed to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
They are alleged to have been part of a gang of 13 men who
broke into the Banco del Istmo in Panama and stole more than

</P>
<P>
Police arrested 10 of the robbers including seven Colombians,
two Venezuelans and a Panamanian and confiscated 350,000 dollars.
But the other three fled with about 250,000 dollars, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
According to police, the group had prepared for the heist for
five months and had managed to break into the bank without being
filmed by security cameras.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian authorities are now investigating the possible
connection between those involved in the bank robbery and a group

<HEADLINE> China Able to Achieve Grain Self-Sufficiency, Says White Paper (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government pledges
today that China will endeavor to increase its grain production so
that its self-sufficiency rate of grain under normal conditions
will be above 95 percent and the net import rate five percent, or
even less, of the total consumption quantity.
</P>
<P>
The "White Paper: Grain Issue in China", published by the
Information Office of the State Council, points out that the basic
principle for solving the problem of grain supply and demand in
China is to rely on the domestic resources and basically achieve
self-sufficiency in grain.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that China has basically achieved
self-sufficiency in grain at the present stage, and there are many
favorable objective factors for the country to maintain such
achievement by its own efforts in the course of future
development. Natural agricultural resources, production
conditions, technical level and some other conditions ensure great
potential in this respect.
</P>
<P>
There is potential for increasing the yield per unit area on
the existing cultivated land. Given a relatively stable sown area,
China can achieve its desired total grain output target if the
annual average increase rate of per unit area yield is one percent
from 1996 to 2010 and 0.7 percent from 2011 to 2030. Compared with
the annual average increase rate of 3.1 percent of the per unit
area yield in the past 46 years, it is clear that one percent and
0.7 percent are fairly low. So, to achieve the target is totally
possible even if the factor of diminishing land returns rate is
considered.
</P>
<P>
There is also potential for exploiting untouched arable land
resources, the white paper says. China now has 35 million
hectares of wasteland which is suitable for farming. Of this,
about 14.7 million ha can be reclaimed. The Chinese government
plans, in the next few decades, to reclaim more than 300,000 ha
each year to make up for the loss of cultivated land appropriated
for non-farming uses and to keep the area of cultivated land
constant for a long period of time. The grain-sown area will be
stabilized at about 110 million ha through the increase of the
multiple crop index.
</P>
<P>
There is scope for scientific and technological improvement. At
present, the contribution made by science and technology to
agriculture accounts for about 35 percent of the agricultural
production increase. The Chinese government has drawn up a
strategy for agricultural development by relying on science,
technology and education. The contribution rate of science and
technology to agriculture will be increased to 50 percent by 2000,
and over 60 percent by 2030, which will be close to that of the
advanced countries.

<HEADLINE> China Able to Achieve Grain Self-Sufficiency, Says White Paper (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Non-grain food resources can be exploited also, the white paper
says. China has rich water, grassland and sloping land resources
which have great potential for exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Grain losses can be curtailed. According to estimates by
experts, the loss rate of grain is at least 10 percent in the
course of planting, harvesting, transportation, storage, selling,
processing and consumption -- a total of well over 45 million
tons. So it will be possible to save at least 20 million tons of
grain every year if such losses are reduced to within the rational
limits.
</P>
<P>
The white paper points out that the Chinese government has
determined to even up the grain supply to meet the demand through
increasing grain production, and is confident of its ability to
lead the people throughout the country to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will continue to strictly carry out the
basic policy of protecting cultivated land and ecological
environment in its economic distribution and its work guidance and
implement the two major strategies: developing agriculture by
relying on science, technology and education in the countryside,
and realizing sustainable development. Thus it expects to promote
a fundamental change in the agricultural economic system and the
method of increasing agricultural production, so as to facilitate
the steady increase of the overall grain production capability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the white paper points out that while standing for
the resolution of balance between the supply of and demand for
grain at home, China will not refuse to use international
resources as a necessary complement. This will, however, only play
the role of regulation in varieties, in case of crop failures and
to support poor regions.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that China has never relied on the
international grain market too much. From the founding of New
China to the eve of the 1960s China was a net exporter of
grain. After that it began to import more than it exported. Since
the reform and opening polices were introduced at the end of the
1970s the net import percentage in domestic grain production has
been on the decrease. It was 3.2 percent from 1978 to 1984, 1.2
percent from 1985 to 1990 and 0.4 percent from 1991 to
1995. Therefore, the small quantity of grain imported by China
will not imperil the stability of the international grain
market. There is no basis to the international clamor about a
"China threat in food supply," the white paper says.
</P>
<P>
It is true that China imports some grain, but at the same time
it also exports some foodstuffs with a fairly high added value. From
1985 to 1995 the export value of foodstuffs and edible animals and
poultry was US$ 75.6 billion, while the import value was US$ 34
billion, so China was a net food-exporting country. China is
willing to establish comparatively stable trade relations in grain
with the grain-exporting countries on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Curb Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Panama is to crack down on
money laundering by stepping up control over all financial
transactions over 10,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ricardo Alberto Arias said today that the
government is implementing measures needed to combat drug
trafficking in the free zone of Colon, some 76 kilometers west of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton's drugs supremo General Barry
McCaffrey estimated during his recent visit to Panama that
billions of dollars were being laundered every year in the free
zone through postal orders and cheques sent from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Under a presidential decree, all payments, charges, deposits or
withdrawals in cash over the amount of 10,000 dollars must be
reported to the Financial Analysis Unit (FAU).
</P>
<P>
Companies will also have to verify at the end of each working
week if several individual operations -- close to or below the sum
of 10,000 dollars and which add up to that amount -- are drug
related.
</P>
<P>
Companies operating in the free trade and export manufacturing
zones must send a report of their monthly operations to the FAU
within the first five days of each following month.

<HEADLINE> China Strives to Increase Grain Production, Says White Paper (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt a series of
measures to protect cultivated land resources, increase
agricultural input, and improve water conservancy facilities and
the standard of agricultural equipment so as to increase China's
comprehensive grain production ability.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can China fulfill the task of increasing
grain output," says the white paper entitled "The Grain Issue in
China", released by the Information Office of the State Council
today.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says it is always the foundation for increased
grain production to protect cultivated land. Over the years, the
white paper says, certain laws and regulations have been worked
out and perfected, including the Agriculture Law, Land Management
Law and Water and Soil Conservation Law. This has helped alleviate
the trend of rapid reduction of cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
However, there will be a growing demand for land for economic
construction following the speeding up of industrialization in the
future. In view of this, the white paper says, the government
will, in light of the principle of "economization on land use and
little or no occupation of cultivated land", adopt still more
effective measures to ensure the dynamic equilibrium of the total
cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, China has built 84,000 reservoirs
to improve production conditions since the founding of New China.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the country has also improved 20 million ha of areas
liable to water logging. The irrigated area has increased to the
present 49.33 million ha from 16 million ha in the early 1950s,
and the water supply capability has reached 500 billion cubic
meters, which has greatly strengthened the ability of agriculture
to withstand natural calamities.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that the Chinese government will continue
to work hard to build a group of large and medium-sized water
control projects to solve the problem of unbalanced distribution
of water resources in different regions and seasons.
</P>
<P>
China will undertake agricultural capital construction on an
extensive scale so as to increase the area with stable yields
despite drought or excessive rain to more than 40 million ha in
2030 from the present 33 million ha. The per unit area yield of
more than 20 million ha of the 2030 figure will reach 15 tons per
ha. The use of water-saving irrigation methods and dry land
farming are encouraged.

<TEXT>
<P>
Also by 2030, the area irrigated by water-saving irrigation
methods will be increased to more than 40 million ha from the
present 13 million ha and the effective utilization rate of
irrigation water will be increased to more than 60 percent from
the present 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the effective utilization rate of natural
precipitation will be raised to over 30 percent. At the same time,
the improvement of medium- and low-yield fields should be speeded
up. China plans to upgrade 60 million ha of such fields by 2030.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, China's agro-industry has
developed by leaps and bounds, playing an important role in
ensuring increased grain production since the founding of New
China. The total output of chemical fertilizers has increased to
the present 24.5 million tons from 39,000 tons in the early 1950s,
and the amount used has increased to 35.7 million tons from 79,000
tons, averaging 375 kg per hectare of cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the white paper says, agricultural machinery power
has increased to 360.7 billion watts from 1.21 billion watts. The
number of large and medium-sized tractors has increased to 670,000
from 1,300 and that of agricultural trucks to 800,000 from 4,000.
Nowadays in the rural areas 162.8 billion kwh of electricity is
used per year, while in the early 1950s the figure was only 50
million kwh.
</P>
<P>
As a whole, however, the agro-industry today is still unable to
meet the needs of sustained agricultural development. For this
reason, China will continue to make great efforts to expand its
chemical fertilizer production and raise the self-sufficiency rate
of chemical fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
By 2000 China will be basically self-sufficient in nitrogenous
fertilizer. At the same time, the production of farm chemicals,
plastic sheets, agricultural machinery and electrical power and
diesel oil will be developed rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says China will gradually adjust the structure
of national income and distribution of social funds. Priority
should be given to agriculture, especially grain production, in
terms of planning and capital input, and a higher percentage of
the fixed assets investment, state budgeted funds and bank loans
will go to agriculture so as to increase the total agricultural
input.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, agricultural investment in the budget for the capital
construction plan of the central government will increase to more
than 20 percent from the present 17 percent. The proportion of
agricultural loans should exceed 10 percent of the total bank
loans and credit cooperatives should increase the proportion of
their agricultural loans, the white paper says.

<HEADLINE> China to Change Grain Increase Method, Says White Paper (8) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China will push forward the strategy of developing agriculture
by relying on science, technology and education so as to let
science and technology play a greater role in increased grain
production.
</P>
<P>
The "White Paper: Grain Issue in China", published today by the
Information Office of the State Council, says that to change the
grain increase method, China must first carry out reform, optimize
the industrial structure and farming system, stress scientific
management, enhance the level of intensive farming in grain
production and raise the utilization rate of agricultural
resources. The most important thing is to rely on progress in
science and technology, stepping up efforts to develop grain
production by relying on science, technology and education and
concentrating on high yields, high quality, high efficiency and
low consumption.
</P>
<P>
The white paper recalls that since the birth of the People's
Republic, China has made over 30,000 major agricultural scientific
and technological achievements, of which over 6,000 have won
awards from the state or ministries, and some of them have reached
the international advanced level. The variety of the most
important grain crops has been renewed three to five times, each
time resulting in increased yields of 10 percent or more. In the
past decade the total area sown to hybrid rice has reached 160
million ha, with an increased output of 240 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that at present, the Chinese government
has chosen and put into practice the strategy of developing
agriculture by relying on science, technology and education. It
will adopt a series of measures to enable science and technology
to play a greater role in increased grain production.
</P>
<P>
-- Speeding up the implementation of the "Seed Project." China
will perfect the breeding, import, processing, marketing and
extension system of improved varieties. By the year 2000 seeds of
all main grain crops will be renewed; 50 percent of commodity
seeds will be coated; and the unified seed supply rate and the
coverage rate of improved varieties of rice, corn and wheat will
be raised.

JAKARTA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Both Indonesia and Colombia
wish to see economic cooperation further increase among the
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) member countries, Indonesian President
Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at a banquet in honor of Colombian President
Ernesto Samper Pizano and his wife Wednesday evening, Soeharto
said there was no conflict of interest between Indonesia, once the
NAM chairman, and Colombia, the current NAM chairman.
</P>
<P>
He told his guests, who arrived here earlier in the afternoon
for a two-day visit to Indonesia, that Colombia's position as NAM
chairman was a manifestation of Latin American countries' sense of
responsibility toward the struggle of the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Samper said his current visit to Indonesia
as the NAM chairman is of vital importance.
</P>
<P>
"The visit reaffirms that the principles set by the movement's
founders are still valid both in Jakarta and in Bogota, or in
other parts of the world," Samper said.
</P>
<P>
He added that NAM must continue maintaining its multilateral,
rather than unilateral, approaches, its solidarity rather than
intervention and its cooperation rather than confrontation.

<HEADLINE> China to Achieve Sustained Agricultural Growth, White Paper (10) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From now on, China will continue to adhere to the principle of
"never slackening grain production and actively developing a
diversified economy," make full use of various resources and
increase the supply of meat, eggs, milk products, aquatic
products, vegetables and fruit. Meanwhile China should pay
attention to the protection of agricultural resources and the
improvement of the ecological environment to realize a sustained
development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The "White Paper: Grain Issue in China", published today by the
Information Office of the State Council, points out that to
achieve its sustained agricultural development, China will adopt
measures as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Gradually setting up an animal husbandry production
structure conforming to the characteristics of China's
resources. Since the adoption of the policy of reform and opening
to the outside world, the production of grass-eating and
grain-saving animal foodstuffs has developed quickly. The
proportion of pork -- which consumes a fairly large amount of
grain -- in the total amount of meat fell from over 90 percent in
1978 to about 70 percent at present; and the proportions of beef,
mutton and fowl meat rose rapidly. By 2000, the proportions of
beef, mutton and fowl meat will increase by 10 percentage points
each. By 2000 China's total output of meat is expected to reach
58.5 million tons and that of eggs, 17.5 million tons. The amount
of meat per capita will be 45 kg and that of eggs will remain
approximately at the present per-capita level.
</P>
<P>
-- Quickening the development and utilization of shallow
offshore waters, beaches and inland waters. The Chinese government
will persist in the principle of "simultaneously developing
aquaculture, fishing and processing, with emphasis on
aquaculture," seek to expand the area for inland freshwater
aquaculture, further utilize shallow offshore waters and beaches
and develop deep-sea fishing. By 2000 the total output of aquatic
products will reach 32 million tons -- 25 kg per capita.
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing the supply of fruit, vegetables and arbor
foodstuffs. The Chinese government will take measures to develop
fruit production by using non-cultivated land, encourage peasants
to grow fruit trees and vegetables in front of and behind their
houses and develop a courtyard economy. China will produce, by
2000, 62 million tons of fruit, 48 kg per capita.

<HEADLINE> China to Deepen Agricultural Restructuring, Says White Paper (12) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Information Office of the State Council today published
"White Paper: Grain Issue in China", saying that the Chinese
government will deepen the restructuring of the agricultural
economy in accordance with the requirements for the building of a
socialist market economy system to create a sound policy
environment for grain production and circulation.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that China will make the rural basic
management systems stable for a long period of time and improve them
continuously. The household contract responsibility system with
remuneration linked to output and the two-layer management system
featuring the integration of centralization and decentralization
are the basic management systems the Chinese rural areas have
adopted since the initiation of the policy of reform and opening
to the outside world. As these systems have effectively promoted
the production of grain and other agricultural products, and
safeguarded the producers' own decision-making power in management
and their economic benefits, they have won the heartfelt support
of the broad masses of farmers.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that the Chinese government will continue
to encourage rural areas and small towns to develop secondary and
tertiary industries to speed up the absorption of the surplus
rural labor force, propel the localities, where possible, to
gradually implement operations of cultivated land on an
appropriate scale, further improve the economic benefits of grain
production and strengthen the motive force for grain production
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
-- Quickening the transfer of existing scientific and
technological achievements into productivity, and the scientific
research and importation of key technologies concerning grain
production. In the next few years China will concentrate on
spreading the following important agricultural techniques:
improved new varieties, paddy rice nurture in dry nursery and thin
planting by throwing rice seedlings, plastic mulching, precise and
semi-precise mechanical seeding, the integrated pest management,
scientific fertilization, water-saving irrigation, and dry land
farming.
</P>
<P>
-- Reinforcing vocational training among the farmers. China
will make full use of its existing 500-odd agricultural and
forestry polytechnical schools, more than 2,000 county-level
agricultural broadcasting and TV schools and grass-roots
agrotechnology popularization organs, and will carry out extensive
vacational training for farmers. The implementation of "Green
Certificate" project will enable ten million farmers to obtain
such certificates and large numbers of grain-growing experts will
emerge.
</P>
<P>
-- Deepening reform of the system for agricultural
science-technology and education. The state and local governments
will selectively support leading agricultural scientific research
and education institutions to foster a capable contingent of
scientists for important basic practical technology and new- and
hi-tech research. Some people engaged in scientific research and
education will be encouraged in an active way to go deep into the
countryside to spread technology and train farmers.
</P>
<P>
-- Efforts will also be made to raise the utilization rate of
resources and reduce the loss of grain. Concrete steps will be
taken as follows: operation of scale in an appropriate degree will
be carried out gradually and the intensification level of grain
production raised where possible. Technologies will be actively
popularized to lower grain production costs, reduce the waste of
materials and improve grain production efficiency.

<P>
The white paper points out, "to realize the sustained and
stable growth of grain production and produce diversified
foodstuffs, China must handle well the relationship among
population, resources and environment, strengthen the management
of agricultural resources and protect the ecological environment."
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that since the 1980s China has made great
efforts to develop ecological agriculture and has tried every
means to find a sustainable agricultural development mode that can
not only increase the output of grain and other farm produce, but
also help improve the ecological environment. In this period
there has been a comprehensive improvement of soil erosion on over
67 million ha of land in small river valleys, and more than 2,000
experimental ecological agriculture stations of various sizes have
been set up at the county, township and village levels.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has unfolded large-scale projects for water and
soil conservation throughout the country, and constructed a
shelter-forest network for farmland in the plains to control soil
erosion. Important shelter-forest and other ecological projects in
northeast, north and northwest China, on the middle and upper
reaches of the Yangtze River and in coastal areas have taken
shape. Pastoral areas have given up farming and restored animal
husbandry when artificial grasslands have been constructed to
prevent them from becoming deserts. All these measures have played
active roles in improving China's ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to promote agricultural development in an
ecologically friendly way, start large-scale water and soil
conservation projects, control soil erosion in small river valleys
in a comprehensive way, prevent desertification and grassland
deterioration, and strive to increase the coverage rate of
forests. In the course of industrialization and urbanization China
will continue to protect and improve the natural environment for
agriculture. In this respect, it will focus on controlling
environmental pollution brought about by industrial
development. It will actively develop new sources of rural energy,
try to slow down the destruction of vegetation and the
deterioration of soil quality caused by the shortage of energy in
rural areas. It will speed up the construction of hydropower
facilities, reduce the proportion of coal in the energy structure,
and combat the negative influences of acid rain and global warming
to grain production.

<TEXT>
<P>
The white paper says that China will further restructure and
perfect the grain circulation system. In accordance with the
requirements for a socialist market economy system, the Chinese
government will focus on continually propelling the reform of the
grain circulation system in the following three respects.
</P>
<P>
First, establishing a pricing mechanism as soon as possible,
whereby grain prices are primarily decided by the market; further
developing and improving the grain market system.
</P>
<P>
Second, China should speed up the separation of state-owned
grain departments' policy-related business from commercial
business, to strengthen state-owned grain circulation enterprises'
competitiveness in the market.
</P>
<P>
Third, China will quicken the fostering of intermediaries
linking the farmers with the market, and guiding and encouraging
them to join hands and participate in grain circulation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will adopt a series of policy-related
measures to promote the management of grain by the integration of
trade, industry and agriculture, and gradually set up a
high-efficiency agricultural system with grain as the base so as
to increase the comparative benefits of grain production and the
income of the farmers, and ensure the sustained, stable
development of grain production.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that to guide consumption and reduce
waste, the Chinese government will continue to conduct education
on treasuring and economizing on grain and formulate corresponding
policies to promote the formation of a new social tendency that
stresses thrift in grain and opposes waste and extravagance.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that the Chinese government will also
strengthen the regulation and control of grain markets. To protect
grain producers and stabilize grain markets the Chinese government
started in 1990 to set up the minimum grain price protection
system and the special grain reserve system. In 1994 a grain
market risk fund system at the central and provincial levels was
set up. Experience over the past few years has proved that these
systems have played positive roles. China will further perfect
these systems and reinforce the government's ability to regulate
grain markets.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that China will make timely and
appropriate use of the international grain market to regulate the
relationship between the domestic grain supply and demand. In
recent years the grain prices on the domestic market have been
approaching step by step those on the international market. To
protect the farmers' basic interests the Chinese government will
adopt the policy of imposing tariffs on imported grain according
to the usual international practice.

<HEADLINE> 25th Anniversary of China's UN Seat Marked in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The 25th anniversary of
the restoration of China's lawful seat in the United Nations was
marked here in New York today, with the presence of the U.N.
Secretary-General who made a complimentary speech to an audience
of hundreds.
</P>
<P>
On October 25, 1971, the 26th session of the U.N. General
Assembly passed a historic resolution, which ousted Taiwan and
accepted the People's Republic of China as the legitimate member
of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Chinese, waiting outside the U.N. headquarters and
shouting for China's seating, also saw the country having resumed
its seat as one of the five permanent members of the Security
Council at the end of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Peolpe's Republic of China has played a
growingly important role in the United Nations, which was
confirmed by the U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who
said china has made "immense contributions" to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"China's presence in the United Nations has added substantially
to its credibility and relevance as a truly universal
organization," Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun summarized China's functions and
contribution to the U.N. endeavor for peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that China adheres to the principles of respect for
national independence and sovereignty, peaceful settlement of
disputes and non-interference in others' internal affairs. It
upholds justice and strongly opposes hegemonism and power
politics.
</P>
<P>
China has endeavored to safeguard the interests of developing
countries and played a unique role in maintaining world peace and
in seeking a fair and reasonable settlement of regional conflicts,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also gave an account of China's role in
solution to disputes and conflicts of different regions in the
world, including the Iran-Iraq conflict, the question of Cambodia,
the Gulf crisis, and the Korean nuclear issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary-general confirmed China's understanding of
the unique and difficult role of the United Nations, which, he
said, is demonstrated by its long record of involvement and
support for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The celebration was also marked by a panel discussion on
China's role in the U.N., Sino-U.S. relations and the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the cautiousness China shows in the
United Nations, the Chinese ambassador explained that China did
act very cautiously, because "we believe we have great
responsibility in dealing with international issues, which might
be very complicated and call for great patience."
</P>
<P>
"China was against using the Security Council to exert pressure
and in favor of patient dialogue and negotiations," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Nsanze Terence, Permanent Representative of Burundi to the
U.N., said that cautiousness is not weakness, but a well-thought
attitude. Burundi was one of the 76 countries in favor of China's
restoration to the U.N. in 1971. Referring to Taiwan's attempt to
be presented in the U.N., Terence said there is no provision in
the U.N. Charter that allows one U.N. seat be shared by two
delegations.
</P>
<P>
China should have the equal opportunity to be presented at the
U.N. and the World Trade Organization, said Olara A. Otunnu,
President of International Peace Academy, who presided over
today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Some speakers also urged China and the United States to
improve their bilateral relations with more exchange of views at
higher levels.
</P>
<P>
Today's event was organized by a number of non-governmental
organizations, including the Foundation for U.S-China Relations
Inc., the U.S.-China Friendship Association and the Association
for the Reunification of China.

<HEADLINE> Gore Criticizes Dole Tax Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Referring to the 1980s
recession, Vice President Al Gore blamed Republicans on Wednesday
for past economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Gore told voters in the blue-collar town of Duluth, Minnesota,
that "supply-side Republicans created that catastrophe" of the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Gore credited Clinton's economic policies with reducing
Minnesota's unemployment rate, creating new jobs and raising
family income, according to Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Gore criticized Dole's proposed 15 percent tax cut, saying,
"They have proposed a risky scheme that would blow a hole in the
deficit and raise interest rates on mortgage payments for homes,
on car payments for automobiles, on everything that people pay
interest for."
</P>
<P>
Dole often tells voters that his tax plan is the right
prescription for a sluggish economy under Clinton, and that it
would put more money in the pockets of ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
Later, Gore stopped in Eagan, to promote Clinton's anti-crime
record.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times we get together in America and see a problem
that desperately needs to be solved and we rush to some solution
that doesn't really get the job done," said Gore, surrounded by
uniformed police officers.
</P>
<P>
"This time we managed to do something right," he said. "We
coupled punishment with prevention and effective community
policing, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill, three strikes
and you're out, an approach that is based upon the real life
experiences of police officers, police chiefs, sheriffs, the whole
law enforcement community."

<HEADLINE> World Conservation Congress Concludes in Montreal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTREAL, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest meeting of
conservation experts since the Rio Earth Summit concluded here
today, with commitments to tackle more vigorously with the globe's
environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
The congress, the first-time effort by the World Conservation
Union (IUCN) to make its triennial general assembly more
accessible to a wider audience, attracted more than 3,200
conservation scientists and practitioners, politicians and
business leaders from some 130 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
More than 55 workshops and hundreds of informal meetings were
held to look at issues such as economics and the environment, the
role of business in conservation, the impacts of climate change on
ecosystems and environmental security.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most energizing, exciting and useful meeting ever
held" in IUCN's 48-year-old history, said IUCN's outgoing
president Jay Hair.
</P>
<P>
"This is a working congress," added IUCN's Director General
David Mcdowell. The congress "generated many new approaches for
putting the ideals of Rio into action on the ground."
</P>
<P>
"The most innovative ideas can be grouped under 4 Ps:
partnerships, people, politics and the private sector," he noted.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing prior to the congress' end, IUCN announced
an agreement with UNESCO to cooperate on the designation of world
heritage sites as well as promote an alliance on environmental
education and awareness.
</P>
<P>
To better promote the world's conservation, a new Biodiversity
Information System involving nine of the world's leading
conservation networks will be set up, which would become world's
most comprehensive data bank on species and ecosystems, IUCN said.
</P>
<P>
IUCN also announced its cooperation with the United Nations
Environmental Program in establishing the most comprehensive
global environmental law information system as well as
coordinating actions on biodiversity and trade programs.
</P>
<P>
During the 11-day congress, IUCN also put emphasis on its
traditional role as the most authoritative global forum on the
status of the world's biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
In its 1996 Red List of Threatened Animals released before the
congress, IUCN warned that 25 percent of all mammals may now face
the threat of extinction.
</P>
<P>
"We were astonished to find that the reality was worse than we
had imagined," said IUCN's newly-elected president Yolanda
Kakabadse. "This is an indicator of the health of the world's
ecosystems, and consequently, of our own health," she noted.
</P>
<P>
The congress debated more than 120 resolutions, ranging from
global issues such as the World Trade Organization to protecting
local world heritage sites and action plans for particular
species.
</P>
<P>
These will provide the programmatic framework for the future
work of IUCN, which has emerged as the largest grouping of
conservation organizations in the world.

<HEADLINE> World Telecom Policy Forum Concludes in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from 128 countries
concluded here Wednesday a telecom policy forum with in-depth
exchange of views on how to implement a host of new satellite
systems which may provide seamless global communications with
pocket-sized terminals.
</P>
<P>
The three-day forum, the first such event organized by the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), focused on the policy
and regulatory issues which need to be addressed in order to
facilitate the introduction of the new systems which are
collectively called Global Mobile Personal Communications by
Satellite (GMPCS).
</P>
<P>
Unlike the communications satellites currently in operation,
these new GMPCS systems, most of them are scheduled to come into
operation within the next five years, will make use of a group of
non- geostationary satellites moving around the Earth in low or
medium orbit, transferring signals to earth stations or between
each other.
</P>
<P>
They could offer users a way to make phone calls, send fax
and even transfer multimedia data from and to anywhere in the
world, including remote areas or parts of the world with poor
fixed line telecommunications infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
However, the global coverage which can be provided by such
systems also raises a number of complex issues in the areas of
national sovereignty, service and equipment licensing and
interconnection with other carriers.
</P>
<P>
Particular concern was raised by developing countries whose
populations still have very limited access to the traditional
fixed line telephone services.
</P>
<P>
Josefina Lichaugo, Undersecretary for Communications of
Department of Transportation and Communications of the
Philippines, told a press conference that developing countries
"are caught in a dilemma" by the introduction of new telecom
technologies.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, she said, developing countries do not want to
be left behind in the rapid development of telecommunications. On
the other hand, the regulatory authorities in those countries are
not ready for such new and complex technologies as GMPCS.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking upon to ITU to ensure that the implementation of
GMPCS will narrow the ever-widen gap (between developed and
developing countries," Lichaugo said.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Parapak, Secretary-General of the Department of
Tourism, Posts and Telecommunications of Indonesia, who was
elected as chairman of the forum, also pointed out that many
concern was voiced by developing countries that they can not move
in GMPCS as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
"They still need time to study it, and introduce it to
policy-makers, and to the regulatory authorities in their
countries," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In a set of non-binding opinions adopted by the forum for
further consideration by governments in formulating their
policies, the participants stressed the need for respect of the
sovereign right of each country to regulate its
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
They also invited policy makers and regulators, GMPCS operators
and service providers to work cooperatively within the ITU to
facilitate the early introduction of GMPCS, subject to the
application of the relevant provisions of the radio regulations
and the particular requirements of each government.
</P>
<P>
GMPCS system operators and service providers are also urged to
take steps to ensure that their access and utilization charges are
set at a level that would make this service as widely utilized as
possible including in rural and remote areas in developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges for Cease-fire in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday asked its diplomats in Zaire and Rwanda to urge leaders
of the two countries to do everything possible to defuse current
political tension that has arisen because of fighting in eastern
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher sent urgent instructions
to those ambassadors this week as hundreds of thousands of Hutu
refugees were fleeing the refugee camps in eastern Zaire to escape
the fighting between the army troops and ethnic Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
"We've asked our ambassadors in Kinshasa and in Kigali, the
American ambassador in both Zaire and Rwanda, to appeal to them to
do everything possible to defuse the current political tension,"
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The United States directed its appeal in part to the government
of Zaire in Kinshasa in the hopes that it can control over the
various military forces that are involved in the fighting, Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
The hostilities have been intensifying since early September as
Zaire's government accused the Banyamulenge, ethnic Tutsis who
emigrated from Rwanda decades ago, of planning a revolution
against the government.
</P>
<P>
Zaire has also accused Rwanda and Burundi, which are headed by
Tutsis, of supplying weapons and other support to their ethnic
brethren there as a way to express their displeasure with
Kinshasa's refusal to shut refugee camp, where live approximately
1.1 million Rwandan refugees and 145,000 Burundian refugees, most
of whom are Tutus who fled their countries for fear of retribution
by Rwandan and Burundian Tutsis.

served to provide legal guarantees for the older people to enjoy
their old age.

people among their population, with each city surpassing one

<HEADLINE> FIFA Stress Ticket Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- One week after the Guatemala
stadium tragedy that left 79 people dead, FIFA sent letters on
Wednesday to all national football federations to stress that only
tickets corresponding to numbered seats could be sold.
</P>
<P>
On October 16, a World-Cup elimination match at the Mateo
Flores de Guatemala Stadium ended in disaster when fans were
crushed or asphixiated to death. It was said that there were
30,000 people over the capacity of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
FIFA also indicated that entry tickets should be printed in a
way that is difficult to forge and that the kick-off whistle
cannot be blown until order has been established in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
International football representatives will be meeting in
Barcelona on December 7 to decide whether to ask France to remove
their stadia barriers for the 1998 World Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
Barriers in Guatemala contributed to the high injury rate.
