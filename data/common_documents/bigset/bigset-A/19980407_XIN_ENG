<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Receives Warm Welcome in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- On his first tour to France as
premier of China, Zhu Rongji has been cordially received by his
hosts since his arrival on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
To honor the Chinese leader, French President Jacques Chirac
hosted a luncheon at the Elysee Presidential Palace on Monday.
</P>
<P>
When the moment came for the host and guest to say good-bye in
the palace courtyard, Chirac expressed his respect for the Chinese
leader by clasping his hands together in a traditional Chinese
gesture.
</P>
<P>
His eyes filled with emotion, Zhu waved his hand to the
president and to journalists covering the moving scene.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with some 400 delegates from the French
employers' association, Conseil National du Patronat Francaise, at
a brunch earlier in the morning, Zhu received lengthy applause
from the French entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question by a representative from the Alcatel
telecommunications group, Zhu recalled an incident as the mayor of
Shanghai when he joined in an effort to establish one of the first
joint-venture telecommunications company in China -- the Shanghai
Bell Company.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said jokingly that it was no time for him to negotiate for
new contracts with French companies, but that they could do it
later "under the table."
</P>
<P>
"If I did that, the British might accuse me of lacking
`transparency'," said Zhu to the amusement of his audience.
</P>
<P>
On his visit to the Rodin Museum on Sunday, Zhu praised his
guide, Jacqueline Samson, for her explanation of works by the
French artist August Rodin.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Samson was close to tears when Premier Zhu shook her hands
and gave her a gift.

PARIS -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji Monday called on French
enterprises to be more engaged in China, as the country is the
best for investment in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"I think China is the best place for investment in Asia. But
it is up to you to decide. Don't lose this opportunity," said
Zhu when addressing more than 200 heads of French enterprises
at a breakfast organized by France's national employers'
association CNPF.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that France played a very positive role at the ASEM
meeting held in London last week, because President Jacques Chirac
expressed deep sympathy and support to the Asian countries now
undergoing a financial crisis. (France-China-Zhu Rongji)

<HEADLINE> WHO Urges Africa to Pursue Health for All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Regional Director for Africa of
the World Health Organisation (WHO) Ebrahim Samba urged African
states to pursue health for all here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the opening of a three-day African Federation
for Technology in Health Care conference, Samba said "Health for
all by the year 2000" slogan should motivate African countries to
pursue the goal of providing health for all.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was need to set target dates to enable
governments' work towards their objectives with vigor.
</P>
<P>
WHO believed health for all in Africa could be achieved, said
Samba, not by governments alone, but through equal partnerships
with the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Samba said there was a general complaint of inappropriate
technology among most African states and health practitioners,
which needed to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, appropriate technology did not mean that the
continent wanted cheap technology to ensure health for all.
</P>
<P>
He said that lack of appropriate technology was also forcing
most people to go overseas in search for medical help.
</P>
<P>
The conference, being attended by more than 100 health experts
from 20 African and six European countries, seeks to implement
WHO 1994/95 resolutions on health on the continent and to find
new ways to improve health provision services through improved
technology.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps
said there is need for African countries to develop a health
procurement system that does not leave the continent open to
exploitation by foreign industries.
</P>
<P>
He said that a well managed system would ensure that Africa
procured not only durable but good, safe and appropriate
equipment for use in health institutions.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the limited number of hospital engineers
and inadequate preventive maintenance and maintenance skills
among the users of medical equipment also remained an area of
major concern on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He called for the harmonization of health ministries and the
medical technology industry to improve and ensure relevant
equipments necessary for the provision of basic and advanced
health care.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a health care equipment exhibition was organized by
FSG Wedimedia Ltd of the United Kingdom and USK International
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns Riga Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia Monday sharply denounced a
blast near the Russian Embassy in Riga, Latvia's capital,
describing the incident as "outrageous."
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off 35 meters from the Russian Embassy at 2300
GMT Sunday. Four cars were damaged, but there were no casualties,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The blast provided new grounds for even greater concern over
anti-Russian terrorist activities and rising nationalism and
extremism in the Baltic nation, said the Russian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"Explosions rock Latvia, monuments are vandalized, fascists are
raising their heads," the ministry said, adding that Russia is
"demanding that Latvian authorities take drastic measures to
punish the guilty."
</P>
<P>
Latvian Interior Minister Ziedonis Cevers said on television
that the bomb was a landmine, and that police were taking
additional security measures in the wake of this blast and another
that caused extensive damage to the Latvian capital's only
synagogue last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The explosions came against a backdrop of deteriorating
relations between Riga and Moscow, which are at odds over Latvia's
treatment of ethnic Russians living in the Baltic country.
</P>
<P>
In early March Latvian police forcefully disbanded a
Russian-speaking pensioners rally in Riga, which increased tension
in Russian-Latvian relations.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Play Fundamental Role in Emerging World Order: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said
here Monday that Pakistan is poised to "play a fundamental role in
the emerging world order."
</P>
<P>
Addressing civil and military officers at the National Defense
College, Sharif said that the world is developing towards
multipolarization with close and productive cooperation between
nations.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who deliberated on various crucial national and
international issues concerning Pakistan, said that he has again
held out the olive branch of meaningful dialogue to the newly
elected prime minister of India.
</P>
<P>
"We await a clear pledge of sincerity towards the peaceful
resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed the need to give thought to the
structural reforms of international institutions to enable them to
meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's relations with the Muslim world will continue to be
in the forefront of all Islamic causes, said Sharif. "Our goal
will remain not only to interact closely with all Muslim countries
but also to strengthen the unity and solidarity of the Islamic
community," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, Sharif said that so long as Afghanistan
continued to be ravaged by war, the enormous potential for
interaction with the resource-rich Central Asian republics will
never be realized, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif expressed the confidence that efforts by his government
to bring the warring factions in Afghanistan to the negotiating
table will succeed.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Stresses Importance of Missile Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan, as a sovereign state,
has the right to develop missiles which is of fundamental
relevance to its national security, a foreign office spokesman
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a crowded news conference, the spokesman confirmed
that Pakistan successfully carried out a test Monday on the
surface-to-surface Hatf-V (Ghauri) missile, which has a range of
1,500 kilometers and can carry a payload of 700 kilograms
"overland."
</P>
<P>
He said the test, using a missile developed with Pakistan's own
materials and technology, represented "a landmark" in the
country's missile and satellite launching program.
</P>
<P>
"Considering various developments in the region, especially
across the border, it is of fundamental importance to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the missile test would intensify an arms race in
the region, the spokesman said, "We do not want an arms race, but
we cannot compromise on matters of national security."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan was willing to strengthen peace in the region,
but developments surrounding them had forced them to take measures
to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ruling Party Chairman Exonerates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe African National Union
(Patriotic Front) Chairman Joseph Msika said Monday Parliament
Speaker Cyril Ndebele will not be tried by the party.
</P>
<P>
Msika told the Zimbabwe News Agency that Ndebele will not be
tried for advising that Masvingo Central MP Dzikamai Mavhaire
should be given parliamentary immunity for utterances made in the
house. Msika said that as Chairman of the Disciplinary Committee
he had the final say on whether or not Ndebele had a case to
answer.
</P>
<P>
The speaker was strongly rebuked by President Robert Mugabe
for advising that Mavhaire should not be answerable for his
"Mugabe must go" statements.
</P>
<P>
"The speaker has no case to answer. He may have made an
omission in his advice but that does not warrant him to be
tried," Msika said.
</P>
<P>
He said the contradiction coming from ZANU (PF) Secretary for
Administration Didymus Mutasa who is insisting that Ndebele must
be disciplined was immaterial.
</P>
<P>
"Mutasa is not the chairman of the party and he cannot say
anything final," said Musika.
</P>
<P>
He said that the party central committee meeting, which
suspended Mavhaire from holding any party position for two years,
had not decided on what to do with the speaker.
</P>
<P>
Regarding his utterances in the parliament, Nebele said that
he has no apologies to make for his advice as he was following
the correct provisions of the law.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Information, Posts and Telecommunications
Minister Chen Chimutengwende welcomed President Robert Mugabe's
declaration that he will step down if the party congress said so.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in a statement that Mugabe's remarks should
clarify the matter once and for all and shut up those calling for
him, who has been at the helm for the past 18 years, to step
down.
</P>
<P>
"It is ZANU (PF) congress which elected him to power and it
is, therefore, proper and democratic that the same congress
should be the only body that can change the position," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other individuals, political analysts, economists, leaders of
the labour movement and human rights activists have also called
on Mugabe (74 ) to resign, citing economic hardships which have
escalated since the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister attacked them, saying that they were
misguided to think that Zimbabwe had an economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> S. African Defense Force Chief Resigns Over False </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Monday accepted resignation by National Defense
Force (SANDF) Chief General Georg Meiring after a military
intelligence report he handed to Mandela was found fraudulant.
</P>
<P>
"President Mandela with regret decided to accede to the
request of Chief of the SANDF Georg Meiring to allow him to
retire early," Cabinet Secretary Jakes Gerwel was quoted by South
African Press Association (SAPA) as saying in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Gerwel said Mandela has described Meiring's decision as
appropriate and honorable.
</P>
<P>
He said Mandela would confer with his cabinet on Meiring's
successor.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Meiring announced his decision to resign,
saying it was related to a military intelligence report about a
plot to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
"I have, after due consideration of all the facts, decided
that it would be in the best interests of the SANDF if I would
ask the president to suspend my contract and allow me to retire
on early pension without prejudice," SAPA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Meiring said his decision to retire was not
acknowledgement that he had acted wrongly or with sinister
motives.
</P>
<P>
He said he was the individual responsible for addressing the
mistrust unleashed by the inaccurate report, which he handed
personally to Mandela on February 5.
</P>
<P>
The report, which claimed that a handful of senior African
National Congress (ANC) members were plotting a coup, has
triggered widespread controversy in the country since media
published parts of its content in late March.
</P>
<P>
It alleged that among others, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,
Mandela's ex-wife, SANDF Chief of Staff Siphiwe Nyanda and former
ANC member and now opposition United Democratic Movement
co-leader Bantu Holomisa were involved in the plot.
</P>
<P>
"My position of trust has been unsettled by the report, which
leaves me no choice but to come to this decision... My early
retirement therefore is an effort to restore the trust in... the
SANDF," Meiring said.
</P>
<P>
Should Mandela approve his request, his last day of service
would be May 31, Meiring said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a judicial commission appointed by Mandela found
that the handling of the report had been flawed and the report
had no substance. The government accused certain elements in the
military of trying to destabilize the country by launching a
disinformation.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Ruling Party Wins Appeal on Colors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Lesotho Congress
for Democracy (LCD) could continue to use its party colors, the
Lesotho Court of Appeal ruled Monday, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The appeal court overode a High Court ruling on February 25
that the LCD should not use the black, green and red colors,
which the opposition Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) argued were
similar to theirs.
</P>
<P>
On submission by the BCP that similarities in colors would
confuse supporters of the two parties, the LCD argued that at
elections, political parties did not display colors on flags but
only their party symbols, which must be registered only in black
and white in accordance with electoral laws.
</P>
<P>
The colors and flags of parties therefore played no importance
in influencing or directing people as to how to vote.
</P>
<P>
BCP deputy leader, Tshiliso Makhakhe said he upheld the
independence of the judiciary and accepted and respected the
decision of the appeal court. However, he said he was totally
"surprised" at the appeal court's order since the contested
colors are a mark of the BCP.
</P>
<P>
The LCD, led by Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle, broke away from
the then ruling BCP in June last year.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone: Trial of Junta Coupists Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The trial of the first batch of 21
suspected coupists of Sierra Leone's ousted military junta
continued Monday, with charges varying from treason, murder and
arson.
</P>
<P>
Those charged with treason and arson will face death penalty,
according to a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The trial began a week ago and those appeared before the court
included five civilians who acted as ministers and deputy
ministers under the former military regime.
</P>
<P>
Others included former junta spokesman, arms dealer, popular
broadcaster, and the former secretary of president Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
According to the attorney-general, many more will be charged
as the police investigations are completed and the results of the
investigations are made known.
</P>
<P>
There are close to 200 persons, both military and civilian,
who are under investigations and those who are not involved will
be released immediately, he said.
</P>
<P>
The military junta, which toppled the legitimate government of
Kabbah in a coup last May, was dislodged by the west African

<HEADLINE> Garang Reaffirms Separation of Religion, State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A Sudanese rebel leader has
reaffirmed his stand that religion should be separated from
state, asking the Khartoum government to accept this as a basic
reality and principle, the Kenya News Agency (KNA) reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
John Garang, Chairman of the Sudan People's Liberation
Movement (SPLM), was quoted as saying last weekend at Kenya-Sudan
border that religion was a matter of personal belief.
</P>
<P>
On self-determination for the people of southern Sudan, he
said that this was a fundamental human right which the people of
Sudan were entitled to.
</P>
<P>
Garang, also Chairman of the Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA), was speaking when he met a special delegation from the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
He commended President Daniel arap Moi's efforts in trying to
bring to an end the conflict in southern Sudan and President Moi
is the chairman of the IGAD Peace Initiative on Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The delegation which consists of representatives from Kenya,
Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea had visited Kenya, Sudan, Uganda,
Ethiopia and Eritrea before meeting with Garang.
</P>
<P>
The KNA report said that while meeting the SPLA/SPLM chairman,
IGAD peace delegation presented the Sudanese government with
proposals on ceasefire and the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting between the rebel movement and the Khartoum
government is expected to be held in Kenya's capital of Nairobi
later this month.
</P>
<P>
The previous peace talks failed to reach agreements due to the
contentious issue of separation of religion and state, and the
question of self-determination for the people of southern Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Ex-East Bloc States Said to Be Still Spying on West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Despite efforts to join the Western
military alliance NATO, former East Bloc countries, like Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic, are still spying on their would-be
allies, intelligence sources in Bonn confirmed Monday a report in
the news weekly Der Spiegal.
</P>
<P>
The news magazine reported that former East Bloc countries have
been trying to place agents at high levels in the NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are among the first wave
of Eastern European countries to be admitted into NATO. But in the
personnel proposed for their future NATO embassies, they had tried
to include many known spies, who however had been rejected by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
There are still close ties between intelligence agents from the
countries seeking NATO membership and Russian espionage
organizations, said Der Spiegal citing NATO security organs.
</P>
<P>
It added that officials in Brussels feared that Poland would
pass NATO secrets to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The magazine also quoted Peter Frisch, chief of Germany's
domestic intelligence service, as saying that of the three
countries, Poland in particular has not reduced its espionage
activities in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Poland has denied the charges and said it has already dismissed
600 of the 1,000 foreign intelligence agents during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the Spiegal report, the intelligence sources in Bonn
also said that there are at least hundreds of spies from the
ex-East Bloc countries working currently in Germany, with those
from Russia and Romania being the most active.
</P>
<P>
They said Russian agents focused their efforts on NATO and
defense information, and telecommunications and computer
technology as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Federico
Pena Monday announced his resignation, citing "personal and
family" reasons.
</P>
<P>
Pena, who served as transportation secretary in Clinton's first
term, submitted his letter of resignation to President Bill
Clinton Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Pena said he had decided to resign
because he wanted to spend more time with his family and to focus
more on his children.
</P>
<P>
"There is never a perfect time for a decision like this, but I
believe that after five-and-a-half years as a member of the
Clinton Cabinet, the time is now right" to depart, said Pena in a
memo sent to department employees.
</P>
<P>
Pena, 51, had planned to leave Washington at the end of
Clinton's first term. He reminded reporters Monday that he already
had put his Washington house up for sale when he was asked by the
president to head the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
Pena said he planned to depart on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1997, Pena, the former Denver mayor agreed to take
over the Energy Department, but has made it clear he likely would
not want to remain the full four years.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Power Generation Increases in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Nuclear electricity generation
rose by 9.6 percent in 1997 to provide over 60 percent of
Belgium's electricity, Foratom reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Generation records were also set in Finland, France, Germany,
Spain, Switzerland and Britain in the past year, according to
Foratom, or the European Atomic Forum that is the trade
association of the European nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
Foratom Secretary General Wolf Schmidt Kuster described the
past year as having witnessed nuclear energy continue to be the
largest single source of carbon-free electricity in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear electricity now accounts for over 30 percent of the
total generation in Europe and is believed to provide a
competitive and environmentally beneficial source of electricity
as the electricity market is deregulating in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drag triggered by the Asian economic slowdown, fuel
cycle companies in Europe still won large multi-year contracts
from foreign governments last year for clean-up work at former
military sites.
</P>
<P>
European technologies for nuclear waste management is set to be
a major growth sector for employment and profits in the future,
according to the Foratom report.
</P>
<P>
Foratom hailed nuclear electricity generation as an alternative
to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in that unlike thermal
power plants, nuclear power plants do not emit carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power plants are claimed to help offset greenhouse gas
emissions by 700 million tons each year, Foratom said.
</P>
<P>
But the Foratom report did not mention the danger a
Chernobyl-type nuclear power plant incident can cause to the
environment.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Welcomes Investigation Results Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Monday expressed welcome to the conclusion of the
Palestinian investigation, which said Israel was not responsible
for Hamas activist Muhi Sharif's death.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu received the report on the findings of the
investigation from Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat, who briefed the prime minister's attorney Yitzhak
Molcho Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The findings prove that this is an internal power struggle
inside Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement), Netanyahu told
reporters here. He said that the PNA is apprehending the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, leading Hamas bomb maker, was found killed on March 29
in an industrial zone in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
Palestinian security officials said that Sharif was shot to death
before he was moved to his car, which was detonated later.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that it confirmed Israel's previous statement
that it had no part in the affair, adding that "this is a positive
development."
</P>
<P>
He said that the findings show that "if PNA wants to, it can
fight terror."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nabil Shaath, Palestinian minister of planning and
international cooperation, told a news conference in Ramallah that
the investigation has shown conclusively that Hamas members had
killed Sharif in a power struggle.
</P>
<P>
He said that the investigators had identified the murderer,
the weapon and his accomplices. Five Hamas members connected to
the murder have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Other Palestinian officials said that the investigation had led
to the uncovering of large quantities of explosives, weapons and
time bombs in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Preventive Security Chief in the West
Bank Jibri Rajoub said that Palestinian security forces had
arrested some 30 Hamas activists in the last few days, who were
involved in Sharif's killing.
</P>
<P>
Israel accused Sharif of involving in several suicide bombing
attacks in Israel, including two explosions in Jerusalem last
summer, in which 25 Israelis were killed and about 200 others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel has categorically denied any involvement in
the incident, Hamas has vowed to avenge Sharif's death,
declaring that they would attack Jewish targets both inside and
outside Israel.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Cease-Fire in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday urged all Afghan parties to stop the fighting and to agree
immediately on a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The council also called on the parties to engage in a political
dialogue for national reconciliation, a lasting political
settlement of the conflict and the formation of a broad-based
fully representative government.
</P>
<P>
The council said in a presidential statement adopted Monday
that it reiterates its call to all countries to stop interference
immediately.
</P>
<P>
It points to the fact that "the foreign interference continues
unabated in the form of the supply of war-making materials to the
factions, reinforcing the reluctance of faction leaders to engage
in serious political dialogue with one another."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council said the United Nations, as a universally
recognized intermediary, must continue to play its central and
impartial role in international efforts towards a peaceful
resolution of the Afghanistan conflict.
</P>
<P>
It is concerned with the sharp deterioration of the
humanitarian situation in several areas in Central and Northern
Afghanistan, while strongly urging the Taliban to let the
humanitarian agencies attend to the needs of the population.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan factions have actively engaged in arms replenishment
throughout the last months.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council supports the steps of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to launch investigations into alleged
mass killings of prisoners of war and civilians in the country.

<HEADLINE> Angola Repatriates 353 Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Angola repatriated 353 illegal
immigrants in northern Uige Province in the first quarter of the
year, the official in charge of immigration and border affairs
told media Monday.
</P>
<P>
Almeida Ribeiro, head of the immigration and border affairs
authorities, told reporters that of the 353 repatriates, 346 are
from Congo, three from Gambia, three from Mali and one from Sao
Tome and Principe. They all entered through the border in Uige
Province and engaged in illegal trade and other unlawful
activities.
</P>
<P>
These illegal immigrants returned home on vehicles arranged by
the Angolan interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
As was disclosed by Ribeiro, the immigration and border
affairs authorities began sorting out illegal immigrants late
1997.
</P>
<P>
Except those having been repatriated, there are still 150
illegal immigrants to be sent home. Many of them are now working
in non-governmental organizations and other economic sectors,
Ribeiro said, adding that others are engaged in illegal
activities while evading checks.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of 1992 when civil war broke out again in
Angola, many illegal immigrants swarmed into the country.
</P>
<P>
Some of these immigrants engaged themselves in illegal
exploitation of diamond in Angola's northeastern provinces of
Lunda-Norte and Lunda-Sul, and some engaged in illegal trade in
northern provinces of Uige and Mlanje, and the capital city of
Luanda, greatly destabilizing the economic and social orders in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have been doing the repatriation work since
Angola's two warring sides signed the Lusaka Peace Accord and
ceased fire in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In August 1996, the Angolan police launched the Cancer-2
operation, sorting out many illegal immigrants, especially those
engaged in unlawful trade.
</P>
<P>
So far, 5,000 illegal immigrants have been repatriated, most
of whom are Africans.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arabs Protest House Demolition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Arabs on Monday
observed a general strike and marched to protest against what
they called persistent discrimination and demolition of their
homes by Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
Although police were keeping vigil against possible
disturbances, the protests passed without major incidents of
violence.
</P>
<P>
The strike and demonstrations were called to protest the
police during last weekend's violent clashes between Arab
residents and police in a Bedouin village near the northern town
of Shfaram.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of protesters and police were wounded duing the
clashes, which were triggered by police's attempt to demolish
three homes allegedly rebuilt without official licenses.
</P>
<P>
In Arab towns in northern Israel, schools, shops and offices
were closed as part of the general strike. Holding Palestinian
flags and green Islamic Movement flags, about 10,000 Arab
protesters marched from Shfaram to the Bedouin village Sahali,
where last weekend's clashes erupted.
</P>
<P>
Following the march, dozens of Arabs began rebuilding the
three demolished homes that ignited the recent violence. The
police did not intervene apparently for fear of escalating the
tensions.
</P>
<P>
The recent violence between Israeli Arabs and police signaled
the increasing tensions between the government and the country's
one million Arab population, who closely associate with
Palestinians in the territories. Arab citizens have been
protesting years of discrimination and confiscation of properties
by Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
In order to calm the anger of the Arab population Monday,
Israeli leaders vowed to pay more attention to their
well-being. Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav, who is in charge of
Arab affairs, admitted that a mistake was made Saturday because
the police did not consult with local Arab leaders before
demolishing the buildings.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman has expressed concern about the rising
tensions between Arabs and the government and voiced sympathy
toward the Arabs, saying that many of them are living under
critical conditions. He said that he would tour the northern
region on Thursday to hear complaints from local Arabs.

MAPUTO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican National Electoral
Commission (CNE) condemned Monday in a statement that some people
violated law by intimidation.
</P>
<P>
CNE said that these intimidating acts in the central provinces
of Sofala and Zambezia and the northern Nampula Province violated
the law and the freedom of the citizens.
</P>
<P>
"Intimidation can not be allowed in our multi-party democratic
process, and the intimidators shall be punished according to the
law," CNE warned.
</P>
<P>
CNE also noted that there were instigative and fraudulent
conducts of some political parties and individuals in the
signature-collection campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from some voters, such conducts were
found in the cities of LIchinga in Niassa Province and Xai-Xai in
Gaza Province and the capital city of Maputo, CNE said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that someone tried to bribe the voters with
soaps in order to run for Mayor.
</P>
<P>
The national electoral commission stressed that "Voters can
not be forced to support someone, no matter who he is."
</P>
<P>
CNE acknowledged that there were mistakes in the voters'
registration in mid-November and early December last year.
</P>
<P>
Some registers issued in 1994 were lost and there were
mistakes in the names of some voters, which will have impacts on
80,000 voters in 33 cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
CNE has decided that the mistakes would be corrected from
March 30 to April 13. But according to press reports, few voters
went to the designated sites to make correction.
</P>
<P>
The commission also announced Monday that election campaign
may go on from June 15 to June 27 for the elections scheduled on
June 30 in the 33 cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
Election results will be announced on July 15; from July 16 to
July 30, the elected members of the city councils will be
inaugurated; and the municipal presidents of the cities and towns
will be sworn in before August 4.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Rejects PNA Findings on Sharif's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian radical group
Hamas rejected on Monday the findings of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) over the killing of its activist Muhi Sharif.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Hamas, or Islamic Resistance Movement,
condemned PNA's investigation results as "lies."
</P>
<P>
PNA security officials said Monday that Sharif was killed by
rivals in an internal struggle for leadership of Hamas, clearing
Israel of its responsibility in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Hamas' statement attributed PNA's announcement of its findings
to the pressure of Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Hamas finds a strong and direct link between the issuing of
these weak rumors and American and Zionist pressures on the
(Palestinian National) Authority to exonerate the criminal and
transforming the victim into the criminal," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has vowed to avenge Sharif's death by attacking Jewish
targets both inside and outside Israel.
</P>
<P>
"In Hamas, we affirm to our people, that the blood of martyr
Sharif did not spill in vain and these rumors will not prevent
Hamas from making its decision and choosing the path of struggle,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was Hamas' chief bomb maker and most wanted by Israel
for masterminding several suicide bombing attacks which killed
dozens of Israelis. His body was found on March 29 in the West
Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials initially accused Israel of shooting
Sharif to death before dumping his body in an explosive-rigged car
and detonated it.
</P>

Israel has categorically denied the accusation and warned that
if Hamas launches terror attacks on Israel, it will hold the PNA
responsible for it. The U.S. also called on the PNA to prevent
Hamas from taking such actions.

Hamas' statement said that it is also investigating the
incident.

Israel was behind the killing and the PNA also "carries part of

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia: Maternal,Infant Mortality High: Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of Health
Adem Ibrahim said Monday that Ethiopia is among those developing
countries with high maternal and infant mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference to mark the World Health Day
which falls on Tuesday, April 7 under the theme of "Pregnancy is
special -- let us make it safe", Minister Adem noted that
Ethiopia is facing high maternal and infant mortality rate due to
lack of health services and malnutrition, infection during
delivery as well as poor sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that millions of Ethiopian women underwent
the risk of pregnancy without knowing that they could avoid it if
they wanted to.
</P>
<P>
This trend should not be allowed to continue since the
interventions that make motherhood safe are known and the
resources needed are available, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Making motherhood safe is one of the prime concerns of the
ministry of health," the minister said, adding that the Ethiopian
government has displayed its commitment to the improvement of
women's living standard by drawing various policies that ensure
the well-being of women and children.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the World Health
Organization (WHO) here Monday, in such developing countries as
Ethiopia, the maternal mortality rate is on average about 870 per
100,000 live births.

WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

</P>
<P>
In a 30-minute telephone conversation, Clinton reviewed his

"was sometimes the venue for superpower rivalry" during the Cold
War, said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.

Clinton and Yeltsin will meet in May at the summit of seven

<HEADLINE> Safe Motherhood, This Year's Theme: U.N. Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday reminded the world of taking care about women' health
as there are 600,000 maternal deaths a year globally.
</P>
<P>
In his message for World Health Day which falls on April 7,
Annan said this year's theme to observe the day is "Safe
Motherhood -- the health and survival of women during pregnancy
and childbirth."
</P>
<P>
Along the large number of deaths, private statistics put
pregnancy and childbirth related injuries to women at 50 million a
year in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), nearly three
fourths of the deaths are directly related to severe blooding,
infection, unsafe abortions, eclampsia and obstructed labor, while
maternal and newborn health services would cost only an average of
three U.S. dollars per person per year to prevent such deaths.
</P>
<P>
A consortium of U.N. and international agencies has launched a
year-long awareness campaign and called on governments and people
worldwide to commit to implementing measures to curb childbirth
related deaths and injuries.

WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Monica Lewinsky's lawyer
accused special prosecutor Kenneth Starr Monday of conducting a

client and suggested Starr wrap up the case.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see him drop the damn thing.... Let's see Mr.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Hear on Mideast Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton will be
told on Monday evening the difficult situation in the Middle East
for a breakthrough of the peace process by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross, the White
House said.
</P>
<P>
"Ross will review where we are in the peace process," a White
House spokeswoman said. She did not make any elaboration on the
evening briefing.
</P>
<P>
Ross made a trip last week to the Middle East in an new effort
to break the year-long deadlock of the peace process by offering
new ideas on Israel's pullback on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But his proposals of Israel further ceding 13.1 percent of its
occupied West Bank have been rejected by the Israeli government on
the grounds of its security.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has admitted its envoy Ross could
not bridge the gap between Israel and the Palestinians over the
size of the Israeli pullback.
</P>
<P>
Albright last week said that the United States felt frustrated
over the continued impasse in the region and indicated the United
States might wash its hands as a broker as it could not go on
forever in such a stalemated situation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said last week they would decide in the
ensuing few days how to pursue peace efforts, following Ross's
latest trip, but indicated they expected Israeli and Palestinian
leaders to come up with better offers before then.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Waiting for Jones to Make Appeal Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The conservative foundation
supporting Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit against U.S.
President Bill Clinton said Monday lawyers are still waiting to
hear if she wants to appeal a judge's decision dismissing the
suit.
</P>
<P>
A Rutherford Institute spokesman said that Jones still has to
get "focused" after last week's order, adding, "She's the one
who's going to make the final call," United Press International
reported.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, a federal judge in Arkansas ruled Jones had not
produced enough evidence to bring her suit against President
Clinton to a jury.
</P>
<P>
Jones claimed Clinton, as Arkansas governor, exposed himself
and made a crude sexual proposition in a Little Rock hotel suite
in 1991, and that her career as a low-level state employee
suffered after the rebuff.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Judge Susan Webber Wright said even if Jones is
telling the truth -- a position the judge was required to take
before ending the case without trial -- Jones had not shown that
she was harmed by the alleged harassment.
</P>
<P>
Jones has 30 days from last week's ruling to file a notice of
appeal.
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after last Wednesday's ruling, the
Rutherford Institute issued a statement saying Jones would appeal
to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and to the Supreme Court
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday evening, however, the institute issued another
statement, saying, "an appeal is very likely but no final decision
has been made."

<P>
ABU DHABI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Monday called for an enlarged Arab summit to discuss Arab affairs,
UAE's official Wam news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone conversation with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al-Nahyan
underlined the importance of holding "a gathering of Arab leaders
in the current period ... to bring the Arab nations out of the
disastrous situation."
</P>
<P>
He had hinted before that the Arab world is lack of strong
solidarity enabling them to speak in one voice when dealing with
Arab affairs.
</P>
<P>
The president said that there should be intensified efforts to
encourage those countries who are hesitating to attend such a
proposed summit to ensure it cover every Arab state.
</P>
<P>
"The gathering is in national interests of all (Arab
countries)," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has repeatedly urged all Arab states to attend an
emergency Arab summit to discuss Arab issues, in particular the
stalled Mideast peace process and the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and some other Arab countries have reportedly expressed
their support to the UAE's appeal while others remain cautious
on commenting on it.

WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States welcomes the
ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
by France and Britain, said the White House Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It represents a milestone in the global effort to reduce the

Mike McCurry said at a regular briefing when referring to the
ratification of the treaty by Britain and France.
</P>

"The president (Clinton) obviously expresses his gratitude to

again calls on the United States Senate to give its advice and
consent to the CTBT this year," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is in the best interest of the United States because
its provisions will significantly further our nuclear
nonproliferation and arms control objectives and strengthen
international security, said McCurry.
</P>
<P>
Britain and France became the first nuclear powers to ratify a
treaty banning nuclear weapons tests on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the two countries turned over documents to
the United Nations' treaty section in New York signifying their
government's acceptance of the CTBT, which prohibits any kind of
nuclear weapons test explosion.
</P>

UNITED NATIONS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi

</P>
<P>
His remarks ware included in his report to the Security Council
which adopted a presidential statement today calling for stoppage

</P>
<P>
Annan noticed that foreign military assistance continued to
pour into the country, inhibiting all peacemaking efforts by
felling the war machines of the mostly Uzbek, Tajik and Hazara
Northern Alliance and the predominantly Pushtoon Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"Despite their rhetorical support for the U.N. and a negotiated
settlement, neither side appeared ready to abandon the military
option," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the military situation there remained stalemated, with
occasionally flare-ups of fighting along the front lines between
Taliban and Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
"The continued fighting has not produced any significant
changes in the front lines but it has caused further destruction,
deaths, injuries and internal displacement of large numbers of
people," he said in the report.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian situation deteriorated sharply in Bamyan
Province where several hundred thousand people suffered from severe
food shortages, he added.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government
reiterated that the 1994 genocide in Rwanda will never occur
again.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here Monday by the Rwandan Embassy to
Ethiopia in commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the 1994
genocide in the country said, April 7 of 1994 is the symbol of
the igniter which triggered the abominable and barbaric crime --
genocide -- which cost more than one million Rwandan lives in
less than one hundred days.
</P>
<P>
It said, since 1994, the date of April 7 has become notorious
not only in the history of Rwanda, but also for the international
community as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that "while paying tribute to the
memory of the victims of this heinous act, it would be important
for the international community to stand shoulder to shoulder and
commit itself not to tolerate or dismiss, let alone forget, this
tragedy that befell the people of Rwanda at the very beginning of
the month of April 1994."
</P>
<P>
It hoped that "the international community will renew its
solemn and unwavering commitment to ensure that this act of
barbarism which decimated the population of rwanda will never
occur again".
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in Rwanda, the statement said,
"over the last four years, the government and people of Rwanda
have embarked on the task of national reconstruction: in that
regard, the political and administrative institutions have been
placed back on track, the ravaged economy is stirring again and
hopes is returning to the population".
</P>
<P>

<P>
ABU DHABI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and Bahrain's senior
military officials held talks Monday to discuss military
cooperation between Washington and Manama, Bahrain's official
Gulf News Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Commander of Air Forces of the U.S. Central Command Carl
Franklin and Bahrain's Defense Minister and Vice Commander of the
Bahraini Defense Forces Sheikh Khalifa bin Ahmad al-Khalifa
discussed "the military cooperation and ways of boosting the
cooperation between the two sides," the GNA said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the talks between them focused on the extension of
deployment of U.S. military aircraft in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Bahrain accepted Washington's request for the
extension of U.S. aircraft on its soil for a further 60 days
within the framework of a defense agreement signed between them
after the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain had previously consented, both last year and at the
beginning of this year, to a number of requests concerning the
deployment of U.S. military aircraft in its territory.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly deployed 36 warplanes, all belonging
to the U.S. Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in Bahrain, as part of
Washington's military buildup in the oil-rich Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aircraft joined other U.S. forces in the Gulf region
to supervise the implementation of no-fly zone operation against
Iraq and sanctions imposed by the United Nations against Baghdad
in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zone in southern Iraq was imposed by U.S., British
and French forces in August 1991 to protect Shiite Muslim Iraqis
from reprisals after President Saddam Hussein's forces brutally
crushed their uprising soon after the end of 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Breaches Peace Accord: Archbishop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The archbishop of Liberia's
Catholic Church, Micheal Francis has accused the Liberian
government of failing to implement the agreement which calls for
the formation and training of the national army by the west
African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Senate on Monday afternoon, Bishop Francis said
that disarmament was finished to some extent and free and fair
elections were held.
</P>
<P>
However, the critical issue of restructuring the military and
security operators has been postponed and ignored, he said,
quoted by a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored
here.
</P>
<P>
Under the Abuja peace accord, ECOMOG is mandated to be in
charge of the disarmament, provide security for the post-war
elections and participate in the re-building and training of the
Liberian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The archbishop recalled that initially all the former factions
had agreed to total disarmament and the formation of the new army
should be done regardless of factional loyalty.
</P>
<P>
But this has not happened, he observed. He also attributed
the current insecurity in the country to the failure to keep the
determination of the Abuja accord and the on-going attempt to
restructure the security forces by the government.
</P>
<P>
According to him, most of the problems Liberia is facing today
are rooted in the unfinished business of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
His statement caused unease in some members of the Senate. But
the archbishop said that "this is my honest and sincere opinion."

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Favors Business-like Government, Not Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said he favored forming a government composed of business-like
people nominated by any faction, not a coalition government,
reports here said.
</P>
<P>
Opening a round-table meeting in the Kremlin on Tuesday,
Yeltsin proposed that formation of the government and nomination
of candidates should be "approached objectively, on business and
professional grounds, not on political considerations."
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin reportedly proposed forming a trilateral
committee among leaders of the government and both houses of
parliament at the "leading four" meeting on April 2.
</P>
<P>
At the April 2 meeting, which was attended by acting Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, lower house speaker Gennady Seleznyov
and Federal Council Chairman Yegor Stroyev, Yeltsin proposed that
the year 1998 be declared "a year without confrontation."
</P>
<P>
He also called for efforts to avoid conflicts and confrontation
within and between parliamentary factions, parties and
authoritative institutions.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's meeting, he urged participants to back
Kiriyenko's candidacy for premiership, so as not to delay his
appointment. Russia is now in a critical moment, the president
said, because the country has been without a government for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he had suggested Kiriyenko "listen to
the deputies' proposals and refrain from making hasty moves."
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko told reporters after the round-table conference that
the meeting was constructive and that he was satisfied. He
believed that he would receive the support of the people.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Duma decided that it would vote on Kiriyenko's
nomination on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin dismissed his entire government two weeks ago and
nominated 35-year-old Kiriyenko, the former fuel and energy
minister, to the post of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The president threatened on Monday to dissolve the parliament
if it vetoed the nominee.

<HEADLINE> More Japanese Graduates Join SDF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- More Japanese graduates of
universities and junior colleges are joining the Self-Defense
Forces (SDF) because of the stagnant economy and rising
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
One in four people who became middle-ranking members of the
Ground, Air and Maritime Self-Defense Forces in 1997 were
university or junior college graduates, Kyodo News reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the 1,200 who passed entrance exams for acceptance in the
SDF in 1997, 300 were university or college graduates, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The positions were previously dominated by high school
graduates. Officials blame the economy, which was once the world's
second largest but has since 1992 grown stagnant, on the change.
</P>
<P>
"In times of an economic slump, there is always an increase in
the number of people who want to become government employees
because of job security," an SDF official in charge of recruitment
said.
</P>
<P>
Those who want to be admitted to the SDF must pass an exam in
one of three categories: the top-level officer candidate exam for
posts filled mainly by university graduates; the middle-ranking
exam for senior high school graduates; or the general personnel
exam for posts filled by junior and senior high school graduates.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China will increase the issue of
its certificate treasury bonds by 17.36 billion yuan, the Ministry
of Finance announced today.
</P>
<P>
The five-year bonds, which will be on offer between tomorrow
and October 31, will carry an annual interest rate of 7.86
percent, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the ministry announced the issue of 120
billion yuan in certificate bonds, which will be on offer through
October 31.
</P>
<P>
China issued a total of 241 billion yuan in treasury bonds last
year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the People's Bank of China, the central bank,
indicate that nearly 90 percent of the original issue has already
been sold.
</P>
<P>
As prices and interest rates on bank savings deposits keep
going down, more Chinese residents have turned to treasury bonds
as their main investment choice.
</P>
<P>
Since May 1996, China has cut bank interest rates four times,
with the latest on March 25.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Separation of Kosovo From Serbia "Unacceptable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Tuesday described the attempt to separate Kosovo from
Yugoslavia as "totally unacceptable" after he met visiting Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
Such an attempt, which will not be accepted by Yugoslavia
either, will not promote negotiations between Belgrade and the
ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, it will only result in bloodshed,
Primakov told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he and Dini both agreed that the talks between
Belgrade and the Kosovo Albanians must start as soon as
possible. The Russian foreign minister pointed out that the talks
must be based on three principles including non-separation of
Kosovo from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The other two principles are granting Kosovo autonomy and
defining the relationship between Kosovo, with autonomy enjoyed
within the framework of Serbia and the federal central authority.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also stressed Russia's opposition against dispatching
troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Dini arrived in Moscow Monday for a three-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, who account for 90 percent of
the population of the province, have been seeking Kosovo's
independence from Yugoslavia. They came into armed conflict with
Serbian policemen in February.

<P>
NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- World semiconductor sales hit
10.52 billion U.S. dollars in February, the second highest
February total since 1990, the U.S. Semiconductor Industry
Association (SIA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Sales in the Americas, European and Asia-Pacific markets
climbed 3.3, 7.7 and 6.6 percent respectively from February 1997
figures.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, the continued decline of the yen against the dollar
contributed to a sales fall of 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
While stronger than 1997 overall, world chip sales dipped 4
percent from January to February, the SIA said in its latest
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Sales in the Americas, European, Japanese and Asia-Pacific
markets decreased 4.1, 3.2, 4.8 and 4.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the SIA, sales in the first two months of this
year were consistent with the seasonal sales pattern seen in 1997
and were in line with the industry group's forecast.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, global sales surged in the second and third quarters
after a modest first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The SIA, formed in 1977, represents 90 percent of U.S.
semiconductor production.

<HEADLINE> Blair on Way to Belfast Amid Talks Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
left Downing Street Tuesday afternoon on his way to Belfast to
save the peace after the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) rejected the
draft settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
Blair is to meet UUP leader David Trimble at Hillsborough
Castle later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The main pro-British party UUP rejected a document presented by
talks chairman George Mitchell earlier Tuesday. The feuding
parties in Northern Ireland are supposed to reach an agreement on
the basis of the draft plan before Thursday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's blueprint includes plans for a new parliament to run
the province's internal affairs alongside cross-border bodies that
Protestants fear will grow into an all-Irish state.
</P>
<P>
Blair's official spokesman said earlier in the day the prime
minister was ready to go to Belfast if he was needed there.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the Ulster Unionists' rejection of the peace plan
put forward by talks chairman George Mitchell, a spokesman for
Blair said the document was not intended to be final.
</P>
<P>
"No one has been asked to accept this document as it stands. It
exists as a basis for discussion and negotiation," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman in Dublin said Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern would travel to Belfast Tuesday night or Wednesday
morning for talks with local leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Crime in England and Wales fell by
almost 9 percent last year, the fifth consecutive annual drop,
according to government figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But property crime may rise in the long term as the economy
flourishes, as shown by research from the statistics department of
the Home Office, or the interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, the number of offenses reported to
the police last year was down by about a fifth from 1992 levels,
the fifth consecutive annual fall.
</P>
<P>
Violent crime rose by 2 percent and sex crime was up by 7
percent in 1997. House burglary and car crime fell by 14 percent
across England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
"It is obviously pleasing to see that crime is heading in the
right direction, but we must not be complacent," junior minister
Alun Michael said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic factors may well create an upward pressure on
property crime in the future," he said.

<HEADLINE> DuPont Locates 900-Million-Dollar Venture in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- US-based chemical giant DuPont
decided to locate a 900-million-US-dollar joint venture in south
China's Dongfang city, Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from DuPont China, the company has made a
breakthrough in negotiations with the China National Offshore Oil
Company (CNOOC) on supply of natural gas for the joint venture
recently.
</P>
<P>
The site of the joint venture is located in the port city on
the island province.
</P>
<P>
DuPont and BASF Akliengesellschaft of Germany will have equal
investment in the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
"We remain totally committed to this joint venture, although it
has taken longer to reach this point than we anticipated," said
Eduard J. Van Wely, DuPont Senior vice president responsible for
the company's worldwide nylon business and the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Sources from DuPont said that the joint venture is well along
in going through procedures for government approval.
</P>
<P>
The nylon intermediates factory will use BASF technology to
turn China's natural gas into raw materials for producing nylon.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the factory is planned to break earth in early
1999. Upon completion, the factory will become a base for DuPont
to produce and sell nylon intermediates in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The factory is expected to turn out 150,000 tons of
caprolactam, the major material for production of nylon 6 polymer,
every year.
</P>
<P>
This joint venture will be the largest investment project that
DuPont has ever had in China. It will enable the company to meet
the target of investing one billion US dollars in the country by
2000.
</P>
<P>
Since entering China market in 1984, DuPont has already set up
11 wholly-owned or joint venture factories and four representative
offices in seven coastal cities in the country. Total investment
of DuPont in China has exceeded 300 million US dollars.

<P>
PARIS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States struck
a deal Tuesday on establishing free air space between them,
allowing free competition between airline companies of the two
countries, said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Perreau, director for economic and financial affairs
in the French Foreign Ministry, and Joel Spiro, under-secretary
for transport of the U.S. State Department, signed a five-year
agreement in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, to be formalized within weeks by the foreign
ministers of the two countries before coming into force in June,
said that France and the United States will enlarge "in a
gradual and balanced way, the possibilities to be offered to air
transport companies."
</P>
<P>
Air France is eager to implement its agreements with U.S. air
companies on mutually representing each other in airports of each
other's country. They have been blocked from doing so by the
U.S. government because of the lack of an agreement with France on
free air space.
</P>
<P>
The United States has signed free air space agreements with a
number of other West European countries.

</P>
<P>
Meat and gourmet powder output reached 59 million tons and
520,000 tons last year, respectively, officials announced at a
two-day workshop on China's food industry, which closed in
Shanghai today.
</P>

<P>
Liquor output topped 27 million tons in 1997, and the output of
beer was 18.6 million tons, second in the world.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the rapid development of the food industry has
brought great changes in people's diets. Food sales in Shanghai's
900 supermarkets accounted for 73.8 percent of their sales in 1997.

<P>
Priority will be given to intensifying the processing of farm
products, and to produce more instant and healthy food, according
to officials.
</P>

Trade and Industry, said the presence of Zimbabwean farmers will
even enhance trade between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Zambian government will continue
improving the investment climate in the country to enhance
economic development.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, Bwalya Ngandu, Zambia Investment Center
Director-General, assured the Zimbabwean farmers that they will
be given various incentives when they invest in his country
where less than 20 percent of the total 9 million hectares of
cultivatable land has been developed.
</P>
<P>
Ngandu stated that the capital equipment for farmers coming
into Zambia will not be taxed and that all income from
agriculture will be taxed at 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that registered investors will be allowed
to own land in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Those who will come with an investment of 250,000 Dollars or
more will be given the status of self-employment that investors
in other sectors cannot enjoy, said Ngandu.
</P>
<P>
He also assured Zimbabwean farmers that they could have a
large market for their produce as Zambia is a member of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), which is
aiming to achieve a free trade area by 2000 and a customs union
with a zero tariff on products originating from within the
market.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Safe-Pregnancy Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Health plans
to launch a national project next month to lower the mortality
rate of pregnant women and infants by improving maternity
service.
</P>
<P>
The "Safe Motherhood" project aims to increase the proportion
of hospital births among pregnant women, according to Xiang
Xiaoying, an official with the ministry's Department of Woman and
Child Health.
</P>
<P>
Women who run a high risk in childbirth will be given more
care, and the rate of child birth defects is expected to drop
after implementing the project, said Xiang, who declined to give
more details.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to a 50 percent decline in the current death
rate of pregnant women by the year 2000," she said. "It is also a
goal which the Chinese government promised the international
community to achieve."
</P>
<P>
Today's World Health Day also focused on safe pregnancies and
childbirth, as well as health care for mothers. Chinese medical
personnel provided street-side health counseling at some downtown
areas of Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
China reported that 62 of every 100,000 pregnant women died
prior to or during childbirth in 1996, far below the world average
of 430 persons per 100,000 people, and the level in developing
countries of 480 persons per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
However, the mortality rate for pregnant women in China's poor
rural areas was around 200 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
"The deadly causes included hemorrhaging, hypertension,
amniotic embolism, heart attacks, and inaccessible maternity
services," Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
"A national survey found that the rate of in-hospital
childbirth was lower than 20 percent in some areas. Almost half of
those who died in pregnancy died at their homes or on the road to
a hospital," she added.

<HEADLINE> Celebrations Planned to Mark HK's Return Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is actively considering
various celebration events to mark the first anniversary of Hong
Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
David Lan, secretary for Home Affairs, said this in a replay to
a question on whether the government has any plan to celebrate the
event, at a two-day plenary session of the Provisional Legislative
Council that was opened here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Lan said that 1997/98 will be a most
significant and memorable year.
</P>
<P>
Following the smooth transition, he said the newly established
HKSAR has continued to function in a steady and progressive
manner, with the concept of "one country, two systems" and
principles of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high
degree of autonomy fully realized.
</P>
<P>
Lan said July 1 this year will be a time to look back on the
achievement of the HKSAR during its first year in existence.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from having it declared as a public holiday, the
Administration is actively considering various celebration events
to mark the occasion," he said.
</P>
<P>
As regards details and expenditure of such activities, he said:
"I can assure members that we will, as usual, be prudent in
spending public funds."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether there is any plan to launch
publicity campaigns abroad in this respect, Lan said: "the
Secretary for Trade and Industry has been coordinating plans for
our overseas Economic and Trade Offices to organize functions in
celebration of the HKSAR's first anniversary."
</P>
<P>
He said that activities range from cocktail reception, sit-down
dinner with cultural performances to organizing major business
conferences to show how the HKSAR could be a launching pad to
business opportunities in the Asia Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
"July 1 1998 will be an occasion for our overseas offices to
brief their host countries on our free and open economy as well as
our autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' principle," he
added.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Debate on Undeclared Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission called on
Tuesday for a debate on undeclared work as part of its effort to
redress the employment issue.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials estimated that undeclared work accounts
for between 7 and 16 percent of the European Union's gross
domestic product, or represents between 10 million and 28 million
jobs that correspond to between 7 and 19 percent of total declared
employment in the union.
</P>
<P>
Undeclared work is defined by the commission as paid activity
that is lawful in nature but not notified to the public
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive agency of the 15-nation union,
identified undeclared work as an issue of common concern for EU
member states in the employment field.
</P>
<P>
It called for member states to debate on how to tackle the
issue more effectively.
</P>
<P>
Undeclared work usually is found in labor-intensive, low-profit
sectors such as agriculture, construction, retail trade, catering,
domestic services or manufacturing and business services where
costs are the major factor of competition.
</P>
<P>
Undeclared work is found to employ four main groups of people:
second and multiple job holders, economically inactive population
such as students and early retirees, the unemployed and
third-country nationals illegally residing in the EU.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials claimed that undeclared work risks
undermining the financing and delivery of social protection and
public services.
</P>
<P>
The curtailment of receipts, officials explained, means a
reduction in the level of services the state can offer and this
creates a vicious circle as the government raises taxes to
continue to provide the services, thus creating more incentives to
undeclared work.
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn, European Commissioner responsible for employment
and social affairs, said Tuesday: "The European Employment
Strategy, in particular the Employment Guidelines, now provides an
opportunity for combating undeclared work through EU coordinated
action if this is deemed necessary."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner expected a wide-ranging discussion that would
result in an action at EU level.

<HEADLINE> Health Official Expects Polio to Be Eradicated Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) will make concerted efforts with its member countries for
the global eradication of diseases in the near future such as
polio, a WHO official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Infectious diseases are no longer a major issue for WHO; we
hope that polio and some other infectious diseases can be
eradicated in the near future," said Dr. Roderick W.K. Gee, WHO's
chief representative in China, at a meeting to mark the 50th
anniversary of WHO's establishment.
</P>
<P>
Gee said the Western Pacific region countries, including China,
are on the edge of eradicating polio and leprosy.
</P>
<P>
However, many new health problems brought by the rapid growth
of an aging population, the emergence of new diseases and
re-emergence of some old ones are posing a new challenge to
humans, he said, calling for further worldwide cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and new Health Minister Zhang Wenkang
both addressed the meeting and spoke highly of WHO's achievements
and its cooperative ties with China.
</P>
<P>
WHO's contributions to mankind include a remarkable rise in the
average human life expectancy from 46 years in the 1950s to 65
years in 1994, and the global eradication of smallpox in 1980,
said Zhang Wenkang.
</P>
<P>
Because of a worldwide immunization project targeting children
less than 5 years old, the immunization rate reached 80 percent in
1994, compared with less than 5 percent in 1974, he said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the organization was initiated by China
and Brazil in 1946. The People's Republic of China regained its
seat in WHO in 1972.

<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Tuesday joined the world
in commemorating the World Health Day whose theme this year is
''Safe Motherhood: a Right to Life in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
The theme was chosen after it had been noted that as many as
500,000 people all over the world were dying of child birth
related complications.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the deaths were being recorded in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a function held here to mark the day,
regional-Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) Ebrahim
Samba said Zimbabwe's reproductive health system was doing well
despite different problems which included lack of finance and
resources, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
''Let us encourage our youths to wait for the right age before
they can have babies to avoid unnecessary complications and
deaths,'' said Samba.
</P>
<P>
He said more information about reproductive health needed to
be made accessible to today's youths who experimented with their
lives at times.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, First Lady Grace Mugabe said there was
need to provide the general public with appropriate information
on issues of reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
She said it was sad that mothers and their babies were dying
because of poor health and inadequate care during pregnancy and
childbirth although that could be avoided.
</P>
<P>
''Progress can only be achieved if we join hands in our
concerted efforts both individually and collectively to promote
and support measures and programs aimed at enhancing reproductive
health,'' she said.

China's forest coverage rate has risen to 13.9 percent from
12.7 percent in the 1980s and its urban green-coverage rate
increased to 23.8 percent from 19.2 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier stressed at the meeting that afforestation is
a protracted strategic task which needs the attention of
governments at all levels.
</P>
<P>
The country's forest-coverage project has made remarkable
progress in halting environmental deterioration in recent years,
he said, because of the nationwide voluntary tree-planting drive
and smooth progress of the country's key afforestation projects.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the worsening of the country's ecology has
not been reversed, and rapid industrialization and population
growth will apply even more pressure on resources and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the situation, he said, the government will map
out a long-term afforestation plan and seek approval by the
National People's Congress, China's legislature.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academy of Sciences to Invite More Visiting Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) will establish a system of senior visiting scholars this
year to make up for the aging of its research personnel and keep a
larger number of "transient" scientists.
</P>
<P>
The CAS will spend 24 million yuan (3 million U.S. dollars)
inviting 852 senior visiting scholars from at home and abroad
within the next three years, CAS Vice-President Bai Chunli told a
news conference today.
</P>
<P>
"Many core members of research groups at the CAS are getting old
and lack vitality, and most of its personnel are permanent
employees and cannot be replaced, which has hindered the progress
of the CAS," Bai said.
</P>
<P>
He said the new system is a breakthrough in CAS' management of
personnel resources. It will help the CAS become a more open
center of advanced scientific research and technology innovation
for both Chinese and foreign scientists, he said.
</P>
<P>
The visiting scholars should be those from outside the CAS who
have doctoral degrees and have been involved in scientific
research for more than five years, as well as foreign scholars and
overseas Chinese scientists who are professors or assistant
professors, according to the system.
</P>
<P>
All the scholars invited should be less than 45 years old, and
stay in the CAS for six to 12 months consecutively, according to
the system, and they can become employees of the CAS after that
period in a mutual decision between the scholars and the
institutes they have visited.
</P>
<P>
The first group of 853 senior visiting scholars will be
involved in the most advanced research projects, which include
nuclear technology, high-energy astrophysics, infrared remote
sensing, robot control and other projects in 88 institutes of the
CAS, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CAS will strive to build itself into a national
knowledge innovation center within 10 years and provide abundant
resources for the country's technology innovation.

<HEADLINE> China cracks down on Cheating on University Entrance Exams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Education said
that it will use various means to crack down on rampant cheating in
university entrance examinations.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is quite severe, and the number of crimes is
growing," said Zhang Tianbao, Vice Minister of Education, adding
that there are various cheating methods which are difficult to
discover and that some officials have become involved in the
illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
"This move will help the anti-corruption drive and foster a
good campus style," said Zhang, who is a member of the Central
Commission of the Chinese Communist Party for Discipline
Inspection.
</P>
<P>
Some 15 million people took college entrance exams of different
types last year, with the volume causing difficulties for
officials who sponsor the exams.
</P>
<P>
China's modernization drive emphasizes a university degree. A
university graduate can find a job more easily than those without
college education.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's 1,000 universities cannot provide
sufficient opportunities for all school-age applicants.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said computer technology should be widely used this year
to monitor the exams. He also stressed the need for educational
department workers to be honest.
</P>
<P>
Standardized classrooms for university entrance examinations
must be created, he said, adding that cheating must be dealt with
severely.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to crack down on the fabrication and sale of
false university certificates.

<HEADLINE> Specialist: Iron, Steel Industry Should Focus on Economic Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- As the world's largest iron and
steel producer, China should maximize economic returns and pursue
technological progress in iron and steel manufacturing while
stablizing its production.
</P>
<P>
In a recently published analysis of this year's domestic iron
and steel market, Zhou Chuandian, former vice minister of China's
defunct Ministry of the Metallurgical Industry, noted it is not
true that the more developed an economy ism the more iron and
steel it needs.
</P>
<P>
With the current economic growth and domestic supply-demand
relationship taken into account, China is projected to consume 100
million tons of steel in 2000, which is approximately the current
annual production.
</P>
<P>
On the surface, according to the metallurgical specialist,
China's present production capacity will be able to satisfy the
demand.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the product structure needs to be
optimized. This finds expression in the imports of many steel
products significant to the national economy, he said, as well as
the excessive production of some goods.
</P>
<P>
Zhou stressed that the only way for steel manufacturers to
achieve sustainable development is to make earnest efforts to
improve the product structure and increase the technology content
in the products.
</P>
<P>
"This is the inevitable path for the healthy development of
China's iron and steel industry." he said.
</P>
<P>
After briefing on the experience and the change of iron and
steel consumption by developed nations, Zhou said economic growth
does not necessarily lead to rising demand for iron and steel
products.
</P>
<P>
That means, he went on to say, that from the early to late
stages of industrialization, with the saturation and gradual
decrease in steel for infrastructure construction, steel
consumption will reach a saturation point and slightly drop.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, technological progress will help bring down
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The use of substitute materials also is increasing. Aluminum
and plastics are taking the place of steel in products ranging
from doors and windows to airplanes and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
The government department in charge of the metallurgy industry
has been aware that the difficulties the industry now encounters
cannot be addressed by mere production expansion or cost reduction.
</P>
<P>
This year's objective of China's metallurgy industry is to
place steel production basically at last year's level, said an
official of the former ministry during a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to turn out 107 million tons of steel in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The official said she believes the industry should make great
efforts to increase the production-sales ratio, readjust the product
structure and reduce stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
Steel manufacturers should be encouraged to make goods with a high
added value which substitute for imports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show China produced 107.57 million tons of steel in
1997, up 7 percent from 1996. The production volume in January was
8.77 million tons.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Collection of Ancient Maps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China has published a collection
of 142 ancient maps, dating back to periods from the Warring
States to Qing Dynasty, in both Chinese and English editions.
</P>
<P>
The book, published by the Harbin Map Publishing House, is the
first collection of ancient maps, which introduces the precious
ones among Chinese ancient maps in a systematic way, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The world's oldest map "Zhao Yu Tu", which was discovered in an
ancient tomb of a king in the Warring States (BC.475 - BC.221),
and the world's earliest color map, which was drawn on silk during
Han Dynasty (BC.206 - 24) were published in the book.
</P>
<P>
China, the first country in the world to draw maps, has many
famous ancient maps, which are not only precious cultural relics,
but also important materials for the annals of maps in the world.
</P>
<P>
In order to discover more ancient maps, and have them studied

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Allied Signal, one of the biggest
suppliers of aerospace and automotive equipment in the United
States, held a seminar here today on acquisitions and mergers,
drawing dozens of senior officials with Chinese ministries and big
companies.
</P>
<P>
Frederic Poses, vice chairman of Allied, briefed participants
on his company's experience in operations management and reform,
and expressed his hope that such lessons could help Chinese
business executives as they tackle the task of making China's
corporations more efficient and profitable.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Allied has both purchased and sold many businesses,
and more than doubled its profit margins through mergers and
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
"China today is on the threshold of a bold and dramatic new
phase of its evolution as a major economy in the world," Poses
said. "Mergers, acquisitions and restructuring will be effective
measures for China's state-owned enterprises to increase their own
strength and take part in the competitive international market. We
pay close attention to the progress of ongoing mergers,
acquisitions and restructuring in China. China's success in this
area will have a far-reaching influence on Asian, and even world,
economic development."
</P>
<P>
China has been active in mergers, acquisitions and
restructuring in the state-owned sector. Eonomists estimate that
this development will continue and should be speeded up in the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
For China to continue on its path of economic reform, it will
need to carry out mergers, acquisitions and restructuring on a
larger scale and quantity, according to Poses, and "set up
advanced management systems by introducing modern-enterprise
regulations."
</P>
<P>
High ranking officials from the State Economic and Trade
Commission, the State Development Planning Commission and the
Ministry of Science and Technology as well as representatives of
such big companies as FAW (First Automobile Works) Volkswagen, Air
China and China Aviation Industries Corp. attended the seminar.
They said China is ready to learn enterprise reform from developed
nations and to have more information exchanges with those nations.
</P>
<P>
Allied has set up 11 subsidiaries in China, specializing in
manufacturing aerospace and automotive products, chemicals,
plastics and advanced materials.

<HEADLINE> Ross to Be Back in Middle East Soon: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian permanent delegate to
the Arab League Mohamed Sobeih said Tuesday that U.S. Mideast
peace envoy Dennis Ross will return to the region soon despite
Israel's attempts to balk such a visit.
</P>
<P>
According to the Middle East News Agency, Sobeih said that if
Ross returns, he would probably carry a written U.S. initiative to
break the year-old deadlock in the Middle East peace-making.
</P>
<P>
The local Arabic-language newspaper Al Ahram reported Tuesday
that U.S. President Bill Clinton would meets with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Ross to decide on dispatching Ross to
the region as a last-ditch effort to exhaust U.S. diplomacy and
maybe announce the U.S. peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Ross ended his latest mission in the region a week ago, failing
to bridge the gap between the Palestinians and Israelis over a
U.S. proposal which reportedly asks Israel to withdraw from 13.1
percent of the West Bank accompanied by security cooperation from
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel flatly rejected the U.S. idea, saying it can accept no
more than 9 percent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hebron accord signed between the Palestinians
and Israelis last year, Israel should reploy its troops in the
West Bank in three stages that have to be completed in mid 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, which started as a
brainchild of the 1991 Madrid peace conference, have been stalled
for a year over Israeli construction of a new settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem and its long-delayed troop redeployment in the West
bank.

interests of the two countries and their people and benefit world
peace, stability and development," said Jiang, who also asked
Kuzmuk to convey his greetings to Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Kuzmuk offered greetings from Kuchma to Jiang. He also told

democratic and prosperous country and prepared to advance
relations with other countries based on peace and equality.

<HEADLINE> China's Banking Sector Goes Electronic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese banking sector has
used more electronic equipment in recent years to cater to the
need for its modernization.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the banking sector said that computers, networks,
credit cards and other electronic means have had increasing
presence in the sector, largely promoting the business quality and
monetary management capability of banks.
</P>
<P>
So far China's commercial banks have computerized most of their
branches and offices, and over 90 percent of the country's
residential banking business is handled with computers.
</P>
<P>
Networks have been widely adopted in the sector, with
professional banking nets and intranets developing rapidly. The
regional banking network system has been established in many
coastal cities, and the banking-oriented Golden Bridge Network has
set up ports in 24 provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, China started building the national
banking card information exchange network, the core of the Golden
Card Project. This marked that the sector has entered the age of
networks.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector has also developed professional softwares
with high security and powerful functions, basically meeting the
needs of business operations.
</P>
<P>
Credit cards, ATMs and other electronic banking means are also
increasingly popular in China, which greatly expanded banks'
service channels.
</P>
<P>
By now all of China's major banks have opened credit card
business. By the end of 1997, the banks had issued a total of
71.33 million credit cards, with an aggregated trading volume of
over 1.686 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts held that, with the huge number of financial
institutions and the dispersion in their layout, China's banking
sector should further step up its electronics construction.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Bingde, a niece of late
Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, received related materials from
friends of the United States here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
These materials included a copy of the letter written by former
US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to a committee in the US on
commemorating the centenary of the birth of Premier Zhou, and
overseas press organizations' reports on a concert on February 28,
which was attended by people from both China and the US.
</P>
<P>
Madame Zhou, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference and former Deputy
Director of the China News Service, said that this is "a good
commemoration of Premier Zhou".
</P>
<P>
She expressed her appreciation for the work done by President
of the US-China Association for Promotion of Economy and Trade
(UCAPET) Edward A. Morrison and its Vice-President Luo Zhen.
</P>
<P>
In the letter which was presented to a Museum in Tianjin by
Morrison on April 3, Kissinger spoke highly of Premier Zhou's
life, holding that Premier Zhou had "an extraordinary deft
understanding of statecraft", and he was a man of "exceptional
wisdom, intellect and humor".
</P>
<P>
Morrison said that Zhou Enlai was a pioneer for US-China
relations, and it is of historical significance to keep
Kissinger's letter in the Museum.
</P>
<P>
Madame Zhou noted that in the previous period of time, there
were many activities in China and worldwide to mark the occasion,
believing that Premier Zhou's image will forever remain in the
hearts of Chinese people and of all people around the world.
</P>
<P>
She presented the UCAPET with a set of VCD "The Centenary of
the Birth of Zhou Enlai" commemorating the former Chinese premier
which she sponsored and a book of his poems and some other
writings with madame Zhou as the chief compiler.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Canadian Cooperative Symposium Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Chinese and Canadian
experts attended a symposium in Beijing today to jointly explore
ways of developing cooperatives in the face of increasing market
competition.
</P>
<P>
Lyle Vanclief, Canada's Minister of Agriculture who is visiting
China, attended the opening ceremony of the symposium which is
being co-sponsored by his ministry and the All-China Federation of
Supply and Marketing Cooperatives (ACFSMC).
</P>
<P>
Experts discussed the challenges and opportunities faced with
cooperatives because of fierce competition in both the domestic
and the international markets, the integration of the world
economy and, especially, the burgeoning of multi-national
companies.
</P>
<P>
Practices in many countries have proved that cooperatives can
only develop through reform, experts said, stressing that
cooperatives deeply rooted in the countryside and the communities
enjoy a unique influence in the development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Rural residents account for 80 percent of the Chinese
population, and members of Chinese cooperatives make up 80 percent
of the rural population.
</P>
<P>
Mu Li, vice president of ACFSMC, said that China is willing to
learn from foreign countries, he said, expressing his hope that
closer cooperation in personnel exchanges, economy and trade will
be carried out between cooperatives in China and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Vanclief said cooperatives, especially agricultural co-ops,
play an important role in the social and economic life of Canada.
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation between cooperatives in the two
countries will be beneficial to both, and expressed his conviction
that the present symposium will lay a foundation for further
commercial cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Ingestion of food and water
contaminated with disease-causing microorganisms commonly found in
human waste continues to cause major public health problems in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a published report on Tuesday, the Department of Health said
that the 11 confirmed outbreaks, with water as the cause of
infection, had downed at least 1,410 people and killed seven
others in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Most of the outbreaks occurred during the third quarter of last
year, when the long dry spell due to the El Nino phenomenon
started in the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the health department, food and waterborne
diseases occur all year round in the Philippines but an increase
in cases is observed during the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
This, the report said, can be attributed to the poor water and
drainage system and poor environmental sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization said that as much as 80 percent
of diseases in developing countries, including the Philippines,
are caused by the lack of safe water and adequate sanitation.

</P>
<P>
Vanclief, who is visiting China at the invitation of China's

</P>
<P>
He noted that China is undergoing fast changes, and this

with Chinese officials on scientific and technological
cooperation, and also emphasized coordination in mutual investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that he discussed with the Chinese side China's entry
into the World Trade Organization, and also the market access of
Canadian goods into China, noting "very good progress" has been

Canadian products into China, but also to discuss how to improve
two-way trade and investment, because trade and investment can
only be successful when worked in both ways.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Coup Report Leads to S. A. Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- South African National
Defense Force (SANDF) chief Georg Meiring Monday announced his
resignation amid the controversy about a fraudulent military
intelligence report he gave President Nelson Mandela two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
Barely an hour after Meiring's announcement, Mandela accepted
his request for a premature retirement with effect from May 31.
</P>
<P>
While acceding to the general's request "with regret," Mandela
said his decision was "appropriate and honorable."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he would name the new SANDF chief after
conferring with his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that SANDF chief of staff, Lieutenant-General
Siphiwe Nyanda, a former commander of the African National
Congress (ANC)'s military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), is the
most likely candidate.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his surprising quit, Meiring said: "I have, after
due consideration of all the facts... decided that it would be in
the best interests of the SANDF if I would ask the president to
suspend my contract and allow me to retire on early pension
without prejudice."
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old general, whose contract ends next April, said
his decision was related to a military intelligence report about
an alleged coup against the government.
</P>
<P>
The report, which Meiring presented personally to Mandela on
February 5, claimed that Nyanda, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,
Mandela's ex-wife and several other top political figures were
planning to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
It was suspected that by implicating Nyanda in the plot,
Meiring tried to extend his time in power.
</P>
<P>
The report also implicated ousted ANC leader and now
opposition United Democratic Movement (UDM) co-leader, Bantu
Holomisa, and suspended Foreign Affairs official Robert McBride
in the alleged coup. McBride was arrested in Mozambique in March
for alleged gun smuggling.
</P>
<P>
It was later learned that the report had been compiled on
information from a single source who has been found by a court to
be unreliable.
</P>
<P>
Suspicious of the serious allegations, Mandela on March 27
ordered the set-up of a three-member judicial commission, headed
by Chief Justice Ismail Mohammed, to investigate the compilation
and verification of the report as a matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
After calling senior officials from the SANDF and the
government as witnesses, the commission found last week that
Meiring's handling of the report was flawed and the report had no
substance.
</P>
<P>
The government said the alleged plot was a huge fabrication
and the report was aimed at destabilizing the current democratic
order. It said certain elements in the country were trying to
launch a disinformation campaign as the 1999 general election
draws near.
</P>
<P>
Mandela planned to brief senior security officers and
opposition parties on the commission's findings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Meiring had reportedly failed to explain
why he gave the report to Mandela without verification and why he
bypassed official intelligence structures, including the
Intelligence Coordinating Committee and Defense Minister Joe
Modise, who would probably have vetoed the report.
</P>
<P>
However, Meiring said Monday that his resignation was not an
acknowledgment that he had acted wrongly or with sinister
motives. He stressed he did so because of the controversy sparked
by the leakage of the report, not its contents.
</P>
<P>
Despite government confirmation that the contents of the
report would not be investigated further, Meiring said such a
probe would be done.
</P>
<P>
He said he was the individual who took the responsibility for
the mistrust unleashed by the inaccurate report.
</P>
<P>
"My position of trust has been unsettled by the report, which
leaves me no choice but to come to this decision... My early
retirement therefore is an effort to restore trust in... the
SANDF," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meiring, who joined the old South African Defense Force in
1959 and became its chief in 1993, was kept on in the post after
the 1994 general election.
</P>
<P>
Perceived as an outspoken "political soldier", Meiring had
publicly clashed repeatedly with the ANC before the 1994
election. The government has been under pressure from politicians
on the left to ditch Meiring since his appointment in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Albania Sees Lower Infant Mortality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 7 (Xinhua) - With improved medical conditions and
more education on hygiene, Albania has seen a drop in the infant
mortality rate in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate in 1997 was down nearly 1.3 percent from
that of 1992, Health Ministry officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality in 1997 declined to 22.5 per 1,000 from 35 per
1,000 five years ago, official statistics claim. Nevertheless, the
rate still tops the list of all European countries, and it is
three times that of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, much work remains ahead for Albania to lower its
infant mortality rate, officials stressed.

<HEADLINE> China's First Securities Investment Funds Warmly Greeted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The first two of China's
long-awaited securities investment funds met with positive
reception today upon listing in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The closed-end Jintai Fund and Kaiyuan Fund opened at
1.45 yuan and 1.37 yuan this morning, and closed at 1.41 yuan and
1.36 yuan. Both funds reported active trading at a turnover of
about eight million units each.
</P>
<P>
"The listing prices fell between the expected range, and are
reasonable," said Chen Jinling, Jintai Fund's manager and
a stock analyst with the Guotai Securities.
</P>
<P>
He said the investors are placing great hopes on the two funds,
citing the facts that the funds were 40 times oversubscribed and
warmly greeted by the investors today.
</P>
<P>
The two funds are hailed as the first two standardized
investment funds set up under the guidelines of the newly-issued
regulations governing securities investment funds. Worth two
billion yuan each, the funds are expected to invest 20 percent
of the capital into bonds, and 80 percent into stocks.
</P>
<P>
The buyers actually entrusted their personal savings to the
professional fund managers through the investment funds, which
promise a much higher yield of about 25 percent, compared to the
less than six percent return on bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the former investment funds which have much of their
capital mired in real estate and legal person's shares, the new
securities market-targeted investment funds have higher
liquidity, and guarantee more stable returns at fewer risks," said
a stock investor surnamed Zhou, after buying 2,000 units of the
Kaiyuan Fund.
</P>
<P>
Experts have seen much more besides the funds' role as a stable
and secure investment instrument. According to Xiao Zuoji, a noted
Chinese economist, the investment funds will prove to be the most
ideal way for the Chinese securities market to mature and
standardize.
</P>
<P>
"It will attract increasing personal funds into the capital
market, salvaging the fund-thirsty state enterprises. It will also
foster clusters of institutional investors in the Chinese stock
market and bring about fundamental changes there, curbing
overspeculation and irrational investing, and thereby stabilize

Germany dropped to 4.623 million in March, or 12.1 percent of the
total labor force, down from the February reading of 12.6 percent,
the German Labor Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in unemployment, which was mainly due to
traditional springtime job gains, was "unexpectedly strong" this
time, said Bernhard Jagoda, president of the Labor Office.
</P>
<P>
However, he also noted that the actual jobless figures still
remained at a post-war record high.
</P>
<P>
When based on seasonally-adjusted figures, the number of the
jobless dropped by 2,000 to 4.414 million in March.
</P>
<P>
While the job situation in the western half of the country
continued to improve, job losses in eastern Germany had not yet
touched bottom, the office said.
</P>
<P>
In western Germany, the jobless total went down by 11,000 to a
seasonally-adjusted 2.958 million in March, while in eastern
Germany, unemployment rose by 9,000 to 1.456 million.

CANBERRA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Australia's shock Davis Cup
defeat by Zimbabwe has caused a split in the team with Mark
Woodforde slaps Mark Philippoussis for refusing to play and then
turning up as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
Woodforde said relations between Philippoussis and the rest of
the team would take a long time to heal.
</P>
<P>
Woodforde, a Davis Cup veteran but primarily a doubles
specialist, was forced to play in the reverse singles against
Zimbabwe after world number four Pat Rafter dropped out because of
illness.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis had refused to play in the tie because of a
public feud with team captain John Newcombe. But Philippoussis
arrived as a spectator for the tie at late notice, and apparently
uninvited, to cheer on the team.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
here this afternoon with former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres.
</P>
<P>
As an old friend of the Chinese people, Jiang said, Peres has
made "unremitting efforts in promoting the development of the
friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries" when
he served as Israeli prime minister and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed his appreciation for Peres, who is the
honorary president of the Council for the Promotion of
Israel-China Relations, for his contributions to advancing the
peace process in the Middle East so as to achieve peace between
Israel and its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Jiang said that areas for Sino-Israeli
cooperation are "very broad, and with enormous potential."
</P>
<P>
"It's our common wish and is also in the fundamental interests
of the people of both countries to further strengthen the friendly
and mutually beneficial relations between China and Israel," said
Jiang, adding that China hopes to make joint efforts with Israel
to establish a relationship of long stability and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Middle East, Jiang said that it's a "wise
move" for Israel and the relevant sides of the Middle East to
choose negotiation as a way to solve their conflicts. "It also
accords with the historic trend," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China enjoys friendly relations with all the countries in the
Middle East region, and China will, by exerting its
influence, make great efforts in advancing the peace process of
the region as it has always been doing," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Peres expressed his gratitude to Jiang for the meeting, and
said that China has undergone great change since his visit five
years ago.

economic development and the improvement of the living standard in
your country," said Peres.
</P>
<P>
Peres expressed his satisfaction with the development of
Sino-Israeli relations, saying that Israel and China have had
"very good cooperation" in the fields of agriculture, culture and
technology during the past six years.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister said that China's efforts in
advancing the peace process of the Middle East is of "unusual
significance" as China is a permanent member of the Security
Council of the United Nations, and maintains good relations not
only with Israel but also with Arab countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The world is undergoing "very
deep" changes, hope and challenges are still facing the 21st
century, former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing more than 200 students at the Foreign Affairs
College today, the former Israeli Prime Minister who is
in Beijing for a goodwill visit to China, said that a
number of wars are running down, the world is entering a new age.
</P>
<P>
In the past, all the sources of wealth and strength came from
territories and natural resources, the size of land, which are
related to whether a nation is strong or poor, weak or powerful,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, all the sources of wealth and strength come from
science and technology, added peres, who is also honorary
president of the Council for the Promotion of Israel-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that no matter what color people are or where they
live, the modern opportunities of developing technology and
science and information will enable them to succeed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, markets, due to globalization, are even more
important than countries, and competition is worldwide, he said,
adding that it is necessary to focus on "economic issue", not "on
the importance of land and natural resources".
</P>
<P>
"So, we changed our strategy to make peace with our Arab
neighbors," said Peres, who is the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize winner
along with Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat. He also called the
Palestine issue "the most complicated issue".
</P>
<P>
For the sake of the younger generation and their future, it
is necessary to advance the Middle East peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the belief that economic exchanges will help
push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Israel-China relations, he said that China is a
very important country in the world and will soon be a power. He
said that China has supported the cause of peace, and that
relationship between the two countries is quite good.
</P>
<P>
Peres arrived here on April 3 and will end his China trip
tomorrow morning.

<HEADLINE> China Spells out Stance at IPU Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese delegation to an
annual conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Tuesday
spelled out China's stance on international issues in Windhoek,
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
"At present, significant and profound changes are continuing
to take place in the international situation, the most noticeable
of which is the accelerated and increasingly obvious movement
toward multipolarization," Li Shuzheng, head of the Chinese
delegation, said.
</P>
<P>
A copy of his speech was available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and development are the two main themes of today's
world. To seek peace and promote development and cooperation has
become an irresistible trend of the times," said Li, who is vice
chairperson of the Foreign Affairs Committee of China's National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
People all over the world are looking forward to the
establishment of a just and rational new international political
and economic order and longing for lasting peace and development
in the new century.
</P>
<P>
However, she pointed out, Cold War mentality still exists,
regional conflicts caused by ethnic, religious or territorial
disputes still occur from time to time. "The world is still far
from tranquil."
</P>
<P>
She said state-to-state relations should be based on the five
principles of mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and
peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
"Every country has the right to choose a road of development
in light of its own national conditions. No country should
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries under any
pretext.
</P>
<P>
"This is the political prerequisite for global and regional
security."
</P>
<P>
She said countries should strengthen their mutually beneficial
economic cooperation, level off inequalities and lift
discriminatory policies in economic exchanges and trade so as to
gradually narrow the gap between rich and poor states and attain
common prosperity. "This is the economic foundation for global
and regional security."
</P>
<P>
She said a practical way to realize global and regional
security is for all countries to strengthen consultation and
cooperation in the field of security, to enhance mutual
understanding and trust and seek peaceful settlements to their
differences and disputes.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed "deep concern" over the stalled Middle East peace
process and urged parties concerned to abide by relevant U.N.
resolutions and the "land for peace" principle.
</P>
<P>
She welcomed the peaceful solution to the Iraqi crisis and
urged the strict implementation of the memorandum of
understanding between Iraq and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
China is also concerned about conflicts and unrest in Africa,
she said, pointing out that developed countries should make more
effort to help Africa out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
She called for efforts to maintain the stability of financial
markets so as to ensure a steady economic growth in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
"With relatively weak economic foundation, developing
countries are most vulnerable to the impact and shock of an
adverse financial environment."
</P>
<P>
On human rights, Li said the issue is of universal
significance. But the protection of human rights must be
integrated with the reality of each and every country.
</P>
<P>
She said the Chinese nation has a long tradition of respecting
human dignity and value and today the Chinese people enjoy better
protection of human rights than ever before.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China has acceded to 17 international human
rights instruments. "Last October China signed the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. We intend to
sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
</P>
<P>
China has always stood for dialogue on human rights with other
countries to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with other
states and jointly promote the cause of human rights all over the
world.

Makerere University told a workshop last Thursday that local
herbalists are to be involved in teaching the students of

Makerere University is the most prestigious one in the country
and has trained many leaders and scientists such as Kenyan
president Daniel arap Moi and Julius Kambarage Nyerere, former
president of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the herbalists have more knowledge in certain
medicinal plants than me," the professor told the workshop aimed
at conserving medicinal plants and biodiversity. He urged the
local herbalists to publish their work.
</P>
<P>
Local herbalists accumulated abundant experience in thier
practice. But they have few opportunities to circulate their
knowledge. The professor assureed that the intellectual right of
the herbalists who promulgates their works would be protected.

medicine is effective for many diseases. He asserted that local
traditional medicine "will be the medicine of the next
millennium".

<P>
Uganda will soon get equipment to extract medicine from its
herbs on the industrial level. "The venture will cost at least
900,000 U.S. Dollars, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has at least 1,600 known medicinal herbs and a long
history of developing its traditional medicine. But the medicine
knowledge is only spread from a master to his apprentice in a
traditional way.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the National Association of Traditional
Herbalists has launched seminars to train traditional medicine
men publicly.

<HEADLINE> Debt Write-Off Process of Poor Countries Too Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, ADpril 7 (Xinhua) -- The African Forum and Network on
Debt and Development (AFRODAD) has charged that the process of
debt write-off of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCS) is
going much slower than it hase originally been anticipated, the
Zambian newspaper Financail Mail reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The AFRODAD said that this raises questions of whether or not
the debt write-off initiative will secure sustainable debt levels
for Africa's HIPCS.
</P>
<P>
It said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) remains the
largest single creditor and as such the IMF needs to be persuaded
to take its responsibility by ushering in more grant financial
resources throught the HIPCS enhanced structural adjustment
facility trust fund.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank and the IMF still remain closed to
participation of primary stakeholders in the formulation of debt
sustainability analysis in the different African countries in
spite of their 'participation policies'," it said.
</P>
<P>
Africa's debt have reached some 315 billion U.S. Dollars and
its implications is now somewhat widely understood, according to
AFRODAD.
</P>
<P>
The debt problem poses a threat to the structural changes and
a sustainable solution is needed to ensure that the debt problem
does not arise again and current process and borrowing is not
creating a new form of debt crisis, said the organization.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Back ACRI Won't Replace ECOMOG: Ghanaian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The African Crisis Response
Initiative (ACRI) sponsored by the U.S. will not help enhance
peacekeeping operation in west African in stead of replacing the
sub-regional force ECOMOG, said a Ghanaian officer.
</P>
<P>
Clayton Yaache of the ghanaian army said here at the weekend
that the U.S. initiative was a means to an end and not an end
itself.
</P>
<P>
Yaache is the leader of a group of students of the Ghana
Command and Staff College now on a visit in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, along with other African countries such as Senegal,
Uganda, Malawi,Mali and Ethiopia, has endorsed the training of
its troops by the U.S. under the ACRI.
</P>
<P>
According to Yaache, the training of an African crisis
response force does not in any way affect the existence of
ECOMOG, the Post Express quoted the Ghanaian officer as reporting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Yaache said, it would enhance the capacity of
countries within ECOMOG to effectively keep peace.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG would continue as a peacekeeping force after its
successful installation of democracy in Liberia and Sierra Leone,
he said, suggesting "We will be on standby and ensure the peace.
But if for any reason there is another operation, ECOMOG will
continue".
</P>
<P>
Yaache, who headed a 20-man delegation from Ghana comprising
12 students and eight directing officers, said, "If ACRI would
enhance future peacekeepng in the sub-region, so be it. But i
cannot see it completely replacing ECOMOG because there are other
countries that make up ECOMOG."
</P>
<P>
Currently, researchers at Nigeria's National War College are
studying the U.S.-sponsored initiative, aimed to find out the
real facts behind it.
</P>
<P>
It seems that Nigeria is in the view that what African
countries need in terms of peace keeping is logistics support
since many of them have been involved in one peacekeeping mission
or the other in many parts of thet world for some time.
</P>
<P>
A senior leader of the college said earlier that at the end of
the study, also being conducted in conjunction with some
organizations in Africa, real facts behind the initiative would
be revealed with a view to highlighting its implications on
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has expressed its hope that an all-African
peacekeeping force could be built with ECOMOG as the nuclues.

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire Accord on Bougainville to Be Signed: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer Tuesday said a formal ceasefire between
Bougainville rebels and the Papua New Guinea (PNG) government
could be signed later this month.
</P>
<P>
"The ceasefire arrangement is almost certain to be signed in
Arawa on Bougainville towards the end of this month," Downer told
the Australian parliament in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
Rebels on the island announced independence from PNG in 1990
and later the war between the rebels and PNG government troops
broke out.
</P>
<P>
A truce on Bougainville was agreed upon earlier this year after
talks in New Zealand. A New Zealand-led Truce Monitoring Group has
since helped to keep peace on the island, supported by Australian
Defense Force personnel.
</P>
<P>
Downer said "a final date is yet to be determined but certainly
before the end of this month and I very much hope to be present
myself for the signing, given the role Australia has played in
helping to facilitate this process."
</P>
<P>
Australia has pledged 87 million U.S. dollars in aid to restore
essential services and infrastructure on the shattered island.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia could take much of the credit for ending
the war between secessionist rebels on the island and Papua New
Guinea government forces and their allies on Bougainville.

<HEADLINE> IMF Makes No Progress in Regulating Currency Trading: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has not shown any progress in efforts to regulate
currency trading, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the IMF has promised to study Malaysia's proposal on
the matter, it has yet to make any suggestion, Mahathir told
reporters in Jitra in the northern state of Kedah, when asked to
comment on the latest development in Malaysia's proposal to
regulate currency trading following the financial crisis in the
region since last July.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why...so long as the currency fluctuates,
currency traders will make profits," he was quoted by the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that if Malaysia's currency was stable, currency
traders would not reap profits, and that was why they (currency
traders) were not interested in restoring the ringgit's value.
</P>
<P>
"Although the World Bank, IMF and all parties recognize our
strong economic fundamentals the ringgit still depreciates," he
said, adding the currency traders had their own views (on the
country's economic fundamentals) and were not swayed by statements
from the World Bank or anybody.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether his government would take further measures,
Mahathir said "I don't know what measures...we have done what we
should but the ringgit is still weak."
</P>
<P>
The local unit is now worth about 3.70 ringgit to one U.S.
dollar against 2.50 ringgit to the dollar nine months ago before
the financial crisis hit the country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Tobacco Farmers Protest Low Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's small-scale farmers who
produce the bulk of Burley tobacco Monday refused to sell their
crop to protest low prices at the Burley Marketing Floor, The
Herald daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the history of the Burley Marketing
Floor that small-scale growers, previously passively accepting
whatever price was offered, have cancelled a sale.
</P>
<P>
Prices were as low as 67 U.S. Cents a kilogram as agaisnt last
season's average price of 1.6 Dollars a kilo, which left the
farmers, the bulk of them communal, with no option but to cancel
their sales.
</P>
<P>
Flue-cured tobacco growers, who this season produced 220
million kg, have also been hit by a wave of low prices, and this
has resulted in some farmers withholding deliveries in
anticipation of improved prices within the next few weeks.

MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma (the Lower
House of Parliament) decided Tuesday to discuss President Boris
Yeltsin's appointment of Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister on
Friday, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will address some 20 representatives of leading

the debate will not be held until the Duma has discussed the
outcome of the meeting in the next two days, the Duma's Acting
Speaker Vladimir Ryzhkov said.
</P>

Kiriyenko may not have a 100 percent chance of being backed at
the Duma's plenary session, he said. "The situation remains quite
complicated so far, but serious consultations are under way," he
added.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin fired his entire government two weeks ago and
nominated 35-year-old Kiriyenko as the candidate for premier,

<HEADLINE> Large number of Kenyan Civil Servants Asked to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
reportedly asked some 19,500 civil servants to retire by the end
of June this year, the Kenya Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper quoted a source at the office of the
president as saying that the Directorate of Personnel Management
(DPM) had started working out modalities on how to implement the
retirement scheme in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
The retirement scheme affecting all cadres under the Public
Service Commission was part of the conditions given by the World
Bank for the release of development aid to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Under a voluntary early retirement scheme, the civil service
workforce amounting to some 500,000 has already reduced by some
86,112 staff and more than 100 million Dollars were spent for the
scheme, the source at the presidential office was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the DPM said the retirement scheme was too costly
for the government, noting that "unless the finances sought from
World Bank to fund the exercise were released, the program may
stall".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae told a
workshop on Monday that there was a need to trim government
departments which, he said, had led to unnecessary increase in
expenditures on administration and staffing.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders to Visit Lebanon over Israeli Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid are planing
separate visits to Lebanon for talks with the country's leaders on
the Israeli proposed conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Daily Star newspaper said Tuesday that Mubarak phoned
his Lebanese counterpart Elias Hrawi on Monday night to express
his unwavering support for Beirut over its stance on the Israeli
offer, and said he was contemplating a visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Israeli Cabinet for the first time in two
decades formally approved, with conditions, the United Nations
resolution 425, which calls for Israeli unconditional and
immediate withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It linked the implementation of the resolution with negotiated
security arrangements with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, the main power broker in the region, have
firmly rejected the offer, saying the resolution asks Israel to
leave Lebanon without any conditions, and therefore the strings
attached in the offer are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also accused Israel of attempting through
the offer to separate the Lebanese track from Syria in the peace
talks with Israel and instigating strife inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been asking Israel to withdraw its troops from the
Golan Heights, a strategic plateau captured by Israel in the 1967
Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
The joint stance taken by the two countries has won support
from the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid informed the Lebanese Foreign Ministry on Monday
that he will visit Lebanon and Syria on Thursday to hold talks
with the leaders of the two countries in order to draft a joint
response to the Israeli offer, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Israel now occupies a 1,200-square-kilometer area in south
Lebanon with the claimed aim of protecting its northern villages
and towns from Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attack.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Foreign Exchange Inflows Hard to Sustain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's foreign exchange inflows
in the first quarter of 1998 has been too little to sustain the
foreign exchange market, hence the continued depreciation of the
Kwacha against other currencies.
</P>
<P>
From January to March 20, inflows to the Bank of Zambia (BOZ),
the central bank, amounted to merely 3.921 million U.S. Dollars,
of which only 1.676 million Dollars came from donors and 2.245
million dollars from non-government sources, mainly
non-traditional exports and retentions.
</P>
<P>
BOZ statistics last week showed that the inflows have
been very minimal mainly due to reduced earnings from copper
sales, the biggest foreign exchange earner in Zambia, and
non-inflow of donor funds allegedly because of disagreement on
good governance issue.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Zambian government released 81.514 million
Dollars in the past months to service its external debt which
totals 7.2 billion Dollars, and to support other government
expenditure as well as the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has released 28.8 million Dollars (mainly in
last January) onto the foreign exchange market to beef up the
dwindling market so as to save the Kwacha from further
butchering.
</P>
<P>
This move, however, did nothing to change the situation as the
Kwacha continued depreciating from 1,330 last September to 1,700
Kwacha against the Dollar at present.
</P>
<P>
The continued dwindling in foreign exchange inflows may have
an adverse effect on the fragile economy as this may erode the
purchasing power of the Kwacha that may in turn force
manufacturers to push up prices of their goods, which will bring
a chain reaction in price spiral.
</P>
<P>
This, some analysts indicated, will cause high inflation rate
and economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the depreciation of the Kwacha to the
withholding of foreign exchange by donors due to displeasure with
the Zambian government over the imposition of four-month state of
emergency after last year's foiled military coup.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Polyester Cotton Yarn to Be Exported to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has been granted derogation
on the exportation of polyester cotton yarn into the European
Union with previous requirements regarding rules of origin now
waived.
</P>
<P>
The derogation stipulates that polyester-cotton yarn
originating from Zambia between June 1 this year and February 20
in the year 2002 will be exempted from the rules of origin
contained in the Lome Convention, reported Financial Mail on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Export Board of Zambia spokesman
Leonard Simwanda as saying that this means that the previous
requirements on the rules of origin contained in the Lome
Convention will now be waived on Zambia's exports.
</P>
<P>
The amount exempted over the specified period will be 3,500
tons per year.
</P>
<P>
The EU/ACP (Asian Caribbean and Pacific group) Lome
Convention, which expires in the 2000, is the largest trade
agreement helping the developing countries to expand their
exports through preferential access to the EU markets.
</P>
<P>
But the impending expiry of the convention has aroused debate
as to the future of these countries, especially on what the new
agreement will be like and weather the developing countries will
lose this advantage they had been granted by the EU.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bankruptcy Increases to Record High in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Bankruptcy filings in the
United States last year increased by 19.1 percent to a record high
of more than 1.4 million, according to the American Bankruptcy
Institute (ABI).
</P>
<P>
The record number was driven by consumer filings, which
accounted for 96 percent of all filings in 1997. Last year,
personal and family insolvencies, or non-business filings, hit a
record of more than 13.5 million, up 20 percent from 1996. By
contrast, business bankruptcy rose by only 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the ABI, an organization dedicated to
research and education on matters related to insolvency, one of
every 70 households in the United States filed for bankruptcy last
year, up from one in every 82 households a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the field noted that consumers are filing for
bankruptcy protection from their creditors in record numbers
despite low unemployment, tame inflation and strengthening family
income.
</P>
<P>
The trend departs from historical norms, which saw bankruptcy
rise and fall in sync with the business cycle. An analysis
prepared by a Washington D.C. attorney blames the shift on a
pro-debtor rewrite of the bankruptcy law in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The nation's states differ widely in their approach to
shielding a debtor's personal assets from creditors. Some are very
stingy, while others allow debtors to protect huge fortunes,
including multimillion-dollar residences.
</P>
<P>
Congress is looking into complaints by many creditors that the
bankruptcy system needs fixing.
</P>
<P>
But debtors and their sympathizers reject their claim,
asserting that families should not be turned into the streets.
</P>
<P>
The battle line for the two sides are drawing around two
provisions in the law, Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy
Code.
</P>
<P>
Chapter 7 is an option used in about 70 percent of the cases,
in which the debtor converts most household assets to cash. The
money is used to reimburse creditors in accordance with the
strength of their claims, leaving the debtor free to launch a
fresh and unencumbered start on life. But in most cases the
debtors have almost no assets bearing any cash value.
</P>
<P>
Chapter 13 allows debtors to retain their assets in return for
paying off creditors from future earnings in accordance with a
court-approved plan that usually remains in effect for three to
five years.
</P>
<P>
A bill now moving through the Senate would give courts a greater
role in determining which chapter should apply to debtors seeking
bankruptcy protection from creditors.

<HEADLINE> 4 Israelis Killed, 39 Wounded in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Four Israeli soldiers have been
killed and 39 others wounded in south Lebanon in the first three
months of this year during clashes with Lebanese guerrillas, the
Daily Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting statistics released by Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed
Islamic resistance force, the paper reported that eight militiamen
of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) were also killed.
</P>
<P>
On the guerrilla side, 16 anti-Israeli-occupation fighters lost
their lives during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, Israeli assaults on Lebanon,
including air raids, shelling and roadside bombings, totaled 112
in March, while Lebanese guerrillas conducted 114 operations
against Israeli and SLA troops in the Israeli occupied south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is spearheading a war against
Israeli troops and its ally SLA in south Lebanon, carried out 105
attacks in March alone, down from February's figure of 117, the
highest number in one month since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" in south
Lebanon in 1985 after two invasions, with the claimed aim of
protecting its northern part from cross-border guerrilla
attacks. It has since been bogged down in an attrition war with
resistance forces there.
</P>
<P>
Israel offered to pull out of Lebanon provided security
arrangements are worked out with Lebanese government. Beirut,
however, has rejected the offer, saying the U.N. Security Council
resolution 425 calls for unconditional and immediate Israeli
withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Export Fuel in 1999: Oil Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- As Nigerians have been suffering
from the acute fuel scarcity for weeks, the Ministry of Petroleum
Resources said Monday that the country is expected to export refined
oil products beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing in the capital Abuja, Minister Chief Dan
Etete said this could become possible as the federal government
has embarked on a program to solve the problems besetting the oil
sector once-and-for-all.
</P>
<P>
The recurrent crippling fuel crisis in Nigeria is mainly
attributed to the lack of maintenance of the country's four
aging refineries.
</P>
<P>
But the minister pledged that the refineries would have been
brought back to their normal production level by the time the
present administration leaves office in October this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry "are doing everything possible" to deal with the
persisting fuel scarcity, he said, adding "What we need is the
cooperation of all patriotic Nigerians".
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Etete was blaming for the problem on
"unpatriotic elements who indulge in hoarding and diversion of
the product (fuel)".
</P>
<P>
Vandals who are tampering with the fuel pipelines were making
the situation worse, said the minister, who just returned from
the emergency meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of the OPEC extra-ordinary meeting in Vienna,
he reiterated that the cut in Nigeria's daily quota by 125,000
barrels to 2.01 million barrels would not affect this year's
budget, a clear hint that the government will not review down the
budget as widely speculated.
</P>
<P>
As Africa's leading oil producer and exporter, Nigeria based
this year's budget revenue on the export of oil at 17 U.S.
Dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
When the budget was being drawn, exigencies such as the
present cut in production and the sharp fall in oil prices were
taken into consideration, Etete explained.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigeria is not panicking or in a panicky situation
because of the reduction, while assuring that it has nothing to
do with the domestic fuel consumption.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that this year's budget is not adversely affected,
Etete said he and Finance Minister Chief Anthony Ani have been in
close consultation.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges For Greater Efforts for Women's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) Tuesday called for greater efforts to protect women from
childbirth illnesses and other pregnancy-related complications.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF, in a report released here, said tens of thousands
of women across Asia die of childbirth illnesses and injuries each
year, while millions of others suffer from painful and often
life-long disabilities.
</P>
<P>
The report was timed to mark this year's "World Health Day"
which falls on April 7, with the theme of "Pregnancy Is Special:
Let's Make It Safe."
</P>
<P>
The report noted that pregnancy and childbirth are the leading
causes of death, diseases and disabilities among women of
reproductive age in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
While one in every 16 women in Africa risks dying from
pregnancy-related complications, one in 65 women risks the same in
Asia, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries with high maternal mortality rates include
Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Indonesia and the Philippines, according
to the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
"Making motherhood safe requires more than good quality
reproductive health services. Women must be empowered, and their
human rights -- including their right to good quality services and
information during and after pregnancy and childbirth -- must be
guaranteed," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Of all health statistics monitored by the WHO, maternal
mortality is one with the largest discrepancy between developed
and developing countries, said Dr. E. B. Doberstyn, WHO
representative in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said that while infant mortality is almost seven times
higher in developing countries, maternal mortality is on an
average 18 times higher.
</P>
<P>
Estimations based on the latest statistics of the WHO show that
while the rate of maternal deaths is 480 women per 100,000 live
births in developing countries, it is 27 women per 100,000 live
births in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
To help reduce the gap in women's health between various
countries, the WHO planned to launch a mass campaign to build
awareness and support for "safe motherhood" later Tuesday in
Washington, where experts will outline social and economic
implications of this global problem, according to WHO officials
based in Bangkok.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- This year, China will start
exporting a kind of millet used just for tributes to emperors
to Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The Gulong millet, which is a unique product of northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province, is claimed to be nutritious,
digestible and good for health. Local people call it the "food of
longevity".
</P>
<P>
The product has long been used as a gift for relatives by
local people, because it was grown in a small area with low yields.
</P>
<P>
The Zhaoyuan County government and the Jitai Company of
neighboring Jilin Province will form a joint venture to produce
the millet, according to Tian Fengchun, the county magistrate.
</P>
<P>
They will spend 27 million yuan on the construction of a
6,600-ha farm, an irrigation system and a processing plant with an
annual production capacity of 20,000 tons. All the products will
be exported to Hong Kong and Southeast Asian countries from
October on, Tian said.

LAS VEGAS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The annual trade show for the
National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) opened here Monday with
a variety of digital broadcasting technologies.
</P>
<P>
More than 90,000 broadcasters are in Las Vegas to discuss
technology for producing radio and television programs while tens
of thousands of representatives from major electronic companies
are trying to sell cameras, transmitters, monitors and other
equipment needed in the transformation of the broadcasting system.
</P>
<P>
At the Las Vegas Convention Center, where the four-day show is
held, visitors marveled at digital TV sets receiving digital
pictures provided by Las Vegas KLAS Channel 8, the world first
digital broadcasting station.
</P>
<P>
Developing digital technology has been on the NAB's agenda for
years. Stations in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Las Vegas,
Dallas and other five largest cities will start broadcasting
digital signal before the deadline of May 1999. All other stations
will begin digital broadcasting no later than May 2002.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Minister Calls for Cut in Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae has called for a 20 percent annual cut in civil service
salaries and allowances, local press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop on economic performance and public
sector management held here on Monday, Nyachae said the
government cannot afford to meet the wage bill of over 1.05
billion U.S. Dollars every year, or 39 percent of ordinary
revenues.
</P>
<P>
He noted that last year's wage agreement with teachers, who
were granted salary increases of up to 200 percent over three
years, was not sustainable.
</P>
<P>
The national budget and the economy will feel the crunch in
the next three years as the government was expected to meet
higher teachers' pay and allowances in five phases, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae stressed the need to trim government departments which
led to poor coordination and an unnecessary increase in
expenditures on administration and staffing.
</P>
<P>
The proposed cut in government departments is shall help to
reduce government expenditure on salaries and allowances by 20
percent a year, which will release about 210 million Dollars for
redeeming domestic debt, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's domestic debt increased from 1.8 billion Dollars by
June last year to 2.3 billion Dollars by the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae stated that the Public Investment Program for 1998/99
contained 1,226 on-going projects and 441 new ones which needed
eight billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
There were no enough resources available to complete even 20
percent of the on-going projects in the portfolio within the next
three years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae attributed the current economic strain in Kenya to
withholding of foreign aid and rampant corruption in government
departments.
</P>
<P>
"When the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)
program lapsed in August 1997, we lost a direct IMF
(International Monetary Fund) loan of 175 million Dollars," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A more serious consequence of the suspension of ESAF program
was the sudden jump of Treasury Bill interest rates from 19 to 27
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this development, he said, the expenditure on
domestic interest increas d by about 30 percent compared to the
budgeted levels.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Southeast Asia May Face Worst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asians are beset with the
nightmare of forest fires, which have eaten up tens of thousands
of hectares of forests in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and
Thailand since January, and led to severe air pollution in the
region.
</P>
<P>
This year's forest fires in Southeast Asia could be "one of the
greatest ecological disaster of the millennium," if the fires
could not be contained quickly, Klaus Topfer, executive director
of the U.N. Environment Program, warned recently.
</P>
<P>
Actually, such a warning is becoming a reality, as forest fires
are continuing and smog is worsening in most Southeast Asian
nations, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Although fires have been reportedly under control in Thailand,
in the Philippines, the government is still seeking assistance
from Australia, Canada and the United States in putting out forest
fires on the island of Palawan, the Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires have hit eight provinces in the Philippines from
January to April, and a total of 22,594 hectares of forest lands
were destroyed, according to the National Disaster Coordinating
Council.
</P>
<P>
The affected provinces include Benguet, Oriental Mindoro,
Palawan, Negros Occidental, Zamboanga del Norte, Davao del Norte,
Davao Oriental and Davao del Sur.
</P>
<P>
However, other reports said that in Palawan alone, about 30,000
hectares of forest were damaged by the fires, which started in
mid-March by farmers practicing the traditional slash and burn
method.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Malaysia is no better. Fires have been burning
in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, where at least 1,000 hectares
of forest were lost. The culprits are local timber companies
diversifying into palm oil, in order to take advantage of buoyant
prices.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other Southeast Asian countries, the disaster in
Indonesia is the worst in the region. Since mid-January, forest
fires in Sumatra and East Kalimantan came back. The latest
official figures show that fires in East Kalimantan have destroyed
138,030 hectares of forest, plantation and bushland in the last
three months.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the real damage to Southeast Asian countries is
not only the loss of thousands upon thousands of hectares of
forest, but the haze which is affecting environment of the region.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Southeast Asia May Face Worst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, the haze from Indonesia's fire affected Southeast
Asian nations' industrial production, tourism, air transportation
and fishing, and cost the region 1.384 billion U.S. dollars, the
World Wide Fund for Nature estimated in a February report.
</P>
<P>
This year, the haze has already affected disaster areas of
Southeast Asian countries. In Miri, an oil-town in Malaysia's
Sarawak State, nearly 200 schools have been closed indefinitely
since March 30 when the air pollution index surged past critical
levels to 620, as a reading over 500 is considered very hazardous.
</P>
<P>
Officials blamed the haze on local fires and fires in
Indonesia's East Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
In Mindanao, the Southern Philippines, people have also
experienced the haze from local fires and Indonesian forest fire.
</P>
<P>
But, experts said, this year's major haze threat will still
come from Indonesia because the situation there is far more
critical than in any other Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
They said that for the moment, the northeast monsoon is blowing
the smoke away from Indonesia's northern neighbors, but everything
will change when the southwest monsoon begins in July.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to avert one of the century's worst ecological
disaster, environment ministers of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) met in Brunei last Saturday and discussed a
package of measures to combat smog from Indonesian forest fires.
</P>
<P>
The ministers proposed that fires in East Kalimantan be
contained rather than any attempt made to put them out.
</P>
<P>
They planned to establish two special fire-fighting units for
Kalimantan, Sumatra and Riau, the hotbeds of the fire which has
sent smoke over much of the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to set up a central revolving fund
from regional and international contributions.
</P>
<P>
However, these measures may far from enough to contain fires in
Indonesia, since the country has limited financial resources due
to an economic crisis and its neighbors could hardly provide
assistance when they are also being hit by the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Hoax Sends Harare Airport in Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Eighty passengers on board of a
South African Airways (SAA) Airbus flight from Johannesburg were
detained for several hours at Harare International Airport on
Monday for security checks following a bomb hoax, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Harare airport officials said they received a call from the
captain of the SAA flight which said one of the passengers was
believed to be carrying a bomb.
</P>
<P>
All passengers were detained in the local domestic terminal
while they identified their luggage during security checks.
</P>
<P>
Police and bomb disposal unit with sniffer dogs were used
during the operation.
</P>
<P>
All security personnel were deployed on full alert. Plain
clothes officers cordoned off the airport and patrolled around
both terminals and waiting lounges.
</P>
<P>
Harare International Airport Manager Karikoga Kaseke confirmed
the incident, saying it had been a hoax.
</P>
<P>
The captain of the SAA flight received information on his way
to Harare from his company that a certain female from Durban had
telephoned the SAA in Johannesburg that his flight from
Johannesburg to Harare was carrying a bomb, Kaseke said.
</P>
<P>
"The flight was already mid-air and the most logical thing for
the captain to do was to proceed to Harare and he informed us of
the bomb threat some 35 minutes before landing," said Kaseke.
</P>
<P>
Kaseke said all rescue and fire tenders were summoned to be on
standby including those from government service.
</P>
<P>
The bomb disposal unit made a detailed search of the plane for
almost an hour and nothing was found, he said. The plane was
declared safe by 13:30 hours, after a further check, Kaseke said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 a tipsy South African national was arrested at the
airport for claiming he possessed a substance for making

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Brace for More Palestinian Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police are bracing for
renewed violence Tuesday after they shot dead a Palestinian youth
overnight at a checkpoint in northern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian was passing the Kalandiya checkpoint driving a
car suspected of being stolen in Israel when Israeli border police
ordered him to stop.
</P>
<P>
Police said the man ignored the order and accelerated to
escape. The police gave a chase. The car hit two police cars
before the police opened fire and killed the driver. Another
passenger inside the car was not hurt and escaped on foot in the
direction of the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Following the man's death, local Palestinian residents rioted
by throwing stones at the Israeli soldiers and policemen.
Jerusalem police chief Yair Yitzhaki, who came to the site to
inspect, was lightly hurt by stones and was treated on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The police said they are investigating the incident to
determine if the killed man was involved in terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli woman passenger was lightly injured Monday night
when a bus she was riding came under stone attacks by Palestinians
at the Damascus Gate to the Old City of East Jerusalem. Another
bus was also attacked by stones.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of major Jewish holiday of Passover, extra security
forces have been deployed at border crossings and public places
to brace for more Palestinian violence and possible terror
attacks by the militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).
</P>
<P>
Hamas has vowed to avenge the death of its bombmaker Muhei
Eddine Sharif, whose body was found inside a car exploded in
Ramallah on March 29.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority announced Monday that its
investigation showed that Sharif was killed by fellow militants in
an internal feud, but Hamas rejected the conclusion and continued
to hold Israel responsible for Sharif's killing.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Residents Shun Commitment to Cremation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only a dozen people signed their names on a banner calling for
using paper coffins and cremation outside the city's crematory and
cemetery on April 5, the traditional day for Chinese to sweep the
graves of their ancestors and pay respect for the dead, according
to Monday's Yangcheng Evening News that arrived here today.
</P>
<P>
The name-signing activity was initiated by students from the
South China University of Science and Engineering who came to the
cemetery before 8 a.m. and put up the slogan "saving wood and
protecting environment."
</P>
<P>
By noon time, April 5, a little more than ten people including
a boy of six signed the banner. More than 300,000 people visited
the cemetery that day, the most in recent ten years, according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The students also did a survey among 2,000 people, asking their
opinions on cremation. The result showed 83 percent of those
surveyed were in favor of cremation while only 10 percent showed
disapproval.
</P>
<P>
But even cremation supporters did not like the idea of making
commitment of any sort, such as signing their names. An old man
said he was in favor of cremation but would not practise it himself.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is known for its sticking to the old practice of
burying people and for its funeral rituals. The cremation rate in
the province is estimated at 23.5 percent, or 10 percentage points
lower than the nation's average. In several cities, the rate is
below 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a move to save its farmland by changing some traditional
funeral practices, the province has decided to halt the practice
of burying the dead starting this year.

The container terminal project at the Chittagong port, 224
kilometers southeast of here, with a proposed cost of 500 million
dollars, is another big project, he said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations for the two power plants, and the western
region integrated power project for power generation and
distribution were at the advance stage. And these projects would
fetch about 2 billion dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year, he
stated.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bans Import of Assault Firearms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday ordered to ban the import of 1.6 million rifles on the
ground that the weapons were military-style ones unnecessary for
the Americans to use them for hunting and sporting.
</P>
<P>
"These are military weapons, weapons of war," said Clinton, who
made the order to bar 58 high-powered, foreign-made guns with
large-capacity magazines after a finding that they failed to meet
an exemption to U.S. gun laws as a sporting rifle.
</P>
<P>
Most of the affected guns were variations of the AK-47 and Uzi
semiautomatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
"They were never meant for a day in the country and they are
certainly not meant for a night on the streets," Clinton said at
the White House in announcing the decision.
</P>
<P>
Press secretary Mike McCurry said the announcement was made
"within the context of a nation that is still grieving" from the
recent schoolyard shootings in Jonesboro, Arkensas, that left
five killed and 11 wounded.
</P>
<P>
However, the weapons that the school-boys used would not be
covered because they were made in the United States, not imported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said foreign gun makers were making "minor cosmetic
modifications" to skirt the law. To those manufacturers, he said,
"You can read the fine print in our law and our regulations all
you want and you can keep making your minor changes. But we're
going to do our best to keep our people alive and stop you from
making a dollar the wrong way."
</P>
<P>
The decision to ban the weapons makes permanent a temporary ban
that the administration imposed last November on assault weapons.
The order follows a Treasury Department review of 59 weapons.
</P>
<P>
Firearms importers had permits to ship in nearly 600,000
altered guns, and applications were pending for 1 million more.
The administration's action prevents the sale of those weapons.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand's Dilemma on Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a caricature published in a local newspaper Monday,
which reflects the sentiment of the Thai people.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Thai finance sector itself was in a love-hate
dilemma towards the entries of foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
The financial storm, which swept Thailand last July, has left
the country's banking sector shattered. The Thai government has to
clean up the messes with the help from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Under the IMF's prescription, Thailand began its big operation
on the ailing financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government led by Chuan Leekpai closed 56 of 58
suspended financial institutions and took over four banks which
were in poor condition soon after it took office last November.
</P>
<P>
The country's 15 commercial banks were required to greatly
increase their capitals, since the devaluation of the baht and
lands, which banks took as collaterals, have made their
non-performing loans soar.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, to promote Thai banks to the international standard
by the year 2000, the Bank of Thailand, the country's central
bank, is considering introducing tighter provisioning measures,
including changing the definition of non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed measures, the non-performing loans of Thai
banks will account for 40 percent of their total loans.
</P>
<P>
It is natural that local banks turned to their foreign
counterparts when seeking funds from domestic clients, who are
also cash-strapped, has been proved to be extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
A number of commercial banks announced their recapitalization
plans recently, which showed that many banks have been or will
inevitably be taken over by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The Development Bank of Singapore bought 50.27 percent of the
stake in Thai Danu Bank, while the ABN-Amro Bank of the
Netherlands followed suit by taking over 75 percent of the stake
of Bank of Asia.
</P>
<P>
ABN-Amro said it will buy all the stake of Bank of Asia by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under its recapitalization plan, the Thai Farmers Bank, the
country's second largest, allowed a 49-percent foreign
shareholding instead of the previous 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the largest bank, Bangkok Bank, issued 400 million
new shares, mainly to foreign buyers, allowing the foreign
shareholding to increase from 25 percent to 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimated that under the central bank's requirement of
capital increase, half of the local banks will see the majority of
their stake go into foreign hands.
</P>
<P>
Among the remaining 35 financial institutions, nine have been
taken over by foreigners, while the others were negotiating with
foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
It is widely acknowledged that foreign funds are indispensable
in reviving Thailand's financial sector and the economy as a
whole. That is why the government and Thai banks are making every
effort to lure more foreign banks and enterprises into the local
market.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some Thai people fear that the country may be
degraded into an economic colony of western countries. That is a
dilemma for the Thai banks as well as for the country at present.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Meets French Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
said Monday that China would like to make concerted efforts with
France to further promote friendly and beneficial cooperation on
all aspects.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, Zhu said that
the relations between the two countries are developing fast along
the direction set by the Sino-Franco joint declaration. China and
France are carrying out positive cooperation in the political,
economic, scientific, cultural and military fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
More important, Zhu said, the joint declaration aiming to
establish a comprehensive partnership will escort the bilateral
relations into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that the Franco-Sino relations have entered its
best period. As a significant event in the bilateral relations,
Zhu's current two-day visit to France will help implement the
Franco-Sino joint declaration, he added
</P>
<P>
The joint declaration was signed by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and his French equivalent Jacques Chirac in Beijing last May.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also expressed satisfaction that Jospin
continues the friendly policies toward China.
</P>
<P>
As a friend of China's, France is closely watching the
development in China, Jospin responded.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese economy is poised for a new take-off on the basis
of a broader opening to the world, and China is playing an
increasing role on the international stage," Jospin said. "These
will help realize a new balance in international relations."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two premiers also agreed to strengthen
economic ties, particularly in the fields of energy and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"French enterprises are very competitive and capable of
transferring advanced technologies through long-term and strategic
cooperation to China," the French premier noted as Zhu invited
French entrepreneurs to invest in China.
</P>
<P>
Both believed that trade between the two countries should reach
a higher level through common efforts.
</P>
<P>
Jospin gave a banquet after the meeting in honor of Zhu, who
will end his week-long trip to Britain and France and leave for
Beijing on Tuesday.

<P>
 Training Courses
</P>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- In view of the economic woe, many
educational institutions are offering learn-first-pay-later terms
to draw students to enroll in expensive courses, the Bangkok Post
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
People who enroll in training courses are now offered three-
or six-month installment terms.
</P>
<P>
According to Suphannee Somboontham, deputy director of
Chulalongkorn University's continuing education program, the terms
were being offered following the requests from many students and
applicants.
</P>
<P>
The move is proving a success in drawing a large number of
cash-strapped people, who want to improve their skills by taking
short-term courses, which are very expensive.
</P>
<P>
Suphannee said a 170-hour computer program development course
costs 54,000 baht (1,350 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
After the learn-first-pay-later method was introduced,
applications poured in as some 1,500 people applied for the 1,200
seats, she said.
</P>
<P>
Similar terms have been made available at assumption
university's education center. Last semester, 80 students paid by
monthly installment, and the director expects a sharp rise in next
semester.
</P>
<P>
Each student is charged 20,000-40,000 baht (500-1,000 dollars)
in tuition fees per semester in the assumption university.
</P>
<P>
Students said that the installment method enabled low-income
earners to improve their skills through expensive training
courses.
</P>
<P>
A widening of the payment system would put further education
within reach of more low-income people and others badly hit by the
economic slump, a student said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Tourist Department
is pushing hard to expand its share of the Russian tourist market,
the local newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the auspices of the Ceylon Tourist Board, 12 Sri Lankan
tour operators and hotels participated in Moscow International
Travel and Tourist Fair this year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 3,618 Russian tourists visited Sri Lanka
last year, an increase of 21 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Although this is only about one percent of the total tourist
arrivals in the country, Russian tourists spend an average of 55
U.S. dollars per person per day, which are three times higher than
the average spending of all tourists in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the beaches and rich culture which attract the
Russian tourists, the traditional friendship established between
the two countries during the period of the cold war, is considered
as a major attraction, Colombo hotels sources said
</P>
<P>
A permanent resident representative is reportedly to be
appointed soon for the Russian tourist market and a Russian team
is expected to visit Sri Lanka to promote Russian films in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The sources believed that the true potential of Russian tourist
to Sri Lanka is ten fold of the present tourists figure.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization has
set up a special fund to help Southeast Asian nations tide over
the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Samlee Pliambangchang, a WHO official responsible for
Southeast Asian affairs, said the fund initially set 2 million
U.S. dollars for immediate assistance and technical support.
</P>
<P>
The WHO is to seek cooperation from donor agencies and other
international organizations in helping Southeast Asian countries,
particularly in obtaining basic necessities such as drugs and
medical devices, Tuesday's Bangkok Post quoted Dr. Samlee as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the WHO will give special attention to Indonesia which
is most affected by the crisis and is expected to face a shortage
of drugs.
</P>
<P>
The organization, he said, will ask India, a major Asian
producer of raw materials, to provide drugs on credit to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
As for Thailand, Dr. Samlee said, technical assistance will be
provided in analyzing short and long-term measures required to
cope with health impacts due to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
WHO officials have said most of the health consequences
resulting from the economic crisis in Southeast Asia are not yet
manifested, therefore the organization should prepare itself to
respond to the health problems which have direct impact on the
public.
</P>
<P>
Thai Public Health Ministry recently set up a "health
intelligence unit" to cope with worsening health problems.
</P>
<P>
Pakdi Pothisiri, deputy permanent secretary for public health,
said the unit would coordinate with other state agencies,
including the National Economic and Social Development Board, the
Foreign Ministry and the Finance Ministry, in analyzing the
consequences of the economic crisis and propose measures to

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sees Hike in Coconut Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Coconut Authority
(PCA) is targeting 3.5 million metric tons of coconut production,
in copra terms, by the year 2005, local television reports said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's coconut has improved and the prospects for an
increase in coconut farmers' income are bright with the help of
new technologies for coconut production and processing, PCA
administrator Virgilio David was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the PCA's plan, he coconut production is expected to
increase from 2.5 million metric tons to about 3 million metric
tons by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The PCA's coconut industry development plan is focused on
increasing farm production and productivity for the benefit of
millions of coconut farmers.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines remains the biggest supplier of coconut,
supplying about 60 percent of world-traded coconut products. About
80 percent of the country's coconut production goes to the
international market, while the remaining 20 percent is for
domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Statistics Office, coconut product
exports rose 2 percent to 173 million U.S. dollars in the first
two months of the year from the year-ago 169.8 million dollars.
Coconut exports include copra, coconut oil, desiccated coconut and
copra meal or cake.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Allows Freezed Banks to Operate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
allow the seven Freezed banks to operate again after they have
repaid the Bank Indonesia (BI) liquidity funds, a government
official said.
</P>
<P>
"The seven banks whose operation licenses have been revoked can
resume their activities if they can restore their own financial
viability and return the BI (central bank) liquidity funds they
have used," Chairman of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency
(IBRA)Iwan Prawiranate said here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the government announced the suspension of seven
private commercial banks and placing of another seven banks under
the management of IBRA, saying the move is part of the ongoing
banking reforms to restore its reputation and regain the
confidence of people at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Iwan said the operations of the seven banks were frozen because
they had been using liquidity funds of BI in excess of 500 percent
of their paid-up capital and equal to or in excess of 75 percent
of their total assets.
</P>
<P>
The other seven banks placed under IBRA control had been using
BI liquidity funds totaling more than 2 trillion rupiah (about 240
million U.S. dollars) and also in excess of 500 percent of their
total equity.
</P>
<P>
IBRA deputy chairperson Rind Suwandi also said the IBRA hoped
the government to take over the equity of the seven banks now
under the agency's management so that they can become healthy
again.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BI Governor Syahril Sabirin said that no deadline
had been given to the troubled banks now under supervision of
IBRA.
</P>
<P>
"Let us just wait and see their development. Hopefully they can
be healthy and sound soon," Antara quoted the governor as saying.
</P>
<P>
As many as 54 troubled banks now are under the supervision of
IBRA, said the governor.
</P>
<P>
According to a monetary reform agreement signed last year
between the Indonesian government and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), the Indonesian government had closed down 16 private
banks at the end of October last year in a bid to restore the
healthy operation of the financial system and improve the
efficiency of the country's banking industry.

<HEADLINE> Russian Landscape Paintings to Be Exhibited in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-six Russian landscape
paintings of Isaak Levitan and his contemporaries will be
exhibited in the China National Art Gallery April 10-28, according
to an official from China's Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference for the exhibition Monday, Xi Jingzhi,
professor of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, said that in the
second half of the 19th century the Russian landscape school had
reached its peak.
</P>
<P>
Levitan, who died at 39, was representatives of landscape
painters in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech, Russian ambassador to China Igor
A. Rogachev said Levitan's landscape paintings compare favorably
with the poetry of Alexander Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov, with
prose of Nikolay Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy, with music of Peter
Tchaikovsky and Sergey Rakhmaninov.
</P>
<P>
The total 86 works, which come from four local museums in
Russia, includes the masterpieces of Levitan and other masters

<HEADLINE> WB Says Indonesia to Implement Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank envoy said that
Indonesia will implement the economic reforms agreed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), as it is important to gain
international and domestic market confidence.
</P>
<P>
"I have a great confidence. The government is negotiating the
program, and it is reflecting seriousness in implementing it,"
World Bank Vice President for Asia Pacific Region, Jean-Michel
Severino said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Severino made his response to international community doubt on
the country's willingness in implementing the reform program
negotiated with the IMF, Antara News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiation between the Indonesian government and the IMF that
will be over in the next few days is expected to result in a
strong and credible package, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been negotiating here since March 18 to
review Indonesia's economic reform program tied to the IMF's 43
billion U.S. dollar aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
The IMF gave the first 3-billion-dollar tranche to Indonesia in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the second 3-billion-dollar tranche was delayed
pending a review of the progress made by the Indonesian government
in implementing the IMF-prescribed economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank's country director for Indonesia,
Dennis de Tray said the government should also recognize that
there is no magic medicine to go through the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank plans to disburse 4.5 billion dollars of fund
over the next three years to support Indonesia's economic recovery
and help it return to growth and development.
</P>
<P>
The fund will emphasize a framework for macroeconomic
stability, financial reform, competition policy and regulatory
reform, sustained economic growth and the setting of social safety
nets for the poor and other vulnerable groups.
</P>
<P>
Of the total pledge, the World Bank will contribute 2 billion
dollars to support a financial sector restructuring program this
year.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Province Bans Traditional Burials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- In a move to save its farmland by
changing some traditional funeral practices, south China's
Guangdong Province has decided to halt the practice of burying the
dead.
</P>
<P>
From this year, the province will no longer give permission for
most burials and will encourage cremation of the dead, according
to Saturday's Yangtze Evening News, and will no longer give
permission for new cemeteries, which have become a fairly
lucrative business in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is known for its sticking to the old practice of
burying people and for its funeral rituals. The cremation rate in
the province is estimated at 23.5 percent, or 10 percentage points
lower than the nation's average.
</P>
<P>
In several cities, the rate has remained below 5 percent, while
in Shenzhen, the prosperous special economic zone, the rate
climbed to 97.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial civil affairs department, about
270,000 people have been buried each year in recent years,
resulting in an annual loss of at least 266 hectares of land. And
in some places, people have destroyed forests to make room for the
dead, in some cases building elaborate cemetaries for their own or
for family members' use in future.
</P>
<P>
Although the provincial government is determined to halt this
practice, one official says that the road to reform is going to be
a bumpy one.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Limit Coal Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Poland plans to restrict the amount
of coal imports in a bid to protect its own coal industry.
</P>
<P>
The Polish newspaper Law and Economy reported Monday that
initially, the country's general customs administration will
impose quality checks on imported coal following Economic Ministry
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Poland, the fourth largest coal producer in the world, has seen
a slump in production in recent years due to rising costs and has
turned to imported coal.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's coal industry lost more than 500
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To help revitalize the industry, the Polish government this
year plans to shut down a number of loss-making coal mines and lay
off 30,000 miners.

<HEADLINE> Rain Aids Farmers, But Still Drought Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The drought that has plagued north
China's farms for months and threatened major winter wheat growing
areas has eased, according to an official from the State
Drought-Prevention Office (SDPO).
</P>
<P>
Rain this month and last has brought an average of 20 to 30
millimeters of precipitation to most of north China's winter wheat
producers between the Yellow and the Huaihe rivers, with some
areas receiving an average of 40-60 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the growth of winter wheat in China's major
producing areas is as good as that of the same period in 1997 when
there was a bumper summer harvest, said the SDPO official.
</P>
<P>
"Rainfall has essentially eased the drought threatening the
growth of winter wheat in northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui
provinces and most parts of Henan, Shandong, Shanxi and Shaanxi."
</P>
<P>
The official said the rains have not only been beneficial to
winter wheat and other transplanted seeds but that the moister soil
has made spring sowing much easier.
</P>
<P>
While optimistic about the soil moisture brought by the recent
rainfalls, one in mid-March, the other between the end of March
and April 2, the SDPO official cautioned farmers not to ignore the
possibility of worse drought to come, perhaps in May.
</P>
<P>
At present, 11 million hectares of farmland to be used for
crops sown in spring and reaped in autumn are suffering from poor
soil moisture because of severe drought in previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three weeks, eastern parts of northeast China,
the country's largest autumn harvest area and most important
commodity grain producer, received only 10-20 millimeters of
rainfall. Although enough to improve soil moisture, it was not
enough to alleviate the drought there.

<HEADLINE> Study Calls For Higher Agriculture Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Latest research shows a
significant shortfall and a year-on-year decline in China's
investment in agricultural science and technology, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
This fall-off has resulted in a brain drain and decreasing
scientific yields, said the survey, conducted by the Agricultural
Economics Institute under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, funds allocated to agricultural scientific research
have had a slight increase in some years and decreased in others,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
On average, State financial investment fell by 0.8 percent a
year during the 1985-95 period.
</P>
<P>
However, when added to input from the scientific organizations
themselves, investment totalled 5.2 billion yuan (626 million
U.S. dollars) in 1996, compared with 1.4 billion yuan in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In overall terms, investment more than tripled. However,
average annual growth was just 2.5 percent in real terms, the
survey reported.
</P>
<P>
Even in 1996, when the Agriculture Law and the Law on
Scientific Advancement were both in effect, the increase in funds
allocated to agricultural science and technology lagged far behind
the growth in investment in other fields.
</P>
<P>
"The results were worse than we expected", said Ma Shiqing,
director of the Science, Technology and Quality standards
Department of the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the poor situation demonstrated by the
findings is likedly to lead to new measures and greater fundings
by the ministry and other sources.
</P>
<P>
The survey concluded that the government should increase
investment in agricultural science and technology by eight percent
annually. This would allow the achievement of the ambitious goal
of making China self-sufficient in food by 2030 when the
population is expected to reach 1.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Dips in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' inflation rate, as
measured by the consumer index, declined a bit in March to 7.3
percent from an 18-month high of 7.4 percent in February this
year, according to the latest report from the National Statistics
Office.
</P>
<P>
In the report published Tuesday, Socio-economic Planning
Secretary Cielito Habito said the slowdown was a result of the
government's efforts in addressing the price situation.
</P>
<P>
But the latest inflation figure was higher than an earlier
projected target of less than 7 percent by the government for
March.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Fenix, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, attributed the slight decline in inflation level to
the oil price rollback ordered by the Energy Regulatory Board.
</P>
<P>
Fenix also cited the lower campaign spending as another
contributory factor to the lower inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
But many economists were still sticking to their double-digit
inflation projection in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso has fallen more than 30 percent since its
effective devaluation in July last year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pak-Canada Relations to Grow Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Canada will further
enhance their existing friendly and cooperative relations in
various fields, particularly in trade and economic areas.
</P>
<P>
This was emphasized by both the countries during a four-day
state visit to Pakistan by Canadian Governor General Romero
Leblanc, which concluded on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Leblanc was the first head of state from Canada to have visited
this South Asian nation during the last half a century, although
Canada established formal diplomatic relations with Pakistan
within two weeks of the inception of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Among the entourage of the Canadian Governor General were many
business men. This indicated Canada's great interest in developing
trade and economic relations with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
At a business luncheon held in honor of Leblanc, Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said that his country attached great
importance to "translating deep friendship with Canada into a
mutually beneficial and vibrant economic cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Sharif made special reference to the government's newly
announced investment policy, saying "all sectors of the economy,
including agriculture, service industry, infrastructure and social
sector are open for investment on repatriable basis."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has taken attractive investment
incentives, and foreign investment enjoy complete protection under
laws in the country, Sharif added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was confident that with continued efforts by both the
governments and business people, the current two-way trade and the
level of Canadian investment in Pakistan will be increased
manifold.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Pakistan, Leblanc and his party held
wide-ranging talks with the Pakistani leaders and business men.
The two countries expressed their strong desire to further the
mutual beneficial economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Canada are now working together on environmental
protection, regulation of energy, financial credit systems, health
care and education. "Through all our cooperation, our two
countries have built a strong foundation for growth in trade and
in mutual prosperity," Leblanc said.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the Governor General, President Tariq
Tarar said that the visit would strengthen the bilateral relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Leblanc said the two countries have an actively-evolving
relations in the field of trade and investment, and share common
views on many issues of international importance. The governor
General also stressed the need for cultural exchange which, he
termed as "an investment" for the future.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the capital city of Islamabad, the visit also took
Leblanc to Pakistan's second largest city of Lahore, where he also
had meetings with the business sector.
</P>
<P>
Leblanc held that prospects of increasing economic cooperation
between the two countries are very bright.
</P>
<P>
Canada wants to help Pakistan bring development and prosperity
for its people. And for this purpose, investment can play a key
role, he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Canada and Pakistan are close partners in the
field of trade and economic affairs and "in this area our
cooperation has been very positive and successful."
</P>
<P>
Besides, their bilateral talks also covered regional and
international issues of mutual interests, peace and stability in
South Asia and the Pak-Indian relationship in particular.
</P>
<P>
Leblanc expressed the hope Pakistan and India, the two South
Asian nations, with which Canada enjoys cordial relations, will
resolve their outstanding issues in a spirit of accommodation.

exports to Japan are expected to fall this year, the Wellington
newspaper "The Dominion" reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is agreed it is going to be a bad year for Japan," he
noted. But he expected New Zealand trade with Japan will drop less

digit margin, mostly driven by wood products," Bowen stated.

taking about a third of overseas sales.
</P>

<P>
WELLINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Police Commissioner
 Peter Doone has indicated that a review of the police will
increase the frontline capability.
</P>
<P>
Doone was quoted by a TVNZ report Tuesday as saying that "I am
confident that the review will result in a more efficient police
service and boost our frontline capability."
</P>
<P>
He said the aim of the review is to ensure that police
management is as lean and cheap as it can be. The police can
learn lessons from the way private companies are managed.
</P>
<P>
His comment came after Police Minister Jack Elder announced on
Monday a review to investigate whether some services and jobs can
be cut or contracted out to help save money for frontline
policing.
</P>
<P>
The review will focus on management and administration to save
spending on the police. It followed criticism of the cost of a new
 computer system for the police and a pay dispute between the
government and police officers.

<HEADLINE> Two Major Financial Services Announce Big Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The New York-based Citicorp and
Travelers Group are merging in a record 82 billion U.S. dollar
deal combining the second-biggest bank with a leading provider of
financial services in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement sent both companies' stock prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
The deal easily surpasses the previous record price of 37
billion U.S. dollars that the telecommunications company WorldCom
is paying for MCI.
</P>
<P>
The new company would be called Citigroup Inc., would use
Travelers' trademark red umbrella as its logo, and would have more
than 100 million customers in 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
It would have assets of almost 700 billion U.S. dollars,
revenue of nearly 50 billion U.S. dollars and operating income of
approximately 7.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Citicorp is the parent company of Citibank, the international
banking powerhouse, and also is the world's largest issuer of
credit cards with some 60 million bank cards.
</P>
<P>
Travelers Group is an insurance, brokerage and investment
banking giant. Its operating companies include Salomon Smith
Barney, Travelers Life &AMP; Annuity, Travelers Property Casualty
Corp., Primerica Financial Services, and Commercial Credit.
</P>
<P>
The merger will mean that the two companies' customers will
have easier access to a much broader range of financial services.
For example: Citicorp account holders can now transfer money by
telephone or personal computer between checking, savings and money
market accounts. And they will also be able to make transfers
between those accounts, plus Travelers' insurance and mutual fund
products.
</P>
<P>
Large financial companies have said for a long time that
studies have shown their customers want this type of one-stop
shopping.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that it remains to be seen how the on-line
revolution will affect people's way of getting financial services.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Buy British Submarines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Defense Minister Art
Eggleton said Monday that Canada will buy four British submarines.
</P>
<P>
The minister confirmed recent reports that the cabinet has
decided on the four used diesel subs in order to replace Canada's
three aging Oberon-class ones.
</P>
<P>
The British Upholder-class subs were built in the early 1990s
and mothballed soon after their delivery after the British navy
decided on nuclear-powered ships.
</P>
<P>
The four Upholders cost Britain a total of 2.28 billion dollars
(1.6 billion USD) to build.
</P>
<P>
Canada is expected to pay 610 million dollars for the four
subs, along with 140 million dollars that will be spent on
training and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The submarines are to be delivered to Canada starting from
2000, according to reports here.
</P>
<P>
Canada's current subs were built by the British in the 1960s.
For years, Canada's navy has been arguing for new subs as
replacements of the old.
</P>
<P>
With the purchase, Canada's navy will have subs that are
quieter, faster, deeper-diving and have smaller crews than the old
ones.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Procedure Fails Improving Ties with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- In contrast to warm welcome
American wrestlers had received in Iran, Iranian wrestlers have
suffered strict examinations when they arrived in Chicago last
week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said on Monday offered no apology to
Iran for the treatment, saying federal law requires such
procedures for unofficial, nonimmigrant visitors from four
countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya and Sudan -- that are on unfriendly
terms with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has made a mistake here by implementing the existing
regulations," spokesman James Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington may alter the practice in the future if
relations with Tehran continue to improve.
</P>
<P>
"We will be discussing it at the State Department to make sure
the procedures are appropriate in these tapes of visits," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian wrestling team was detained for two hours in
Chicago last week when they flew in the United States. They were
photographed and fingerprinted. The episode left the Iranian
government convinced there was no shift at all in Washington's
policy toward Tehran.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the State Department was not aware that
any such procedure would be applied against the Iranians, given
the adminsitrattion's eagerness for an incident-free visit.
</P>
<P>
Foley hoped the bad feelings over the treatment accorded to
the Iranian wrestlers would pass quickly.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to stress, first and foremost, the fact that
the Iranian wrestlers are, indeed, welcome visitors in the
United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And so in spite of what may have happened at their arrival
in Chicago, this should not in any way be interpreted as a
lessening of our commitment to facilitating these exchanges and
this dialogue at that sort of level," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Vaults over 9,000 Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks closed above
9,000 points for the first time, vaulting into record territory
Monday on news of a major financial services merger.
</P>
<P>
At the sound of closing bell, the Dow Jones industrial average
stopped at 9,033.23, up 49.82 over the previous session. The
barometer of blue-chip stocks hit 9,000 for the first time early
Friday, only to close nearly 17 points short.
</P>
<P>
At one point early today, the Dow surged up more than 111
points to 9,094.76.
</P>
<P>
The record closing came little more than five months after the
Dow Jones industrial average tumbled below 7,000.
</P>
<P>
The New York Stock Exchange also set a record today.
</P>
<P>
The buying spree followed the announcement that Citicorp and
Travelers Group are merging in a record 70-billion-U.S. dollar
deal. The pact unites the nation's second-biggest bank and a
leading provider of financial services ranging from trading stocks
to insurance.
</P>
<P>
The news made Travelers Group the most-traded stock on the New
York Stock Exchange, and drove up the values of bank and financial
services stocks at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Both Travelers and Citicorp rose by big margins. Citicorp
gained a hefty 37 to more than 180 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rise in the Dow, declining issues outnumbered
advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where
volume came to 603 million shares, below Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
The S&AMP;P 500 list was down 1.31 at 1,121.39. The NYSE composite
index was up 0.09 at 583.17 -- surpassing the record hit on
Friday.

WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The design for the Series 1996
20 U.S. dollar note, the first redesigned U.S. currency note will
be unveiled next month by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Rubin and Chairman Greenspan will unveil the new bill

according to an announcement from the Treasury Department here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new 20 dollar note will enter circulation in the fall of
1998. It is commonly used in daily commerce and is the bill most
often dispensed by Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). The 20 dollar
note is the third in the U.S. currency series to include new and
modified security features to deter counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
The Series 1996 100 dollar was issued in March 1996 and the
redesigned 50 dollar note in October last year.
</P>
<P>
Like the new 50 dollar note, the redesigned 20 note will
include a large dark numeral on a light background on the back of
the note that will make it easier for people with low vision to
identify the note.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Peace Revivable If Israel Reconsiders Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said on Monday that it is still possible to pull the Mideast peace
process out of its current impasse if Israel reconsiders its
stance toward a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that Egypt is holding intensive
consultations with the United States, European Union, Arabs,
Palestinians and Israelis on ways of rescuing the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his recent contacts with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, Moussa said that Netanyahu affirmed his
determination to continue the peace process and his hope to reach
a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt considers these statements as a good sign, but they need
a positive action to be realized," he said, urging the Israeli
leader to drop his hardline policies on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks came to a standstill in
March last year when Israel broke ground for the construction of a
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as
the capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Cairo's contacts with Arab countries are designed to make a
complete evaluation of the current state of the peace process and
crystalize a sound Arab stance, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are also underway to persuade the U.S. to make public
its peace initiative to pressure Israel into softening its
hardline position, he said.
</P>
<P>
Washington has reportedly outlined a plan calling on Israel to
withdraw troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks,
accompanied by security cooperation with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross failed to win the acceptance
of the plan from Israel and the Palestinians during his recent
shuttle between the leaders of the two sides. The U.S. has yet
to make public the plan for fear of putting pressure on Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis
Ross said on Monday that both the Israelis and Palestinians
intended to find a way to break the year-long deadlock on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an annual meeting of the Anti-Defamation League,
an American Jewish organization, Ross said the U.S.-guided
process was resilient.
</P>
<P>
But he neither gave any details of his four-day futile
diplomacy in the region last week, nor shed any light on what
the Clinton administration might do next.
</P>
<P>
The White House said earlier that Ross and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright would brief President Bill Clinton on the
difficult situation for reviving the deadlocked peace process in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Ross will review where we are in the peace process," a White
House spokeswoman said. She did not make any elaboration on the
evening briefing.
</P>
<P>
Albright said in Port-of Spain, Trinidad, she would go to the
White House after a Caribbean foreign ministers meeting and give
President Clinton a report on Ross' trip.
</P>
<P>
"It will be during that meeting that we will consider what our
next steps will be," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright also said in a letter to Democratic Senator Carl
Levin that the Clinton administration would remain determined to
work privately and "without public disclosure" of the proposals
Ross had offered to both the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has disclosed and rejected the U.S. proposals
which requires Israel to further cede 13.1 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinians who in return would take steps to meet
Israel's request for security.
</P>
<P>
At the annual meeting of the Anti-Defamation League, Israeli
Ambassador Eliahu Ben-Elissar said both Israel and the
Palestinians would have to make compromises to get talks between
the two sides resumed.
</P>
<P>
"Peace means compromise, peace means concession, and we are
ready," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador Ahmed Maher Al Sayed, for his part,
criticized Israel's stance toward the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Syrian, Lebanese Leaders Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
on Monday held talks with his Lebanese counterpart Elias Hrawi on
Israel's proposal to withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged information about their respective
consultations in the Arab and world community on Israel's move,
the Syrian TV reported.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Hrawi's visit is aimed at
coordinating the stances of the two countries on Israel's offer to
implement the United Nations Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Israel approved the adoption of the resolution
425. But it conditioned the withdrawal on a security arrangement
for the bordering areas agreed by the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Both Lebanon and Syria, which agree not to make peace with
Israel separately, have rejected Israel's offer. They insist that
the Jewish state withdraw from south Lebanon unconditionally as
the U.N. resolution demands.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and Parliament Speaker
Nabih Berri also visited Damascus last week to discuss the issue
with the Syrian leader.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expresses Regret over Pakistan's Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department said
on Monday that Pakistan's test of a medium-range missile "would be
destabilizing and undermine the security" between Pakistan and
India.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is especially important to avoid steps in the
nuclear and missile areas that could be seen as provocative and
could adversely affect the political and security environment in
the region," State Department spokesman James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan announced on Monday that it had successfully tested a
ballistic missile with a range of 900 miles (1,450 kilometers).

<HEADLINE> Greek Consumers Boycott Farm Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Greek consumers Monday began to
boycott meat and farm products in protest against the recent price
hikes stemming from the drachma's 14-percent devaluation and
rainstorms that swept the country.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Consumers' Institute (INKA) hoped that the five-day
boycott would force the national producers and merchants to reduce
prices.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive markets in Greece were reported to be in the
islands of Rhodes, Corfu and Crete.
</P>
<P>
Wishing to join the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
in 2001, Greece recently speeded up its economic reform pace by
allowing its national currency to join the European exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) as of March 14.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has decided to intensify money market
checks to prevent profiteering while calling on the Greek business
world and traders not to pass on the consequences of the
devaluation to prices by exercising self restraint.

<HEADLINE> New Chip to Cut PC Prices Deeply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Semiconductor
Corp. said today that a new chip could drive personal computer
prices to less than 400 U.S. dollars by next year, likely to spur
a new price cutting wave.
</P>
<P>
The company is developing a chip that combines a
micro-processor with circuitry of more than a dozen additional
chips needed to make a PC, which is regarded as being able to
substantially reduce manufacturing costs, the Wall Street Journal
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We've got top-brand customers working with us on this," Brian
Halla, National's chairman and chief executive officer, was quoted
as saying. The company did not reveal the potential customers yet.
</P>
<P>
The paper said it won't be easy to have an impact. Intel
supplies close to 90 percent of the microprocessors used in PCs
and has ample resources to counter most of its rivals' development
plans.
</P>
<P>
The company also said that used in a conventional portable
computer, the PC-on-a-chip could enable a machine to last for nine
hours on battery power, or long enough for a trans-Pacific flight,
Halla said.
</P>
<P>
Many of today's chips have circuits that are about 0.35 microns
wide, or one-300th the width of a human hair. That is enough to
put about seven million transistors on a chip. National and other
companies are moving to 0.25-micron chips this year, enough for
roughly 30 million to 50 million transistors. By the end of next
year, the company expects to hit dimensions of 0.18 microns,
allowing for as many as 100 million transistors, more than enough
to handle most functions of a computer on one piece of silicon.
</P>
<P>
National Semiconductor Corp last year bought Cyrix Corp., a
microprocessor maker whose integrated Media GX chip helped Compaq
computer Corp. stimulated the sub-1,000 U.S. dollar PC market in
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
One chain of retail stores in the U.S. already is selling a
Cyrix-based machine for 499 U.S. dollars, without a monitor. By
comparison, the least-expensive machines based on Intel chips run
for about 800 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts question the company's capability of keeping up
the running speed of PC while integrate more components.
