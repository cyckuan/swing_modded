<HEADLINE> Beijing Reception Honors Sino-Japanese Relations  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, together with
the China-Japan Friendship Association, hosted a reception here
this evening to mark the 25th anniversary of normalization of
diplomatic ties between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Qi Huaiyuan, president of the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries said in a speech that since the
normalization of Sino-Japanese ties 25 years ago, both countries
have witnessed a deep and comprehensive development in politics,
economy, science and technology, culture and exchanges between
their local governments, through the efforts by governments and
peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral friendly cooperation has not only facilitated the
growth and prosperity of both nations but also contributed to the
peace, stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We should remember those forerunners who have dedicated
themselves to the normalization of bilateral ties," Qi noted. The
Sino-Japanese relations have stepped into a new period, linking
the past with the future.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the countries should abide by the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of
Peace and Friendship, and work together to bring a sound and
stable bilateral friendly relationship into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan are two major powers in Asia and important
members in the international community, therefore to bring a sound
and stable Sino-Japanese relationship into the new century is not
only the common goal of the people of the two countries, but is
also essential to peace in Asia and the world at large, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Former Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who is here
for the celebrations in Beijing, told the group that remarkable
progress has been made in Japanese-Chinese relationship over the
past 25 years.

<HEADLINE> 1.2 Million Iraqis Die of Medicine Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.2 million Iraqis
died because of an acute shortage of medicines and medical
requisites over the six years of U.N. sanctions, Iraqi Health
Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak announced here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today Mubarak pointed out that health
conditions have continued worsening in Iraq as a result of lack of
medical supplies, such as the antiseptics and anesthetics which
are necessary for urgent surgeries.
</P>
<P>
In this period of time, Iraqi hospitals had to operate in about
one-third of their capacity, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He held the U.N. Sanctions Committee responsible for delaying
the approval of the contracts concluded by Iraq with foreign
companies on the purchase of medical supplies under the
oil-for-food deal, which took into effect last December.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal signed between Iraq and the U.N. in May
1996 allows sanction-stricken Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil within six months to buy food and direly needed
medicines to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The deal was renewed last June.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that Iraq used to import 500 million dollars worth
of medicines and medical requisites before the 1990 Gulf War, but
it imported medicines valued at only 7 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister also accused the United States and Britain
of using illegal weapons during the 1990 Gulf War, which has led
to an increasing number of leukemia infections, lymphatic gland
tumors and mental-retardation cases among Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanction against Iraq after President Saddam
Hussein sent troops to occupy Kuwait in August 1990. The troops
were driven out of Kuwait and defeated half a year later by the
U.S.-led coalition forces.

He said he personally aims to serve as a bridge for the future
bilateral ties, by helping Japanese young people, young statesmen
in particular, to learn more about China and to increase cultural
exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that Japanese-Chinese relations will continue
to flourish for the next 25 years, and that friendship between the
two countries will last from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
Yoshio Sakurauchi, chairman of the Japanese Association for the
Promotion of International Trade and former speaker of Japan's
House of Representatives, said that bilateral diplomatic relations
were normalized through the efforts of the past generations of the
two countries, and thanks to wise decisions of leaders of the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Japan and China have cooperated in a wide range of
areas such as politics, economy, culture and sports, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We should face up to and draw on lessons from history, and
look to the future, proceeding from the principaled stance set out
25 years ago," he said.

<P>
He also acknowledged that he will be devoted to carrying

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Braces for Impending Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has set
aside over 1.5 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (125 million U.S.
Dollars) as a drought management fund in the mounting fears
over a possible drought during this rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture today told
the Zimbabwe News Agency that the government had enough
information on the looming drought, a result of the notorious El
Nino phenomenon, and was making every effort to ensure drought be
properly managed if it eventually occurred.
</P>
<P>
The money set aside would be used to ensure there is adequate
food for the country's estimated 12.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
"When the last devastating drought during the 1991/92 rainy
season occurred, we did not have any information, in fact we were
caught unawares. But this time the government has started to
prepare," said one official who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
Kumbirai Kangai, Minister of Lands and Agriculture, recently
warned the farming community and the rest of the Zimbabwean
population to brace up for the drought, which he said could be
the worst in the history of the country.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said the country is fortunate this year to have enough
scientific information and indicators on the El Nino phenomenon
and the possible pending drought.

LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The British government today
denied changing its policy on a single European currency, which
starts on January 1 1999.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting speculation that it was about to call a referendum on
British entry into European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU),
Chancellor Gordon Brown said on BBC Television that Britain would
make an announcement on its EMU intentions at the "appropriate
time...about the turn of the year".
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Britain's position on EMU has not changed
since the Labor Party came to power in May.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said: "It is unlikely Britain will
join in the first wave. There are formidable obstacles in the way
of doing so."
</P>
<P>
"If the single currency proceeds and if it is a success, then
in the longer term Britain could not stay out. But that is in the
longer term, it is not a little after," Cook said in another BBC
interview.
</P>
<P>
They were speaking after financial markets surged on Friday in
reaction to a Financial Times report which suggested that the
government was warming to the idea of EMU and that an announcement
on Britain entering the single currency would be made shortly.
</P>
<P>
A poll released Saturday showed that most people in Britain
remain resolutely opposed to joining a single European currency.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Israel-Palestinian Talks to Resume Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between Israel
and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) are expected to
resume soon, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his
cabinet here today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting today that Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy and PNA chief negotiator Abu Mazen are now in
the United States and scheduled to meet with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in New York Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the prime minister's office,
Netanyahu said he expected an agreement on reopening the peace
talks to be reached during that meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, the PNA made some progress in fighting
against terrorism, which would be conducive to the resumption of
peace talks, the statement quoted Netanyahu as saying.
</P>
<P>
Today's cabinet meeting was called by Netanyahu to discuss the
impact of a nationwide general strike today and the recent
security cooperation between Israel and PNA.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has stepped up its campaign against the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) and has reportedly arrested dozens of
its members and closed down 17 Hamas institutions, including a TV
station in Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said this is the initial step that PNA has taken
against terrorism and urged it to make more efforts.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Israel and PNA have been stalled since last
March following Israel's construction of a Jewish settlement in
Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The peace process skidded into a deeper crisis after two
suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem killed 25 people in July and
September.

<HEADLINE> International Community Urged to React to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos today urged international organizations and the
great powers to react to Turkey's tactics of war threats.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in the northern Greek port city of
Thessaloniki today, the president accused Turkey of taking such
tactics, saying that they were directed not only against Greece
but international law and order, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the speech made by Turkish Deputy Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit that differences between Greece and Turkey
were not confined on the issue of Imia, an uninhabited island in
the Aegean, but included territorial waters, airspace, the
continental shelf and the militarization of islands.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos today also
criticized the Turkish policy, saying that Ankara's position was
"yielding diminishing results in the world stage."
</P>
<P>
"The whole issue," he said, "is developing now not as a Greek-
Turkish confrontation, but a confrontation between Turkey and the
international community."
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have since early this year been trying to
improve their strained relations for decades, but the war of words
between them are escalating following the breakdown of recent
talks between the two communities of Cyprus as well as between
Pangalos and his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem.

<HEADLINE> PNA: No Peace Talks Without Solution To Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks with Israel
will not be resumed without a solution to Jewish settlements in
West Bank and Gaza Strip, a senior official of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
Marwan Kanafani, a spokesman for PNA President Yasser Arafat,
told the Voice of Palestine radio in Gaza that "there is no way
that negotiations (with Israel) will continue without a solution
to the Israeli settlement policy."
</P>
<P>
Kanafani's remarks were apparently the PNA's reaction to the
announcement earlier today by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that Israel-PNA peace talks are expected to resume soon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told his cabinet today that Israeli and PNA
officials will meet U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Monday in New York and are expected to reach an agreement to
reopen Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Kanafani had called it a "positive step in the right direction
if it's true."
</P>
<P>
However, now in a more cautious tone Kanafani urged Israel to
implement the interim agreement the two sides signed in 1995 under
which Israel has to redeploy in three stages its troops in West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The second stage troop redeployment had to be completed on
September 7, but so far Israel has done nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
Israel had announced to stop giving back lands to Palestinians
as long as they fell short of meeting Israeli demands for cracking
down on terrorist groups and dismantling their infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The PNA accused the Netanyahu government of attempting to rid
itself of the Oslo obligations of returning occupied territories
and retreating from the principle of "land for peace."
</P>
<P>
Kanafani pointed out the troop redeployment, a basic part of
the interim agreement which Israel failed to implement so far, has
been one of the main causes of the current crisis of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has stepped up its campaign in recent days against
Hamas and extremist militants, closing down 17 Hamas-affliated
institutions and rounding up 13 activists.
</P>
<P>
In a gesture of reciprocity, Netanyahu earlier today ordered
the release of more tax revenues Israel has been withholding since
the two suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem in July and September
killed 20 Israelis and five bombers.
</P>
<P>
This transfer, together with the previous one in August, would
bring the total amount of revenues to be turned over to PNA to
over 25 million U.S. dollars, about half that Israel owes.

the support of voters for granted, in the first speech by a prime
minister to the Labor conference for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
"What the people give, the people can take away," the Prime
Minister will say at the Conference, according to the observers.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Threatens to Attack Overseas Israeli Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The military wing of the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), responsible for recent
Jerusalem attacks, today threatened to move the battle abroad by
attacking Israeli targets around the world.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued today, Izzadin Kassim Brigades
strongly denounced Israeli secret intelligence service Mossad for
plotting the attack against a Hamas leader, Khalid Mashiel, in
Jordanian capital Amman last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mashiel, head of the political bureau of Hamas, was attacked by
two Canadian tourists with an electrical device in front of his
office in what Hamas called "an assassination attempt" by
Mossad. But Jordanian authorities downplayed the incident as the
result of a quarrel between his driver and the tourists.
</P>
<P>
Mashiel is recovering at a military hospital and his condition
is stable.
</P>
<P>
"The attempt of Mossad, through their collaborators, to
assassinate Khalid Mashiel, will cause us to move the battle
outside the borders of the nation," the Hamas release said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the leadership of the Izzadin Kassim are
"studying with great seriousness the response to this dangerous
crime by planned attacks against Israeli interests in different
parts of the world."
</P>
<P>
The release called planned retaliatory moves as "a legitimate
right and justified steps."
</P>
<P>
It called on Jordan's King Hussein to publicly punish those
responsible for the attack and cut off diplomatic relations with
the countries involved.
</P>
<P>
Izzadin Kassim also strongly denounced the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) for conducting the recent massive sweeps
of Hamas activists in the self-rule territories and demanded an
end to PNA corruption.
</P>
<P>
The release also threatened to carry out more terror
attacks. "Israel will pay dearly for its cowardice against our
brother Mashiel ... we will turn it into a fire to burn our
enemies and bombs to destroy the bodies of the murderers," it said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas claimed responsibility for the recent suicide bombing
attacks in Jerusalem, in which 25 people were killed and over 300
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The attacks have aggravated the already tense situation
between Israel and the PNA, and dimmed the hope for renewing the
peace process stalled since last March.
</P>
<P>
Israel, with the backing of the United States, is pressuring
the PNA to launch an all-out war against Hamas and other militant
organizations.
</P>
<P>
So far Israeli and Palestinian security forces have rounded up
hundreds of Hamas activists and other militants in operations
throughout the territories.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Chief of Staff of
Saleh Ben Ali Al-Mahia met with his South African counterpart
George Meiring today in Saudi capital Riyadh to discuss bilateral
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwait News Agency reports, the top military
officers assessed the possibility of military cooperation South
Africa is now seeking with the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Meiring is on a tour to the Middle East, which has taken him to
Egypt and Jordan. He arrived in Saudi Arabia Saturday and will
then visit the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz
was on a visit to South Africa Saturday for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has it that Saudi Arabia and South Africa are
considering an oil-for-arms deal worth 1.5 billion U.S. dollars,
under which South Africa would barter its G-6 self-propelled
howitzers and anti-aircraft missiles for oil.
</P>
<P>
But reports from Cape Town said that South African Defense
Minister Joe Modise denied the speculation after talks with his
Saudi counterpart Saturday.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- An American out-of-control
earth observation satellite burned up in the atmosphere today, the
U.S. Space Command said.
</P>
<P>
The Lewis spacecraft, which started tumbling days after being
launched in August, crashed into the atmosphere at 27,000 kph and
burned up at 11:58 GMT over the southern Atlantic Ocean off the
coast of Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) has
launched an independent investigation into the loss of the
mission, which was to have monitored land use and pollution.
</P>
<P>
"The Lewis satellite was not designed to survive re-entry and
is expected to have burned up in the atmosphere," said the U.S.
Space Command, which keeps track of nearly 8,000 orbiting objects.
</P>
<P>
The 65 million U.S. dollars Lewis mission was meant to be a
champion of NASA "cheaper, faster, better" philosophy, but four
days after launch it spun out of control and communications were
lost.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Troops Continue Operation in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish troops continued
cross-border operations against the Kurdish militants in northern
Iraq, despite strong criticism from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
A number of camps of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party, or
PKK, were destroyed in a week of air raids and ground offensives
by the Turkish troops, the Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Turkish fighter-bombers carried out an air strike on 15
suspected PKK camps Thursday in northern Iraq where more than
1,000 militants were reportedly gathering in preparation for
winter offensives into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 Turkish troops, backed by 130 tanks, crossed
into northern Iraq to reinforce the units already stationed there
to wipe out PKK rebel camps. Anatolia said 138 rebels have been
killed so far.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was continuing in the regions of Kani Mazi, Ekmal,
Bervari, Meti, Carcel, Dergele in northern Iraq, it added.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops have frequently taken actions inside Iraq in the
past two years, triggering outcry from neighboring countries and
some international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Iran has called on Turkey to immediately withdraw its troops
from northern Iraq, saying the operations there increased
instability in the region, according to Iran's official news
agency.
</P>
<P>
However, a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman said earlier
that the ongoing offensive against PKK rebels in northern Iraq is
only "a routine and limited action."
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war against
the Turkish government in an attempt to establish an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for Emergency Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat arrived here Sunday afternoon for talks with Tunisian
president on the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Arafat and President Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali
are scheduled on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew here from the Algerian capital of Algiers where he
discussed with President Liamine Zeroual on the same topics.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters after meeting with Zeroual, Arafat
called on the Arab states to convene an emergency Arab summit to
examine the critical situation in Palestinian-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat underscored the importance of convening an Arab summit
as early as possible for a united Arab stand toward Israeli
hardline policies. He expressed hope that his appeal would meet
with "quick response" from all Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that he had briefed Zeroual during the meeting of
the difficult situation in Palestinian territories brought about
by Israel's refusal to implement the accords concluded with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
He also said that Israel's closure imposed on Palestinian
territories and freezing millions of dollars in tax revenues due
to the Palestinian National Authority would not bring the
Palestinian (PNA) people to their knees.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and PNA have been stalled since last
March after Israel's construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier today
that he expected an agreement from a meeting Monday in New York
between Israeli and Palestinian officials and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on resuming peace talks after a six-month
freeze.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian side said peace talks would not be
possible if without a solution to Jewish settlements.

<HEADLINE> AL Calls for Turkish Troop Withdrawal From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) today
voiced concern over Turkey's military incursion into northern Iraq
and urged Ankara to immediately withdraw its troops, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs of the
Cairo-based organization Mohamed Zakaria Ismail said the incursion
is considered a blatant violation of the sovereignty of an Arab
League member state.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting today with Turkish Ambassador to Egypt Yacar
Yakic, Ismail stressed the deeply-rooted and historical relations
between Turkey and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Around 8,000 Turkish troops backed by tanks and aircraft
entered northern Iraq on September 22 to reinforce the Turkish
forces there in a bid to wipe out guerrillas of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year separatist war in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish ambassador said Turkish troops will withdraw from
Iraq as soon as they destroy the bases of terrorist elements of
the PKK. He affirmed that his country respects the territorial
integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, AL issued a statement condemning the Turkish military
operations inside Iraq, the latest of a string of Turkey's
cross-border operations over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> France Warns US Against Rash Action over Total's Iran Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- France today warned the United
States against any rash action over the 2 billion U.S. dollar oil
deal signed Sunday by Iran and the French oil group Total.
</P>
<P>
"The application of the clauses of the (d'Amato) law will make
up in effect a grave precedent in the field of trade in
international law," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques
Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said the contact signed by Total "well appears to belong to
the activities that the d'Amato law aims to deter (international
companies) from undertaking" by making deals with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The d'Amato law is America's. So it can only be applied in the
United States and upon American enterprises," the spokesman
pointed out, adding that only the United Nations Security Council
can decide to impose sanctions on individual countries and its
companies.
</P>
<P>
"The valid sanctions by international law are those taken by
the U.N. Security Council," he said, while recalling that France
and its European Union partners were strongly opposed to the law
when it came out last year on Capitol Hill in Washington DC.
</P>
<P>
"European Union and its member states have regularly expressed
their opposition to the principle of legislation carrying
unilateral sanctions with extra-territorial reach," he said.
</P>
<P>
The d'Amato law, adopted by the United States Congress and
signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton last August, aims to punish
American and foreign companies which make more than 40 million
dollars in deals with hydrocarbon and oil industries of Iran and
Libya.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Spending Slows Despite Income Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The consumer spending in
the U.S. slowed in August despite a healthy personal income
increase, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that personal consumption expenditures
increased by 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
5.52 trillion dollars in the month. That followed a 1 percent
surge in July, the biggest in six months.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in spending growth mainly resulted from the auto
sales. Spending on durable goods -- items expected to last three
or more years -- rose by 0.3 percent after a big 3.2 percent jump
in July. Spending on nondurable goods rose by 0.2 percent and on
services, by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department also said that U.S. personal incomes rose by 0.6
percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.92
trillion dollars. It followed a 0.2 percent increase in July.
</P>
<P>
The disposable personal income -- income after taxes --
increased by 0.5 percent, a bit less than the overall gain.
</P>
<P>
The combination of robust income growth and a moderate spending
gain produced an increase in the U.S. savings rate -- savings as a
percentage of disposable personal income -- to 3.8 percent in
August from 3.6 percent in July which was a six-month low.
</P>
<P>
The report was the last major economic data released by the
U.S. government before the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) holds its
policy-making meeting on Tuesday. Most economists now expect that
the U.S. Fed will leave short-term interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed raised the short-term rate on March 25 but have
refrained since as inflation in the country has diminished despite
brisk economic growth.

GENEVE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- World top tennis player Pete
Sampras pulled out of the one million U.S. dollars Swiss indoor
championships to be held in Basle for his shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
Sampras injuryed his right shoulder during the match against
Patrick Rafter in Sunday's Grand Slam Cup final in Munich where he
made a straight sets win, said the star on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Wimbledon and Australian Open champion arrived in Basle
late on Sunday and made the disappointing decision after an
examination by tournament doctor Axel Kentsch.
</P>
<P>
Sampras returned to his United States home on Monday where he
will begin treatment for the injury, caused by over use.
</P>
<P>
His withdrawal was the latest blow to the Swiss event which has
suffered an exodus of top attractions.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, U.S. Open winner Rafter pulled out claiming
fatigue. French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten withdrew last
Wednesday with a foot injury.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin
today encouraged compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and
overseas friends to suggest ways to improve the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Jia said this when meeting the guests today at the Great Hall
of the People. The visitors from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao are
here to participate in the celebration of the 48th National Day
which falls on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Jia, who is also secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), briefed the group on the
CPC's 15th National Congress and the development of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing is witnessing rapid economic growth and a low
inflation rate, as its national gross product increased by 11.3
percent during the past eight months with the price index up only
4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that the Seventh Plenary Session of the CPC 14th
National Congress central expelled former Beijing party secretary
Chen Xitong from the Party. The decision has been widely received
among leaders and ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, Beijing has a sold foundation to build from,
and that people should differentiate between the problems of Chen
and the achievements of the capital city. To expel Chen from the
Party has heightened people's confidence in the anti-corruption
drive.
</P>
<P>
While talking about Beijing's development, Jia said that there
is still a long way to go before Beijing becomes a modern
international metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Jia expressed his gratitude to overseas friends who have made
contributions to Beijing's construction, hoping that they would
continue to support and help the capital.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing can not develop quicker without overseas friends'
help," he said, adding that measures will be taken to accelerate
Beijing's growth and create conditions for foreigners to
participate in the capital's buildup.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yushu, a well-known entrepreneur from Hong Kong, said that
he was honored to celebrate with Beijing residents the first
National Day since Hong Kong returned to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he believed that with the motherland as powerful
backing, Hong Kong would surely become more prosperous in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Ma Limin, a businessman from Australia, was excited to see the
motherland becoming stronger. He told that the case of Chen Xitong
and Wang Baosen, former Beijing vice-mayor who committed suicide
in 1995 to escape punishment for corruption, has not dimmed the
interest of overseas Chinese to invest in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 overseas Chinese from 16 countries and regions
including the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Australia,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao attended today's meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
on Sunday visited the Palace Museum in Beijing, asking relics
officials and workers to do their utmost to protect the site.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by State Councilor Li Tieying, Beijing Mayor Jia
Qinglin and Culture Minister Liu Zhongde, Li visited a warehouse
of palace treasures and inspected a polluted moat surrounding the
Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
The Palace Museum, or the Forbidden City, is the site of the
home of many Chinese emperors. It was built some 500 years ago and
has been included on UNESCO's world heritage list.
</P>
<P>
After hearing a report by Zhang Wenbin, chief of the State
Cultural Relics Bureau, Li said that the Palace Museum is a museum
that has great influence both at home and abroad. As tourism
continues to develop, more and more people will come to visit it.
</P>
<P>
"We must let the masses of tourists view the relics
as often as possible on one hand, the management and
protection of relics must be strengthened on the other," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the policy of effectively protecting relics and
rationally making use of them must continue to be implemented, and
management must be stricter.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is a civilized country with a long history
and abundant cultural relics. Therefore, the protection and
utilization of the relics are a duty-bound responsibility for
Chinese people. Government departments should attach great
importance to the work, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged that a relics protection system be created in
accordance with the socialist market economy, to enable the
country's abundant cultural heritage to play a role in material
civilization and cultural and ethic progress.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urged to Stick to Defense-Only Military Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea urged Japan to
stick to defense-only military activities despite the new
Washington-Tokyo defense guidelines on the expansion of Japan's
military role in "crisis situations surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
Ryu Kwang-sok, Director-general of South Korea's Foreign Ministry
on Asia and Pacific Affairs, made the remark today during his
meeting with Kato Ryozo, Director-general of the Asian Affairs
Division of the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Japan also agreed to conduct continuous consultations with
South Korea and maintain transparency in its negotiations with the
United States on strategies to implement defense guidelines, Ryu
said.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Kato explained to Ryu eight items in the
new defense guidelines which the Japanese government will not be
permitted, including engaging in any direct military activities
such as the provisioning of ammunition, or engine inspections of
U.S. warplanes or warships heading for battlefields, according to
Yonhap News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Under guidelines recently amended, Japan will also not be
allowed to provide information on target selection," the Japanese
official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines allow Japanese forces to conduct inspections of
ships in international waters only with the approval of the United
Nations Security Council, Ryu noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the revised guidelines have yet to specify when, where
and how the Japanese self-defense forces will engage in crisis
situations.
</P>
<P>
Kato refused to categorize what constitutes "areas surrounding
Japan," saying that the areas are not a geographical concept but a
situational one.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Iranian Air Raids on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq strongly condemned Iran
today for its air raids on Iraqi territories, Iraq News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Eight Iranian warplanes bombed Monday morning camps of Iranian
opposition groups in areas of Diali province of Iraq, 80
kilometers east of Baghdad and Kute province, 180 kilometers south
of Baghdad, the agency quoted an Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft defense forces and warplanes resisted the
Iranian raiding planes, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Together with another country, Iran is taking advantage of
Iraq's hard conditions resulted from the U.N. blockade on Iraq to
launch air raids, it should be fully responsible for the
casualties and damages in Iraq caused by the raids, the spokesman
said, without giving the name of the other country, but apparently
referring to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been launching cross-border military operations in
northern Iraq to attack the Turkey's Kurdish rebels based in the
region since years ago. The lastest, which started in May is still
continuing.
</P>
<P>
Iran has also launched several air raids on northern Iraq
during the past years in a bid to wipe out some military posts of
the Iraq-based Iranian outlawed group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (people's
holy warriors) Organization.
</P>
<P>
"Under such a state of affairs, the U.N. pledges to maintain
the sovereignty of Iraq have become ink and paper," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called on the U.N. to keep its pledges to
maintain the sovereignty of Iraq in accordance with the relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Arab nations and the international
community to denounce the Iranian aggression on Iraq, and to
pressure the U.S. and its allies to end the blockade imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman emphasized that such aggressive behavior exposes
the falsity of Iran's call for dialog and peace with Iraq.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Pushes Inter-Korean Car Ferry Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The two Koreas and China are
negotiating a direct car ferry service as a way of developing
tourism in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) around
Mount Paekdu (Mount Changbai in Chinese), a South Korean
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"South and North (DPRK) Korea and China are conducting talks on
opening a direct transit service between the South's Sokcho and
the DPRK's Rajin-Sunbong, both on the eastern coast. There is a
good possibility that progress will be made on the negotiations,"
Yonhap News Agency quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries,
DPRK's External Economic Affairs Commission and China's Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation are all involved in the
negotiations, which also covers customs regulations, he said.
</P>
<P>
If an agreement is reached among the three parties, South Korea
and China are likely to set up a joint-venture company, he said.
</P>
<P>
Seoul has been pursuing the idea of an inter-Korean sea route
after President Kim Young-sam declared in August that he is
willing to allow South Korean tourists to travel to the DPRK once
the four-party meeting opens.
</P>
<P>
The four-party talks, the probability of which remains
uncertain, is intended to bring together the two Koreas, the
United States and China to discuss peace and security on the
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that while the maritime ministry is eager about
the idea, diplomatic and security-related agencies of the
government are not so keen on it because of the safety and
security issues it poses.
</P>
<P>
Seoul predicts 50,000 to 100,000 South Korean tourists would
visit Mount Paekdu, on the DPRK-Chinese border, and generate an
estimated 25 to 50 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange income
for the DPRK in a year.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Welcomes Annan's Reform Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore today hailed
the reform package of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
pledged to support his efforts to innovate the largest world
organization.
</P>
<P>
The position was indicated by Professor S. Jayakumar, Minister
for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Singapore, in his address
at the general debate of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The debate of the 52nd session of the U.N. Assembly, which
began on last Monday, was focused on Annan's 29 reform measures
and 15 proposals put forward in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
"In the larger interests of this organization, we should all
welcome the thrust of the Secretary-General's proposals and not
take issue with too many details," Jayakumar said.
</P>
<P>
"By taking a pragmatic and eclectic approach we hope to help
move the reform process forward, even if we may have questions
about specific aspects," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister pledged to "continue to work with the
Secretary-General and other member states to make the UN a more
efficient and effective organization, one that will serve the
interests of all its members, big and small, developing as well as
industrialized."
</P>
<P>
However, Jayakumar noted some what he described as
"contradictions and ambiguities" in the proposals put forward by
some major powers for reforming the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Legend, Hitachi to Jointly Develop New Desk Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Legend Group, China's leading
computer maker, and Hitachi Ltd of Japan announced here today they
will form a strategic cooperative alliance, conduct full-dimension
technical cooperation and jointly develop new-concept desk
computers.
</P>
<P>
The project plays up the highly complementary strong points of
the Chinese and Japanese manufacturers engaged in information
technology.
</P>
<P>
As for their advantages, Hitachi has commanded the technology
of key components and has mastered the latest technological
information and resources, as well as advanced management
expertise concerning technological development.
</P>
<P>
Legend designs complete sets of computers, and has
highly-competent technical personnel and uses the world's
most-sophisticated technology in its production.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed between them, Legend will be
fully responsible for making the new products to be sold at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the new-concept computers will be more space- and
energy-efficient than the traditional models and will produce less
harmful radiation.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yuanqing, deputy president of Legend Group, disclosed that
the new generation of the computers jointly developed by both
sides will be put into the market in small batches by the end of
the year, and will show marked improvement in both function and
appearance.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Legend will produce 400,000 computers this
year. The Chinese computer maker was recently named one of the top
ten sellers in the Asian-Pacific region in a survey on the
region's PC market conducted by Dataquest, a well-known market
surveyor.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Legend scored 7.7 billion yuan in computer sales,
ranking first in China.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1984, Legend Group has grown into a multi-functional
conglomerate with 26 domestic branches and sub-branches, 21
overseas firms, and total assets of 2.8 billion yuan. Last year,
it ranked second among China's 100 top electronics enterprises and
was listed by the Ministry of Electronics Industry as one of the six
major conglomerates that will receive hefty state support.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi is a world-renowned electrical machinery manufacturer,
chalking up 68.7 billion U.S. dollars in total sales in 1996 and
ranking fifth among the world's computer-manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of long-term strategic cooperation ties
between Legend and the world's computer giants such as Microsoft,
Intel and Hitachi, shows that the Chinese computer maker is no
longer focused solely on the domestic market.

the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception in Rawalpindi, the sister city of
Islamabad, commemorating the 48th anniversary of the founding of
PRC, Iftikhar said the founding of new China on October 1, 1949
ushered in a new era in China's history.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since then, the great Chinese people have scored
remarkable achievements in the task of building the Motherland
leaving the world bewildered at the pace of its progress," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud of our brotherly relations with China," Iftikhar
said. Pakistan and China have practically demonstrated to the
world that "countries with different ideologies and systems can
not only co-exist peacefully but also maintain model relations in
all fields of human endeavor," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Chengli said
that the Chinese government and people cherish the traditional
Sino-Pak friendship and stand ready to join the Pakistani side in
establishing and developing the all-round cooperative partnership
oriented toward the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Qian Reiterates "One China" Principle (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen has said that the "One China" principle will be firmly
adhered to in fighting any separatist activity in the name of
"Taiwan Independence," "Two Chinas," "One China, One Taiwan," or
in any other forms.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a reception to mark the 48th founding
anniversary of the People's Republic of China held here today by
the State Council's Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs, Office of
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs and Taiwan Affairs Office, which was
attended by more than 1,000 compatriots from Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), Macao and Taiwan, Chinese nationals
residing abroad and foreign citizens of Chinese origin.
</P>
<P>
Qian reiterated China's firm opposition to the attempts to use
a referendum to change the fact that Taiwan is an inseparable part
of China.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to increase contacts with various parties and
people from all walks of life in Taiwan, except for a small number
of "Taiwan Independence" supporters, he said. And China is ready
to hear any opinion or suggestion that would benefit the
reunification of the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that personnel flow and other exchanges across the
Taiwan Straits have been increasing sharply, the growth of
cross-Straits trade has continued, and Taiwan compatriots have
continued to invest in the mainland since early this year.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that the fights against "Taiwan
Independence," "Two Chinas" and "One China, One Taiwan" have been
repeatedly successful. The smooth return of Hong Kong to the
motherland based on the principle of "One Country, Two Systems,"
together with the continuity of the region's prosperity and
stability, will finally have an important impact on solving the
Taiwan issue, Qian pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China has
reiterated the adherence to the basic principle of "Peaceful
Reunification" and "One Country, Two Systems," and it has vowed to
fully implement President Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposal on
improving cross-Straits relations and forging ahead on the course
of peaceful reunification of the motherland.

<P>
He said: "We must firmly and unshakably adhere to the principle
of 'One China', and oppose the separatist attempt in the forms
of 'Taiwan Independence', 'Two Chinas', 'One China, One Taiwan' or
in any other forms, and oppose the attempt to use a referendum to
change the fact that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China."
</P>
<P>
China must continue to increase the economic and cultural
exchanges across the Taiwan Straits, he added, and strive to
realize the full 'Three Direct Links', namely direct mail,
shipping and trade services across the Taiwan Straits, as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the Taiwan authorities lift the restrictions on
the development of the cross-Straits economic and trade
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that he hoped that the Taiwan authorities would
respond sincerely to President Jiang Zemin's proposal to hold
negotiations on formally ending cross-Straits confrontation based
on the principle of "One China."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities should demonstrate their sincerity and
exchange views with China regarding the arrangement of the
procedures of the cross-Straits political negotiation, Qian urged.
</P>
<P>
He said that the purpose of the political discussion is to
improve and develop the cross-Straits relations and push forward
the course of peaceful reunification step by step. Any speech or
action designed to undermine the cross-Straits relations, or
create "Two Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan", is contrary to the
will of the people and doomed to fail, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan compatriots are our blood brothers, and we will
continue to protect all their legitimate rights and interests," he
said. "We are willing to increase contacts with various parties
and people from all walks of life in Taiwan, except for the small
number of people who stubbornly stick to the stand of 'Taiwan
Independence', and we are willing to hear and discuss any views
and suggestions that would benefit the reunification of the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Georgia, Germany and other
countries have sent messages of congratulations to President
Jiang Zemin on China's 48th National Day on October 1.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Kim Jong Il, chairman of the National Defense
Commission of DPRK and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's
Army, described the founding of the People's Republic of China as
an epoch-making event for Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
It was after the founding of the People's Republic of China
that the Chinese people became the real masters of their own
country and found a new way to create a totally different kind of
life from the old society, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
during the past 48 years, the self-reliant Chinese people
carried forward the practice of plain living and hard struggle,
surmounted difficulties, put an end to the history of
impoverishment and backwardness and established a new socialist
China, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
He added that with the efforts of the CPC and the Chinese
government, China has played a more important role in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Kim spoke warmly of the achievements the Chinese people --
under the leadership of the CPC headed by Jiang -- have made in
fulfilling the mission of establishing a modern socialist country
with Chinese characteristics and realizing the unification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
As for the traditional friendship between DPRK and China, Kim
said it is the persistent policy for both parties and countries to
strengthen and develop such a friendly relationship.
</P>
<P>
In another message of congratulations, Georgian President
Eduard Shevardnadze praised China's reform policy and the great
achievements the Chinese people have made under the policy.
</P>
<P>
He said China has set an example for those countries which are
seeking their own positions in modern society.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze also mentioned Hong Kong's return to the
motherland on July 1, which, the president said, proved again that
the choice made by the Chinese leadership was correct.
</P>
<P>
German President Roman Herzog said in his message that China's
rapid development in the past 20 years has attracted worldwide
attention.
</P>
<P>
As for China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong, Herzog said it was a historic event for all Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
He added that he believed Hong Kong, after returning to its
motherland, would maintain its prosperity and development and make
greater contributions to its motherland's modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> HK Land Fund Trust Ends Historical Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) Land Fund Trust, which
was set up at the early stage of the transition period to manage
HKSARG's share of land premium income, has completed its
historical mission and will dissolve tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a farewell reception here today, Chen Rongchun, one
of the Land Fund's three trustees, announced, the Land Fund Trust
will submit the Final Accounts to Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
tomorrow and dissolve on the same day.
</P>
<P>
When the Land Fund was established in August 1986, its net
assets were only 772 million HK dollars (99 million U.S. dollars),
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to prudent management and effective operation over the
past 11 years, the Land Fund, through to the date of handover, has
increased its net assets to 170.7 billion HK dollars (21.9 billion
U.S. dollars), of which 123.6 billion HK dollars (15.8 billion
U.S. dollars) represent land premium income and 47.1 billion HK
dollars (6.0 billion U.S. dollars) accumulated investment surplus,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Adding the share of land premium income for the three-month
period from April 1 to June 30 of 26.4 billion HK dollars (3.4
billion U.S. dollars), which was received by the Land Fund on
August 29, the trustees have handed over the HKSARG net assets
valued at 197.1 billion HK dollars (25.3 billion U.S. dollars),
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"This performance has fully proved that the original decision
of establishing the Land Fund was timely and correct and the
anticipated goal of safety, preservation and appreciation of the
Fund has been realized and remarkable wealth has been created for
the HKSARG as well as over six million people of Hong Kong," Chen
commented.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, the establishment day of the HKSARG, China's Vice
Premier Qian Qichen, on behalf of the Central Government, had
formally handed over the Land Fund to the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
The Land Fund is now being managed as part of HKSARG's fiscal
reserves by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under the direction
of the financial secretary, Donald Tsang.
</P>
<P>
Chen said, the Land Fund "lays a solid foundation for the
finances of the HKSARG and at the same time contributes to
maintaining the status of Hong Kong as an international financial
center, stabilizing the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollar and
facilitating the economic and social development of the HKSAR."
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the reception were Tung Chee Hwa and Jiang
Enzhu, the director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
Tung, on behalf of the HKSARG and people of Hong Kong, thanked
the three trustees appointed by the Central Government for
creating remarkable wealth for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He acclaimed that the Fund has played a major and stabilizing
role in the early days of the HKSARG, adding its establishment
demonstrated both the care for the HKSARG and the vision of the
Central Government.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the fact that the Fund has weathered one
after another global financial crisis over the past years to
achieve an average annual rate of return of 9.09 percent, which is
about one percentage point higher than the annual inflation rate.

Chunyun met today with a delegation of Nepal, led by Pradeep
Shrestha, first vice-president of the Federation of the Nepalese
Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
</P>

projects with less investment and quick results to benefit the
peoples, and enhance a steady development of bilateral trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He briefed the visitors on the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC).

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Two passengers were
arrested separately in South Africa's Cape Town and Johannesburg
international airports on Friday after they were found to have
swallowed 137 condoms filled with cocaine, police said today.
</P>
<P>
A man from South America was detained at Cape Town
International Airport after an X-ray check found that there were
70 condoms in his stomach filled with cocaine, the South African
Press Association (SAPA) quoted a Cape Town police spokeswoman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The cocaine weighed one kilogram and had a street value of
350,000 Rand (about 74,000 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The suspect was given laxatives and expunged the condoms
during the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
A second man was arrested at Johannesburg International
Airport after he was found to have swallowed 67 condoms filled
with cocaine with a street value of 283,500 Rand (60,300
Dollars), SAPA quoted another local police spokeswoman as saying.

for Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The cocaine he swallowed weighed 945 grams.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) today approved a 200 million U.S. dollars loan to help China
fund a railway project in its resource-rich northwestern province
of Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
A new 368-kilometer railway line linking the cities of Shenmu
and Yanan will open up abundant resources of low sulfur coal in
mineral-rich but land-locked Shanxi province, the Manila-based
financial body said.
</P>
<P>
The project will create 370,000 new jobs by 2005 and
drastically reduce poverty from 22 percent to 5 percent in a
region where the lack of transport links has been a major
constraint to development, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB will also provide a technical assistance grant of
400,000 dollars to help the local railway companies in Shanxi
province develop financially viable commercial operations.
</P>
<P>
The Shanxi Xiyan Railway Company will be the executing agency
for the project, which is due for completion in December 2002.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan, drawn from its ordinary capital resources, will
have an interest rate determined in accordance with the bank's
pool-based variable lending rate system for U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China's Stock Market Expected to Grow Stably </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite generally declining
stock indices, Chinese experts insist that they have good reasons
to be optimistic about the prospects of the country's stock market.
</P>
<P>
The main stock indices for China's two stock exchanges in
Shanghai and Shenzhen have been on a downward trend for more than
four months.
</P>
<P>
The reverse movement of the stock market against the sound
macro economic growth and upbeat forecasts, especially those in
recent weeks, has made investors hesitant about making new buying
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Many investors fear that the expected acceleration in market
expansion following the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, which endorsed a shareholding system in the
reforms of the State-owned enterprises, will result in an
oversupply of stocks. They also fear that many underperforming
enterprises will rush to the stock market to raise funds.
</P>
<P>
However, experts say that such fears are not justified, quoting
stock market administration sources as saying that China will
pursue not rash but stable advances in stock market development.
</P>
<P>
The stock market expansion will not be too rapid and companies
have to pass stern examinations for listing, they point out.
</P>
<P>
Jia Xiaoliang, an official in the State Economic and Trade
Commission, reaffirmed that only well-performing enterprises will
be listed.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the measures taken since last December by the
Chinese authorities to eliminate speculation, such as the
imposition of a ten percent ceiling on daily stock price movements
and banning bank credits from entering the stock market, are
intended to safeguard the market order and prevent small investors
from the woes of wild ups and downs in share prices.
</P>
<P>
Also, China has formulated more than 250 stock market laws,
rules and regulations, and investors' risk awareness has
increased considerably, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate institutional buying and a lack of investment funds
are two major factors affecting the stable development of China's
stock market, according to Zhang Houqi, deputy general manager of
the Research and Development Section of China Securities Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, Chen Yaoxian, chairman of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, said earlier that China will
take measures to foster more institutional
investors. Well-informed sources say that details of the measures
will be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
China's share issue quota this year is 30 billion yuan, twice
the figure for last year. The quota for next year is estimated at
50 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, China had 708 listed companies, which had
a capital stock of 159.7 billion shares and a market
capitalization of 1.64 trillion yuan, about 24 percent of the
gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Japanese Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China and Japan can bring good-neighborly and
stable bilateral ties into the 21st century only if the principles
set forth in the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration and the
China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty are strictly followed.
</P>
<P>
Li made this remark during a meeting with a Japanese delegation
consisting of representatives from all walks of life, which was
led by former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and directors of
various Japan-China friendship organizations.
</P>
<P>
Li said that 25 years ago, the governments of the two countries
signed the renowned Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration and realized
the normalization of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The then Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, with his vision
and insight as a statesman, visited China and opened up a new
chapter of Sino-Japanese ties together with Chairman Mao Zedong
and Premier Zhou Enlai, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The present sound relationship, which has been hard-won,
reflects the long-term efforts of the statesmen of the former
generation and the people of the two countries, including those
present at the meeting, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 25 years, bilateral co-operation in various
sectors has progressed rapidly, he said. The Chinese government,
pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace, attaches special
importance to its relations with the neighboring countries, and it
is China's consistent policy to develop its relationship with
Japan, China's close neighbor, which is linked by a narrow
strip of water, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the guests on the gist of the 15th National
Congress of the Chinese Communist Party which was held earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Takeshita said this year marks the 25th anniversary of the
normalization of diplomatic relations; the 20th anniversary of the
signing of the Peace and Friendship Treaty is next year, and it is
of great significance for both countries to push forward bilateral
ties by celebrating the two big events.
</P>
<P>
He said he totally agrees with a Chinese saying that "when you
drink the water, think of those who dug the well." The present
bilateral relationship reflects the arduous efforts of several
generations, and the present generation shoulders the
responsibility to pass on the traditional friendship to the next
generation with a goal of achieving a lasting relationship, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yoshio Sakurauchi, chairman of the Japanese Association for the
Promotion of International Trade, and other Japanese guests said
they look forward to Li's official visit to Japan this November,
and expressed the conviction that the visit will further promote
bilateral ties.

ISLAMABAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today expressed
"serious concern" on the reports regarding the commencement of
regular production of Prithvi Missiles by India.
</P>
<P>
"India's decision is bound to escalate tension and add to the
deterioration of the security climate in the area," a Foreign
Office spokesman said here today, adding South Asia was among the
few remaining "flash points" in the post-cold war world.
</P>
<P>
The production of Prithvi, which is capable of carrying nuclear
warheads, represents a qualitative change in the fragile security
situation of the region, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"It was regrettable that New Delhi has responded by induction
of sophisticated missile systems while Pakistan was pushing for
confidence building measures including a zero missile regime in
South Asia, and has offered a "Non-Aggression Pact" to India," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the timing of the announcement of these
militarization programs coinciding with the announcement of
India's candidature for a permanent seat of the U.N. Security
Council is "curious".
</P>
<P>
"Adherence to the Charter of the United Nations and respect for
Security Council Resolutions rather than military might should be
the criteria in this campaign," he said.

<HEADLINE> Photo Show Features China in Foreigners' Eyes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of photos taken
by foreigners who live in or have visited China opened here today
to mark the 48th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, named "China Through Foreigners' Eyes," presented
300 foreigners' photos of China. They were selected from some
1,500 photos offered by over 500 photographers from more than 60
countries.
</P>
<P>
The photos in the show cover almost every aspect of Chinese
society, painting a fairly complete picture of China's reform and
opening-up drive, social progress and people's everyday life.
</P>
<P>
Some of the pictures illustrated the three major events in
China's political life this year: the death of senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, the return of Hong Kong to the motherland and the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Other photos
reflected the daily routines of Chinese people's life, such as the
morning exercise of a centenarian.
</P>
<P>
And many pictures focus on the country's picturesque landscape,
rich cultural heritage and colorful folk customs.
</P>
<P>
"This photo show is intended to help develop the friendship
between the Chinese people and peoples in the rest of the world,
thus making the world a more peaceful and beautiful place," one of
the show's organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Today's show, jointly sponsored by the All-China Journalists'
Association, Chinese Association for Cultural Exchanges with
Foreign Countries, Xinhua News Agency and 15 other units, is the
fifth of its kind in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The first "China Through Foreigners' Eyes" photo show was
staged in Beijing in 1987. It was named after a special column
opened 16 years ago in a Beijing-based "Bridge Magazine," which
was sponsored by the All-China Journalists' Association.

<HEADLINE> HK Deposits, Loans, Advances Fall Slightly in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total deposits,
loans and advances fell slightly during August 1997, according to
statistics published today by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA).
</P>
<P>
Total deposits declined by 0.8 percent in the month, reversing
a 0.5 percent rise in July. The fall was primarily attributable to
a 1.4 percent drop in HK dollar deposits, which more than offset
an increase of 0.2 percent in foreign currency deposits.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA release said the fall in HK dollar deposits was
across-the-board, partly reflecting the less buoyant asset
markets.
</P>
<P>
In line with the fall in deposits, total loans and advances
declined by 0.4 percent in August, which dropped by 0.6 percent in
July.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The latest bimonthly public
opinion survey conducted by Hong Kong's Home Affairs Bureau has
revealed a more buoyant mood and confident outlook among the
people of Hong Kong as compared with previous survey findings.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted over the telephone, showed that 80
percent of the respondents were confident that Hong Kong would
continue to be prosperous and stable, which is eight percentage
points higher than a similar survey conducted in July.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 82 percent expected the situation to improve or
remain unchanged in the coming 12 months, which is also up by
eight percentage points.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the survey said this optimistic outlook was
collaborated by the finding that only four percent of the 1,033
respondents considered Hong Kong's future to be a problem, which
is lower compared to eight percent in the last survey.
</P>
<P>
He added that 81 percent of the respondents were satisfied with
the present situation, which is four percentage points higher than
in the last survey.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the positive outlook appeared to have carried
over to the public's perception of government performance, which
has won the approval of 53 percent of the people, representing a
three percentage point improvement.
</P>
<P>
Of the three most often mentioned problems, housing remains on
top of the list at 63 percent, followed by social welfare related
and labor-related problems.

<HEADLINE> German Gov't Starts to Sell its Final Stake in Lufthansa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- German national airline Lufthansa
has reached its final stage of privatization as the German government
today started to sell its remaining 35.7 percent stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
The placement of 143 million Lufthansa shares held by the
government represents the second-largest stock flotation in German
history after last year's privatization of the state-owned telecom
giant Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
The share subscription offer is due to last until October 10 when
the final sales price will be announced.
</P>
<P>
On the current prices of around 36 marks (21 U.S. dollars), stock
experts predicted that the Bonn government was likely to make some 4.5
billion marks (2.6 billion dollars) from the sale.
</P>
<P>
The Lufthansa stock flotation is part of Bonn's efforts to boost
government revenues and to increase the country's chance to meet the
fiscal standards required for joining the planned single European
currency, the Euro, in January 1999.

<HEADLINE> New Commercial Bank Office Opened in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A commercial bank office
was opened here today, the first since the United Arab Emirates
banned such banks in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said the opening of the representative office of the
Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corporation indicates an approaching
revision of the ban on new commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Central Bank of the UAE has begun to revise the
ban on new commercial banks because the market has sharply grown,"
a banker in the UAE's Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The UAE introduced the ban amid fierce strong competition among
banks seeking a bigger share of the market in the oil-rich state,
which is classified as over-banked.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that despite its relatively low
population of 2.4 million, the UAE has 47 banks, 28 of which are
foreign-owned, with a total capital of some 63.4 billion
U.S. dollars at the end of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading American Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading American newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The rate of cancer among American children has been rising
for decades. Many experts suspect that the increase may be partly
the result of growing exposure to new chemicals in the
environment. That suspicion, while still unproven, is beginning to
shape Federal research priorities and environmental strategies.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and Palestinian leaders said they expected that a
meeting today with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in New
York would help revive talks on a range of issues. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said that the Palestinian Authority
had taken "preliminary steps" in cracking down on militants, and
he released 17 million U.S. dollars that had been withheld from
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Russian organized crime groups flush with dollars, are
forming alliances with Colombian drug traffickers in the
Caribbean, acquiring cocaine for delivery to Europe and providing
weapons to Latin American mafias, according to U.S. European and
Latin American law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
-- The first of the showdowns between the tobacco industry and
the U.S. states that have sued it begins today in a Texas federal
courtroom. Taxas is asking for 8.6 billion U.S. dollars in the
case, claiming that the tobacco industry concealed information
about the health effects of tobacco and the addictiveness of
nicotine.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Congress hopes to pass a stopgap bill before fiscal 1997
ends tomorrow, having finished only three of 13 spending measures.
Included is a three-week delay in a deadline for undocumented
immigrants to seek residence. Republican leaders Friday agreed to
boost Environment Protection Agency funds in return for more
spending in GOP districts.
</P>
<P>
-- Minorities account for 29 percent of new home-owners in the
past three years, according to an analysis of Census figures by
the Kennedy School of Government. The report also says that the
number of minority home-owners increased 38 percent from 1985 to
1995.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Manufacturers Score Economy Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite some positiveurers
trend in the Nigerian economy, the country's manufacturers have
described the overall performance of economy as below
expectations.
</P>
<P>
In its half-year economic report released at the weekend, the
Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) said: "apart from
local raw materials sourcing which rose from 54 percent to 58
percent, all other indicators maintained a disturbing downward
trend."
</P>
<P>
Some 11,907 jobs were swept away between January and June this
year, a drop of 12 percent from 48,909 by December last year in
the sector, which also witnessed a 26.3 percent fall in
investment.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers' unsold inventory swelled to 4.6 billion Naira
(about 55 million U.S. Dollars), 13.7 percent over 3.97 billion
Naira (some 48 million Dollars) at the end of last year,
according to MAN.
</P>
<P>
But it was a drop compared with 6.033 billion Naira (some 73
million Dollars) in the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
MAN statistics also revealed that capacity utilization in
companies also declined to 29.35 percent by June this year from
33.94 percent from the second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, industrial output correspondingly narrowedurers
to 31.4 billion Naira (about 378 million Dollars), compared with
33.7 billion Naira (about 406 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The five sub-sectors hit hardest by reduced capacity
utilization are those of textiles, wearing apparels, leather
products and carpets; wood and wood products; non-metallic
products; plastic, rubber and foam products; and electrical and
electronic products.
</P>
<P>
Citing the petrol shortage in the economic center of Lagos and
environs as well as the failure in the refineries, the
non-governmental organization further said that the 5.5 percent
growth target in the country's gross domestic product projected
in the 1997 budget may not be met.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no government report on the economic
performance of the country in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the achievements resulted from government
macro-economic control have been widely accepted in the country,
including the manufacturing sector which accounts for an
approximate 10 percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Earlier statistics show that inflation rate dropped from 28
percent at the end of last year to 15.7 percent by July this
year, while foreign exchange reserves came up from 4.08 billion
Dollars to 7.4 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the local currency to the Dollar has also
been stabilized.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact, the national economy has not been bounced
back, according to Finance Minister Chief Anthony Ani.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of bankers last month, Ani acknowledged that real
growth was still below expectations and the government needed to
promote it by encouraging foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the government's commitment to provide the
much-needed enabling environment for investors.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Strives to Increase Agri-production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Federal Government
has prepared a comprehensive plan to increase the agricultural
production with an aim to completely end its dependence on import
of food items, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The 9th Five-Year Development Plan beginning from next year
envisaged 3.83 percent annual increase in wheat production, 3.22
percent in rice production and 7.86 percent in cotton production,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in agri-production will not be achieved through
the significant increase in the area under cultivation, but by
changing the cropping pattern and getting the higher per acre
yield through the use of latest agri-technology, they said.
</P>
<P>
The government was keen to achieve food autarky in the country,
because a sizable portion of national income is being spent on the
import of food items, they said.

HAIKOU, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The first ten buses fueled

Haikou, capital of China's southernmost Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
This makes Haikou the third Chinese city after Guangzhou and
Shenzhen to use natural gas-driven vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The buses burning natural gas are considered safe and
environmentally-friendly, and will help to curb the increasing air
pollution in cities caused by excessive auto emissions.
</P>
<P>
The "green buses" emit 70 percent less pollutant fumes,
according to automobile experts.
</P>
<P>
Haikou will invest a total of 30 million yuan to install a
natural-gas fuel burning system to 5,400 buses and cars.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Awarded S$20,000 in Defamation Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The High Court of Singapore
awarded Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong 20,000 Singapore dollars, or
13,160 U.S. dollars at current exchange rate, in damages in his
defamation suit against opposition Workers' Party leader J.B.
Jeyaretnam, Singapore television reported today.
</P>
<P>
The case arose out of Jeyaretnam's words at an election rally
on the eve of the polling day early this year.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiff's case was that Jeyaretnam had defamed the Prime
Minister for criminal activity by saying that the then Workers'
Party candidate Tang Liang Hong had placed before Jeyaretnam
police reports against "Mr. Goh Chok Tong and his people".
</P>
<P>
In his 142-page judgment, Justice S. Rajendran said because of
the high standing of the Prime Minister, Mr. Goh was awarded
10,000 Singapore dollars in general damages.
</P>
<P>
An ordinary man, the Judge said, on hearing the words, could
have believed the Prime Minister might be investigated for an
offense.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the level of defamation was not as high as
claimed by Mr. Goh, which meant the words implied that Mr. Goh had
committed the alleged criminal offenses, the television report
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that another 10,000 Singapore dollars was awarded to
Mr. Goh as "aggravated damages". Justice Rajendran said that this
was because Jeyaretnam acted with reckless disregard to the
consequences of his actions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
He also took into account Jeyaretnam's conduct of his defense
during the trial, where, the report said, his lawyer tried to put
government policy on the stand, with little or nothing to back up
the accusations.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister was also awarded 60 percent of the court
costs, which means that he can claim from Jeyaretnam costs of the
five-day trial last month, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Begins Gas Export to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today began to export
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to the U.S. from Escravos in the
south, marking a major achievement in developing its huge natural
gas resources.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian Tribune report said the Escravos gas project, a
joint venture between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
and the Chevron Nigeria Limited, is now utilizing 165 million
standard cubic feet of associated gas daily.
</P>
<P>
Besides exporting 8,000 barrels of LPG daily to the U.S.
market, the project in the Delta State has also started supplying
dry gas to the Nigerian Gas Company, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Escravos gas project was started in 1991. Total investment
involved is estimated at 569 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is blessed with 110 trillion cubic feet of gas
reserve, the 10th largest in the world. However, it is estimated
that about 70 percent of the associated gas produced in the
country's oil fields are being flared.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Escravos gas project, several other gas
projects are under construction, including the Nigeria Liquefied
Natural Gas Project with an investment of 3.6 billion US Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Airports Are Danger Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Three major Nigerian airports
have been tagged danger zones by the International Federation of
Airline Pilots Association, the Nigerian Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
The three airports are, Muritala Muhammed international
airport in Lagos, the Aminu Kano international airport in Kano
and the Port Harcourt international airport in River State.
</P>
<P>
The association dubbed the three airports into class three
critically deficient airports during its recent 33rd general
meeting in Accra, Ghana, where it viewed over 80 airports in
Africa and the Middle East, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This classification means the airports are below the
international civil aviation organization safety standard
concerning the provision of navigational facilities and aids, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
In a reaction to this development, the report said, the
Nigerian National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers
also expressed similar concern over the poor state of airports in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our association hopes to work closely with the management of
the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and the Federal
Ministry of Aviation to correct this worrisome situation," it
said in a news release.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Unemployment Reaches Three-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel's unemployment
rate reached a three-year high of 8 percent in July and August,
according to an initial data published today by the Israeli
Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate is far more higher than Israeli Treasury's
most pessimistic figures, which suggested the unemployment rate
would be at 7.7 percent by December 31 this year and 7.9 percent
12 months later.
</P>
<P>
The data showed the people out of work numbered 180,000
respectively in July and August, compared with 168,000 on average
during the second quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the data, 41,000 people have joined the ranks of
the unemployed since the beginning of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury also predicted two sets of figures for
unemployment by 2000. In the optimistic view, the jobless rate will
decline to 6.8 percent, but in the worst case, 11.4 percent of
the workforce will be unemployed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Japanese PMs Exchange Greetings on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto today exchanged messages
of congratulation on the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li noted that in the past 25 years since the
normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, marked
progress has been achieved in bilateral relations through the
concerted efforts of the two governments and the two peoples from
all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
This has not only brought about great benefits to the two
countries, but also made important contribution to peace,
stability and development in this region and the world at large,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Premier stressed that the bilateral relations,
which have developed into such a hard-won but good situation at
present, should be cherished by both sides.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China and Japan are important neighboring
countries and major economic cooperation partners of each
other. When the world is moving fast toward multi-polarization, it
is of great significance for the two countries to strengthen their
good-neighborly relations of cooperation looking into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li said he hoped the two countries will take advantage
of the 25th anniversary of normalization of relations to make
continued efforts to ensure that the bilateral relations will
develop in a healthier and more stable way on the basis of the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Treaty of Peace and
Friendship between the People's Republic of China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Prime Minister Hashimoto said China and Japan
realized the historic normalization of bilateral relations on the
very day 25 years ago. Since then, the two sides have surmounted
different social systems and achieved friendly cooperative
relations in various fields.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to China, Hashimoto said, he and his
Chinese counterpart recalled the development of the bilateral
relations since the normalization of their diplomatic relations,
and reached a consensus that in the following 25 years, the two
sides should strengthen dialogue and deepen cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hashimoto expressed confidence that the
exchanges of visits between leaders of the two countries will help
the Sino-Japanese relations develop in a broader and more
extensive way.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side is willing to work together with the Chinese
side to bring the Sino-Japanese friendly relations into the 21st
century, Hashimoto said.

LAGOS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor has presented a 12-million-U.S.-dollar interim budget to
parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
No information is available on the allocation of funds in the

The budget for the September-December period of this year also
covered logistics and development, according to a report reaching

foreign exchange earner for the government, which was inaugurated
in August.
</P>

In a letter to parliament dominated by members of his ruling
National Patriotic Party, Taylor said he would maintain "sound
fiscal policy".
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Phase Out Leaded Gasoline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today approved the phase-out of leaded gasoline by the end
of the century as one of the measures to solve the worsening air
pollution in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under a newly-signed executive order by Ramos, leaded gasoline
will be phased out in Metro Manila not later than January 1, 2000
and other parts of the country by January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Ramos described the signing of the order as "very timely" in
view of the fact that the country is now experiencing two major
environmental disasters: the El Nino phenomenon and the haze
brought by forest fire in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Wide use of leaded gasoline by some kinds of vehicles is
considered one of the main factors that cause the severe air
pollution problem in the Philippines.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Sabah state
today launched its Maritime Strategic Development Framework as an
initial step towards developing the sector in the state.
</P>
<P>
The framework, launched today by the state Chief Minister Yong
Teck Lee in the state's capital Kota Kinabalu, spells out several
objectives including developing infrastructure and support
services, improving sea links, developing the shipbuilding
industry, and continued use of marine resources.
</P>
<P>
Under the framework, the state Communication and Works Ministry
would be in charge of maritime matters in the state, according to
a report by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama from Kota
Kinabalu.
</P>
<P>
The documents on the development of the maritime sector are
important to Sabah in its efforts to position itself as a regional
center for the maritime industry, especially in the East ASEAN
Growth Area (EAGA) comprising Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the
Philippines, Yong was quoted by Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Such a framework would provide a guide on the direction of the
industry in the state now and in future, where previously there
was no special reference center for the maritime sector, the chief
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Yong also said that Sabah would organize the Sabah
International Maritime Exhibition next September as part of its
efforts to promote the maritime industry in the state.

CANBERRA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The travel allowance brawl,

<HEADLINE> More Palestinian Workers Allowed to Enter Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel Army announced today
to allow additional 8,000 Palestinian workers to enter Israel
starting this morning in a move to help reactivate the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
This brought the total number of Palestinian workers allowed
in to 29,000, who had been barred from entering the country since
Israel imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
after the September 4 suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem,
which killed eight people and wounded nearly 200 others.
</P>
<P>
Israel began to ease the closure gradually two weeks ago in
response to the security cooperation from the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), that has arrested more than 200 Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) activists in the recent roundup.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision also comes at a time when Israel and the PNA
may resume direct talks in the framework of the Oslo accords in
the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the
resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have seen a
statemate since Israel started construction of a new Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, was made possible by the
discussions held in Washington between Israeli and Palestinian
delegations.
</P>
<P>
An official announcement of the resumption of the peace talks
is expected today at the meeting in New York among Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy, PNA President Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud
Abbas and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
In another positive step to push peace talks forward,
Netanyahu said that he has given instructions to the transfer to
the PNA 59 million shekels (about 16 million U.S. dollars), half
of the funds withheld by Israel since the Mahaneh Yehuda attack on
July 30.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side welcomed the positive measures taken by
the Israeli government. Arafat's spokesman Marwan Kanafani said
that "the Israeli government agreed to resume the negotiations
committees and we see this as a positive step in the right
direction."

</P>
<P>
Hashimoto made the pledge in a major policy speech to the 141st
extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet (parliament) which
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the 25th anniversary of normalization of Sino-Japanese

</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, Hashimoto reiterated his vow to push

the overhaul of a creaking government bureaucracy, which he said
has shown "serious limitations."
</P>
<P>
"Without administrative reform, I don't think we can gain the
trust of the people," said Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who won his reelection as leader of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) earlier this month, reshuffled his
cabinet on September 11.

<HEADLINE> Saudi, Yemeni Border Dispute to be Solved Soon: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The decades-old border
dispute between Yemen and Saudi Arabia will be resolved once and
for all in a few weeks, Yemeni Interior Minister Hussein Moh'd
Arab has said.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister made the remarks in an interview with
local English daily Arab Times published today.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the delay in ending the border dispute
between the two countries mainly due to the Gulf War in 1991,
they succeeded in reaching common grounds on issues of security
and stability.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that negotiations between Yemen and Saudi
Arabia has led to positive results, adding that the leadership of
the two countries have the political will to solve the border
issue and mend the relationship between the two countries in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that the forthcoming weeks will witness new
positive developments in resolving the disputes between the two
countries, especially the border issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute between Yemen and Saudi Arabia dates back
to the 1960s when Britain ended its domination of the Gulf,
leaving ill-defined frontiers separating the countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been locked in border disputes since
then, but since February 1995 when the Memorandum of
Understanding concerning the solution of the border issues was
signed, tensions have been eased and bilateral ties have been
improving.
</P>
<P>
Saudi-Yemeni demarcation negotiations were launched
accordingly through joint committees formed in line with the
memorandum which laid the basis for a solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Intensified political efforts for the same purpose started
from July this year when Saudi and Yemeni interior ministers
exchanged letters from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh to exchange formulas of final
solution.
</P>
<P>
The latest effort on solving the issue was the Yemeni interior
minister's visit to Saudi Arabia on August 9 to pave the way for
an expected visit by Saleh to Saudi Arabia to solve the border
disputes between the two neighboring Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Saleh paid his second visit to Saudi Arabia in two years in
early February to discuss issues of border demarcation between
the two countries and hold talks with Saudi leaders on bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed security and economic agreements
last year to boost bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> China Honors Foreign Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A meeting was held here today
to confer 1997 Friendship Awards on 45 foreign experts for their
outstanding contribution to the development of China's economic
construction, science, technology and culture.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Foreign Experts selected this year's
winners from over 80,000 foreign experts working throughout
China. This year's group of winner's included 12 experts in the
cultural and educational sector, 29 in economics, technology and
management, and four representatives from experts organizations
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The winners ranged between the ages of 35-74 and many have
worked in China for as long as a decade.
</P>
<P>
In an address at the awarding meeting, Chinese Vice-Premier Zou
Jiahua said the introduction of foreign expertise and experience,
as well as exchanges of skilled personnel and international
cooperation in economics, science, culture, education and other
areas are major measures of China's modernization drive. The
policy will remain unchanged in the future, said Zou.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier noted that China is still a developing country
with relatively backward scientific and technological levels. He
added that the foundation of China's economy is relatively weak
and the overall quality and efficiency of the national economy is
relatively weak.
</P>
<P>
China still lags behind developed nations and it is imperative
that the nation absorb and learn from the achievements of mankind
as a whole, said Zou.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that more foreign experts will become
involved in China's reform, opening and modernization efforts, and
added that China will continue to send technicians and management
personnel for study and training in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China invited some 570,000 foreign experts
to work in the country between 1979-1996. Over 80,000 foreign
experts are expected to come to work in China this year.

<P>
TOKYO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Diet (parliament)
opened the 141st extraodinary session today with debate expected
to focus on new guidelines for Japan-U.S. cooperation and the
government's reform program.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the 75-day session is the new
Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines, released last week in
New York.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines paves the way for Japan to provide a wide
range of logistic and noncombatant support to the U.S. military in
peacetime and in emergencies "in areas surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
The Diet session seems unquiet as opposition parties threatened
to submit a non-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's cabinet for the recent resignation of Koko Sato as
Management and Coordination Agency chief. They said Hashimoto
should take the blame for the appointment of Sato who was
convicted in 1986 of taking bribes in the 1970s Lockheed payoff
scandal.
</P>
<P>
They also threatened to boycott debate at all Diet Committees
unless an Osaka dealer, who claims to have donated political funds

<HEADLINE> China's Defense Industry: Turning Swords into Ploughshares (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- On streets of many Chinese
cities, mini-van taxis are very popular and convenient
transportation tools for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
For every 10 such taxis, seven are manufactured by former
weapons factories. These factories also turn out one fifth of the
total national output of cameras and almost two thirds of
motorcycles. Even the rice on the dinner table may be one of the
325 kinds of grains that have been treated by nuclear radiation
technology, formerly the preserve of the military.
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, Chinese people's knowledge of the defense
industry was limited to a number of factories with names
mysteriously coded in Arabic numerals to protect their
identity. Today people are only too familiar with it through its
civilian products throughout their daily life, from cars and color
TV sets to tiny dress buttons.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a massive effort to turn swords into ploughshares
that started in the early 1980s, the Chinese people are now able
to enjoy all the material benefits brought by a converting defense
industry.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the defense industry now manufactures 15,000 kinds of
civilian products in the fields of communication, transportation,
energy, light industry, medicine, textile, engineering and
construction. Civilian products accounted for 80 percent of the
total output value generated by the industry in 1996, with an
average growth rate of 20 percent in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The defense industry is expected to claim a bigger share of the
country's merchandise market. "For one thing, weapons factories
enjoy a good reputation for quality and credibility," said Zhang
Junjiu, president of the China National Ordnance Industrial
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The industry's potential for further development is based on
its strength. Before 1979, massive amounts of money had been spent
constructing what was called the "Third Front," a strategic rear
base in central and southwestern China with numerous new weapons
factories.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1978, China's defense industry had a huge amount
of assets and employed three million scientists, engineers and
workers. Its factories were fed by orders from a huge army and did
not have to worry a bit about hunger.
</P>
<P>
Good times came to an end abruptly in 1985, when China reduced
its defense forces by one million troops and cut down on
procurement of military products. The defense industry was called
upon to turn to civilian production for survival and
self-development.
</P>
<P>
A number of defense factories moved out of their hiding places
right into center of economic activities, such as coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
Though facing difficulties brought by the transition of a
planned to a market economy, defense industry had three things
they could count on in their efforts to produce civilian
goods: high technology, ample labor and good reputation.
</P>
<P>
These factors have turned out to be crucial in their
"swords-to-ploughshares" conversion. Weapon producers in southwest
China, for example, now mainly produce motor vehicles and auto
parts. They sold 12 billion yuan (1.5 billion US dollars) worth of
such products last year, 95 percent of their total sales.

<TEXT>
<P>
The following names are familiar to most Chinese: Jialing,
Jianshe and Chang'an. Jialing tops the country's sales list of
motorcycles and is closely followed by Jianshe, another motorcycle
producer, and Chang'an, maker of mini-cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
Cars and motorcycles are actually the two most important
civilian products of China's arms industry. Zhang Junjiu told that
the industry will invest more in the two products in the hope of
making it a mainstay of China's automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
Electronics is another civilian field that the defense industry
has an edge. Mianyang, a medium-sized city in southwest China's
Sichuan province, has become limelight for three former arms
factories there now become giant civilian product makers.
</P>
<P>
Changhong Corp. is the country's biggest television producer
today. The corp. last year made 4.8 million color TV sets, which
replaced foreign brands as best sellers.
</P>
<P>
Huafeng, making electronic plugs, has hundreds of rivals
including those set up by foreign investors. But no one has yet
been able to shake the position of Huafeng as China's king of
electronic plugs.
</P>
<P>
Jiuzhou's strength lies in an ability to produce 700 kinds of
cable TV facilities. Last year, it sold more than one million
terminals and prided itself on taking up one third of the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
Sales of the three's civilian products accounted for 95 percent
of the total of the country's electronics industry. And their
employees' annual income is more than double the average of
Chinese workers.
</P>
<P>
"We will put more efforts into the development of high-level
civilian products in the next five years," said Cao Gangchuan,
director of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for
national Defense under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
With the pledge, more and better civilian products manufactured
by defense industry enterprises will enter ordinary people's homes
and lives. And, with continued production conversion of its
defense industry, China's modernization drive is expected to fare
even better in years to come.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Moderately Tight Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to follow
a moderately tight monetary policy well into the next century,
according to a senior Chinese bank official.
</P>
<P>
"We will retain a monetary tight monetary policy in order to
control inflation and ensure sustained, stable and healthy
national economic development," said Shang Fulin, deputy-governor
of the People's Bank of China. Shang made the remarks during a
recent international seminar on the financial systems in China and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
China's moderately tight monetary policy will remain unchanged
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000) and the
foreseeable future thereafter in order to ensure the stability of
the country's currency, according to Shang.
</P>
<P>
Four-odd years of macroeconomic control have led to a decline
in the nation's inflation rate from 21.7 percent in 1994 to 1.8
percent for the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
"macroeconomic policies centered on controlling inflation have
been a major success," said Shang, adding the nation's
macroeconomic environment will continue to improve.
</P>
<P>
Shang predicted that China's annual economic growth rate for
this year will approach 10 percent, with inflation remaining below
five percent.
</P>
<P>
China will record yet another trade surplus this year despite
the recent currency crisis in Southeast Asia, according to another
central bank officials at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials noted that China should learn a lesson from the
crisis and step up its effort to reform exchange rate mechanisms
and adopt measures to eliminate potential inflationary pressures
and financial risks in the process of economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 financial officials, experts and scholars from
China, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Venezuela and a number of other
countries attended the seminar.

<HEADLINE> New Cassava Varieties to Help Uganda Fight Famine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from China,
Colombia, Uganda and United Kingdom have developed resistant
varieties to cassava mosaic, a disease which destroys the
plant, ''the New Vision'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
Excited local scientists in Namulonge Research Institute in
central Uganda said the planting materials of the new varieties
are being distributed to various districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
Cassava is a buffer plant against famine during long dry
season in Uganda. But a new variety of cassava mosaic has
devastated cassava gardens in the country in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The research team has isolated the new variety in February
this year and the result of the research have been accepted in
April.
</P>
<P>
A report on the results is published in the British journal,
the General Virology, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The research result will save an annual loss of 60,000
hectares of cassava in the country, or some 600,000 tons of the
roots worth 60 billions of Uganda Shillings (some 60 millions
U.S. Dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
The disease also causes a 1.5 billion U.S. Dollars loss in
other parts of Africa and on the Indian sub-continent, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The study was carried out in Dundee, Scotland with study
material from Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The planting material is being multiplied at Namulonge and
Serere research centers in the center before distribution to
farming communities for further multiplication.

</P>
<P>
The committee will dispatch three groups of lawmakers to
Jiangxi and Guizhou provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The criminal investigation
departments of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda have agreed to work
together to combat increased drug trafficking in the region, The
East African reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held in the lake town of Entebbe of Uganda last
week, the weekly paper said, the three East African countries
decided to set up a system for communication and exchange of
information relating to narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The meeting attended by criminal investigation department
directors of the three countries pointed out that Uganda had been
made a favorable ground for illicit business in drug trafficking
mainly due to inadequate border controls.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Uganda Anti Narcotics Unit seized more than 258 tons
of cannabis and arrested 298 drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting attributed the growing use of East Africa as a
conduit for narcotics in recent years to the liberalization of
trade and lack of sophisticated drug detecting equipment at
points of entry.
</P>
<P>
A source said Ugandan laws are still lenient on drug
traffickers and this may hamper regional efforts to fight the
drug trafficking practice.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Tanzania has acquired more than eight
sniffer dogs stationed at main points of entry while Kenya has
four and Uganda has only one.
</P>
<P>
The main drugs available in the region are cannabis, heroin,
cocaine, mandrax, metaqualone and khat.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi To Focus on Five Pillar Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province
will revamp its economic structure into five pillar industries,
according to a report in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
They are the coal- and coke-centered chemical system, the power
system with coal as its raw material, the metallurgical, machinery
and tourism systems, deputy governor Liu Zhenhua said recently.
</P>
<P>
Because the development of 60 key industrial groups in the
province demands astronomical investment, the provincial
government will help the enterprises raise money through various
channels, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the province plans to encourage more enterprises to
issue shares at home and abroad, as well as attract more foreign
investment by improving its infrastructure and investment climate.
</P>
<P>
At present, only nine companies in the province have gone
public. This year, two or three companies in the province will
flow shares at home, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi Province is strong in the coal, heavy chemical and
energy industries. Its annual coal production is 320 million
tons. The province provides 1.5 billion kilowatt-hours each year
to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region.
</P>
<P>
Tourism resources are also abundant in the province. About 70
percent of its ancient buildings were constructed before 600 AD,
the deputy governor said.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa's Drive to Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- An aggressive marketing
campaign aimed at attracting tourists to the southern African
region has been launched after the approval of the regional
tourism organization charter, the Herald daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Executive director of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) tourism organization Shepard Nyaruwata said in
an interview at the weekend that the region had considerable
tourism potential, which is still to be exploited.
</P>
<P>
"Each country has been trying to promote itself. We are now
looking at selling the region as this will help promote tourism
growth in all countries," said Nyaruwata.
</P>
<P>
SADC ministers responsible for tourism signed the regional
tourism organization charter whose objective is to sell the
region as a tourist haven during this month's Blantyre SADC
summit.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to result in an increase in tourism and
the creation of thousands of jobs in member countries, Nyaruwata
said.
</P>
<P>
Nyaruwata said other regions were developing their industries
at a fast rate and SADC countries would be in a better position
to compete if they were united.
</P>
<P>
"We need to improve the quality of service so that it becomes
uniform in all countries. The tourists should be happy with the
services they get in all SADC countries if we are to maintain the
good name we are trying to build," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the region's tourism, Zimbabwe will next
month host a SADC investment forum on tourism.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police to Crack Down on Armed Bandits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
mounted a major security operation in Northeastern Province to
track armed bandits who killed more than 20 local people in the
past week, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted police spokesman Peter Kimanthi as saying
that "we have responded swiftly and are combing the region in
search of these killers."
</P>
<P>
An extensive security operation is under way in areas
surrounding Tog-shabele, said Kamanthi, adding that Kenya Army
personnel are using military aircraft to search for the killers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that reinforcements had been sent to the aid
of the scattered security personnel in the province to beef up
the team in their tough battle against the well-organized
bandits.
</P>
<P>
In two bloody days last week, 12 people including nine
Administration Police officers were gunned down by the ruthless
bandits when the officers were pursuing them together with their
25 colleagues.
</P>
<P>
A wave of panic sweeping through the Garissa town, capital of
the province, following the rampant killings during the past
week, and local leaders and residents expressed anger and
concerns over the increasing state of insecurity.
</P>
<P>
David Mutemi, Wajir District Commissioner of Northeastern
Province, urged Kenyan Somalis to help the government curb the
infiltration of sophisticated weapons from Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the recurrence of armed attacks by daring
marauders from the neighboring country posed a major concern to
the government.
</P>
<P>
Mutemi is expected to hand over to residents today some 377
goats stolen by a heavily armed gang and recovered by security
forces last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military to Reconsider Ties with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish military is
considering whether to exclude Russia from competition in
Turkey's defense projects due to the latter's obstinate position
on missile transfer to Cyprus, local newspaper Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Turkey plans to spend at least 150 billion U.S. dollars in the
next 25 years on modernization programs, which is of interest to
Russia, the paper quoted senior military sources, who declined to
be named, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military is seeking international industrial companies
to bid for these defense projects, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly criticized the Russian-Cypriot missile
deal, saying that the offensive weapons would constitute a
serious threat to Turkey's state security.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which has lost much of the arms markets in eastern
Europe and other regions, insisted on the sale of 150
anti-aircraft S-300 missiles to Cyprus according to a deal signed
by the two countries last January.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military vowed to destroy the missiles by force if
they are finally deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian state-controlled company Rosvoorouzhenie,
producer of the S-300 missiles, said that Cyprus, as a sovereign
state, has the right to buy weapons which they need, adding it
had no intention to drop the deal.
</P>
<P>
Russia is reportedly eager to participate in Turkey's 4.5
billion dollar project to produce the third generation tanks and
another 3.5 billion dollar project to produce 145 assault
helicopters as well.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot South and
Turkish Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkish troops seized the
northern third of the island following a failed coup seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Turkey, which has
deployed 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Zambia's Non-traditional Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Demand for Zambia's
non-traditional exports has outstripped supply and it is likely
that the country might not be able to meet all the orders, Zambia
Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) has decided to go flat out
from next year to rural areas to sensitize people on the vast
opportunities for the non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
As demand for the non-traditional exports increases, some
areas in the country are reportedly having a hard time in selling
their produce when in fact they could easily be exported to
European markets, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
During the recent visit to Mbala in northern Zambia, EBZ
acting chief executive Johnson Mwenya found stocks of uncollected
soya beans lying dormant as the owners could not market their
produce.
</P>
<P>
He said the EBZ will work with the Ministry of Agriculture,
Good and Fisheries to take stock of the potential export
products.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, which is expected to take part in the South African
Trade Exposition next month has already participated in over 10
international trade fairs all of which have earned it trade
orders worth millions of Kwacha, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
But these orders are usually not fulfilled as demand outstrips
supply, said Mwenya.
</P>
<P>
Promoting the non-traditional exports, which earned Zambia 310
million U.S. Dollars last year, is part of the government efforts
to diversify the economy.

<HEADLINE> Bearing Giants Bolster Business in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Two world bearing giants, SKF
Group and Timken Co, are intensifying their activities to fortify
their presence in the Chinese market, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The Sweden-based SKF Group, one of the world's leading
rolling-bearing firms, said it had bought a 20 percent stake in
Wafangdian Bearing Ltd for 250 million yuan (30 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is negotiating with China's largest bearing producer on
another project.
</P>
<P>
SKF has invested 650 million yuan (78 million dollars) in four
joint ventures in China. Their products are used in a variety of
ways, including in textile machine tools, automobiles and
locomotives as well as bearing seals.
</P>
<P>
SKF recently established a holding company in Beijing which
oversees and coordinates operations of its joint ventures and
sales outlets in China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the US-based Timken Co. is going to publish its
Chinese version of the Timken Tapered Roller Bearing Guide.
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed "the Bible" of the industry in the West, the book
provides complete data for 26,000 specifications in 230 kinds of
tapered roller bearings. The Chinese versions will be available in
November this year.
</P>
<P>
The step coincided with the company's rapid business growth in
China in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The Timken Co strengthened its presence in China by setting up
a joint venture with Yantai Bearing Plant in Shandong Province in
last June.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Rival Warlords Join Hands Against Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ethnic Uzbek
warlord Abdul Malik and his former boss Rashid Dostum, whom he
ousted four months ago, have agreed to join hands in fighting
against the Islamic Taliban militia, Afghan sources here said
today.
</P>
<P>
Dostum, who returned to Afghanistan in early September after
three months of exile in Turkey, Sunday rushed to Shiberghan,
capital of Afghanistan's northwestern Jowzjan province, and held a
crucial meeting with Malik, the Afghan sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two strongman held lengthy discussions on the prevailing
situation around Mazar-e-Sharif, capital of the next-door Balkh
province and stronghold of Malik and his northern anti-Taliban
alliance, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Dostum and Malik agreed to take joint action
against the Taliban who had been posting serious threats to
Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 kilometers northwest of Kabul, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Dostum and Malik's meeting took place as the Taliban fighters
were poised to launch an all-out attack on Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The militia have claimed they had tightened their stranglehold
of the city after the fresh offensives in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Dostum, once the strongest warlord in Afghanistan, was forced
to flee the country late May when his right hand-man Malik staged
a sudden revolt against him.
</P>
<P>
Malik briefly sided with the Taliban, allowing them to enter
northern Afghanistan unopposed. However, a few days later, in a
row over power sharing, Malik staged another about-face and drove
the hard-line student militia out again.
</P>
<P>
Later, he formed a new anti-Taliban alliance with Afghanistan's
former military chief Ahmad Masood and the Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat.
The alliance has announced Mazar-e-Sharif as their temporary
capital.
</P>
<P>
However, Malik has failed to win over pro-Dostum elements and
infighting among his forces has put him on the defensive when the
Taliban launched a strong attack on Mazar-e-Sharif earlier this
month.

a notebook filled with quotations from the "Selected Works of Deng
Xiaoping", as well as a pile of newspaper clippings on Deng
Xiaoping theory.

</P>
<P>
Today, however, the villagers live in new brick homes equipped

commodes. Many others have purchased commercial housing in
Shanghai proper, according to Yang, who believes that Deng
Xiaoping theory has brought changes to her hometown and to her own
life.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, Yang has received praise from the
school and various departments for the many research papers and
survey reports she has authored on the basis of Deng Xiaoping
theory.
</P>
<P>
Yang is one of many young people in over 40 colleges and
universities in Shanghai who hold high respect for Deng and are
extremely interested in studying his theory.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Loans for Housing Up in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's four building
societies have advanced a record 2.5 billion Zimbabwean Dollars
in new housing mortgages during the last 12 months as demand for
housing countrywide continues to outstrip supply.
</P>
<P>
This was reported today by the daily paper the Herald which
added that currently, one U.S Dollar equals to 12 Zimbabwean
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The largest building society, the Central Africa Building
Society, made a record 880 million Zimbabwean Dollars lending in
its history to housing schemes, while Beverley Building Society,
Founders Building Society and the Zimbabwe Building Society have
also made huge commitments to the housing cause.
</P>
<P>
Results of a recent survey by property consultants, Knight
Frank, show that despite the high cost of borrowing with the
lowest rate currently quoted by building societies at 17.25
percent, demand has been high for low-density houses,
particularly in the low to middle sections of the market.
</P>
<P>
This has in turn pushed up the prices of the houses in the low
to middle sections, with the cheapest low-density houses in
Harare priced at around 600,000 Zimbabwean Dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey in Harare by Knight Frank, the
low-density residential sales market was very buoyant over the
last 12 months, leading to significant increases in values.

Project Hope, initiated by the China Youth Development
Foundation in 1989 to assist those children forced to drop out of
schooling by poverty, has so far collected a total of 978 million
yuan (117.83 million US dollars) in donations from China and
abroad. Funds have been used to pay for the education of 1.54
million individuals "adopted" by donors who pledge to mail cash on
a regular basis for childrens' tuition via post
offices. Meanwhile, general funds have been used to build 3,600
primary schools in poor villages.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shengli, one of the first beneficiaries of the Project
Hope, graduated from Shanghai No.1 Normal School last year and
returned to his hometown in north China's Hebei province to teach
in a primary school. "I'll extend my knowledge gained with the
help of social charity to more kids in remote and impoverished
areas," he says.
</P>
<P>
But while special attention is given to boys and girls in
poverty-stricken areas, education of migrants' children has also
come on the agenda. These children have moved with their parents
from the interior areas to urban cities, coastal areas and other
cities on the wave of pursuing opportunities. Estimates suggest
that two to three million of them have reached school age, but
most are barred from attending local schools because they do not
possess the necessary citizenship, let alone the financial ability
to pay.
</P>
<P>
To prevent migrant children joining the ranks of the
illiterate, SEC has called for all the localities concerned to do
their best to provide school education for them. Pilot schemes are
now operative in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hebei, Zhejiang and
Shenzhen to put these children in school, who have the theoretical
right, if not the practical wherewithal, to receive a
nine-year-long compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
For with education, and only education, will millions more like
Zhou Haimei be able to take the opportunity to develop themselves
and have a better future.

<HEADLINE> New Round of Agriculture Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- It has long been a tradition
for Chinese farmers to raise chickens in their backyards, but a
group of farmers in Guangxi, southwest China financed a chicken
farm a year ago, paving the way for large-scale chicken production,
processing and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Termed as the latest step towards industrialized farming, one
of the new round of China's agriculture reform, the new
company--Guangdong Wen Poultry Co. Ltd., provides farmers with
complete services and then purchases all mature chickens at
protected prices.
</P>
<P>
The practice has established a large specialized group composed
of chicken breeders which are joining hands to face both regional
and national market competitions.
</P>
<P>
The Yulin, Guangxi-based chicken farm is not alone in such
initiatives. A Ministry of Agriculture official in charge of rural
reform and experimental areas noted tens of thousands of rural
enterprises like Guangdong Wen have emerged in China's rural
areas, especially in more developed rural areas over the recent
few years.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions of the socialist market economy have enabled an
increasing number of rural areas to implement industrialized
farming," according to the official.

<HEADLINE> New Round of Agriculture Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Observers point to the fact that China has introduced new forms
of businesses in industrialized farming and reformed production
systems in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The new production and management methods, which integrate
production and marketing, can be applied to intensive operations
from the standpoint of funding and providing qualified personnel
and technology. The innovative methods have enabled tens of
thousands of farmers to open up the market.
</P>
<P>
China successfully carried out its first round of rural reform
the early 1980s by abolishing the people's communes and
introducing the household contract responsibility system with
remuneration linked to output.
</P>
<P>
The change ushered in a rapid growth period in China's
agriculture production, and created a miracle in worldwide
agricultural history.
</P>
<P>
China's annual grain output has steadily grown from 304.75
billion kg to last year's harvest of 490 billion kg. Such
achievement has been accompanied by marked increases in the output
of cotton, oil crops, meat and aquatics products.
</P>
<P>
Rapid industrial expansion China's vast rural areas have
witnessed in recent years has widely been heralded as the "second
round of agriculture reform".
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, people have also found that the reform alone will
not "thoroughly and effectively" solve some deep-rooted problems
restricting rural development.
</P>
<P>
Related problems include a comparatively low degree of
intensive farming and low operational efficiency, as well as
increasingly profound contradictions between low production and
large markets, and difficulties in both marketing and purchasing
farm produce.

<P>
The current move in industrialized farming, which agronomists
refer to as the "third round of agriculture reform", has combined
the strong points of the previous reforms in rural areas, and is
expected to yield new breakthroughs in agriculture development
through industrialized ways.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Wen Poultry, for example, has established fodder
production facilities, marketing and service departments, and
hatcheries to integrate production, supply, marketing, scientific
research, industry and trade. Some 230 households join in a
cooperative in raising chickens for the company.
</P>
<P>
By now, the company has provided local farmers with more than
800,000 hatchlings and sold more than 400,000 packaged chickens
over the past year. Farmers have earned 450,000 yuan in total,
with Guangdong Wen earning 580,000 in profits.
</P>
<P>
Yulin, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is one of China's many
rural experimental areas. Local officials noted that 50 of the
city's rural breeding enterprises are generating an annual output
value of one million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises are currently introducing intensive farming
to approximately 10 percent of the city's total land, and some 500
enterprises are developing an average 6.6 ha. each, a local
official said.

Many provinces, including Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang,
Jiangsu and Guangdong, are also extending the effort to foster
various forms of ownership for rural enterprises in accordance
with local conditions. Related efforts have promoted the
integration of trade, industry and agriculture, as well as the
unified operations of production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Province, a forerunner in introducing industrialized
farming, is currently home to some 18,000 rural enterprises
which generated 1996 earnings of over 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Central China's Henan Province, yet another of the country's
major agricultural areas, is home to over 15,000 enterprises
directly engaged in production related to farming, forestry,
animal husbandry and fisheries, as well as in processing and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural enterprises in the central Chinese province have
helped more than four million farmers, or 23 percent of the total,
enter the market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, agricultural enterprises featuring both high input
and high efficiency have attracted many farmers willing to invest
in enterprises and carry out highly industrialized farming.
</P>
<P>
He Dong, a farmer in Zhongshan City, south China's Guangdong
Province, has contracted some 20 hectares of paddy fields to grow
rice. Mechanized farming and harvesting equipment have enabled He
to earn more than 400,000 yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
"To till farmland on a relatively large scale, the more you
plant, and the more you'll harvest," local farmers said.

BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- When she left school at the
age of 14 to work as a domestic in Beijing, Zhou Haimei, a girl
from rural Hubei, central China, could hardly imagine that six
years later she would be employed as an accountant by a private
company in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
"I'll have more opportunities in Beijing if I know how to
operate computers." says the girl who has used much of her
hard-earned monthly income to fund her own night school education.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was able, but also lucky. She had received seven years'
schooling during which she acquired the ability to learn by
herself before dropping out from school because of poverty. A lot
more are not so lucky as Zhou is.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the State Education Commission (SEC)
show that in China today, a total of four to five million children
aged 7-11, mostly from remote and rural impoverished areas and
two-thirds of them girls, are prevented from going to school
mainly because of poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Nine-year compulsory education must be made top priority in
order to eradicate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people,"
urged Chinese vice-premier Li Lanqing in an article in 1996 to
mark the 10th anniversary of the issuance of the "Law on
Compulsory Education."
</P>
<P>
Increasing its funding by some 20 percent annually, China has
spent a total of 602.5 billion yuan (72.59 billion US dollars) on
education over the past five years (1992-1996). In 1996 alone, a
total of 214.4 billion yuan (25.83 billion US dollars) was spent
on education, 99.4 billion yuan (11.97 billion US dollars) of
which came from the government budget.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, 98.81 percent of school-aged children had actually
enrolled in primary schools, up one percent on the 1990
figure.

<HEADLINE> Wu Yi Outlines Principles for Asia-Europe Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Trade and
Cooperation Minister Wu Yi today outlined China's position and
principles for Asia-Europe cooperation in trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Wu unveiled the guidelines at the two-day session of the
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) which closed today in the city of
Chiba, near Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Wu said there are wide differences among ASEM members in the
level of economic development, trade and investment regime, social
system and cultural tradition and therefore cooperation between
these countries should be on the basis of mutual respect,
recognition of the existing differences.
</P>
<P>
It would be unrealistic to stress too much on unified action,
Wu noted, adding that cooperation should be guided by the
following three principles.
</P>
<P>
-- Equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Interests of members in different development stages should be
taken into consideration and the principle of equitable and
balanced interest should be reflected in real action.
</P>
<P>
-- Non-discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Any preferential trade and investment policy currently enjoyed
by ASEM members should be extended to any country, whether it is
or is not an ASEM member. Existing discriminatory trade practice
and investment barriers should be abolished as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
-- Slow but steady progress.
</P>
<P>
"Wu suggests cooperating in trade and investment facilitation
first because here little disagreement is involved. This should
be followed by efforts to remove barriers and obstacles aimed at
promoting trade and capital flow.
</P>
<P>
To further explore the potential of cooperation, every channel
of cooperation available should be fully utilized," she said.
</P>
<P>
Though there is quite a lot trade and investment flow between
the two regions, the normal trade order is being undermined by
man-made discriminatory trade barriers in some countries, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that regular consultations on trade barriers should be
held among ASEM members and other view-exchanging means should be
explored in preparation for the ultimate elimination of these
trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
Economic ministers from 25 countries attended the meeting, the
first of its kind since the ASEM was launched last year.

<HEADLINE> Australia Rejects EU Proposed Plan on Greenhouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia today released a
paper rejecting a proposal by the European Union (EU) for a 15
percent reduction by developed countries in greenhouse gas
emission from 1990 to 2010.
</P>
<P>
Australia would not contribute more than other countries to
resolve the greenhouse gas emission crisis, Australian Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer said here today.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Foreign Affairs and Trade Department today released
the paper in which Australia argued its case against binding gas
emission targets ahead of the December climate conference in
Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The paper reaffirmed Australia's rejection of the greenhouse
gas reduction plan proposed by the EU.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly we have made it clear that type of proposition (made
by the EU) is unacceptable," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to make a fair contribution and that is what
the paper we're releasing today illustrates," the foreign minister
told Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio.
</P>
<P>
The paper, apparently part of the publicity campaign by the
Australian government to lobby support for its position on the
greenhouse gas issue, said Australia could lose offshore up to
8.64 billion U.S. dollars from 48.96 billion dollars' worth of
planned energy projects if it agreed to uniform international
greenhouse gas emission targets.
</P>
<P>
It said nearly 90,000 jobs, to be created by energy-related
projects, would be at risk. Unemployment has been a chronic
problem for Australia, where the annual average jobless rate has
been about 8 percent for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard has failed to win support
from his counterparts in the United States and Japan on the
greenhouse gas reduction issue during their talks over the past
several months.
</P>
<P>
Downer denied Australia was isolated in its stance.

<P>
KATHMANDU, September 29 (Xinhua) -- New archaeological objects
concerning Lord Gautam Buddha have been found in Tilaurakot and
Ramagram near Lumbini in southern Nepal, the birthplace of Lord
Buddha, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
These objects include stone inscriptions, copper plates and
ruins of vihars (buildings) built during the period.
</P>
<P>
They were excavated by applying archaeological geophysics by
Nepal's Department of Archaeology, the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World
Heritage Nepal, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The archaeological objects were detected without excavating
them by earth resistance meter and magnetometer with the help of a
computer.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the UNESCO and the World Heritage Center
were here for investigation as the government of Nepal has applied
for enlisting Ramagram and Kapilvastu under the World Heritage
list, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> 5,000-Year-Old Human Grave Found in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A human grave site believed
to be 5,000 years old has been found in southern Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Srian Deraniyagala, director of the Archaeology Department,
said today that the discovery was made about a month ago at a
mining lagoon in Kataragama district in the south of Uva Province.
</P>
<P>
The department was informed about the discovery by villagers in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Initial excavation has revealed that human skeletons and heaps
of shells were buried in the grave.
</P>
<P>
The exact period the site may have belonged to has yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
Experts will begin main excavation this week. It is estimated
the whole excavation would last for two to three months.
</P>
<P>
Deraniyagala said it was likely that there was a link between
the stone age and the pre-historic period.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any presence of metal or ceramic we will be able
to date the skeletons," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the skeletons may apply to Sri Lanka's pre-historic
men.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka would seek foreign expertise to carry out a joint
analysis of the skeletons, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Thai armed forces are
planning an operation to help ease the smoke haze brought by wind
to southern Thailand from Indonesia, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The operation will include making artificial rains and firing
rockets containing chemicals to eliminate the toxicity of the
smog.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Supreme Commander Gen. Mongkol
Ampronpisit has ordered the related military units to coordinate
with the Meteorological Department and the Public Health Ministry
in the operation.
</P>
<P>
The Thai navy will send its aircraft carrier HMS
Chakrinaruebet, which was purchased recently from Spain, to the
south to serve as a center for the operation.
</P>
<P>
The smoke haze produced in recent forest fires in Indonesia
began to affect eight provinces in southern Thailand last week,
with Trang province hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
The Trang airport remained closed over the weekend although
heavy rains helped reduce the haze in the south.

<HEADLINE> China Continues To Open in Post-Deng Era (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- For China, 1997 will go down
in history as a year of great sorrow and jubilation. Deng
Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's opening policy and
reforms, died in February and on July 1, Hong Kong was returned to
China, ending a national humiliation of more than 150 years.
</P>
<P>
Deng advanced the opening policy back in the late 1970s. This
policy, hand-in-hand with economic reforms, has brought China
unprecedented prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The opening policy will continue after Deng's death. Speaking
at Deng's memorial meeting on February 25, President Jiang Zemin
pledged to follow Deng's teachings and "develop an all-directional
and multi-layer pattern of opening up ... and actively participate
in international economic technological cooperation and
competition."
</P>
<P>
China has benefited enormously from the opening policy over the
past 18 years. By 1996 the country's gross national product has
registered a 5.4-fold increase over 1978 when the opening policy
was initiated. For the 1.2 billion Chinese, the policy means not
only sufficient food and clothing but also consumer goods of a
much greater variety and better quality. They may have access to
things they never dreamed of owning in the past, ranging from
color TVs and telephones to air-conditioners and even private cars.
</P>
<P>
The opening policy first gave birth to four special economic
zones along the Chinese coast: Shenzhen bordering Hong Kong,
Zhuhai near Macao, Shantou in southeastern Guangdong and Xiamen
facing Taiwan. In 1984, 14 more coastal cities were opened to
foreign investment. In 1988, the 33,900-square-kilometer Hainan,
China's second largest island, was made the largest special
economic zone.
</P>
<P>
The second round of opening began in 1992, prompted by Deng's
inspection tour of Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone,
during which he called for accelerated pace of the country's
economic development. Following this historic tour, the Yangtze
River Valley was opened. Pudong New Area of Shanghai, an area as
large as Singapore, is expected to develop into an international
financial center and a high-tech development area. And Suzhou
Industrial Park near Shanghai was also established by the Chinese
and Singaporean governments.
</P>
<P>
All China's interior provincial capitals, except Lhasa of the
Tibet Autonomous Region, were open in 1992. Border regions were
also opened as 14 economic cooperation zones have been set up in
areas bordering countries including the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, Russia, Myanmar and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China had approved 285,000 foreign-funded
enterprises, almost half of which had gone into operation. The
aggregate direct foreign investment has increased to 175 billion
US dollars, making China the second biggest recipient of
international investment in the world after the United States.
</P>
<P>
With its total imports and exports amounting to 290 billion US
dollars, China ranked 11th among the world's top trading nations
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves have kept growing along with
the development of foreign trade, to 117.8 billion US dollars by
the end of May, 1997.

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Open in Post-Deng Era (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's opening policy has persisted with and without Deng at
the helm. Jiang Zemin noted that "opening to the outside world is
an essential condition for China to achieve its socialist
modernization," when addressing at Deng's memorial meeting. He
quoted Deng as saying that "the current world is an open one, that
China's development is inseparable from the world, and that it is
imperative to pursue the policy of opening to the outside world on
the basis of persisting in self-reliance."
</P>
<P>
Not only geographically, but also in the sense that practically
all the economic sectors, China opens its banking, information and
other service industries to foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
China's policy makers are planning to "remake" the special
economic zones, which have pioneered the implementation of the
opening policy. The most significant policy change is the on-going
process of shifting to national treatment for foreign investors in
China from the practice of giving tax privileges and other
preferential treatment offered to foreign investors as in the
first few years after the opening policy was introduced.
</P>
<P>
This will compel the special economic zones to depend more and
more on their own economic strength and initiatives for
development, rather than on policy privileges given them by the
state which were deemed as necessary in the first few years of
their operation.
</P>
<P>
Beginning April 1996, foreign-funded enterprises could no
longer enjoy exemption of custom duties for their imported
manufacturing equipment. Meanwhile, China has reduced its tariff
rates to an average of 15 percent from 35.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
This will make foreign-funded enterprises compete with Chinese
enterprises on a more equal footing. China will gradually allow
foreign companies to play a greater role in fields where they used
to be more or less restricted such as mining, banking, retail
sales and insurance, said Lin Qihui, an official at the State
Council Office in charge of Special Economic Zones.
</P>
<P>
Now that Hong Kong has returned, Lin told that China's
relations with the rest of the world "will definitely become
closer."
</P>
<P>
In striving for development, he said that the country will take
the best advantage of Hong Kong's status as a world financial,
shipping, information and trade center.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed Up Yangtze River Harnessing (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a matter of fact, conservation work started as early as the
1950s, but it went very slowly. In 1989, the country adopted a Key
Harnessing Plan for Soil Erosion on the Upper Reaches of the
Yangtze, which accelerates the harnessing speed.
</P>
<P>
Since then, 46,000 sq.km. of eroded areas have been brought
under control, and 1.23 million ha of trees had been planted on
the upper reaches by the end of 1996, raising the afforestation
rate to 41.1 percent, from the 22.8 percent at the end of the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Li Bin, the Ministry of Forestry official, says that if the
Yangtze valley is brought under control at the current rate of
12,000 sq.km. per year, it would take six decades. But, noticing
the frequency and the destruction of natural disasters, some
ministries proposed several times that the harnessing plan be
completed earlier.
</P>
<P>
One source reports that the communications and construction
ministries and the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA)
will soon adopt a joint regulation to control pollution caused by
garbage from boats, untreated solid waste, bringing the water
quality up to a decent level. And a protection plan covering the
Yangtze as a whole will also come out in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Little Swan Merges With Electric Motor Supplier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Wuxi-based Little Swan
Co. Ltd, one of China's major washing machine producers, has
successfully merged with one of its leading suppliers of electric
motors.
</P>
<P>
The Sanjiang Electronic Appliance Manufacturing Plant, located
in northeast Jiangsu Province, has total net assets valued at 22.4
million yuan. The plant, a well-known township enterprise in
Jingjiang, is one of China's major exporters of electric motors.
</P>
<P>
Little Swan, which purchased 51 percent of Sanjiang for 50
million yuan, has transformed the new venture into a limited
liability company.
</P>
<P>
The new company will expand its current annual production
capacity of five million electric motors and will increases its
annual sales volume to some 300 million yuan, according to a
spokesman for Little Swan.
</P>
<P>
Local observers point to the fact that the merger benefits both
parties, with Sanjiang Company gaining access to greater funding
and Little Swan gaining the former's marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
The Little Swan had earlier planned to invest 100 million yuan
to establish a plant with an annual production capacity of two
million electric motors.
</P>
<P>
Little Swan has also merged with two washing machine plants,
one each in Hubei and Liaoning provinces.
</P>
<P>
Little Swan's 1997 net profits are expected to hit 210 million
yuan.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Rice Exports to Fall Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's total volume of
rice exports this year will fall short of forecasts, according to
Thai Foreign Trade Department Director-General Pracha
Charutrakulchai.
</P>
<P>
Rice export in 1997 was earlier set at 5.35 million tons, but
is now expected to be 4.8-4.9 million tons, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, exports of jasmine rice increased
significantly and its price soared because of a high demand in
East Asia markets.
</P>
<P>
However, during the past few months exports of jasmine rice
decreased as adulteration with low-quality rice caused the
cancellation of many orders.
</P>
<P>
Rice export value for this year is expected to reach the target
of 47 billion baht (1.29 billion U.S. dollars), because high-grade
rice, including jasmine rice, is still receiving favorable prices
overseas, the Bangkok Post today quoted Pracha as saying.

BELGRADE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia says its foreign
trade has grown rapidly since the United Nations Security Council
lifted sanctions against the country in October last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data released by the Yugoslav Statistic
Bureau, Yugoslavia's exports totaled 1.454 billion U.S. dollars in
the first eight months this year, an increase of 27.6 percent over
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Its imports during this period amounted to 2.916 billion
dollars, up 20.2 percent over the corresponding period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The overall trade embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council
in May 1992 had crippled the Yugoslav economy before its
suspension about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's major exports include nonferrous metals, steel
products, pig iron, tobacco, vegetables and fruits while its major
imports include oil and other raw industrial materials.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Benefit from Medi-Care System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Du Yuxia, a 30-year-old
farmer, was relieved to learn that the cooperative medical care
program would pay one third of her 1,200 yuan medical bill, when
she was hospitalized for ectopic pregnancy in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Du's village, each person, young or old, pays 11 yuan (1.3
US dollars) a year to sign up to the cooperative program. It's like
saving for a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
"The system is an effective way by which farmers help each
other to reduce the financial risk of illness," said Zheng
Chaoyang, an official with the Medical Policy Department of the
Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said individuals contribute the bulk of funds to the
cooperative system, while village committees input small amounts
from their collective funds and township enterprises. Governments
at higher levels also provide a little funding.
</P>
<P>
China's rural residents, unlike the majority of their urban
counterparts who continue to enjoy medical insurance provided by
their work units, are often faced with unexpected medical fees.
</P>
<P>
In poor countryside areas, the term "going to hospital' soon
become a metaphor for hard times. Statistics from the Ministry of
Health indicate that 30 percent of those living below the
poverty line become impoverished as a result of crippling medical
bills.
</P>
<P>
"To date the cooperative system has proved to be the most
effective way of providing a financial helping hand to people
whose health fails them," said Zhang. But he stressed that
participation is only voluntary.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Benefit from Medi-Care System (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overseeing the setting up of cooperative medical care system is
a major task in the Chinese government's commitment to achieve the
World Health Organization's (WHO) "Health for All" standards,
which must be gained by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health issued basic guidelines for health care
in rural areas in 1990 to improve provision and set minimum
standards.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines call for sufficient government financial input,
health care education, the establishment of medical care clinics
in villages, the use of clean water, provision of cleaner
lavatories and the spread of cooperative medical care systems.
</P>
<P>
Main target components of actual health care include achieving
a reduction in the mortality rate of new-born babies, improving
ante- and post-natal care, and scoring higher immunization rates
to protect children from childhood diseases.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines require administrators to recruit 50 to 60
percent of a county's populace to the cooperative medical care
system.
</P>
<P>
Although it is feasible for the more than 2,000 counties in
China to set up medical care systems by 2000, Zhang predicted
that not all villages can meet the target.
</P>
<P>
But he thought that more than half of the country's villages
will realize this goal by 2000. Currently, 17 percent of villages
have cooperative systems.
</P>
<P>
But to farmers like Du Yuxia who have benefited from the
program, participation is undoubtedly a good choice. "It's a very
reasonable system. We deposit, and age makes it certain that one
day we'll have to benefit from it," she said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans
to speed up water and soil conservation and ecological
improvements along the Yangtze river, the country's longest.
</P>
<P>
According to a new plan by the Ministry of Water Resources for
the period 1997 to 2010, by that time 218,000 sq.km. of the
Yangtze's total area will be under control, bringing ecological
deterioration under control. An area of 562,000 sq.km. of the
river is now hit by soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to speed up improving the river over the next
two decades," said an official with the ministry's Water
Conservancy Department, who says it will adopt such measures as
reclaiming farmland on mountainsides, small-scale water control
facilities, and more protective farming instead of destroying
soil quality.

Only when the amount of forested area is above 60 percent on
the upper and middle reaches of the river will a sound ecological
preservation system be formed, according to Li Bin, who is in
charge of the Ministry of Forestry's Yangtze Shelter-Forest
project.
</P>
<P>
So, the ministry will plant 14 million hectares of trees
along the river over the next 30 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than seven billion yuan (840 million
US dollars) will be needed for the huge project of the two
ministries for the 1997-2010 period alone.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Quake Toll Rises to 17 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people were
killed and 331 others injured in the tectonic earthquake measuring
6.4 on the Richter scale which jolted Indonesia's south Sulawesi
province Sunday, Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports put the casualties at 12 dead and dozens
injured.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which started at 9:38 a.m. local time and lasted for
several minutes, hit a number of districts such as Pinrang,
Pare-Pare, Sidrap and Polewali as well as Ujungpandang, capital of
the province.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the quake is located at 3.85 degrees of the
south latitude and 119.65 degrees of the east longitude at a depth
of 300 kilometers, some 54 kilometers southeast of Polewali
district, an official of the local meteorological and geophysics
office was quoted as saying Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Together with armed forces personnel, evacuation teams were
sent to the affected areas to evacuate the quake victims to the
nearest hospitals.
</P>
<P>
About 331 victims who suffered from injuries were taken to
hospitals or public health centers, reports said.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the number of houses destroyed by the
earthquake was 415 houses, 10 worship houses and 10 cars.
</P>
<P>
The quake also reportedly hit Pinang and Majene districts
measuring four on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
After the first tremor at 9:38 a.m., at least six aftershocks
had been recorded up to 16:37 p.m. with a varied intensity
measuring from six to 2.4 on the Richter scale, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate estimate on the total loss incurred by
the quake.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed Up Yangtze River Harnessing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These steps are imperative to ensure the proper functioning of
the gigantic Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest hydro-electric
power program, mainly for sand reduction in the Yangtze. The Three
Gorges project will be completed by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
And, just by 2030 or so, the long-term plan is expected to tame
the Yangtze and completely stop the disasters thanks to the effort.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, guaranteeing the safety of the
economically-viable plateau on the middle and lower reaches needs
to be considered, and central and western areas developed, arable
land saved, and the ecology of the Yangtze improved.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze is 6,300 kilometers long, and its valley covers
nearly a fifth of China's territory. It is a key agricultural and
industrial area.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, however, the area has suffered from severe
water loss and soil erosion. This is especially true on the
352,000 sq.km. of the upper reaches, which includes two
tributaries, the Jinsha and Jialing, where much of the land has
been affected by soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Floods, droughts, mud and rocks have caused repeated problems
and the scope of these disasters is widening. The Chinese continue
to worry about whether the Yangtze will become a second Yellow
river, meaning serious concern in mounting silt.

<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- With 964 votes, Li Zhenming,
a 42-year-old farmer, has beaten his rival Xu Jianli and won the
election of chairman of Dongxia Village Committee in east China's
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jianli, 33, regretted that he lost the election with only
261 voting for him. "Nevertheless the election reflected the
villagers' will," he says, adding that he will campaign again next
time, when he will try to win.
</P>
<P>
Direct elections for leading members of village committees have
been held every three years in rural China since 1987.
</P>
<P>
"Direct and democratic elections are a key political reform in
China's rural areas, putting an end to the practice of village
officials being appointed by township governments," says Wang
Zhenyao, a senior official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The village constitutes the lowest administrative level in
China. Sometimes one village can be composed of a cluster of
natural sub-villages. An average village has a population of
1,000. A big one can have several thousand people.
</P>
<P>
Up above villages in China's pyramidic power structure are
townships, counties, cities or prefectures, provinces and the
central government.
</P>
<P>
As 80 percent of China's 1.2 billion people are rural dwellers,
villages are the most intimate communities for the most of the
Chinese to live in.
</P>
<P>
In feudal China, the village was ruled by the richest or the
patriarch of the biggest clan in the community. Ordinary villagers
had no say whatsoever except to turn over land rent and serve
corvee.
</P>
<P>
After New China was founded in 1949, farmers in villages began
to have some say. Yet in some cases it did not go beyond raising
their hands for whatever the village heads had on mind.
</P>
<P>
And the village heads were often nominated, if not directly
appointed, by the administrative bodies above and "voted" in the
village leadership by villagers.

<P>
Now the practice of the majority being led by a few is gone, as
villagers are encouraged to nominate their candidates and the
candidates have to campaign for the posts in the village
leadership.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese law, with the backing of five
villagers a candidate can be nominated. Then some villager
representatives will be elected to decide on the formal
candidates.
</P>
<P>
In some places, all the eligible villagers, namely those at or
above age 18, directly pick the normal candidates by voting.
</P>
<P>
More than 15,000 village committees in Fujian Province have
been or will be re-elected this year. And across China, there are
more than 930,000 village committees, in charge of local affairs,
settling disputes, and safeguarding social security.
</P>
<P>
In Dongxia Village, where 1,463 villagers are eligible to vote
this year, 25 representatives were elected in March to decided on
formal candidates for the village head from among four nominees,
who all presented their programs to run the village. Li and Xu
passed as the finalists to confront the voting by the whole
village.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the villagers' democratic rights, privacy for
those marking their voting papers is ensured. Cai Shuhua, a
50-year-old woman in Fashi Village neighboring with Dongxia,
received ballot papers together with her husband and two children
before they went into the restricted access room in turn.
</P>
<P>
After casting their votes, the family went off to work in
village factories. "We filled in our ballots independently, and
don't know each other's choice," she says.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine to Hold talks in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy and Palestine Liberation Organization Secretary-General
Mahmoud Abbas are scheduled to hold talks here Monday in a joint
effort to revive the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
host the meeting after she meets with Levy in the morning in a
hotel here.
</P>
<P>
The talks are a new development following Albright's trip to
the Middle East three weeks ago. During that visit, she failed to
persuade Israel to change its policy of building Jewish
settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has recently stepped up blockade of the
Palestinian autonomous areas and arrests of "terrorists," which
aggravated tensions with Palestine and drew more criticism from
the outside including the United States.
</P>
<P>
The announcement Wednesday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to build another 300 Jewish homes in the West Bank town of Efrat
fueled the criticism.
</P>
<P>
Calling Netanyahu's move "regrettable" and "unhelpful,"
Albright told reporters here Thursday "I would like to see a 'time
out', and I am calling on Prime Minister Netanyahu to honor
that 'time out'."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's envoy to the Middle East Dennis
Ross has reportedly spent much of the week meeting with Israeli
and Palestinian delegations in Washington in an effort to smooth
the way for Monday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process came to a standstill in March
after Israel decided to go ahead with Jewish settlement expansion
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It slid into deeper crisis after two suicide bombings ripped
off Jerusalem markets in July and September, killing 25 people.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has stopped giving back lands to Palestine as
stipulated by the previous peace accords, demanding Palestine
crack down on terrorist infrastructure.

Fujian Province took the lead in the country with regard to
developing standardized election methods in rural areas in the
mid-1980s. By the end of November 1997 the province will witness
the completion of the sixth round of elections in its villages.
</P>
<P>
Over the years across the country, procedures have matured and
are now reasonably standard and unified, says Wang Zhenyao of the
Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Since the elections respect villagers' democratic rights and
reflect their will, farmers are enthusiastic about the democratic
exercise and value their right to play an active part.
</P>
<P>
In Fujian's Meishan Village, more than a thousand villagers
reportedly traveled back home to exercise their democratic rights
on April 12.
</P>
<P>
For the convenience of those living in remote farmsteads,
mobile ballot boxes and even postal voting have been made
available. On the whole, turnouts have been very high with around
90 percent of those eligible casting votes, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest aspect of direct rural elections in China is that
villagers have the widespread right to actually nominate
candidates," says Wang Zhongtian, a professor with the Party
School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
adding that an election without the right to nomination cannot be
taken as a truly effective and democratic election.

BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China will launch four
large-scale meteorological research and experimental projects in
the coming year as a part of its meteorological system
modernization drive, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Wen Kegang, director-general of China Meteorological
Administration (CMA), announced the projects as the Second Series
of Atmospheric Experiments on the 3,000-meter high Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, South China Sea Monsoon Research, Research into South
China's Tropical Storms, and a Study of the Air Flow
Energy-Moisture Content Change Cycle over the Huaihe, China's
third largest river.
</P>
<P>
These research projects, the largest of their kind in the
country, will be sponsored and organized by the Chinese
Government, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
Three of them will focus on climate changes, while the other
will contribute to research on meso-scale meteorological systems
-- the movement and changes of weather conditions in areas within
a radius ranging from 20 to 250 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The four experiments will be inter-related, as the research
projects to be carried out in the South China and the

<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The return of Hong Kong and
the 15th CPC Natioanl Congress have enriched celebrations of the
48th birthday for China, which has seen great political,
economic and cultural progresses since it was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Chinese all over the world are jubilant about the return of
Hong Kong to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has returned to a vigorously developing motherland,
whose continuously high growth rate of ten percent a year will
bring Hong Kong more opportunities to get further development,"
said Prof. Liu Wei of the Economic School of Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
The 15th CPC National Congress, which was held in September,
has laid down guidelines for China to enter the new century with
even greater momemtum for developement, according to delegates of
the congress.
</P>
<P>
At 48, China can be proud of what it has achieved in many
sectors. It has succeeded in feeding 1.2 billion people, or
one-fifth of the world's population, on less than seven percent of
the world's arable land.
</P>
<P>
This year China has had another bumper harvest of summer grain
-- for three years in a row -- with a total output of 118 million
tons, 3.5 percent over the previous summer.
</P>
<P>
With its GNP reaching 6,779.5 billion yuan (816.8 billion US
dollars) in 1996, which ranked 7th in the world, China is no
longer a nation to be bullied.
</P>
<P>
A fairly complete industrial system has been built over the
past 48 years. The country is the biggest steel producer in the
world today, with an annual output that exceeds 100 million tons.
Its output of steel in 28 days exceeds old China's total
production of 7.6 million tons in 58 years, from 1890 to 1948.
</P>
<P>
China is also one of the world's biggest producers of coal,
cotton cloth, building and sanitary ceramics and TV sets. Her
space industry, started 40 years ago, is capable of commerical
launch services for other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are better educated and healthier. In 1946,
the peak year of general education in old China, there were only
52 primary school pupils and three high school students among
every 1,000 Chinese. In 1996, proportions rose to 113 and 57
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to tremendous efforts to promote public health, the
infant mortality rate is now 36.4 per thousand, against 200 before
1949; the maternal fatality rate is down from 1,500 to 62 per
100,000; various infectious, endemic and parasitic diseases have
been effectively controlled; and the average life expectancy has
doubled from 35 to 70.8.

<HEADLINE> Collection Launched to Cater for VCD Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 220 VCD programs,
comprising top foreign and domestic movies and TV series, were
launched yesterday in Beijing, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The production of the programs aims to help satisfy China's
audio and video market, where demand is currently estimated at 100
million VCDs annually, said the Ministry of Radio, Film and
Television.
</P>
<P>
China's crackdown on pirated and pornographic VCDs and video
products over the past two years has been very successful, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, if not enough VCD products are supplied to meet the
booming market, the strenuous campaign against illegal VCD copies
will have to continue, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
More series of VCD programs will soon be produced jointly by
the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, the Ministry of
Culture, the State Press and Publication Administration and the
Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Most of the films and TV series in the 220 VCD programs
launched yesterday are appearing on VCDs for the first
time. China-made movies and TV series outnumber overseas movies
and TV series by a ratio of 3.2.
</P>
<P>
Feature films and TV series make up 55 percent of the programs,
while 43 cartoons have also been recorded on VCD to cater for the
needs of teenagers and children.
</P>
<P>
The programs also include performances of some traditional
operas. One of the aims of the VCD collection is to raise the
popularity of traditional culture.

U.S. dollars out of 48.96 billion U.S. dollars of planned energy
projects from any decision to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions,
according to a detailed government report to be released here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>

devastating legal submission from the Australian Law Reform
Commission on its Wik native title legislation, forbidding the
commission putting it before a parliamentary inquiry or its

unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

judicial inquiry into the travel allowances cover-up as the

trying to cover up the scandal by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>

trading partners and the powerful music industry by lifting import

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Develop Vaccine Against Computer Viruses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military plans to
develop a software that allows computers to imitate the human
immune system in fighting off computer viruses, hackers and
information warfare attacks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force and the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) plans to develop the software in two years
with around one million dollars in budget, the Defense News weekly
said in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
As the Pentagon relys on information technology to provide
future tactical advantage, defending against cyber attacks has
become a top priority.
</P>
<P>
A General Accounting Office report released in May said 559
cyber attacks were reported in 1995, with 14,000 expected to be
reported in 1999, based on the percentage of annual increases, the
weekly said.
</P>
<P>
A Defense Science Board report earlier this year advised the
Pentagon to increase spending on cyber attack protection by 3
billion dollars during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
An antivirus program modeled on the human immune system offers
several advantages over current computer protection systems, the
weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The software program would be designed to emulate the
properties of the human immune system that enables it to recognize
virtually any foreign substance anywhere in the body no matter how
the invader enters.
</P>
<P>
Software modeled on the immune system would respond instantly
and efficiently to cyber virus or attacks anywhere on a network,
eventually offering the Defense Department a distinct advantage in
fighting the thousands of annual cyber attacks on its systems.
</P>
<P>
The software will become more valuable as the Pentagon moves
toward a system of systems, which means virtually all computers,
whether on weapons system platforms or personal computers, will be
compatible and connected, noted the Defense News.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Check Inflows of Foreign Job-Seekers, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The German government is
planning measures to drastically limit the legal or illegal
employment of foreigners who come from non-European-Union states,
a German newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag,
an initiative to be put forward by German labour minister Norbert
Bluem would seek to tighten up the entry requirements for foreign
job-seekers, to gradually reduce the number of seasonal workers
and to impose a total ban on employment for asylum-seekers.
</P>
<P>
The plan would be reviewed next week by social-politics experts
of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling Christian Democratic Union
(CDU) and Christian Soical Union (CSU) parties.
</P>
<P>
The news report also quoted a German parliament member as
saying that despite an economic upswing, the German job market had
not seen any major improvement so far. Part of the reason was that
the job market was loaded by up to 250,000 foreign job-seekers
annually.
</P>
<P>
"We want to rigorously control such inflows with our measures,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Normalizing Turkey-Greece Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem said today that Greece should adopt vigorous measures
for the normalization of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press upon returning to Istanbul from the 52nd
U.N. General Assembly in New York, Cem said his meeting with Greek
counterpart Theodoros Pangalos failed to create a positive
atmosphere for talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing Greek focus on a disputed island, Cem said that
Turkey suggested the Aegean problem, including sharing of sea-bed
riches, sovereignty over the Aegean and territorial waters, be
discussed as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Cem said Turkey could not accept Greek view that the Aegean
problem can not be solved before a solution of the small island is
reached.
</P>
<P>
Imia, or Kardak called by the Turks, is an uninhabited islet
in the eastern Mediterranean Sea which brought the two traditional
rivals to the brink of war last year.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister reiterated that Turkey would be
willing to seek a solution to the thorny Aegean problem peacefully
with the Greek government.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over the sovereignty of a
number of Aegean islands in addition to the protracted issue of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been mounting in their relations because of the
possible transfer of Russian-made missiles to Cyprus, which
sparked strong criticism from Turkey and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkey accused Greece of encouraging the Cypriot government to
purchase the anti-aircraft missiles, saying it would negatively
affect the settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece support rival ethnic groups in the
Mediterranean island which has been divided since Turkey landed
troops there in the wake of a pro-Athens coup in 1974.
