REVOLUTION WRAP UP METROSTARS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Playoffs, standing ovations, youthful enthusiasm,
and speed. These are terms seldom associated with the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere and descriptions changed Saturday night as
the Revolution concluded the Major League Soccer regular season
with a dramatic 4-3 win over the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution set a team record with 45 points and advanced to
the playoffs for the first time since 1997, which probably was the
last time the Revolution received such an expression of support
from their fans. A crowd of 20,419 at Foxboro Stadium gave the team
a standing ovation in the final seconds as it protected the lead to
defeat the MetroStars for the only time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's on to Chicago. The Revolution will face the Fire in the
first round of the playoffs, with the first game in the
best-of-three series to be played in Chicago Friday night. The
teams will meet again at Foxboro Sept. 19, and if necessary, a
third and deciding match would be in Chicago Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great way to end the season, beating our biggest
rival after they kicked our butts three times this year,''
goalkeeper Jeff Causey said. ``This was a fast-paced game, one of
the fastest I've ever played in. Both teams have some fast guys,
guys like Jamar Beasley and William Sunsing buzzing around. They
create panic situations and put you on your heels a lot. Both teams
have guys who can turn a defender in a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the playoffs, Game 1, we have to be cautious. We
haven't been scoring, but we are becoming more dangerous. We had
more energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution will not likely modify their strategy, though.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley and Sunsing pressured MetroStars defenders from the
start, setting the tone for the game. Sunsing earned a penalty kick
in the sixth minute, and Imad Baba converted it. Beasley scored his
third goal of the season to give the Revolution a 3-2 lead in the
40th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars' Colombian striker, Alex Comas, scored thrice,
including the tying goal in the 47th minute. But Joe Franchino
scored his second goal of the game to prvide the difference in the
68th minute. Franchino had converted his first goal for the
Revolution in the 36th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to play hard and come out with a win,'' Beasley
said. ``The coaches were preaching the whole week, in fact the
whole season, for us to play the way we played in this game. We
supported each other and pressured the ball, and, you could see,
they made a lot of mistakes. I think we should play like this in
the playoffs _ I don't think careful is the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution set a team record with a 9-4-3 home mark, worth
30 points, and also for goals against, with 19 at home and 49
total. The 1997 and '99 Revolution allowed 53 goals in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``William and Jamar and Wolde Harris are going to be big stars
in this town,'' Revolution owner Jonathan Kraft said. ``They are
exciting and fun to watch and great athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is exciting to watch when we have the full
complement of players.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo emphasized speed and youth
this season, and players such as Beasley, Franchino, Harris,
Sunsing, and Rusty Pierce emerged. They displayed some of their
flaws in this match, but also their potential.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution tied Chicago (1-1) April 22 at Foxboro Stadium,
as Causey saved a late Ante Razov penalty kick, and they defeated
the Fire (1-0) May 20 in Chicago, on Harris's 31st-minute goal . .
. Pierce was named Revolution defender of the year and also man of
the year by the Midnight Rider supporters group . . . Jamaican
striker Wolde Harris made his 31st start of the season for the
Revolution, and has a chance to tie Mike Burns's team mark of 33
starts (including playoffs) set in 1997. ``It's good to have other
guys scoring,'' said Harris, who scored 15 goals, tying Joe-Max
Moore for second place on the Revolution single-season scoring list
behind Raul Diaz Arce (18 in 1998).

FRANCHINO COMES UP BIG IN NEW ROLE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Joe Franchino had never scored a goal with the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But, there's a first time for everything.
</P>
<P>
   And a second.
</P>
<P>
   Franchino scored twice Saturday night, both times at crucial
moments in the Revolution's regular-season finale against the New
York-New Jersey MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   Playing midfield for just the ninth game after being a defender
since turning pro, he first scored unassisted in the 34th minute to
tie the game at 2. Then, in the 68th minute, Franchino scored the
deciding goal in the Revolution's 4-3 win at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trapped the ball on my first shot and I tried to hit it low,
going right for the frame, and it went into the corner,'' said
Franchino. ``And then, on my second . . . it came to me and I was
fortunate to get it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel unbelievable,'' he said. ``I can understand how
forwards feel now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution and MetroStars came into the game having already
clinched playoff berths. With the teams not feeling so pressured,
the first half turned out to be wild, with five goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pretty soft goals, the two goals the MetroStars had
in the first half. We made a couple of mistakes on them,''
Franchino said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we gave up a goal two minutes into the second half,
something we can't be doing in the playoffs. We scored four goals
against a good team, though _ we have to look at the positives.''
</P>
<P>
   One positive was that the victory helped ensure New England
would finish in seventh place in the league, setting up a
first-round playoff matchup with the No. 2-seeded Fire, beginning
Friday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important game,'' said Franchino. ``If we win
the first game, the momentum sweeps to us, with our fans getting
behind us. If we come out like we did against the MetroStars, if we
work together, on the same page together, we're going to have a
good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's chances are enhanced by having Franchino
increasingly comfortable at his new position. ``I was
well-prepared,'' he said. ``I felt relaxed, and everything went my
way.''

TCU DEVOURS NEVADA, BUT FEELS A BIT UNSATISFIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. _ Casey Printers tried to hide his disappointment.
After all, what could there be to complain about in a 31-point
season-opening victory on the road?
</P>
<P>
   Printers, who improved his record to 9-2 as a starter Saturday
afternoon after TCU's 41-10 rout of Nevada in the Western Athletic
Conference opener for both schools, talked about the four
touchdowns the offense scored and the Horned Frogs' prolific
running attack.
</P>
<P>
   The defense rolled up a school-record 15 sacks (at least) and
held the Wolf Pack (0-2) to 11 yards rushing. LaVar Veale scored on
an 85-yard punt return, and LaTarence Dunbar did him 10 yards
better on a third-quarter kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   But Printers, and many of his teammates, left Mackay Stadium
with a lingering feeling of frustration. The 22nd-ranked Frogs
dominated the Wolf Pack in most every phase of the game, but
somehow, it didn't feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely disappointed with the way we played,'' said
Printers, a sophomore playing in his first season opener. ``We can
do a lot better than what we did, but we got a win. We're going to
put on the film (today), go back to the drawing board and hopefully
we'll be better next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Printers suffered through the one the worst games of his young
career. He completed 3-of-9 passes for 53 yards and threw an
interception in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have my best today, but we were effective running the
option,'' said Printers, who broke into the starting lineup in the
third game of the 1999 season. ``They weren't pass rushing. They
stayed at the line of scrimmage and were able to bat down balls,
and we knew we could bash them with the running game. We did what
was effective and scored 28 points (on offense).''
</P>
<P>
   LaDainian Tomlinson, the Frogs' Heisman Trophy hopeful, did his
damage in three quarters of work, rushing for 176 yards and three
touchdowns on 24 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of a 43-yard touchdown scamper to top off his day in the
third period _ and a 29-yard run in the first _ Tomlinson's total
came off as more workmanlike than spectacular. He repeatedly
punished Wolf Pack defenders with modest _ by Tomlinson standards _
six-, seven- and eight-yard gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't been hit since last year,'' Tomlinson said. ``I just
got to get used to getting hit and get back in the groove. Overall,
this first game I'm very pleased to have as many yards as I did in
three quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson outgained the Pack while he was in the game, a point
that not only emphasizes his value, but also underscores the job
TCU's defense did.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen sacks _ a total that could climb after TCU coaches
review film today _ not only shattered the record of nine, set
against Texas in 1994, but it likely set an NCAA Division I mark.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA hasn't kept defensive records officially, but it
informed the TCU media relations staff after the game that sacks
would be a recognized statistic this season. If that's the case,
Nevada quarterback David Neill found a spot in the record book.
</P>
<P>
   Though the positives outweigh the struggles, namely Printers',
in coach Dennis Franchione eyes, he admitted that the victorywas
not a cosmetic masterpiece. He did point out it was the Frogs'
first game (i.e., they needed to work out some kinks, such as four
turnovers) and they were playing against a team that did some of
that last week, although Nevada lost to Oregon, 36-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good, not pretty. Effective,'' said Franchione, of the
team's sixth consecutive victory dating back to last season.
``Stopped the run well, put a lot of pressure on the quarterback,
covered very well, too may turnovers offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably felt we could've thrown the ball more if we needed
to. I told them at the pregame meal that at some time I expected
the offensive line and defensive line to take over, and they did. I
was banking on us to be able to gnarl them up a little bit with our
offense and to be pretty effective with our defensive line and it
went that way.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the defensive stats numbers provided by Nevada
officials, Chad McCarty, Chad Bayer, Shannon Brazzell, Aaron
Schobel and Stuart Ashley each had a least two sacks for the Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our young guys stepped up,'' said Schobel, who injured his
right hip in the first half and didn't return. ``We stopped the run
when they ran. Defense looked good and special teams looked real
good.''
</P>
<P>
   But questions for the passing game remain unanswered. Franchione
said going into the season that the team's biggest question was at
receiver, and other than a 33-yard reception by Cedric James in the
first quarter and Kevin Brown's 18-yard grab, TCU receivers
couldn't find open spots in Nevada's zone.
</P>
<P>
   Printers didn't complete a pass in the second or third quarters
and after his pass to Brown five minutes into the final period, the
quarterback was pulled and backup Sean Stilley finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating because we work so hard on the passing game
every day and couldn't go out there and execute,'' Printers said.
``It's not going to come the very first game, but as a competitor
you want to go out and throw the ball well.'' nn

NO. 1 CORNHUSKERS FORCED TO WORK OVERTIME TO TOP IRISH
</HEADLINE>
 DAME-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ Once the game went from regulation to
overtime, Notre Dame's chances of winning evaporated. Punts and
kickoffs aren't needed in OT. That meant the Irish offense was
ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Nebraska, surviving what coach Frank Solich termed a
``collapse'' on special teams, held the Irish to an overtime field
goal and then scored the deciding points on Eric Crouch's 7-yard
touchdown run here Saturday. The Huskers (2-0) will have to hope
that their 27-24 victory in a sold-out Notre Dame Stadium won't
cost them in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in here as a No. 1 team and winning, I think we
accomplished something that not a lot of teams have done,'' said
Crouch, who finished with 80 yards rushing on 16 carries that
produced three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame calls its special teams ``special forces'' and they
were indeed a force against the Huskers. Nebraska's defense held
the Irish to 224 yards in total offense. The Irish had 317 kickoff
and punt return yards. The Irish recovered from a 21-7 deficit with
two lightning touchdowns _ a 100-yard kickoff return by sophomore
Julius Jones and an 83-yard punt return by 5-foot-7 Joey Getherall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were big-time plays and that gave us some energy on
defense,'' Notre Dame cornerback Brock Williams said. ``We should
have won that game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish had defeated the last two No. 1 teams to play here.
The Huskers, who ground out two long scoring drives to produce
their 14-point lead, didn't look as though they would need
overtime. But in the fourth quarter, Nebraska ran 14 plays that
produced 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska defensive tackle Jeremy Slechta sacked Arnaz Battle on
a third-and-goal from the 4 on Notre Dame's overtime possession.
The Irish settled for Nick Setta's 29-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskers converted the third-down play that Notre Dame
couldn't. On third-and-nine from the 24, Crouch found tight end
Tracey Wistrom for a 9-yard completion. Two plays later, Crouch
took an option keeper around left end for the winning TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most critical play of the game was the third-down pass,''
Notre Dame coach Bob Davie said. ``I thought they were going with a
quarterback draw or to the fullback.'' nn

TEXAS tECH PUNCHES OUT NORTH TEXAS' run of upsets 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Texas Tech safety Kevin Curtis said defeat
never flashed in front of his eyes as he trailed North Texas wide
receiver LaDarrin McLane down the right sideline toward the Red
Raiders' goal line late in the fourth quarter Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   He never considered how the Red Raiders would explain their
third embarrassing loss to UNT in four years, all at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all happened so quick, I wasn't thinking about losing,''
Curtis said of his game-saving play in Tech's hairbreadth 13-7
victory against UNT. ``I just knew I had to catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' all-conference safety did better than that. He
delivered the knockout punch to yet another spirited upset bid by
the Mean (in Lubbock) Green.
</P>
<P>
   As McLane thundered past the Tech 15-yard line toward what could
have been a game-deciding score, Curtis closed a 10-yard gap after
a secondary mixup and delivered a well-placed uppercut to the ball.
It popped loose from McLane's grasp at the 12, some 50 yards from
the original line of scrimmage after the Lewisville senior had
taken a pass from freshman quarterback Scott Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going out of bounds, the ball bounded crazily back
into the field of play.
</P>
<P>
   Tech cornerback Derrick Briggs snatched up the ball at the
2-yard-line. Briggs took off, weaving back 54 yards through an
on-rushing throng of both-colored jerseys to the Eagles' 44-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about scoring,'' Briggs said. ``But I ran out
of gas and just fell on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech took over at the UNT 44 and ran out the last 1:44, spoiling
yet another valiant upset bid by the Eagles and a superb defensive
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Curtis) made a great play,'' McLane said. ``I thought he was
behind me on my left side, but he came around (the right side) and
knocked the ball loose. We had a chance to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Outgained 318-156 and held in check offensively by Tech's third
consecutive solid defensive effort of the season, the Eagles (0-2)
were not outhustled. UNT's sure-tackling defenders held the
Raiders' offense to a long play of 19 yards, a week after the same
scheme ran up a Big 12-record 505 yards in a 38-16 victory over
Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I was pleased with our effort and determination,''
UNT coach Darrell Dickey said. ``We came into a hostile environment
and had a chance to win in the end. We sputtered and were a little
inconsistent on offense. Our defense did a great job of bending and
not breaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' defense intercepted three of Kliff Kingsbury's
passes. Middle linebacker Brad Kassell returned one of those picks
23 yards for a touchdown at 7:43 of the third quarter. And if not
for a drive-sustaining fake punt in the second quarter, Tech might
have had nothing more to show than Chris Birkholz's field goals of
50 and 47 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury completed 42 of 55 passes _ both school records _ for
238 yards and one touchdown. But it was not pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we should be capable of quite a bit more than we
did (tonight),'' said Tech coach Mike Leach, who now has firsthand
knowledge of UNT's ability to perplex the Raiders. ``We made more
of (the Eagles) than they were. Their defense did a great job all
days and ours did, too. We certainly had a big play there at the
end by Kevin Curtis and Derrick Briggs.''
</P>
<P>
   There were few big plays from the offense, which after springing
deep- threat receiver Carlos Francis for 234 yards last week,
appeared content to dink its way downfield. And the only offensive
drive that produced a touchdown was bogged down on fourth-and-two
at the Tech 48 as the second quarter ticked away in a
then-scoreless game.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams coach Manny Matsakis called a fake punt. Freshman
backup safety Ryan Aycock took a short snap and after seeing his
pass option thwarted, hooked it around right end for a 19-yard gain
and a first down at the UNT 33. Seven plays later, Kingsbury found
tight end Tim Baker at the goal line with 4:13 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Hunt's fumble recovery at the UNT 48 on the first play of
the second half led to Birkholz's 50-yarder at 12:36 of the third
quarter. Wes Welker's 39-yard punt return set up Birkholz's 47-yard
kick five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ultimate goal is to win one a week and we did,'' Leach
reasoned. ``But I thought we could have taken a bigger step than we
did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he didn't take into account who the Raiders were
playing. nn

TEXAS A&AMP;M OVERWHELMS WYOMING

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Wyoming's depth chart revealed this
recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' remodeled secondary included five junior-college
transfers and three freshmen, and seven of those defensive backs
made their Division I-A debut only 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   So, the special served Saturday night at Texas A&AMP;M's Kyle Field?
</P>
<P>
   Fresh meat, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore quarterback Mark Farris and receiver Robert Ferguson
feasted on the Cowboys' inexperienced secondary during the Aggies'
51-3 victory that could be described best as a big-play buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Farris completed 14 of 21 passes for 272 yards and two
touchdowns, and Ferguson finished with seven catches for 174 yards
and two touchdowns, and that included a 93-yard strike that went
for the second-longest reception in Texas A&AMP;M history.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M threw the ball well tonight,'' Cowboys coach Vic Koenning
said. ``They've got a great quarterback and great receivers. Their
offensive line did a great job of protecting him, and he was able
to look downfield and make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Aggies' defense kept Wyoming's pass-happy offense
in check throughout the evening and allowed only three receptions
of more than 10 yards while registering four sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Koenning played the role of riverboat gambler throughout the
first half in an attempt to even the odds for his outmanned Cowboys
(0-2). Wyoming gambled three times on fourth down, which included
two fake punts and an unsuccessful, first-quarter onside kick after
Aaron Elling's 40-yard field goal gave the Cowboys' a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Koenning realized that the odds favor the house.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies (1-1) parlayed the onside kick into a three-play,
44-yard touchdown drive that tailback Richard Whitaker capped with
a 23-yard run with 8:44 remaining in the opening quarter. Farris,
though, established the tone for the evening with a 21-yard pass to
receiver Chris Taylor on the Aggies' first play from scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a good game tonight, and it's good to get that first
win under out belt,'' said Farris, whose night ended after fullback
Ja'Mar Toombs' 1-yard touchdown run with 6:27 remaining in the
third quarter. ``We didn't have a lot of plays in the first half,
but we made the most of our opportunities. We put points on the
board. We did a lot of good things as a team tonight, and we still
have some things we need to get done this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies rushed for 191 yards on 37 attempts, but 177 of that
came during the second half with the game's outcome decided. The
Cowboys attempted a second fake punt late in the second quarter on
fourth-and-15 from Texas A&AMP;M's 41-yard line, but Matt Swanson
overthrew Darth Tesinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies regained possession with two minutes remaining before
halftime, and Farris launched an eight-play scoring drive that
concluded with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played an all-around team game tonight,'' said Ferguson, a
transfer from Tyler Junior College whose debut at Kyle Field
eclipsed that of tight end Rich Siler, who caught six passes for
107 yards in 1983. ``Everybody played well. This is the type of
score we want to see on the scoreboard each week. We just need to
continue to work hard and play hard each week. We've got the
ability, and we showed a little bit of that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Farris/Ferguson combination put the final dagger through the
Cowboys' hearts on the Aggies' first play from scrimmage during the
second half. Swanson's 40-yard punt pinned Texas A&AMP;M on its 7-yard
line, and the Aggies came out in a running formation with two tight
ends and two running backs and Ferguson split wide.
</P>
<P>
   Farris executed the play fake, and Ferguson blew past cornerback
Sidney Lewis, one of the Cowboys' five junior-college transfers.
Lewis slipped attempting to adjust to Ferguson's route, and Farris
hit his target in stride for a 28-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark made a great pass,'' Ferguson said. ``I just concentrated
on the ball and made the catch. I saw nothing but green and took it
to the house.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Wyoming quarterback Jay Stoner, who departed during the
second quarter with a slight concussion and a possible separated
sternum from a Texas A&AMP;M defense that surrendered only 213 yards of
total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old adage that says that you make your most
improvement between the first and second game,'' Aggies linebacker
Brian Gamble said. ``I think we showed that tonight. We improved on
both offense and defense. We turned it up a notch in practice this
week, and I think it showed. Wyoming is a good team, and we played
better on offense, defense and special teams.'' nn

Texas A&AMP;M whips Wyoming
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COLLEGE STATION _ Should have been a Cowboy?
</P>
<P>
   Not on a football field in Texas during the last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming Cowboys fared even worse in a 51-3 pasting by Texas
A&AMP;M on Saturday night than the Dallas Cowboys did in a 41-14 home
loss to Philadelphia last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At least Wyoming (0-2) made a host of Texans happy. The Aggies
(1-1) converted two kicking foul-ups into quick touchdowns in the
first half and cruised to the rout before 69,273 at Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Mark Farris came out slinging. He was 12-of-17 in
the first half, when the Aggies ran the ball only nine times en
route to a 21-3 lead. On the Aggies' first play from scrimmage in
the second half, Farris hit Robert Ferguson with a 93-yard scoring
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Farris was 14-of-21 for 272 yards and two touchdowns when he
came out of the game late in the third quarter. Backups Vance Smith
and Colby Freeman played in mop-up roles, with Freeman directing
two late scoring drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to get the first win under our belt,'' Farris said.
``We didn't have a lot of plays in the first half, but we made the
most of our opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   In his second game for the Aggies, junior-college transfer
Ferguson had an eye-popping performance. He caught seven passes for
174 yards and two touchdowns, giving him 12 receptions for 253
yards in two games.
</P>
<P>
   The 93-yard play was the second-longest in Texas A&AMP;M history,
behind only a 96-yard pass last season from Randy McCown to Chris
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of score we want to see on the scoreboard
each week,`` Ferguson said. ``We've got the ability, and we showed
a little bit of that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies used a quick-strike offense throughout Saturday's
game. Their first four scoring drives took 35 seconds, five
seconds, 77 seconds and 14 seconds. The Cowboys' mistakes, Farris'
arm and Ferguson's speed made A&AMP;M's 20th straight home win a
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The victory improved A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum's record in
non-conference home games to 25-0. In those games, the Aggies'
average margin of victory has been 44-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies were a bit apprehensive going into this game. The
Cowboys had an experienced quarterback in senior Jay Stoner and a
gimmicky offense that figured to give A&AMP;M's inexperienced secondary
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the A&AMP;M defense held Wyoming to a field goal on its
opening drive and nothing more. Stoner suffered a concussion late
in the first half and did not return. He was 11-of-18 for 69 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On the first drive of the game, Aaron Elling kicked a 40-yard
field goal to put Wyoming ahead 3-0. After that, nothing went right
for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   They attempted an onside kick after the field goal, and it might
have worked except the ball hit Wyoming's Lamar James in the leg
before it traveled the necessary 10 yards. The Aggies took over at
the Wyoming 44.
</P>
<P>
   Farris hit Taylor with a 21-yard pass, the first of six
completions on first down in the opening half. After an incomplete
pass, Richard Whitaker sailed into the end zone on a 23-yard run.
Fullback Ja'Mar Toombs aided Whitaker's run with a devastating
kickout block.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 7-3, the Aggies caught their next break early in the
second quarter. A 42-yard punt by Cody Skates was about to be
downed by the Aggies inside the 10 when the ball glanced off
Wyoming's Ryan Calahan, who was in the wrong place at the wrong
time.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's Dawon Gentry fell on the ball at Wyoming five. Five
seconds later, Toombs bulled into the end zone, breaking two
tackles on his way to giving the Aggies a 14-3 lead with 14:02 to
play in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming ran 21 of the next 25 offensive plays, and it amounted
to nothing but frustration for the Cowboys, who spun their wheels
and came away with no points.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies put the game away in the closing minute of the first
half. Farris went 6-of-7 on a 59-yard drive, hitting Ferguson with
a seven-yard strike with 43 seconds left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Farris and Ferguson teamed on a home-run ball on the Aggies'
first play of the second half. With a two-tight end, two-back
formation, Ferguson was in single coverage. He blew past Wyoming
cornerback Sidney Lewis, who stumbled as Ferguson went by.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson caught the ball around midfield and streaked into the
end zone to put the Aggies ahead 28-3 with 11:15 left in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defender fell down, and Mark made a great pass,'' Ferguson
said. ``I just concentrated on the ball and made the catch. I saw
nothing but green and took it to the house.''
</P>
<P>
   After Toombs capped an 80-yard drive with a one-yard run to make
it 35-3 with 6:27 left in the third quarter, the Aggies emptied the
bench. Freeman, a redshirt freshman, scored on a four-yard run to
culminate his first drive with the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   After Terrence Kitchens kicked a 40-yard field goal, Freeman
directed the final scoring drive. Amon Simon went in from the
one-yard line with 43 seconds left as the Aggies surpassed the
50-point plateau for the eighth time in their last 12
non-conference home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good home opener for us,'' said Slocum, whose
record is 12-0 in such games. ``We sped up our ability to get the
ball downfield tonight.''

BRUINS SURVIVE BULLDOGS' BITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ That was hardly the little break in action,
the calm between storms the Bruins had privately desired.
</P>
<P>
   Between their bimonthly meetings of third-ranked programs, UCLA
took on a Fresno State team Saturday in a game that was a struggle
from dismal beginning to very scary end.
</P>
<P>
   If they ultimately left with a 24-21 victory before a Rose Bowl
crowd of 45,605, they also came away with continued problems with
their special teams, a ragged offensive production and unexpected
quarterback concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins led just 10-7 early in the fourth quarter and
everything reeked of effort, particularly offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Then backup quarterback Scott McEwan, who took over for Ryan
McCann to start the second half, and tailback DeShaun Foster, who
otherwise had a quiet night, led the Bruins to a pair of
fourth-quarter touchdowns that appeared to have UCLA comfortably
ahead 24-7 with 8:49 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Only nothing was going to come easily for UCLA on this night. A
Bruins defense that had been outstanding throughout, suddenly
looked vulnerable. It allowed Fresno State quarterback David Carr
to lead the Bulldogs to a pair of quick touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Carr actually had the Bulldogs driving for the upset, or at
least the tie, with the ball at the UCLA 43 when he fumbled the
snap with 1:17 left. Safety Marques Anderson recovered for the
Bruins, to finally bring some measure of calm to the UCLA faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 2-0, OK?'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said, opening his
postgame press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone figures this will make No. 3 Michigan, here next
Saturday, nervous. Not with an offense that could never seem to
find its footing.
</P>
<P>
   McCann, who had played so well in taking over for the injured
Corey Paus last week against Alabama that Toledo suggested possibly
keeping him there all season, couldn't even last the second half
against Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   McCann completed 12 of 23 passes for 106 yards and one
touchdown, but had trouble with the blitz, missed several receivers
and made several audibles that puzzled the UCLA coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo turned to McEwan to open the second half. He completed 5
of 10 passes for 29 yards but also was sacked twice. Toledo said he
was uncertain who he would start against Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   McEwan led the Bruins on a 12-play, 59-yard drive in the fourth
quarter _ Foster scoring on a fourth-and-1 _ to give UCLA a 17-7
lead with 11:16 to play. When the Bulldogs couldn't answer, Foster
(140 yards on 29 carries) broke loose on a 49-yard scoring run that
seemed to wrap it up.
</P>
<P>
   Except that Carr (20 of 32, 249 yards), threw quick scoring
passes of 16 yards and 32 yards to Charles Smith to put Fresno
State (0-2) back in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the defense was pretty much in control the whole
game, until we gave up a couple big scores at the end to make the
score seem closer than it was,'' UCLA linebacker Robert Thomas
said. ``I thought the intensity was there. We knew they would be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The first half was almost the anti-Alabama game, although the
Bruins did somehow manage to salvage that 10-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA appeared uninspired early, particularly on offense. And, if
historical progression dictates, apparently UCLA will start every
game this season with the special teams giving up a quick
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the first punt was returned for a touchdown; this
time, showing amazing versatility, it was an errant punt snap
setting up a quick score.
</P>
<P>
   McCann checked off a third-and-1 run to a pass play in a
formation with just one receiver and fullback Matt Stanley caught
the pass, tipped by linebacker Tim Skipper, for a 3-yard loss. The
audible left offensive coordinator Alan Borges screaming at McCann,
but it would get worse. The attempted punt on the ensuing play
failed, as center Jeff Grau's snap sailed over the fingers of
5-foot-9 punter Nate Fikse.
</P>
<P>
   Fikse recovered and was tackled at the 6, where Carr connected
with tight end Alec Grego for a 3-yard score three plays later.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins answered with one ugly 15-play, 83-yard drive. It was
kept alive three different times by personal fouls on the Bulldogs
_ once on a failed third down and another on a punt. McCann found
Freddie Mitchell down the left sideline with a 20-yard TD strike to
cap the drive.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's special teams tried to give away another touchdown, only
to have a Bulldog, incredibly, spoil it. Smith burst up the middle
and had no Bruins left to beat. He was looking at an 82-yard punt
return for a touchdown _ only to be tripped up by teammate Bryce
McGill.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Bulldogs couldn't punch it in, failing on a fake
field-goal attempt.

PALMER SILENCES CRITICS WITH BIG GAME FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With all questions about his ability long since
answered Saturday night, USC quarterback Carson Palmer elevated a
great effort into a marvelous one in the final minute against
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer completed all six pass attempts on the Trojans' game-
winning drive, moving the team into chip-shot field-goal range and
restoring any faith that might have been lost in him following a
subpar performance two weeks ago against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great from the start,'' said Palmer, who finished 25 of
30 for 275 yards with one touchdown. Two pass attempts were
dropped, and a third came on a clock-stopping spike in the final
minute. ``I knew I played bad (against Penn State), but I also knew
that wasn't going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Palmer was nearly flawless. The coaching
staff centered the offense on a short passing game, to exploit
Colorado's fear of getting beaten by the deep pass, and under
Palmer's direction, the offense succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer completed passes to eight receivers, and aided by a
strong effort from the offensive line, he showed the patience and
awareness that were missing in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes' defense conceded the short passing game to the
Trojans and Palmer resisted the temptation to use USC's speed at
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer made accurate throws to the sideline and allowed players
such as Kareem Kelly and Marcell Allmond to turn a 4-yard pass into
an 8-yard gain. Palmer made only one highlight-reel throw, a
crucial 19-yard third-down completion to Kelly on the final drive.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was at his best on the final drive, as he perfectly fed
two balls to freshman Keary Colbert, who needed to take only one
step to get out of bounds each time. Palmer also managed the clock
well, as the Trojans took control of the ball with one minute, 14
seconds remaining following a missed Colorado field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started when their guy missed the 40-yard field goal
and I had no doubt that (Palmer) would get us down there,'' said
kicker David Newbury, who made the game-winning 24-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Palmer tossed around the word ``clutch'' more
than a driving instructor teaching the stick shift.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer praised Newbury, the offensive line and the defense to
the max, but the numbers, both Palmer's statistics and the final
score, show that the quarterback played just as big a part in the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were extremely confident the whole time,'' Palmer said.
``We were so confident after we saw the Colorado State (vs.
Colorado) game, and we came in with a great game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we could beat them with the deep post and the quick
slants and we did a great job of executing the game plan.''

OFFENSIVELY, BAD EXECUTION HURTS BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PASADENA, Calif. _ What happened to that smooth UCLA offensive
machine that made Alabama look like Team Overrated?
</P>
<P>
   Everything for the UCLA offense was a struggle Saturday against
Fresno State. Aside from two fourth-quarter touchdowns, the Bruins
offense had little to boast about.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo blamed execution, particularly that of
quarterback Ryan McCann, whom you might remember as the unexpected
hero of the Alabama game.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, of course, McCann had tailback DeShaun Foster
making like Superman, rushing 42 times for 187 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Foster got it going late Saturday but not when McCann was
around. In the first half, Foster rushed 15 times for 49 yards.
Even after three quarters, he had a relatively modest 78 yards on
22 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA offensive line that was blowing highly regarded Alabama
off the line, was struggling against Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alabama was kind of shocked at how we ran the ball,'' said
guard Brian Polak. ``Fresno knew and was able to prepare for it and
then we didn't execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster ended up with 140 yards on 29 carries, and now has 327
yards in two games.
</P>
<P>
   __ What do you make of it? The Bruins weren't real sure how
excited to be over their 24-21 victory against a Fresno State team
that lost 43-10 to Ohio State last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win is a win,'' linebacker Robert Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like the way we won,'' Polak said. ``We have to put
this bad game behind us and get ready for Michigan. Offensively we
just didn't execute in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a learning experience,'' safety Marques Anderson said.
``We got a win. Now we have to go and get better.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Read it and weep: Fresno State is now 0-6 against UCLA, but
coach Pat Hill remains undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for the (late) fumble, we would still be playing now,''
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a moral victory. I feel we can play with these
people. We hope we can keep playing the Bruins. . . . I would love
to play them in Fresno. I would love that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, however, was the last game currently scheduled between
the two schools.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: At least the Bruins emerged without any major
injuries for Michigan. Backup defensive end Mat Ball had a slight
concussion for the only reported injury. . . . The Bulldogs played
without their leading rusher, sophomore tailback Derrick Ward, who
sprained his ankle last week in Fresno State's 43-10 loss to Ohio
State. . . . The 26 net yards the UCLA defense allowed rushing was
its best performance since allowing minus-34 yards against Stanford
Nov. 1, 1997.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You know, the college football fans of Los Angeles
could get used to this.
</P>
<P>
   So what if USC and UCLA made the faithful sweat a little more
than they might have expected as a summer afternoon cooled into an
autumn evening Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   So what if USC needed the smallest man on the Coliseum field to
kick a field goal with only 13 seconds left on the glowing
scoreboard clock to defeat the University of Colorado 17-14 before
a crowd of 65,153?
</P>
<P>
   So what if UCLA needed to pluck a fumble off the Rose Bowl turf
in the waning minutes to preserve a 24-21 victory over determined
Fresno State in front of 45,605 in Pasadena?
</P>
<P>
   It's winning that counts in the do-or-die world of football,
where any loss can doom your national championship hopes, where the
narrowest triumph sometimes is the most impressive. And the Trojans
and Bruins keep winning.
</P>
<P>
   The drama of their latest victories only heightens the sense
that something special is developing here.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team, to put it bluntly, was much good last season. USC
lost as many games as it won after its strapping quarterback Carson
Palmer was injured, an embarrassment for a university that lists
eight national titles in its history books. UCLA, a force behind
the canny QB Cade McNown in 1997 and 19!''nh~

   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ While his teammates ran into the locker room
at halftime, Drew Amerson lay on the field, clutching his knee. For
the Cal State Northridge offense _ a group that's been struggling
this season _ it wasn't good news.
</P>
<P>
   Amerson, last year's leading receiver, didn't return because of
a strained right knee. He is expected to undergo an MRI Monday.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN was down by four points at halftime but rallied to a 19-13
overtime win over Southwest Texas State.
</P>
<P>
   Amerson injured the knee on a kickoff return as time ran out in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to cut and I hyperextended it and it snapped back,''
Amerson said. ``They said they really didn't know (what the injury
is).''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors know it won't be easy if Amerson is out. He is
quarterback Marcus Brady's favorite target and one of the most

OKLAHOMA WALLOPS ARKANSAS STATE
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ It is the stated goal of fourth-year Arkansas
State coach Joe Hollis to bring his program to the point of
becoming a replica of ``the Tulsa of the early '80s,'' recalling
fond memories of his days as offensive coordinator of the Golden
Hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   For much of a long evening before a crowd of 74,730 at Memorial
Stadium on Saturday night, the poor Indians (0-2) seemed about a
century behind _ unable to fend off the Oklahoma defense, plagued
by penalties and Sooners of various description, and beaten, 45-7.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the guests were undone by record-setting
performances from quarterback Josh Heupel and return man J.D.
Thatcher, who had 160 yards on five punt returns, including one
that went 66 yards for a score. For the Sooners (2-0), it was an
easy cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his 13th game at Oklahoma _ not counting a bowl
game _ Heupel (24 of 32 for 301 yards, 3 TDs and an interceptions)
threw his 35th career touchdown pass _ 35 yards to Andre Woolfolk _
tying the school record it took Cale Gundy (1990-93) four years to
establish.
</P>
<P>
   Sooners coach Bob Stoops regarded the whole affair as a decent
40th birthday present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good, solid victory, and I feel good about the way we
played, for the most part,'' he said. ``Offensively, we played much
better than last week in terms of running (208 yards), passing,
catching and blocking. Josh did a nice job _ he was very sharp
finding the open people and delivering the ball, and we were also
catching better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also concentrated on the kicking game this week, and it
worked out very well for J.D. We may have to move him back to
running back where he originally played.''
</P>
<P>
   In a game where the two teams drew a combined 25 penalties,
Stoops noted that, ``We took ourselves out of a couple of scores
that way, and we can't continue doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it was a good night, and I'm especially gratified
that a team that rushed for 245 yards last week only got 84 on us.
But we know we will face better teams than this down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU's misery began early as Heupel directed an 80-yard scoring
march on the game's first possession, sneaking the final yard
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians stiffened and forced a missed field goal on OU's
second possession, but Thatcher took the ensuing punt on his 34,
circled left, cut back through the center of the pursuit, drifted
right, and outran the pack to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' plight was typified by a sequence at the end of the
first quarter when Heupel threw touchdown passes on three
consecutive plays. The first was nullified by a penalty, the second
was dropped, but the third _ 26 yards to Damian Mackey on the first
play of the second period, put the Sooners up by 21 points. The
drive began with a 30-yard return by Thatcher which, with a
personal foul penalty, set OU up at the Indians' 42.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher's 40-yard return set up the next drive, which Heupel
finished with a 19-yard scoring pass to Woolfolk.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians scored late in the half, but damaged themselves with
penalties and once misfired on two consecutive snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Heupel's record-tying toss to Woolfolk (5 catches, 102 yards, 2
TDs) came on the opening drive of the second half, and the Indians
were never able to mount much of a comeback, once having a 60-yard
completion wiped out by a holding call.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's final indignity arrived early in the final period
in the form of OU freshman Renaldo Works _ who supplied the final
touch with a zig-zag 75-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I feel about his development?'' Stoops said. ``At this
point, I feel terrific.'' nn

UNBELIEVABLE: FROGS' 31-POINT WIN IS NOT ENOUGH

   RENO, Nev. _ You miserable ingrate.
</P>
<P>
   There you were, sprawled on the couch Saturday afternoon,
watching TCU dismantle hapless Nevada, 41-10, in the Horned Frogs'
season opener, shaking your head.
</P>
<P>
   I know exactly what you were thinking _ not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Am I right?
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, 'fess up, you want wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   After all the hype, all the buildup, all the talk about promise
and potential and national rankings, you wanted blood. You wanted
gore.
</P>
<P>
   You wanted 50 points on the scoreboard and 300-yards rushing for
Heisman Trophy candidate LaDainian Tomlinson. You fully expected
quarterback Casey Printers to find wide open receivers loping free
and easy where the deer and the antelope roam.
</P>
<P>
   Total annihilation, that's what you wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Geez, oh my. What have we come to when we find ourselves
nit-picking 31-point TCU victories?
</P>
<P>
   We're both going to have to get serious psychological help,
podnuh, 'cause I'm right there with you.
</P>
<P>
   Frogs head coach Dennis Franchione found himself pleading for a
little perspective in his postgame media briefing and rightly so.
</P>
<P>
   His team hadn't played particularly well, but still easily put
away the woeful Wolf Pack, newest member of the Western Athletic
Conference, and there were certainly a plethora of Purple
highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson racked up 176 yards on 24 carries, a 7.3 average, and
scored three touchdowns in three quarters. The Frogs' defensive
line totaled a team record 15 sacks. ``Fifteen!'' Special teams
scored twice on spectacular kickoff and punt returns.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione had ample reason to be happy, but we salivating media
wolves barely let him squeeze in a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you're going to say it's not good enough,'' Franchione
said. ``You guys are trying to create a different standard. I'm
still taking it as a win. A win, is a win, is a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not have been as pretty a win as you guys wanted it to
be, but I've never found one that's ugly that I still didn't
like.''
</P>
<P>
   No one said it was an ugly win. We've seen plenty of those and
this didn't come close. Somehow, though, it just wasn't ... enough.
And yes, there is a different standard. Like it or not, the bar has
been raised.
</P>
<P>
   Two consecutive bowl victories, a No. 22 national ranking and 18
returning starters did that, not us.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Frogs never looked as crisp again as they did
on their game opening, 80-yard, seven-play drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our first game, on the road, against a team playing its
second game. We rushed for over 300 yards. We sacked 'em 15
times,'' Franchione reminded. ``I know what you're saying a little
bit. It was a win but it wasn't as pretty as sometimes you want it
to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell guys in practice, `You're not doing this right,
or this good,' but when they get into a game, it registers even
more and they realize what they have to do. We needed to go play a
game to get better and hopefully now we'll have improvement in Week
2.''
</P>
<P>
   The bittersweet taste of even slight dissatisfaction with a
31-point victory was a strange one for the Frogs, but it was
generally universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed, but I thought we might come out and play
a little bit better than we did,'' Tomlinson said. ``I'm happy with
the win, but we've definitely got some things to work on and
improve on before next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at film I'll probably see some cuts I should have
made. You know, I hadn't been hit since last year. I've just got to
get used to getting hit again and getting back in the groove.
Overall, I'm just happy to get what I did in three quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no balance, no passing game. Printers, who started
10 games last year as a true freshman, was 3-of-9 for 53 yards and
threw an awful interception, one of four TCU turnovers. If the
Frogs are going to do as well as they hope _ and if Tomlinson is
going to win a Heisman _ Printers simply has to be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have my best day, but we were effective running the
option, so we stayed with it,'' Printers said. ``It was frustrating
because we work so hard on the passing game every day and we
couldn't go out and execute. It's not going to come the very first
game, but as a competitor you want to go out and throw the ball
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione wasn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that was his game and I hadn't seen 10 others that he's
played, then I'd be really nervous,'' he said. ``I know what the
kid can do and I've seen him do it in a game, so we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the problem. For the first time in 30-odd years of
watching TCU football, `OK' just doesn't seem like enough.
</P>
<P>
   We're hungry for so much more. nn

NEBRASKA, TOO, SHALL PASS ... BUT NOT OFTEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ This newfangled invention called the forward
pass continues to cause consternation in Corn Land, even though
quarterbacks completing crucial passes are popping up more and more
in Nebraska's history books.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers remain college football's most grounded team.
Mountain(-sized) men on the offensive line, clever QBs flipping
option pitches to yard-gobbling backs ... that's the way the
Huskers move the ball. Only sometimes, they desperately suck it up,
call a number and ``throw the ball forward''.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work on the passing game all the time in practice,'' junior
quarterback Eric Crouch said with the fervor of an evangelist.
``It's not option, option, option all week long. Passing is a big
part of our game, it's so important to have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Eric, and politicians tell the truth. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska, faced with becoming another No. 1 victim in Notre
Dame's legacy, completed a key third-down pass in overtime that led
to a 27-24 victory Saturday. The Huskers (2-0) produced 39 yards of
offense after the third quarter and survived special-teams
meltdowns that nearly gave the 23rd-ranked Irish (1-1) a major
upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure what to say,'' Nebraska coach Frank Solich
said, looking as dazed as Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskers are now 3-0 in overtime games. All three have been
on the road and all have benefited from a key completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think at Nebraska we run it 100 percent of the time,''
said Huskers junior tight end Tracey Wistrom. ``But we think that
when it's necessary, we can throw it and catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 24-21 in overtime, a sold-out Notre Dame Stadium
rocking, the Huskers faced a third-and-nine from the 24. Crouch,
who nearly had to search out a secondary receiver, found Wistrom.
Nine yards, first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracy did a good job getting open,'' said Crouch, who scored
the winning touchdown on a 7-yard run two plays after the Wistrom
completion. ``We made eye contact. I saw where he was looking, I
threw it there and he caught it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like something you'd hear after a Florida State game.
Yes, the Huskers ``do'' throw the ball. Sometimes they even
complete 'em. But if Nebraska is going to win its fourth national
championship in seven seasons, it will need a more consistent
passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Against most teams, the Huskers' move-the-pile attack is more
than adequate. Against the Irish, Nebraska produced 274 yards
rushing, a considerable drop from last week's 505 yards against San
Jose State. At times, the 'Huskers resorted to a jumbo formation.
They lined up with two tight ends and a power I that featured two
fullbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no secret, we were trying to grind 'em,'' Nebraska
senior guard Russ Hochstein said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Huskers went up 21-7 on Dan Alexander's 28-yard
touchdown run late in the third quarter, it appeared the Huskers'
usual wear-them-down game plan was on pace for another blowout. But
in the fourth quarter, the Huskers ran 14 plays that produced 14
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the third quarter, we were moving the ball on the ground
pretty well, but that came and went,'' Solich said. ``When that
happened, we needed to mix it up more. We did not throw as much in
the second half as much we should have or could have.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't throw it a lot and then also have a power game, an
option game. There aren't that many plays in a game. If we didn't
feel Eric could throw it, we wouldn't have thrown it on
third-and-nine in overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nebraska didn't need to pass, Notre Dame couldn't. Junior
quarterback Arnaz Battle missed on 12 of 15 attempts. His three
completions went for 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, faced with 70 yards to travel in 1:07 with the
game tied at 21, Notre Dame coach Bob Davie elected to pocket his
two remaining timeouts. Two Battle scrambles produced 7 yards and a
few boos as the Irish prepared for overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnaz can throw much better than he did today,'' Davie said.
``He can beat you with his legs more than his arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Crouch, who scored three rushing touchdowns and has six in two
games, can beat most teams with his legs. To win a national title,
he'll probably have to beat a few more teams with his arm.

ONE YEAR LATER, IT'S VENUS' TURN TO WIN OPEN TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ Venus Williams had to force a smile as
sister Serena won the 1999 U.S. Open. This time, there was nothing
phony about the ear-splitting grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become a new person since this time last year,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   That is because she has become a champion since this time last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won the Open singles championship with a 6-4, 7-5
victory against Lindsay Davenport on Saturday night, adding the
crown to the Wimbledon title she won earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've beaten the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the rankings
successively,'' said Williams, who beat Martina Hingis in the
semifinals. ``It's a nice feeling to know you've won a Grand
Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   The post-Open rankings will continue to say that Hingis is No.
1, Davenport No. 2, and Williams No. 3, but there can be little
doubt about who is the best player.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won two of the four Grand Slam events. She has won 26
consecutive matches, and five consecutive tournaments. And she beat
Hingis in the semifinals of the Open before knocking off Davenport
in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's definitely the No. 1 player right now,'' Davenport said.
``She hasn't lost a match since the French Open. You just have to
congratulate her and work on your own game. Right now she's playing
better than everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Davenport who was playing the best early in the match.
She needed to beat Williams to take over the top spot in the
rankings, and after the first five games that appeared not only
possible but likely.
</P>
<P>
   She broke Williams twice to take a 4-1 lead, and was serving to
go up 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been playing all the wrong tennis,'' Williams said. ``My
strategy was not working, and I had to change it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going for winners on every shot, she decided to put
the ball back in play and let Davenport make the mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy worked.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport played almost flawlessly in the first five games,
smacking winners all over the court. She was hitting the ball hard
and deep, executing the game plan she used to defeat Serena
Williams in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   But when Williams started getting more balls back in, Davenport
started making more mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   She was broken for 4-2, and, after Williams held, was broken
again for 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Williams again held for a 5-4 lead, and Davenport was serving to
stay in the set.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, she failed miserably. Down 15-30, she double-faulted
twice to give Williams the set.
</P>
<P>
   The double faults were typical of the reversal. What had been
winners turned into unforced errors. Balls that hit the lines in
the first five games flew long and wide in the next five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I should have won that set,'' she said. ``Up two
breaks, at this level you really can't afford to lose that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had a lot to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   She covers the court as well, and combines the movement with as
much power as any woman ever to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``She obviously covers the court well, much differently from
other players,'' Davenport said. ``A player like Arantxa runs it
down, but Venus gets it back with pace. It's tough to put balls
away against her.''
</P>
<P>
   Balls that look like winners when they leave her opponent's
racket come back over the net with regularity. Not only come back,
but come back with some force.
</P>
<P>
   That forces her foe to go for winners on every shot, which
produces the unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsay knew I was going to get the ball under any
circumstances, and it had to be intimidating for her,'' she said.
``I've got the power and the speed. I've really been blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport regrouped after the first-set collapse, and played
well enough to earn eight break points in the second. But she only
converted one of them, for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Williams only had two chances to break in the second set, but
she cashed in them both.
</P>
<P>
   The first came in the fourth game, when Davenport sprayed a
forehand long.
</P>
<P>
   The second came in the 12th game when Davenport again hit a
forehand long, giving Williams the championship and igniting a
genuine smile. nn

STARS' NIEUWENDYK IS HEALTHY AGAIN

   VAIL, Colo. _ For a Stars bunch fixated on getting younger, one
of their most important players just got another year older. Joe
Nieuwendyk turned 34 this morning. It is 34, right, Joe? ``You know
you're not supposed to ask about birthdays after 30,'' Nieuwendyk
joked. Isn't that rule just for women? ``Women,'' Nieuwendyk
clarified, ``and hockey players.'' Especially not hockey players
coming off seasons like Nieuwendyk had in 1999-2000. Injuries
sidelined him for 34 of Dallas' 82 regular-season games. He scored
15 goals, only one better than his previous season low, and added
19 assists. He had 10 points during Dallas' playoff run, only to go
dry for critical spurts. So, less than a year after his Conn
Smythe-winning season and subsequent three-year, $15 contract
extension, Nieuwendyk heard grumblings from fans and media that
maybe his best days were behind him. ``After my rookie year, I
heard you'll never score 50 again,'' said Nieuwendyk, who scored 51
the next season. ``Someone always is saying something. When I hurt
my knees, people said, `Oh, he's done now.' I wasn't. You keep
moving on. And, to be honest, I feel in better shape than I have in
a few years.'' Everything is healed: the chest contusion, the
bruised ribs, the million nicks and dings that accumulate in 13
seasons. His surgically repaired knees from a season ago feel like
they did when he played his first season for Calgary in 1987. And
Nieuwendyk, at 34, finds himself about to be a father for the first
time. His wife, Tina, recently told him they were expecting. ``It's
something that I've always looked forward to,'' Nieuwendyk said,
``but I wanted to wait for the right time.'' Nieuwendyk has never
been one to do anything on anybody else's time. Or one to limit
himself by other people's preconceived notions. Yes, most players
don't have career years in their mid-30s. Nieuwendyk can't help but
think most is quite different than all. So why not? Why couldn't
this be a big year? Stars coach Ken Hitchcock says it very well
could be. ``When you are an older player, where your level is at is
really a lot in your hands,'' Hitchcock said. ``What I can tell you
is the strength of the hockey club is down the middle, and that's
where we're going to win games. Whatever Joe is thinking, he needs
to have a great year, for him and for the team.'' Nieuwendyk nods.
He knows the Stars need a big season from him. But if you're
waiting for Nieuwendyk to say he has something to prove this
season, keep waiting. He doesn't feel like he has anything to
prove. The proving was done a long time ago. No, if anything,
Nieuwendyk said that a little bit of his motivation is pride. He
won't be told he can't and certainly not because of age. ``I think
it is harder as you get older. I think, mostly, paranoia sets in,''
said Stars winger Mike Keane, not too far behind at 33. ``You just
don't want anyone to take your job. It doesn't matter that you've
done this for so many years because it's that type of thinking that
gets your job taken away. A young kid comes in and takes it. Nobody
wants to go out that way. You want to go out on your own terms.''
Which is why Nieuwendyk began skating in July. Nothing serious, but
four times a week he went to a local rink just to get the feel.
Boy, he had fun, too. He can't help it. The smile just won't go
away. Even on his birthday. ``I certainly don't feel old that's for
sure,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``I feel good. I really am excited about
playing hockey every day.'' Maybe everything does get better as you
get older.

RANGERS' BULLPEN GETS FINAL LAUGH IN VICTORY OVER ROYALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The fans in Kansas City are supposed to be
the most docile and friendly in baseball, but at least some proved
otherwise Saturday night at Kauffman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly good time was had by all in the party pavilion on
the hill overlooking both left field and the Rangers' bullpen. From
this lofty perch, the revelers could sip their colds ones, watch
some baseball and offer their personal critique to the Rangers'
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably nothing they haven't heard before _ in New York,
Boston or on Fort Worth-Dallas radio _ but by the eighth inning,
security officers were throwing people out of the stadium or
leading them away in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   You know it's a tough year when the fans in Kansas City are all
over you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rampant all over baseball,'' closer John Wetteland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a little rude,'' reliever Jeff Zimmerman said. ``You
expect that in New York and places like that, but you don't expect
it in Kansas City, them yelling at you about your mother and stuff.
They were on us from the first inning on. I don't think they'll be
singing in church very well tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But for one night at least, the relievers got the last laugh on
their tormentors. With a 6-0 lead suddenly in peril, the bullpen
rescued a suddenly faltering Doug Davis in the fifth inning and
held off the Kansas City Royals late rally for a 6-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Johnson got his second victory in a week after taking
over for Davis and Wetteland, combined with Mike Venafro to pitch
ninth for his fifth save in the past week. Zimmerman, pitching
between them, gave the Rangers 12/3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.J. did another good job,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``Zim,
his command wasn't that good but he kept after them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Doug Davis started the evening like he was going
to give the bullpen a night off. He retired the first nine batters
he faced, and it looked like his relievers were going to do nothing
but listen to drunken fans all night.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed quickly after the Rangers scored six for him in
the fourth inning. The Royals got two hits in the fourth, but a
double play kept them from scoring. But Davis started the fifth by
walking Mark Quinn, and his manager started to get irritated.
</P>
<P>
   After a ground out and a run-scoring single by Carlos Beltran,
Davis walked Gregg Zaun and the manager stewed a little bit more.
Carlos Febles blooped a single to right to load the bases, then
Johnny Damon doubled to left-center to drive home two. That made it
6-3, and Oates went to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walk to Quinn, that's nice,'' Oates snapped. ``You got a
six-run lead, you don't want to start walking people,''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson came in and stopped the rally cold. Rey Sanchez hit
a grounder back to the mound, and Febles was trapped off third.
Johnson walked Mike Sweeney but got Jermaine Dye on a grounder to
third to end the threat. Johnson is now 2-0 with a 1.74 earned-run
average in three outings since being recalled from the minors.
</P>
<P>
   What's even better for him is Oates is starting to use him in
crucial situations rather than mop-up or long relief roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's awesome,'' Johnson said. ``There's nothing better in
baseball. Starting is great and hitting is great, but there's
nothing better than coming in with the game on the line, the three
and four hitters coming up and one swing of the bat could tie it
up. There's no worse feeling if you don't have success, and there's
no greater feeling if you do have success.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps your team win. It also helps send a little message to
your vocal critics. The Rangers don't often get that chance. They
did Saturday night in Kansas City. nn

LEAGUE'S FEAR OF NEW TAX HELPS MAVERICKS, OWNER SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Many NBA owners are concerned about the league's luxury
tax, but not Mark Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban believes the team escrow tax, or luxury tax, is tipping
the balance of power in favor of maverick owners such as himself,
even though the tax doesn't kick in until the 2001-02 season.
That's because Cuban, the Mavericks' 42-year-old billionaire owner,
said he doesn't mind sharing his money with his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring it on,'' Cuban said. ``I love new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   While most owners see the tax as punitive, the effervescent
Cuban sees it as another way of revitalizing a dormant franchise.
And that's Cuban's primary reason for purchasing the Mavericks _ to
breathe some new life into this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was two years ago, I probably wouldn't be spending all
that much money,'' Cuban said. ``But now with the luxury tax right
around the corner and people so concerned with it, they'll give up
better players if you pay part of the salary.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the NBA Players Association, the luxury tax will go
into effect only if league-wide spending on players salaries and
benefits exceed 61 percent of basketball-related income.
Basketball-related income is, among other things, all income
received by teams as a result of basketball operations _ ticket
revenue, television contract monies.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a team will be taxed a dollar for every dollar
exceeding 61 percent of revenue generated from ticket revenue,
television contract, etc.
</P>
<P>
   While many owners have traded players the past two summers to
avoid the luxury tax, owners such as Cuban and Paul Allen have been
busy gobbling up huge contracts. Cuban and Allen, who owns the
Portland Trail Blazers, don't even flinch at the luxury tax.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Cleveland Cavaliers were more than happy to add
forward Shawn Kemp to Allen's stable of highly paid players when
they traded him to the Blazers. Kemp has four years remaining on
his contract that will pay him $71 million, including a staggering
$46 million during the final two years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Allen added to his luxury-tax burden when he acquired
Dale Davis in a trade from the Indiana Pacers. Davis signed a
$19-million extension with the Pacers three weeks ago and is still
owed $40 million over the next five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, whose payroll will approach a $85 million this
season, have five players on their roster who will earn more than
$10 million each during the 2000-01 season.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of payroll Cuban endorses.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mavericks acquired Christian Laettner from Detroit late
last month, Cuban gladly gave the Pistons $3 million to complete
the transaction. Laettner is scheduled to make $6.275 million this
season, and if he receives the maximum amount when he becomes a
free agent next summer, he'll have a seven-year, $77 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   That lofty price tag is one the Pistons were not willing to pay,
especially when it'll substantially affect the amount of luxury tax
they'll owe. But Cuban isn't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the $3 million comes in. It helps you take their
deals, because it \Rhelps them\S avoids the luxury tax,'' Cuban
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some insiders believe dumping high-priced players to avoid the
luxury tax could become chic among the NBA owners. Cuban even said
of the NBA owners: ``I think most are concerned with winning, but
not all of them are.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban's advice to the owners?
</P>
<P>
   ``Concentrate on making money,'' he said, ``so I can have an
advantage.''

STUDY SAYS RAMPART SCANDAL INDICATES SYSTEMIC PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Repeating for those needing.) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a scathing indictment of the entire criminal
justice system, a noted law professor says the Rampart Division
corruption case shows the need for independent reviews of police,
prosecutors and the courts to overcome a zealous effort to win
criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin Chemerinsky, the University of Southern California law
professor who was president of the city's elected Charter Reform
Commission, based his analysis on his own review of the Los Angeles
Police Department's Board of Inquiry report into the Rampart
corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky said the problems that developed are not limited to
the LAPD's Rampart station or to the Community Resources Against
Street Hoodlums units.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather, there has been a general breakdown in the checks and
balances of the criminal justice system. The problems with the LAPD
affect the broader criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the report were supplied to the Daily News and
detail what Chemerinsky termed a ``don't ask, don't tell''
philosophy between prosecutors and police officers to do whatever
is necessary to win convictions. The full report will be released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It also called for a number of actions:
</P>
<P>
   --An independent review of the district attorney's role in the
Rampart case.
</P>
<P>
   --Requiring judges to report on police officers who they believe
have lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   --Improved training of police officers on how to testify in
court, with more emphasis on legal ethics for officers and
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   --Protecting judges from being excluded from criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   --Requiring all complaints about police officers -- no matter
how minor -- be referred to the Inspector General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The Rampart case grew out of an internal LAPD investigation of
missing cocaine evidence and escalated to include the LAPD Rampart
Division's anti-gang CRASH unit, with allegations that officers
beat and shot suspects, planted evidence and lied in court.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since, five officers have been charged with
crimes, charges against 86 defendants have been set aside and the
city has begun paying out settlements that, according to some
estimates, might reach $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky was asked by the police officers union -- the Los
Angeles Police Protective League -- to review the Board of Inquiry
report prepared by the LAPD even as the Inspector General's Office
has its own task force under way reviewing the report.
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky agreed to do so at no cost, with the guarantee he
would have complete independence.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the District Attorney's Office and LAPD said they
would not comment until they review the report.
</P>
<P>
   Former Police Commission President Stanley Sheinbaum, who served
on the panel when the Christopher Commission released its report on
the 1991 police beating of Rodney King, said an outside review of
police conduct is essential since internal reviews are
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the culture in the police department -- all police
departments -- with a heavy component of a `code of silence' with
internal supervision, it just won't work. And, when I look back at
my days on the Police Commission, I didn't know all that much I was
doing, and we met only a half a day a week. We didn't know how to
arm-twist members of the department into getting us information and
we had virtually no staff,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need is a strong, independent Police Commission with
a body of reputable people.''
</P>
<P>
   Edith Perez, a private attorney who was the immediate past
Police Commission president, said she agreed that the entire
criminal justice system needs to be examined. ``It is much more
complicated than only one department. There are a lot of
improvements that could be made in the criminal justice system.
Unfortunately, we've focused on only one player. I think there is a
lot of value in looking at the ripple effect of all this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is to be a solution, there has to be a broader net
cast -- beyond the LAPD,'' said Perez, who also worked several
years as a deputy probation officer. ``You do wonder where the
District Attorney's Office was when all this was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, she said, is the system is overburdened
with cases and prosecutors don't have as much time as they should
to review cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then if you have suspicions that an officer committed
perjury, there is nowhere really to go,'' Perez said. ``I know in
some cases, deputy district attorneys had concerns, but there was
nowhere to go with the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Perez said she would like to see changes in the Police
Commission, including having at least one or two of its members
serving full time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need someone who is there on a day-to-day basis to keep in
contact and know what is going on. But you don't want a full-time
commission; you need people who are still independent and part of
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky's report challenged the LAPD's internal Board of
Inquiry into the Rampart scandal, saying it did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of the Board of Inquiry report was on the failures
in the operation and oversight of officers in the Rampart Division.
Although the report makes some mention of broader concerns in the
Los Angeles Police Department, the problems at Rampart are
presented as relatively unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there were certainly failures in the screening,
selection and supervision of these officers, the report may distort
the overall problem by failing to identify other breakdowns in the
criminal justice system that permitted a situation such as the
Rampart corruption incident to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   XXX
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky's report said the District Attorney's Office --
which is conducting its own internal review -- needs an outside
analysis of its role in the Rampart cases.
</P>
<P>
   There needs to be ``an independent commission to investigate the
District Attorney's Office's handling of Rampart cases, to
determine what it might have done to better prevent, expose and
deal with the Rampart scandal and, more generally, issues of police
perjury and misconduct,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   After conducting informal interviews with prosecutors,
Chemerinsky reported:
</P>
<P>
   --There is a sense that police are often pressured to testify in
a manner to support a case,
</P>
<P>
   --Officers are asked to avoid certain testimony helpful to the
defense,
</P>
<P>
   --Prosecutors feel torn between support of officers and winning
their cases, and
</P>
<P>
   --There is no effective way to deal with perjury by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``In analyzing these concerns, it becomes readily apparent that
certain key problems must be addressed regarding the relationship
between the LAPD and District Attorney,'' Chemerinsky wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors and police feed on each other's desire to `win'
the case. Given these attitudes, there is no check on whether the
LAPD and prosecutors are fulfilling their ... obligations.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The courts, likewise, are limited in reporting suspicions of
perjury by officers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judges are required by law to report any suspicions of
misconduct by other jurists. However, when it comes to police
misconduct, they leave it in the hands of the District Attorney's
Office to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the current approach, judges have no responsibility to
report police perjury or misconduct in the courtroom,'' Chemerinsky
said. ``In light of the Rampart corruption incident, it appears
this approach has not worked. Judges may need to undertake a more
active role in responding to police perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky suggested judges be given some protections from
being excluded from cases by being required to forward such
suspicions to the Police Commission and Inspector General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, he was particularly troubled with the way the
LAPD handles internal investigations in cases involving corruption
and officer-involved shootings.
</P>
<P>
   He recommended that all reports on such incidents be kept and
filed with officials to provide a full view of any such events.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Chemerinsky noted the training of officers on
testifying in court was wanting.
</P>
<P>
   Training at the Police Academy is ``fairly unremarkable, except
for the emphasis of how not to be embarrassed on the witness
stand,'' he said. ``A second type of training occurs in their
assignments. There, more senior officers impart the `tricks of the
trade,' such as how to avoid uncomfortable moments on the witness
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky also recommended a new approach to handling
personnel complaints involving officers, with all complaints being
referred to the Inspector General's Office for resolution.
