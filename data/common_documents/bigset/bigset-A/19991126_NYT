Game next step in healing process
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ

<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION _ There was supposed to be a fire burning here
Thursday night, a symbol of the Aggies' ``burning desire to beat
the hell outta t.u.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a garden bloomed.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of handwritten messages and colorful flowers decorated
the field where the Texas A&AMP;M Bonfire tragedy struck last week.
Maroon and white ribbons fluttered in the breeze. Aggie flags
clapped back and forth. Candles flickered.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of fans from the University of Texas and Texas A&AMP;M
streamed past the Bonfire site over the course of Thanksgiving Day,
staring blankly at the empty field where the stack once stood.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the rival fans occasionally stopped to shake hands with
one another or embrace. Most quietly walked along the police line
surrounding the site and read prayers and messages posted all over
the field. For some, tears flowed. For most, words were difficult
to come by.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Aggies and Longhorns are supposed to play a football
game that traditionally brings out the most heated and intense
emotions you'll ever see?
</P>
<P>
   This game has been called a war. It's been known as the meanest,
most wicked and emotional three hours of football you'll ever
experience.
</P>
<P>
   But not this time.
</P>
<P>
   How do you draw from an empty tank? How do the Aggies suddenly
again despise that which helped sustain them during their darkest
days of the past week?
</P>
<P>
   How do the Longhorns suddenly flick a switch and return to their
favorite pastime of showing utter contempt for that which over the
past week has exemplified true allegiance and spirit?
</P>
<P>
   They don't. No one could, because today it's different.
</P>
<P>
   It's Texas-Texas A&AMP;M and surely Mack Brown and R.C. Slocum will
have their teams ready to play. The X's will be taken care of and
so will the O's. But what about the human beings those X's and O's
represent? What about those frayed and tired emotions on both sides
of the ball?
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies and Longhorns will try to put the events of the past
week behind them and play the game of their lives, like they always
do in this one. But they can't _ not really. Not fully. Not like
it's always been before.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is much at stake for the Longhorns and much
redemption on the line for the Aggies in today's 10 a.m. kickoff at
Kyle Field. It should be a hard-hitting and unforgiving affair
between the lines that offers another memorable chapter to the long
and storied football traditions of both schools.
</P>
<P>
   But hanging over Kyle Field and casting a pall on the day will
be the knowledge that 12 people are dead and 27 are injured, some
critically, all for the sake of a football game. Thousands of
hearts have been affected _ from Austin, to College Station and
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Aggies linebacker Christian Rodriguez lost one of his best
friends in the Bonfire tragedy a week ago. Today, he is supposed to
play with a rage. How could anyone expect him to do that?
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns have tried to make game preparations business as
usual. They have tried to set aside the emotions and heed Brown's
call to understand the difference between feeling legitimately
grounded by the tragedy, yet ready to focus solely on a season-long
goal once the game begins.
</P>
<P>
   But how can they? This one is different.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies and Longhorns will play this game again next year,
and the year after that, and the year after that, and probably
forever. But nothing will reverse the tragedy that occurred last
week and nothing will bring back those 12 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 100-plus years of the rivalry, some even have gone
so far as to call this game life and death. But now we know better.
Now we all shudder at such words.
</P>
<P>
   This rivalry has survived the ups and downs of both programs for
more than 100 years. It has survived world wars, Korea, Vietnam. It
has survived national tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   It will survive this, and the rivalry will live on. In the
future, surely the fierce emotions and heated words again will
re-emerge _ teasips, ``pooooor Aggies,'' hexes and, we can only
hope, bonfires of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways the rivalry might never be the same again.
Twelve people are dead. It made for the darkest day this rivalry
has ever known and as dark and tragic as it was, as much as we all
wish it never happened, a garden has bloomed amid the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   It's Texas-Texas A&AMP;M, and now we all realize exactly what it is.
Just a game.

DIVAC'S WIFE HAS HER OWN ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You'll hear the F-word more than if you were at
Oakland Arena last week for Latrell Sprewell's R-17 return.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see more acts of thuggery than if you were courtside at a
Knicks-Heat playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel more squeamish than if you were at Staples Center
watching Shaquille O'Neal shoot free throws with the game on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, ``The Powder Keg,'' a play running
through Sunday at the Odyssey Theatre in West Los Angeles, is not
about Atlanta's Isaiah Rider or the Los Angeles Lakers' 1998-99
season.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of 11 random scenes, loosely tied together by
characters who make consecutive appearances, examines the
psychodynamics of the ongoing conflict in the former Yugoslavia on
one-time friends, neighbors and countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble cast includes Ana Divac, the wife of former Laker
and current Sacramento King Vlade Divac. The play has been a deeply
affecting experience for the Divaces, who are from the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   They met and were married in Ana's hometown of Belgrade and came
to the U.S. when the Lakers selected Divac with the 26th overall
pick in the 1989 draft.
</P>
<P>
   It pains them to know the friends and relatives they left behind
in Belgrade have grown as inured to air raids as Angelenos are to
traffic. The Divaces returned to the city for a visit over the
summer but stayed just two days, on account of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too dangerous,'' Ana said with a shudder after a recent
performance. ``You look at your friends, all young, beautiful,
smart, educated people, and you wonder, What's going to happen to
them and their lives?''
</P>
<P>
   CNN has become a friend who visits Ana in L.A. and Vlade in
Sacramento nightly, bringing news from back home. Sometimes it is
uplifting, like when President Clinton paid a visit to Kosovo
earlier in the week and promised to help rebuild the war-torn
province.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, however, the news is depressing.
</P>
<P>
   On those nights Vlade is happy to lose himself in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can actually focus on something else for a couple hours,''
he said by telephone the other night. ``It keeps my mind from going
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   On those nights Ana struggles after the curtain falls and it's
time to go home to the couple's three children, ages 8, 5 and 15
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hear bad news from back home, it's a hard night,'' she
said. ``It's easier to get into my characters but harder to get out
of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Ana was studying drama when she met Divac, who was playing for a
club team in Belgrade. When the NBA beckoned him, she put her
acting career on hold.
</P>
<P>
   The life of an NBA wife is sort of like a play; on the stage,
everything looks lovely, just perfect, but behind the scenes it can
be chaotic. When you're married to a professional athlete, so many
people look at you as a mere appendage of your husband _ you know,
attached at the elbow _ you can start to see yourself that way,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Ana said she's lucky. Divac wanted a thinker for a wife, not a
trophy. He's plainly proud of her acting. He encouraged her to
continue studying her craft in the States and supported her without
reservations when the opportunity to play two scenes in ``Powder
Keg'' presented itself.
</P>
<P>
   Her roles are not for the unemotive.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, Ana is threatened by a knife-wielding stranger on
a bus. In the other, she plays the Serbian girlfriend of a
Macedonian man who is attacked by a Macedonian Mafia boss while the
couple is enjoying a night out on the town.
</P>
<P>
   Vlade has seen the play three times since it opened last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so exciting to see Ana perform,'' he said. ``I get more
nervous watching her than I do playing basketball. When I'm there,
I'm kind of acting the parts along with her.''
</P>
<P>
   At 7-foot-1, Vlade is probably the last person you'd want to sit
behind in the intimate theater. Sasha Rendulic, the play's
executive producer, chuckled when Vlade's name came up in
conversation. Divac, he said, has brought the concept of the bench
coach to the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time he saw the play (during a limited engagement at
Cal State L.A.) he was very critical,'' Rendulic said. ``He said
something to Ana like, `You didn't look scared enough!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ana Divac, rearing her head back to laugh at the recollection,
said, ``I knew he'd be brutally honest.''
</P>
<P>
   She's on the stage for less than 20 minutes but Ana leaves the
theater after every performance drained. ``It's very hard to feel
these emotions,'' she said. ``They're very painful.''
</P>
<P>
   She summons the strength by visualizing her friends back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my people are in jail and on top of the jail is
this crazy man (Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milosevic),'' she
said. ``It's a helpless feeling. By doing this play, I feel like
I'm doing something for my friends back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because she's straddling two continents, but the
world looks small as a basketball to Ana Divac these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bloodshed back home looks so far away when you're watching
on TV,'' she said. ``But if something like this can happen with my
country, with my generation, it can happen anywhere. That's what
scares me.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ At least 118 people are dead and 172 are missing after
a ferry burned and broke apart in frigid, raging seas off China's
northeastern coast on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Of 312 passengers and crew members who had been aboard the ship,
only 22 survivors had been found as of Thursday night, according to
the New China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   With freezing temperatures continuing in the wind-whipped sea,
there appeared to be little prospect of finding more survivors, but
rescue operations at sea and along the shoreline near the port city
of Yantai, in Shandong Province, continued Friday, the news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   As the burning, listing ship made desperate calls for help
Wednesday evening, 16-foot waves and a blinding snowstorm severely
hampered rescue efforts at sea.
</P>
<P>
   One tugboat came within 35 feet of the ailing ferry, still with
passengers and crew aboard, but in the darkness and heaving waters
it was unable to hook up with the ferry, according to a dramatic
account in Friday morning's Beijing Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 or 30 passengers jumped into the sea to try to reach
life buoys thrown from the tugboat, but only one was pulled to
safety, according to the account. Some of the other survivors swam
the 1 1-2 miles to shore; others washed ashore unconscious. All day
Thursday, as snowstorms continued, a helicopter, dozens of ships
and thousands of soldiers and residents along the shoreline joined
in the search for survivors from the wreck. Friday, the state media
said that 10,000 people had been mobilized for search and rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, the 138-yard-long Dashun, belonged to the Yanda Ferry
Co. in Shandong. It left Yantai on Wednesday afternoon for what is
normally a seven-to-eight-hour journey 100 miles north to the city
of Dalian.
</P>
<P>
   It was forced to turn back because of the extreme conditions,
but around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, flames were discovered on the
second deck, and the ship sent a distress signal, the New China
News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Some four hours later, apparently engulfed by fire, the ship
began drifting. It was not clear from the contradictory accounts in
the state press whether the entire ship sank or some burning
portions remained afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the cause of the fire was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One survivor, a 28-year-old man, told Agence France-Presse, the
French news service, that around 4 p.m. on Wednesday, all the
passengers rushed to the upper deck because of heavy smoke from
below, where some 60 cars were being carried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to jump into the water because the smoke was so
strong it was hard to breathe,'' he said, adding that he and five
other men had jumped at once. He lost track of the others and swam
for an hour, he said, before reaching the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said many bodies had washed ashore, along with a
few people who were found unconscious but still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning's account in the Beijing newspaper described a
heart-rending scene as a tugboat from the Yantai Salvage Bureau
tried to reach the Dashun. The tugboat first approached the ship
after 5:00 p.m., in the dark, the tugboat operator said. ``The deck
was on fire and the ship was inclining to one side,'' the operator
said. ``But we could see passengers moving about inside,'' he said,
as well as 10 crew members working on the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent three hours trying to get close to it,'' another
officer of the tugboat said, ``but the waves were too heavy.'' The
closest the tug got was about 33 feet, he said, but crew members on
the burning ship were unable to catch ropes shot with a rope-gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen such heavy waves in my past 20 years at
sea,'' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly midnight, with the ship beginning to sink, 20 to 30
passengers jumped into the sea to try to reach life buoys thrown
from the tugboat, the operator said. Only a few reached the buoys,
but some of the ropes broke and only one man, a 44-year-old naval
officer, was pulled aboard, the operator said.
</P>
<P>
   According to local news media, this was the second accident in
five weeks for a vessel operated by the Yanda Ferry Co. Last month,
a ship caught fire and sank near Dalian. All but three people were
rescued.
</P>
<P>
   State television Thursday night showed pictures of a beach
littered with fruit and other debris from the ship.

JOHNSON SAYS HE'LL BE OUT FOR 2 WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ When Larry Johnson sat down for a cup of coffee
Thursday morning, the pain in his back shot down into his legs. And
after he sat out another Knicks practice Thursday, Johnson
indicated that the pain of performing that simple task could mean
that his return to the court is still a ways off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're looking around two weeks,'' said Johnson, who on
Wednesday began a scheduled six-day program of steroid treatments
to reduce the pain. ``Me, I'm just going by myself, how I feel.
Last night I sat down at my computer for 30 or 40 minutes and
didn't feel it at all. This morning, I sat down to drink some
coffee and two minutes later I feel it going down my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's injury has been diagnosed as a pinched nerve, rather
than a more serious herniated disk, and the team physician, Dr.
Norman Scott, said on Tuesday that he was optimistic that surgery
would not be necessary. Johnson cannot play while he is being
treated with steroids, and the Knicks announced Thursday that he
would not play on Saturday against Orlando at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   A disk injury sidelined Johnson for 31 games in the 1993-94
season. He avoided surgery then, and he does not want to consider
that option now. ``I'm trying the steroids first,'' he said when
asked about the possibility of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that despite this morning's episode, he felt better
than he had on the Knicks' recently concluded road trip. ``I think
the telling sign is that I'm getting better,'' he said. ``I'm not
in the same pain I was on the West Coast. The doctors said that
before we do anything, we want to get to no pain in the leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby also sat out Thursday's practice with tendinitis in
his left knee. But for the other Knicks the pain is mental. They
spent as much time Thursday repairing wounded egos in the wake of
their embarrassing loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday
night as they did planning for Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't in the locker room for the Clippers game,'' said
Johnson, who left early to have his back examined. ``No one could
be anywhere close to satisfied with that performance. We're not
doing well right now. But one thing we should do is no
finger-pointing, just stick together, and try as much as possible
to listen to coaches, and not just listen, but do.''
</P>
<P>
   That will remain difficult with Johnson hurting, Patrick Ewing
still two to three weeks from returning and Camby slowed. Camby is
listed as day to day; he said he hoped to practice on Friday and
possibly play Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Jeff Van Gundy reiterated Thursday that the team's
work ethic, more than any physical ailments, has caused it to
struggle to a 6-7 record. Van Gundy, who threatened changes after
the loss to the Clippers, said that he was not planning any lineup
or roster changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought that taking one guy out or putting one guy in
would rectify our problems, as a head coach, you'd do that in a
heartbeat,'' Van Gundy said. ``But I don't really see it that way.
I see it more teamwide. But I do know that to win in this league
you need professional, serious, hard-working, team-oriented
players. We have the capabilities of having those type of players.
They did it last year for a stretch. This year and a good part of
last year, we didn't reflect those qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby said of the team's recent funk: ``You don't want to blame
it on injuries. We did have a couple guys out, but that's no
excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule wasn't in our favor,'' Camby added, ``but still,
we can't go out there and dig ourselves a 28-point deficit against
the Clippers. We've got to have some type of pride. It doesn't
matter who's out there. It's not like they're a great team. We
should have still won with guys out. We have to come out at the
start of games and play better basketball.'' &QL;

<P>
   Merchants may be putting up Christmas decorations earlier each
year _ the first Santas and reindeer now emerge closer to Halloween
than to Thanksgiving _ but American shoppers are going in the
opposite direction. They're buying presents later.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the busiest shopping day of the year has been the
Saturday before Christmas, even if it fell as early as Dec. 18, as
it did in 1993. But the pattern was broken last year, with the day
before Christmas, a Thursday, proving busiest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Procrastination is rampant,'' said Sean Healy, a spokesman for
Visa USA, which compiled the statistics and predicts more of the
same this year.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy of last Dec. 24 set a peak for Visa, which recorded
an average of 2,702 transactions a second for the 24 hours. This
year, Visa projects 3,200 to 3,500 transactions a second on Friday,
Dec. 24, with the busiest hour expected to be 2 to 3 p.m. Eastern
time, when the most stores are open across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The busiest day, however, does not always have the biggest
dollar volume, at least not according to Visa's settlement totals,
or the value of its transactions processed by banks. That figure
hit a record $3.3 billion on Monday, Dec. 21, last year, probably
inflated because some smaller banks do not process sales over the
weekend, Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   The peak pace this year will be about five times as fast as the
635 transactions a second recorded on the busiest day in 1991. The
growth reflects increased use of credit cards, instead of cash and
checks.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing won't change, Visa predicted. The slowest day of
the year will continue to be Christmas itself.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House has abandoned efforts to attract
international leaders to next week's World Trade Organization
summit in Seattle, a decision that leaves one of the biggest
international gatherings of recent years at its planned ministerial
level.
</P>
<P>
   However, this failure also deprives President Bill Clinton of an
opportunity to appear in the role of world leader at one of the
last big set piece events of his presidency on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   While the diplomatic significance of this setback is small _ the
WTO meeting was always planned as a ministerial meeting and the
White House began only late in the day to try to make it something
more _ it underlines the diminishing power of a U.S. president as
his second term draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of President Clinton, the seeping away of his power
is compounded by the growing distance between himself and his two
closest lieutenants: his wife and his vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fact of presidential life that senior members of the
administration, however loyal, start to depart in pursuit of their
own interests as their president's time runs out.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, however, Clinton has had to stand back as
first his vice-president and this week his wife stated publicly
that they were putting their own careers above their official
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Vice-President Al Gore has now given two newspaper interviews in
which he has not only distanced himself from the president, but
effectively downgraded his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running for President of this country,'' he told the
Washington Post last weekend, ``is far more important than being
the best vice-president I can possibly be.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose close association with Clinton is widely _ though
perhaps wrongly _ seen as the chief obstacle to his winning the
presidency in a year's time, has increasingly tried to distance
himself from the president.
</P>
<P>
   He told the same Washington Post correspondent that he had
``zero involvement'' with Clinton's controversial decision to grant
clemency to a group of Puerto Rican nationalists, and is now rarely
seen in public side by side with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Gore will accept campaign help from Clinton, however, is
still moot. Having said three months ago that he did not want
Clinton to campaign for him, he then retreated to the point of
suggesting that this was not his position.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to escape the impression that he wanted the money
that Clinton, still the Democratic Party's most effective
fund-raiser, could raise for him, but not the ethical baggage that
inevitably accompanies the president.
</P>
<P>
   With Mrs. Clinton's announcement on Tuesday that she was
``scaling back'' her official duties as first lady in order to
campaign full time for a U.S. Senate seat, Clinton was given formal
notice that he had lost _ at least temporarily _ his most trusted
adviser, and consort, as well.
</P>
<P>
   She will move to the couple's new house at Chappaqua, north of
New York City, as soon as it has been adapted for security, and
launch her official campaign from there.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first time for 80 years that a president has
lived at the White House without a full-time first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clintons insist that they will see each other at weekends _
presenting the arrangement as a ``commuter'' marriage, no different
from that of thousands of American couples separated by their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's office also moved quickly to quash any new
speculation about the state of the marriage. Her spokeswoman,
Marsha Berry, also denied categorically that the Clintons'
daughter, Chelsea, had any plans to interrupt her studies at
Stanford University to stand in for her mother as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a full-time student and will remain one,'' she said
when the question was put.
</P>
<P>
   It remains, however, that President Clinton and his wife have
spent very little time together in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   On their latest foreign travels, they flew out and back
separately, linking up only for a few days in Turkey, Greece and
the weekend meeting in Florence where Mrs. Clinton was a speaker.
Mrs. Clinton returned two days earlier than her husband, in part it
seemed, to stem speculation about her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, still the abjectly contrite spouse, uses
every opportunity to stress his support for his wife's Senate bid,
and is expected to campaign on her behalf. Given the surge in her
popularity when she emerged as a wronged wife any reminder of that
period will probably help rather than hinder her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife and vice-president increasingly absent, though,
Clinton has started to cut a lonely and somewhat sad figure.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, he was reported to have spent an
afternoon playing golf by himself, in the rain. Earlier this week,
there were poignant photographs of him, with Chelsea, in Athens,
visiting an otherwise deserted Parthenon.
</P>
<P>
   At home, not even his dog, Buddy, has been much in evidence of
late.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the questions are being asked: is the presidency a
job that can be done alone? And how will a man who so clearly
thrives on company adjust to his new isolation?
</P>
<P>
   Both he, and America, are about to find out. &QL;

   NEW DELHI _ Experts now agree that the first sunrise of the new
millennium will not be out in the Pacific somewhere, but over a
small tropical island in the far south of the Bay of Bengal, by the
name of Katchal.
</P>
<P>
   This news seems to have come as something of a shock to the
Indian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The new minister of tourism, Uma Bharti, said on Monday that
``elaborate plans were being made to attract people to Katchal
island...which Greenwich Observatory has recognized as being the
first place in the world where the sunrise of the new millennium
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading Delhi travel agents, however, looked blank at mention of
the island's name. ``Where?'' asked one, who had not heard of the
place. ``You might be able to get there,'' said another. ``But I
don't think it's been marketed enough _ and it's too late to market
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts from Greenwich confirm that, if the new millennium
starts at zero hours GMT, the first sunrise of the new millennium
must be where the sun is rising at that precise moment.
</P>
<P>
   This encompasses half of a great circle running from Eastern
Russia through China, across the Bay of Bengal and on towards the
Antarctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   On the passage through the Bay of Bengal it alights, at
precisely the right time, on the island of Katchal, in the Nicobar
chain.
</P>
<P>
   For the truly intrepid, then, Katchal, though entering late in
the race, would seem to be the destination of choice. Travellers
can get most of the way there without much fuss: the round-trip
from Delhi to Port Blair, capital of the Andaman and Nicobar
Islands, with an overnight stop in Calcutta, costs about $800.
</P>
<P>
   From Port Blair to Katchal is some 230 nautical miles, and
although the travel trade disclaims much knowledge of it, India's
director-general of tourism, Ashok Pradha, says ``We have made
arrangements for at least seven ships to sail to Katchal to bring
visitors to have a look at the first sunrise of the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The ships are important because, although visitors will be able
to see Katchal and the sun's rays falling on it, they will not, it
appears, be allowed to disembark.
</P>
<P>
   Katchal is not the classic desert island of cartoons _ it is
more than 20 kilometers (13 miles) in circumference and contains
rubber plantations _ but foreigners are banned from setting foot on
all the Nicobar Islands, for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Catchy name aside, Port Blair, from where the ``seven ships''
will sail, would itself make a distinctively different place to
celebrate the new Millennium _ or at least to wish good riddance to
the one just finished.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal residents of the chain have been decimated by the
usual western menaces of Christianity, syphilis and deforestation.
The eponymous Lt. Blair sailed here in 1777, instructed to set up a
penal colony, but was defeated by disease and lack of food and
water.
</P>
<P>
   On the third attempt, in 1858, the penal colony was established,
and Port Blair's only historical monument is the grim ``Cellular
Jail,'' a classic circular ``panopticon'' (completed in 1905) where
prisoners could be kept under constant surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Indian freedom fighters suffered in its hideous
conditions, and many died. When the Japanese invaded during World
War II they carried on the good work.
</P>
<P>
   Andaman's many tribal peoples offer another diversion, including
the Andamanese, exceptional in that they never discovered
fire-making; and the Jarawa, who sing and dance at each full moon,
and ``in apparent friendliness,'' as a recent guide book puts it,
``fart in the face of the visitors.'' &QL;

   Childhood has become expendable in the remote jungles and coca
tracts of Colombia after four decades of civil war. The army
routinely calls up underage soldiers for active duty, and they
account for nearly 22 percent of the force.
</P>
<P>
   This year an estimated 15,000 teenage troops serve in Colombia's
army, national security units and police force, and most of them
are between the ages of 15 and 17. Many of the enemies they stalk
are children, too.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing paramilitaries call their young fighters ``little
bells'' because, deployed out in front, they tend to draw fire and
warn of guerrilla traps.
</P>
<P>
   Children as young as eight years old have been seen on patrol
with these paras. They witness random torture, farmers being
butchered alive, corpses being mutilated, and families being driven
from their land at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   With at least a million people displaced by the warfare, many
Colombian families rupture.
</P>
<P>
   Marxist rebels term their swarming juveniles ``little bees''
since they can sting before the enemy is even aware of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty percent of some guerrilla units consist of boys and
girls, and if captured, the army often forces them to find and
deactivate the mines they make and deploy for the rebel fighters,
or to act as informants or guides.
</P>
<P>
   Runaways are considered deserters and often are executed on the
spot by the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) or the
ELN (National Liberation Army).
</P>
<P>
   Militia, which train future guerrillas and are targetted by
paramilitary groups, can have as many as 80 percent children. A
high proportion of these youngsters are kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, after an army offensive that killed hundreds of
rebels, officials invited reporters to the battle zone before all
the corpses were whisked away. Among dozens of dead guerrillas on
display were several pubescent boys and a pregnant teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Although peace talks now are underway, FARC rebels refuse to
observe a truce and attacked thirteen villages across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Six policemen were killed last week when young guerrillas
strapped a grenade to a dog and shooed it into a police station in
central Tolima state. Such tactics are like childish pranks with
deadly consequences and retaliation is swift.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of international legislation and a burgeoning peace
movement, there's no sign of curbing Colombia's child soldiers. &QL;

   JOHANNESBURG _ Even before it faces issues like nutrition,
education and unemployment, a newly-born South African child's
greatest challenge is to reach school age without becoming infected
or being directly affected by HIV.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has the fastest growing rates of HIV in the world
and, consequently, the most alarming prognosis for the next
generation. Already 20 percent of the work force is estimated to be
infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   In six years' time there are expected to be one million AIDS
orphans in the country _ children left homeless because they are
HIV positive or parentless because both their mother and father
have died from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are villages outside Durban where you find grannies with
20 or 30 children in their care,'' says Heather Reynolds. When the
granny dies, we have to find another adult to care for children,''
says Mrs. Reynolds who runs an orphanage for 35 children near the
port city of Durban in Kwa Zulu-Natal, the area of South Africa
worst affected by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is referred to as a national emergency. It is already a
national catastrophe'' she says. ``One in five children in this
country is born HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deadly effect of AIDS is capable of obliterating the
benefits of the end of apartheid and replacing them with something
much more ruthless.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS remains taboo-ridden in southern Africa, and is exacerbated
by ignorance. One commonly-held view is that an HIV-positive man
can cure himself by sleeping with a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that it can be treated with a range of herbs, roots
and vegetables, sold for exorbitant prices by traditional healers
and generally only good for alleviating symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government claims that it would take a quarter
of the country's annual health budget to treat HIV-positive people,
including pregnant mothers, with life-prolonging drugs such as AZT.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have shown that pregnant women, given a
three-month course of AZT can be prevented from passing the virus
on to their child.
</P>
<P>
   But the cash-strapped South African government, to save money,
has decided not to treat anyone at all, pregnant or not. It claims
that the reason is that AZT is not safe.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics about child rates of HIV and the number of orphans
are scarce but the trend is sufficiently alarming for British Prime
Minister Tony and Cherie Blair to have ``adopted'' a 7-year-old
orphan, known as ``Mary'' when they were in Cape Town in January.
The child lives in the Nazareth House orphanage, funded by a
religious order in West London. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hailed as the greatest communicator since Ronald
Reagan, President Bill Clinton took to the new media earlier this
month to convey his message, becoming the first U.S. president to
conduct an Internet chat live online.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, formerly a self-proclaimed computer illiterate, has
clearly become aware that next year's election will be the first in
which the Internet is a perceptible force.
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates have their own campaign Web sites; the
publishing millionaire, Steve Forbes, even claimed to have made
history by announcing his presidential bid online.
</P>
<P>
   And as well as getting a candidate's message out, the Web sites
are bringing in both volunteers and cash. Former Senator Bill
Bradley has just passed the $1 million mark in money raised online,
while Senator John McCain has reached $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   With hi-tech tools proving so effective for the candidates,
there is a growing belief in the computer world that it is only a
matter of time before voters demand a piece of the action. If they
can bank, shop and make political donations online, why can they
not also vote online?
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. enters its election year, this question is being
asked with new urgency. A recent survey by the computer company
Dell showed that almost 80 percent of regular Internet users wanted
to be able to vote online.
</P>
<P>
   Voting came second only to renewing their driving licenses as
the function they would most like to perform on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this reflects the inconvenience of voting in the U.S.,
with polling stations that often can be reached only by car and
queues to use clumsy voting machines.
</P>
<P>
   Long working hours and commutes are also blamed, along with
general political apathy, for a decline in voting that is little
short of catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, the turnout for Congressional elections was
only 36 percent nationwide, meaning that 120 million potential
votes were not cast. In the 1996 presidential election, the turnout
was under 50 percent, compared with 63 percent in 1960. The most
reluctant voters are the 18- to 24-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many groups trying to reverse the decline, several
advocate the introduction of Internet voting, and a number of
states, including Florida, Louisiana, Arizona and California, are
considering limited trials.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, responsible for tens of thousands of troops
abroad, has initiated a pilot project to test online voting as a
replacement for postal votes. Volunteers are being recruited from
five states.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists, of whom Professor Larry Sabato, a political scientist
at the University of Virginia, is one, believes that Internet
voting is simply democracy by other means. It has the potential, he
says, ``to expand our traditional definition and understanding of
the American town square.''
</P>
<P>
   But although Arizona has broached limited Internet voting in its
presidential primary next spring, there is no real prospect that it
will be an option when Americans go to vote for a new president
next November.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it likely that voters will be able to cast their ballot
from their home desktop any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   An unspoken assumption is that there would be an interim stage
during which voters would find a computer in place of the familiar
machine inside the voting booth. This could speed up the procedure
for the computer literate, but could also produce bottlenecks if
even a few were flummoxed by the process.
</P>
<P>
   Another fear is that electronic voting would favor those with
computers _ that is, the wealthier and better educated. However,
not everyone accepts that the ``digital divide'' would keep the
computer have-nots from voting: computer ownership is more diffuse
than often believed.
</P>
<P>
   Online voting opens the possibility of a 24-hour voting day.
Computer terminals in libraries and cybercafes could be brought
into service for those without their own machines, and internet
voting might even appeal to those elusive 18- to 24- year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   That presupposes, of course, that it is the hassle of voting
that keeps them at home, rather than the nature of politics or the
calibre of the candidates. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hailed as the greatest communicator since Ronald
Reagan, President Bill Clinton took to the new media earlier this
month to convey his message, becoming the first U.S. president to
conduct an Internet chat live online.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, formerly a self-proclaimed computer illiterate, has
clearly become aware that next year's election will be the first in
which the Internet is a perceptible force.
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates have their own campaign Web sites; the
publishing millionaire, Steve Forbes, even claimed to have made
history by announcing his presidential bid online.
</P>
<P>
   And as well as getting a candidate's message out, the Web sites
are bringing in both volunteers and cash. Former Senator Bill
Bradley has just passed the $1 million mark in money raised online,
while Senator John McCain has reached $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   With hi-tech tools proving so effective for the candidates,
there is a growing belief in the computer world that it is only a
matter of time before voters demand a piece of the action. If they
can bank, shop and make political donations online, why can they
not also vote online?
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. enters its election year, this question is being
asked with new urgency. A recent survey by the computer company
Dell showed that almost 80 percent of regular Internet users wanted
to be able to vote online.
</P>
<P>
   Voting came second only to renewing their driving licenses as
the function they would most like to perform on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this reflects the inconvenience of voting in the U.S.,
with polling stations that often can be reached only by car and
queues to use clumsy voting machines.
</P>
<P>
   Long working hours and commutes are also blamed, along with
general political apathy, for a decline in voting that is little
short of catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, the turnout for Congressional elections was
only 36 percent nationwide, meaning that 120 million potential
votes were not cast. In the 1996 presidential election, the turnout
was under 50 percent, compared with 63 percent in 1960. The most
reluctant voters are the 18- to 24-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many groups trying to reverse the decline, several
advocate the introduction of Internet voting, and a number of
states, including Florida, Louisiana, Arizona and California, are
considering limited trials.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, responsible for tens of thousands of troops
abroad, has initiated a pilot project to test online voting as a
replacement for postal votes. Volunteers are being recruited from
five states.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists, of whom Professor Larry Sabato, a political scientist
at the University of Virginia, is one, believes that Internet
voting is simply democracy by other means. It has the potential, he
says, ``to expand our traditional definition and understanding of
the American town square.''
</P>
<P>
   But although Arizona has broached limited Internet voting in its
presidential primary next spring, there is no real prospect that it
will be an option when Americans go to vote for a new president
next November.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it likely that voters will be able to cast their ballot
from their home desktop any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   An unspoken assumption is that there would be an interim stage
during which voters would find a computer in place of the familiar
machine inside the voting booth. This could speed up the procedure
for the computer literate, but could also produce bottlenecks if
even a few were flummoxed by the process.
</P>
<P>
   Another fear is that electronic voting would favor those with
computers _ that is, the wealthier and better educated. However,
not everyone accepts that the ``digital divide'' would keep the
computer have-nots from voting: computer ownership is more diffuse
than often believed.
</P>
<P>
   Online voting opens the possibility of a 24-hour voting day.
Computer terminals in libraries and cybercafes could be brought
into service for those without their own machines, and internet
voting might even appeal to those elusive 18- to 24- year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   That presupposes, of course, that it is the hassle of voting
that keeps them at home, rather than the nature of politics or the
calibre of the candidates. &QL;

   Where would you choose to spend an exotic vacation? Sunbathing
on a tropical beach with endless white sands fringed with palm
trees? Or maybe you'd appreciate something a little more cultural,
a mountain trek and a tour of ancient ruins and remote villages?
That's the sort of choice we're used to making.
</P>
<P>
   But what if that paradise beach happens to be just miles from an
entrenched civil war? Or an exotic island's business interests are
controlled by a military regime?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most unpalatable regimes in the world are to be
found in countries desperate to attract tourists, and they are
keener than ever to persuade us that they have some of the most
desirable vacation destinations available.
</P>
<P>
   Take Burma, for example. Next month it will be promoting itself
as an ideal place for an exotic break when it takes a stand at the
World Travel Market in London's Earls Court. There will be no
mention of its record of oppressing human rights and its lack of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Burma is becoming adept at putting a gloss on its image:
when it freed human-rights activist Rachel Goldwyn earlier this
month, after she had served less than two months of a seven-year
sentence for singing a pro-democracy protest song, the British
woman was treated as a ``guest'' of the military, heading ``up
country'' for a couple of days sightseeing on an approved tour
before flying home.
</P>
<P>
   Burma will be in good company at the World Travel Market. There
will also be displays by Indonesia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sixth leading international tourist destination, China
will be awarded the 1999 World Tourism Award in recognition of the
``outstanding impact of travel and tourism in generating employment
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   But does it matter if we vacation in such countries? Tourism
Concern, which campaigns for responsible tourism, says it does.
According to its director, Patricia Barnett, visiting such a
country condones its regime, while a boycott would make an
oppressive government realize that not everyone in the West is
willing to turn a blind eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need to consider why you're going to Bali,'' she
says, ``and to think incredibly hard about why you feel the need to
have a holiday in a country deeply embedded in civil strife.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Guild of Travel Writers has taken a similar stance
and, for the first time in its history, has urged tourists and tour
operators to boycott Indonesia until peace is restored in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual tourists and tour operators have got to examine
their consciences,'' said Guild vice-chairman Peter Lilley. ``It is
all too easy to stand by and convince oneself that the matter does
not concern you _ or that there is nothing you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   But others in the tourism business disagree. Tony Champion,
managing director of Magic of the Orient, which features Burma and
Indonesia in its brochures, feels that it's not up to business to
draw a moral line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to keep the doors open and leave the final
decision to the client. It's very difficult because almost every
country has a human-rights record, including our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tour companies also argue that boycotts can do more harm
than good because they affect local people.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Carlos Bellos, head of the Catholic Church in Indonesia,
has reportedly called for a tourism boycott but with the business
worth billions of dollars to the country, thousands of ordinary
Indonesians depend on tourism for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   David Abram, author of the ``Rough Guide to Goa,'' says, ``If
people don't go abroad who's really losing out? It's the poorer
people _ the local hoteliers, the women who rent out the rooms _
they're the ones who will be most affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked those women they'd say tourism is a good thing
that helps them to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   As global tourism proliferates, the lines become ever murkier.
Should we object to lazing on Turkey's beaches when we consider
their treatment of the Kurds?
</P>
<P>
   What about a week in Moscow now that the Russians are
systematically destroying Chechen villages?
</P>
<P>
   And what about France when they were nuclear testing at Muraroa
atoll?
</P>
<P>
   To muddy the moral maze yet further, enter Libya and Iran, now
respectable vacation destinations. After the Lockerbie bombing
suspects were handed over for trial in the Netherlands earlier this
year, a new Mediterranean resort suddenly appeared in the global
tourist marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Explore Worldwide is planning to move into Libya and British
Airways now offers two flights a week, rising to three during the
summer. It's only a matter of time before Tripoli is building
concrete hotels while its souks are overrun with travel guides and
American Express is common currency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gloss of a European resort, Patricia Barnett argues
that tourists should scratch the surface before visiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Libya is no different to Bali or China _ you have to make a
considered decision about an environment that is perhaps not as
trouble-free as you'd like to believe.'' &QL;

   ASSISI-BASILICA (Assisi, Italy) _ When a powerful earthquake
devastated the vaulted ceiling of the Basilica of St. Francis of
Assisi two years ago, the damage to priceless 13th- and
14th-century frescos was so devastating that it overshadowed the
loss of 11 lives and many thousands of homes. On Sunday, the
basilica, one of the most revered shrines of the Roman Catholic
Church, will be fully reopened to the public. The extraordinary
restoration of the early Renaissance masterpiece was so speedy and

   CHICAGO-LESSON-PLANS (Chicago) _ Though almost every American
school district has begun, in just the last three years, to check
student progress against specified academic standards, the nation's
third largest district has gone a giant step further this year:
supplying every teacher with a virtual script, a detailed,
day-by-day outline of what he or she should be teaching _ and when
_ in the language arts, mathematics, science and social studies.
The standardized lesson plans, which were drafted over two years by
a committee of 100 teachers, are optional. But central
administrators, most notably the system's chief executive, Paul
Vallas, have made clear that all teachers should draw on the
lessons in some way _ and many apparently are. By Jacques

   APPLES-CHARLESTON (Charleston, S.C.) _ You can't say it about
many cities, but you can say it about this one: One man changed its
destiny. His name is Joseph P. Riley Jr. He is Charleston's mayor.
He halted its long decline, which lasted for a hundred years after
the Civil War, turning it from a proud but rotting relic into a
model modern city. Riley has had help, of course: from a business
community galvanized into action when the 95-year-old Charleston
Naval Base was closed in 1996; from a devoted band of
preservationists determined to restore the beauties of antebellum
Charleston; from an unconventional police chief, Reuben Greenberg,
a black Jew with two degrees from Berkeley whose Deep South brand
of tough love has slashed the crime rate and forged better race
relations; and from Gian Carlo Menotti, who rejuvenated the city's
cultural life when he established an American version of his
Spoleto festival here. The mayor has also been helped a lot by
history. Charleston is steeped in it, and tourists flock here to
trace its footprints in the jasmine-scented streets and
aristocratic houses. By R.W. Apple Jr.

</P>
<P>
   OFF-BROADWAY (New York) _ Acting awards may be self-indulgent
and ever so tacky. But as long as we're stuck with them, why
shouldn't there be a high-powered set of them for Off Broadway?
Within the theater industry, the Obies, administered by The Village
Voice, have considerable prestige, and the Drama Desks, parceled
out to actors and productions on Broadway and off, certainly merit
mention in Playbill bios. Yet no one has devised the widely
recognizable acting prizes that Off Broadway has so abundantly
earned. I raise the issue (and not for the first time) not so much
to encourage the further glitzing of New York's serious theater as
to point out that when one has a hankering for great performances,
more often than not the first places to look for satisfaction these
days are the city's smaller stages. A critic's notebook by Peter
Marks.

SATISFYING A BASIC DRIVE: I AM, THEREFORE I SHOP  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STACY KRAVETZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an era when advice spills forth on every
subject, I occasionally do the unthinkable when it comes to
shopping: I go by instinct.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies, I flout all the advice promoting sober,
intelligent buying. That's because shopping is often not
utilitarian. It can be a way to channel hidden worries, to work
through issues and to end up with a trinket commemorating the
process. Know thy inner shopper, know thyself.
</P>
<P>
   When I walked onto the lot of a Saab dealership recently, I
understood the tenets of wise car buying: research the Blue Book
value of your trade-in, compare prices at several dealerships and
negotiate on price, not monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, I understood why the car was an antidote to
everything else in my life at that moment. It was three weeks
before my wedding _ normally not the best time to consider a big
purchase _ which gave this shopping trip special significance.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was that I wasn't thinking about cars at all. My mind
was in the wedding zone. I was wavering between blithe acceptance
of the end of my singlehood, holy terror over the potential loss of
self and great enthusiasm for the honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   All feelings of love and passion aside, planning a wedding had
been a commitmentfest, one focused on committing to the perfect
flowers, to registry lists of dishes and nonstick cookware, to a
dress that would appear in faded pictures for my
great-grandchildren to see. In short, committing to things. Each
choice had been researched, and frighteningly by-the-book. I'd
become ponderously responsible.
</P>
<P>
   So when I saw in the newspaper what seemed a good lease deal on
a new Saab convertible, I decided that three weeks before my
wedding was a marvelously good time to shop for an expensive car.
</P>
<P>
   I would trade in my 1993 Honda with extremely low mileage and
lease the Saab for three years. I'd barely drive it, then return it
in exchange for ... nothing.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, I was a car dealer's dream. I didn't want to
comparison-shop, I didn't want to argue for higher value for my
trade-in, and I didn't want to quibble over lease payments. I just
wanted spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   The professional advice-givers were apoplectic at the thought.
Buying a car ``is not and cannot be a whimsical thing unless you
just like throwing money away,'' said Deanna Sclar, author of
``Buying a Car for Dummies'' (IDG Books). ``Just taking a car out
for a drive and saying, `Gee, this feels good' is not enough,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   What about my need to do something daring? Charles Martin, a
clinical psychologist in Knoxville, Tenn., conceded that there were
times when an act of whimsy was appropriate. ``If I had someone in
my office who was overly obsessional,'' he said, ``it might be very
good for them to go out and buy something impulsively _ but it
ought to be a sweater, not a $20,000 automobile.''
</P>
<P>
   For a mad, mad, mad, mad world, everyone had become awfully
sensible.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that shopping is less about judiciously filling a
need than about satisfying one of our basic drives. Yes, the need
to shop is a drive. It is the desire to search boldly for a thing,
substituting it for a larger issue we're trying to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing upon impulse and shopping with gusto satisfies the urge,
partly because it is a distraction, and partly because it promises
the instant gratification that's hard to come by when we're working
through a tough issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some people need a slice of chocolate cake to curb their
anxiety. Others need a good shopping expedition.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, my anxiety was big, so my shopping trip had to be
bigger. If I could contemplate driving off the lot in a $43,000 car
with a tan interior and a six-CD changer, I could overcome rational
decision-making and prove I still had a wild streak.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. I came, I shopped, I conquered. I didn't buy, but
just knowing that I could buy was satisfaction enough. I had
learned something about myself.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before my wedding, I finally understood, was not the
time to buy a car. But it definitely was the time to shop for one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on to life's bigger challenges, and I have no doubt that
there are many. Relatives are already asking when I'm going to have
children. The mere thought sends me onto a whole new plane of
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be shopping for a small railroad to deal with that one.

LEARNING THE PRICE OF LUNCH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (af)  
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time it happened, my 12-year-old daughter, Marian, hid
the bill in her room. It scared her, and I think she hoped it would
just go away. The second time, she left the bill in resignation on
the dining room table, where I couldn't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Marian had fallen for two tantalizing offers. One was a
collection of books, all for only $5, and the other for a free copy
of a magazine for teenagers. Except they were both subscription
come-ons. Within weeks, she received bills totaling about $35. This
for a girl with a weekly allowance of $4.
</P>
<P>
   About $13 billion a year is spent on marketing to children, $1
billion of it in direct marketing. Despite industry guidelines that
urge companies not to pitch directly to children, they are targets
nonetheless. My children also get mailings offering credit cards
and long-distance phone service. They even get calls from
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If children are spending money and leave a record, they will
be marketed to,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the
Consumer Federation of America. ``The problem is they are
inexperienced buyers and are not always aware of what they are
signing or verbally approving.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kamins, associate professor of marketing at the
University of Southern California, can speak from experience about
marketers' overzealousness. His son Joshua, 9, recently received a
magazine offer directly. ``It was addressed to Joshua, not to me,''
Kamins said. ``I was angry that he was petitioned to subscribe when
he didn't understand the consequences. He thought they were going
to send it to him and he wouldn't have to pay anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are more open than adults. They don't have the defensive
techniques against marketing scams. We get the phone calls and we
hang up. Kids get them and they think, `Hey, this sounds good.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission announced rules last month that
limit marketing directly to children over the Internet. ``The
purpose of the new rules was to empower parents to control these
kinds of solicitations,'' said Jodie Z. Bernstein, director of the
commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
</P>
<P>
   No such regulations govern the older technology of direct mail,
which Ms. Bernstein said was self-regulated through the Direct
Marketing Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The association urges members who want to market to children to
address their pitches to the parents, and to include statements
advising children to consult with mom and dad. Stephen Altobelli, a
spokesman for the group, said the marketers assumed that children
are talking with parents about these offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sensitive that marketing to children must be done more
sensitively than what is done for adults,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope that parents look at the mail before the
children do.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not always possible, however, especially if both parents
work. I never get first crack at the mail, and ever since Grandma
starting sticking dollar bills in greeting cards, my children grab
the mail as soon as they get home from school. And at a certain
age, most children, including mine, stop seeking advice because
they think they know everything.
</P>
<P>
   There is a safety net, Ms. Bernstein said. If children up to 16
or 18 do buy the product, they don't have to pay for it. The age
limit varies state by state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't contract under those circumstances,'' she said.
``They aren't liable for the bill and neither are their parents.''
But she feels that companies are focusing on children because they
expect that the parents will give in and pay.
</P>
<P>
   Kamins, after talking with Joshua about the lures of marketing,
ended up subscribing to the magazine anyway. I had a similar talk
with my daughter, repeating the adage, ``If it sounds too good to
be true, it probably is,'' but I declined to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Kamins said the best defense was simply to educate your child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to explain to the kids that they are promotions to sell
products and explain what the marketing world is all about,'' he
said. ``So the next time they are cognizant of it. Parents need to
explain that there is no such thing as a free lunch in this
world.''

THE STRAIGHT SCOOP ON NCAA HOOPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's that time again.
</P>
<P>
   Four months and 300 teams in 1,000 words ...
</P>
<P>
   Who's headed to Indianapolis?
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, Michigan State and Ohio State will learn that even
with their cores intact, it's harder the second time around _ just
ask Stanford, which lost in the second round last year despite
returning five starters from its 1998 Final Four team.
</P>
<P>
   That said, here are this season's Final Four: Temple, which
gives coach John Chaney a long-overdue reward; North Carolina,
whose center, Brendan Hayward, will emerge as the best big man in
the land; Kansas, whose point guard, Jeff Boschee, came of age last
year against Kentucky; and Auburn, which lost in the Sweet 16 and
has the motivation UConn, Michigan State and Ohio State lack.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the best players?
</P>
<P>
   UCLA fans get to see one when DePaul guard Quentin Richardson
comes to Pauley Pavilion on Dec. 18. The short list also includes
Auburn forward Chris Porter, Texas center Chris Mihm, Maryland
forward Terence Morris _ possibly the first pick in the draft _ and
Ohio State guard Scoonie Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Second five: Michigan State guard Mateen Cleaves (out until
January with a broken foot), Utah forward Hanno Mottola (out
several weeks with a bad knee), Cincinnati center Kenyon Martin,
Duke forward Shane Battier and Fresno State wing man Courtney
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the best newcomers?
</P>
<P>
   Four to remember: Cincinnati freshman guard DerMarr Johnson, a
Parade All-American last year; Duke freshman guard Jason Williams,
who's as talented as Bobby Hurley and William Avery; Connecticut
sophomore forward Ajou Deng, who redshirted last year, and Illinois
transfer forward Marcus Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Which teams are the most improved?
</P>
<P>
   Illinois welcomes two gifted newcomers: Griffin, from Lincoln
JC, and redshirt freshman guard Frank Williams. Add sophomore Cory
Bradford, plus coach Lon Kruger, a master tactician, and the Illini
will challenge for the Big Ten title after finishing 14-18 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame, 14-16 last year, has just one top player, big man
Troy Murphy. But the Irish added coach Matt Doherty, who played for
Dean Smith, coached for Roy Williams and is ready to energize the
long-struggling program.
</P>
<P>
   DePaul, 18-13 last year, is ready for its first NCAA Tournament
since 1992. Even without injured forward Lance Williams, the Blue
Demons have Richardson, forward Bobby Simmons and seven-foot
freshman Steven Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The games to watch:
</P>
<P>
   Once considered Bob Knight's successor, Indiana legend Steve
Alford returns to Bloomington _ as Iowa's coach _ on Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Two of 1999's best battle Feb. 5 in East Lansing when
Connecticut visits Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern Conference bragging rights _ and perhaps a No.1
seed _ will be at stake Feb. 27 when Florida hosts Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   By the time mighty North Carolina visits reloading Duke in the
March 4 season finale, the Blue Devils' sensational freshmen will
be well-seasoned.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't won anything yet:
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga, Florida and Cincinnati are popular preseason picks. But
in each case, believe it when you see it. The Zags will miss coach
Dan Monson and speedy point guard Quentin Hall; Florida must learn
to deal with expectations _ not to mention a tough conference _ and
Cincinnati, for all its talent, has underperformed in the
Tournament recently.
</P>
<P>
   The young blood:
</P>
<P>
   Justified or not, watch for a slew of young coaches to hog the
headlines: Iowa's Alford, Florida's Billy Donovan, Missouri's Quin
Snyder, Seton Hall's Tommy Amaker and Appalachian State's Buzz
Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   One who doesn't get the pub but should: Colorado State's Ritchie
McKay.
</P>
<P>
   And an old dog:
</P>
<P>
   New Georgia coach Jim Harrick has one starter returning from a
15-15 team that lost its best player, Jumaine Jones, to the NBA.
Harrick's also stuck in the brutal SEC East with Florida, Kentucky
and Tennessee. He'll have at least one happy moment: Jan. 15, when
the Bulldogs play Alabama, coached by Harrick's close friend (and
former UCLA assistant) Mark Gottfried.
</P>
<P>
   Who wins the Pacific-10?
</P>
<P>
   It's a two-team battle, Arizona and Stanford. The Wildcats have
new players at point guard (freshman Jason Gardner) and center
(enigmatic transfer Loren Woods) and no seniors _ a tough
combination for winning on the road. Stanford has a fabulous
frontline (if Jason Collins stays healthy), but point guard Mike
McDonald is unproven. UCLA is headed for third, maybe fourth,
unless it discovers discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise team to watch: Cal. The guess here is that coach Ben
Braun does better with unknown underclassmen than he did with the
wild seniors last year.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the Pac-10's best players?
</P>
<P>
   Arizona sophomore forward Michael Wright, USC junior forward
Brian Scalabrine, Stanford senior forward Mark Madsen, UCLA forward
Jerome Moiso and Cal junior forward Sean Lampley. Until Collins,
Woods and UCLA's Dan Gadzuric prove otherwise, it's a forward's
league.
</P>
<P>
   Second five: UCLA guard Earl Watson, Oregon State guard Deaundra
Tanner, Arizona State guard Eddie House, Oregon's Alex Scales, and
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Most athletic player: Oregon guard Freddie Jones, the league's
best athlete and perhaps its best NBA prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the Pac-10's top freshmen?
</P>
<P>
   Stanford guard Casey Jacobsen and Arizona guard Gilbert Arenas
have three things in common: they're among the league's best
rookies, they're both from Southern California and neither was
recruited by UCLA. But the Bruins have a fabulous freshman
themselves in forward Jason Kapono. And don't forget Arizona's
Gardner, Stanford center Curtis Borchardt and Oregon State's Brian
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Which players could alter the Pac-10 race?
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's backcourt can play with anybody, but unless transfer
forward Julius Hicks develops, the Ducks are destined for fourth.
Stanford's fate depends on wing men Ryan Mendez and David Moseley,
who must keep defenses honest with perimeter scoring. USC, so
scattered in the past, needs point guard Brandon Granville to
provide stability and leadership. UCLA, which lacks frontcourt
depth, needs Gadzuric to play through painful tendinitis. If Woods
plays to his potential, Arizona's a Final Four contender. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PAC-10 PECKING ORDER &QL; 
A look at the league race according to Daily News college
basketball writer Jon Wilner.
</P>
<P>
   1.Arizona _ Wildcats have enough talent (and coaching) to win
five or six on the road, and they won't lose at home. Watch frosh
point guard Jason Gardner. &QL; 
2. Stanford _ Perimeter scoring is the only question because the
Cardinal is loaded up front with Mark Madsen and the Collins twins.
Watch frosh guard Casey Jacobsen. &QL; 
3. UCLA _ There's tons of talent and almost as many questions. Do
the Bruins have the discipline to win on the road? That's the key
to the league title. Watch soph forward Jerome Moiso. &QL; 
4. Oregon _ Great backcourt, questionable frontcourt size and
talent. Plus, Ducks must learn to win close games. Watch soph guard
Freddie Jones. &QL; 
5. USC _ If forward Brian Scalabrine becomes an elite player,
Trojans could make the NCAAs. Otherwise, they're scattered as ever.
Watch junior guard Jeff Trepagnier. &QL; 
6. Oregon State _ Can Beavers continue their ascent? To do it, they
must deal with expectations for the first time since the Gary
Payton era. Watch junior center Jason Heide. &QL; 
7. Cal _ Will coach Ben Braun do more with less? Bears playing on
campus (new Haas Pavilion) for first time in several years. Watch
junior forward Sean Lampley. &QL; 
8. Arizona State _ Transition season as second-year coach Rob
Evans' recruits find their way. Sun Devils have guard Eddie House
for instant offense. Watch soph forward Awvee Storey. &QL; 
9. Washington _ Post-Todd MacCulloch begins with six-game trip for
Huskies, who are no longer a program on the rise. Watch junior
guard Michael Johnson. &QL; 
10. Washington State _ Come March, rookie coach Paul Graham might
wish he was back at Oklahoma State. Cougs were crushed by Nevada
last week. Watch soph guard Mike Bush.

SCHEDULE FAVORS KINGS OVER NEXT TWO WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although the season is still young, the Los
Angeles Kings have a good chance to maintain their top spot in the
NHL despite injuries to four of their front-line players.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 15 days, the only road game the Kings will play is
Dec. 3 in Anaheim. And it doesn't hurt that the San Jose Sharks,
tied with the Kings for the league lead with 31 points heading into
Saturday's showdown at the Staples Center, are home just once in
the next five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very focused on the road and done well there,''
said Kings coach Andy Murray, whose club is 8-3-2 away from home
after Wednesday 3-2 overtime loss at Dallas. ``But there is no
substitute for sleeping in your own bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never look down the road. The most important game of the
season is the next game on the schedule. We don't look at the
injuries, we just take what we have, prepare, and expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's game was their 19th straight without a victory
against Dallas. Including a 4-3 victory on Oct. 24, the Kings have
won four straight at home against the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   That game was critical to the Kings early season success because
it came just two nights after the year's most embarrassing loss, a
6-3 crusher to the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than falling apart after blowing a 3-1 lead and allowing
five straight goals, the Kings regrouped. They were 3-0 at home
last year against San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   What's in store: One of the Kings' wins last year over the
Sharks was a shutout by goalie Jamie Storr, whose availability for
Saturday's game is still doubtful because of a badly strained right
groin muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Cousineau, called up from minor league Long Beach three
weeks ago when Stephane Fiset was lost with a bruised right hand,
is expected to get the start.
</P>
<P>
   Storr, injured in the first period of Tuesday's 6-2 victory at
Colorado, worked out Thursday at the Forum, but the club will know
more today when Storr practices at its Iceoplex training center.
</P>
<P>
   A goal to shoot for: Despite an 0-for-28 slump on the power
play, the Kings lead the NHL with 78 goals. San Jose is second with
76. The Sharks lost their last game in overtime against resurging
Montreal, their first home game after a seven-game, 11-day trip.
After a nine-game winless string, the Canadiens swept the Kings,
Mighty Ducks and Sharks during a three-game California swing.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday'shout Bryan Marchment, Jeff Norton, Marcus Ragnarsson
and Mike Rathje. Marchment and Norton are back and Ragnarsson
returned Tuesday against Montreal, but Rathje is still a few games
away.

PAYROLL SYSTEM CRITICIZED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: This is a copyrighted story.) &HT;    By GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
 &UR;
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ An internal investigation of Los Angeles
Unified's $5 billion payroll found waste, fraud and other abuses
including ``ghost'' employees illegally drawing pay checks, the Los
Angeles Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Following a series of audits and investigations into the payroll
system, the school district's chief investigator, Don Mullinax,
fired off a confidential memorandum recommending an immediate
review of the payroll department.
</P>
<P>
   If changes aren't made quickly, Mullinax, a former chief
investigator for the U.S. Senate, concluded ``more and more dollars
will be wasted and taken away from classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The widespread problems have prompted the district's incoming
superintendent, Ramon C. Cortines, and Chief Operating Officer
Howard Miller to launch a ``discreet'' search for a new chief
financial officer, board members said.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax's probe revealed employees often do not sign in or out
as required on their time cards and take excessive overtime ``with
little, if any, evidence of approval.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also found administrators carelessly gave
payroll access codes to subordinates, improperly changed time card
entries regularly and that checks were issued to nonexistent
employees without being detected.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the confidential Nov. 18 memorandum to Miller, he denounced
the district's payroll system as ``the most antiquated that I have
ever seen in the public sector. ... The school district's current
payroll system creates tremendous opportunities for employees to
participate in improper activities.''
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the nation's second largest school system's
$7.4 billion budget is devoted to payroll. During the last two
fiscal years, the district paid out $86 million in overtime,
accounting for 1.6 percent of overall payroll, school officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Tokofsky said the findings reinforce the
board's desire to overhaul the district's financial operations
within the next four to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky blamed outdated systems ``that should have been
discarded in the 1950s'' and poor employee training for the
majority of the abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are vast areas without checks and balances, internal
controls or scrutiny that would prevent waste, fraud and abuse,''
Tokofsky said. ``It is a significant problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Miller and Cortines have begun a search for a new chief
financial officer to replace Olonzo Woodfin, whose contract expires
in June. Another board member and several district officials
confirmed there have been preliminary discussions about hiring a
new chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines and Miller did not respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Woodfin declined to comment, saying he was not aware that his
position was in jeopardy until being contacted by the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to go over the findings and determine essentially what
information Mr. Mullinax is talking about,'' Woodfin said.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-year veteran of the school district, Woodfin was promoted
to chief financial officer last June. Woodfin had been acting chief
financial officer since Henry Jones stepped down early last year.
</P>
<P>
   The district conducted a national search to fill the post,
paying close to $25,000 to canvass the country for candidates. Upon
naming Woodfin to the $141,109 post, then Chief Administrative
Officer David Koch lauded the district veteran for his
``integrity'' and ``in-depth knowledge of the district.''
</P>
<P>
   The reorganized school board voted unanimously last month to buy
out Koch's contract and force Superintendent Ruben Zacarias into
early retirement. Cortines will become interim superintendent upon
Zacarias' exit on Jan. 15. In the meantime, Cortines has been
serving as an ``adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   The personnel moves were prompted in large part by a scathing
audit of the Belmont Learning Center. The audit, conducted by
Mullinax, cited Koch and Zacarias on a list of employees who failed
to adequately supervise the development of the Belmont Learning
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont, the nation's costliest high school, sits partially
completed downtown atop an oil field, which seeps potentially
deadly and explosive gases. It remains unclear whether the school
will be completed.
</P>
<P>
   During a Nov. 10 interview with Daily News editors and
reporters, Cortines pledged to cut jobs in ``almost every
administrative area'' of the school district during the next year.
</P>
<P>
   While Cortines did not specify which posts would be cut, he
voiced frustration with the staff's inability to give him a bottom
line on the district's spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many layers,'' Cortines said, ``and no one is
really responsible for anything.''

FREE TRADE'S COST FOR LABOR, ENVIRONMENT
</HEADLINE>
 OF SERIES; W/SIDEBARS)   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  International trade negotiations have long been about economics
alone _ the pursuit of dollars, euros and yen. But there's brave
new talk in the air about using trade law to promote labor rights
and protect the environment.
<P>
   So far, it's just talk, but governments small and large are
getting spooked. So spooked, in fact, that the issues have become
major sticking points prior to the World Trade Organization summit
meeting in Seattle next week.
</P>
<P>
   With dark humor, WTO Director-General Mike Moore recently
referred to the diplomatic standoff as ``desperate but not
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the problem, liberal activists argue, is that the
fierce competition of international trade is dragging all nations'
labor and environmental standards down toward a lowest common
denominator of rock-bottom wages and ecological destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the WTO absolutely must address the rights of
workers rather than just the interests of multinational
corporations,'' said Pharis Harvey, executive director of the
International Labor Rights Fund, a Washington think tank that has
been a key player in talks among unions and activists to create an
enforcement strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to create such a policy will require a serious effort on
all sides, not just government rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is trying to split the difference
between opposing sides. As a result, the positions on labor and the
environment that U.S. negotiators are bringing to Seattle are
angering not only many foreign nations but also some of Vice
President Al Gore's staunchest backers and are threatening to hurt
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very deep division in the (Democratic) Party over
trade,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at the grassroots level are concerned. Gore's campaign
will get damaged if the administration doesn't manage this well.''
</P>
<P>
   The sound and fury started in a relatively innocuous way earlier
this year, when President Clinton began talking about ``putting a
human face on the global economy.'' Then, at pre-summit meetings in
Geneva, his negotiators proposed that the WTO carry out studies on
how trade affects labor rights and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton's stance merely fulfills a mandate in the 1994
trade law that approved U.S. entry into the WTO. It fell far short
of demands from unions and environmental groups, which are calling
for enforceable labor standards and strong environmental
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how watered down Clinton's proposals are, there's
almost no chance they will be adopted at next week's summit.
</P>
<P>
   Developing nations adamantly oppose his call for studies, saying
it eventually would lead to the imposition of global standards.
These nations say such standards would undermine their ability to
compete and would leave them open to punitive trade sanctions
levied by the United States and other rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trade-labor issue will not rear its head again,'' vowed
Munir Akram, Pakistan's representative to the WTO, as battle lines
were being drawn during negotiations earlier this month. ``Any
discussion of this will wreck the Seattle meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. business leaders also oppose the administration's
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor and the environment are simply inappropriate themes for
the WTO,'' said Craig Johnstone, senior vice president for
international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``The WTO
should not be sacrificed ... to benefit the vice president's
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's decision to raise labor and environmental issues
at the WTO has been germinating for years in the hothouse of U.S.
trade politics.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1993 congressional battle over the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which Clinton won despite tough opposition from
labor unions and a coalition of liberal and conservative
legislators, resistance to his trade policies has been growing. The
opposition culminated in the defeat of ``fast-track'' trade
negotiating authority in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As criticism of free trade continued to grow, the White House
calculated that in order to push any future WTO agreements through
Congress, unions and environmentalists had to be mollified by at
least a symbolic acknowledgment of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration's rhetoric has certainly changed on trade
policy, but I don't know if the policy has,'' said Pelosi. ``If we
don't understand the connection between commerce and the
environment and labor, we're on the wrong side of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Pelosi and 112 other congressional Democrats sent
Clinton a letter calling for a tougher stand at the WTO, including
the renegotiation of WTO agreements to ``explicitly enable'' the
United States and other countries to ban imports made with child
and forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO and its global counterpart, the 143-nation
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, propose that the
WTO's muscle _ its ability to levy economic sanctions on violators
and to obligate changes in domestic laws _ be extended to enforce
the so-called core conventions set by the International Labor
Organization, a U.N.-linked agency that has no enforcement powers.
</P>
<P>
   The conventions include protections of the right to organize and
bargain collectively, and bans on child labor and forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   To help poor nations comply with the conventions and avoid
sanctions for abuses such as child labor _ which is common in many
countries _ the unions also propose a big increase in foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   But any reliance on the ILO would be politically dicey in the
United States, where Republican opposition has blocked Congress
from ratifying all but one of the ILO's seven core conventions.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it's a big political dilemma for Clinton and Gore: If
the administration sides with labor and other liberals at Seattle,
developing nations are expected to dig in their heels and block
further negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But if the administration takes the opposite tack, siding with
business groups and developing nations, the unions and
environmentalists threaten to divert much of their energy from
supporting Gore's presidential campaign to fighting the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is between a rock and a hard place over the WTO,'' said
Jeffrey Schott, an analyst at the Institute for International
Economics, a pro-free-trade think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good chance that labor will continue to be very
unhappy after Seattle, and that may affect both the presidential
race and congressional races.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney _ who had engineered
the labor federation's early endorsement of Gore last month _
called the administration's stand on labor rights ``disgustingly
hypocritical,'' and called on U.S. negotiators to reject any WTO
deal that does not include labor protections. Sweeney's aides
privately said the venom was meant as a warning to Gore of a
possible schism in labor support for his candidacy.

FRACAS OVER FREE TRADE IN WOOD, PAPER
</HEADLINE>
 W/WTO-FIGHT)   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  When is there such a thing as too much prosperity?
<P>
   The Clinton administration is finding out that, politically at
least, it's when prosperity comes from a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. proposal that the World Trade Organization adopt a global
free-trade pact in forest and paper products has galvanized
opposition from environmentalists, who say it would accelerate the
devastation of old-growth forests worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, developed nations' tariffs on wood products
would be eliminated by 2000, and developing countries' tariffs by
2002; elimination for paper products would occur by 2002 and 2004,
respectively. Doing away with these tariffs would make it cheaper
and easier to buy and sell wood products.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is the most high-profile element of a U.S. proposal to
accelerate an existing WTO agreement for free trade by 2020 in wood
and paper products and eight other categories: fish products,
chemicals, energy equipment, environmental goods, gems and jewelry,
medical equipment and scientific instruments, and toys.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. environmental groups have closed ranks to fight the plan,
and a group of 50 members of Congress led by Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif., wrote to President Clinton last week to demand that he
abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free-logging agreement would be a disaster,'' said Andrea
Durbin, international policy director of Friends of the Earth. ``It
would increase the rate of logging for old-growth forests in the
United States and abroad, and it could undermine a wide variety of
forest protection laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But American forest products companies are lobbying hard for the
plan. They say an across-the-board free-trade agreement is needed
to level the playing field because U.S. tariffs on imports of
foreign forest products are low, averaging only 1.4 percent, while
U.S. forest products face tariffs of 10 to 20 percent in many other
countries' markets.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has plenty of lobbying clout because of its
economic impact. In California alone, it employs 94,000 workers,
with an annual payroll of $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling the intense heat from environmentalists, the Clinton
administration and industry leaders have edged away from an earlier
prediction that the plan would increase world trade in forest
products by 3 to 5 percent. The forecast led environmentalists to
predict that logging of forests would increase by the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the White House and its industry allies argue that free
trade would force lumber producers to be more efficient and waste
less wood, thus increasing imports and exports without cutting
additional trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. forest industry is the most efficient in the world
and is environmentally superior, so (tariff elimination) will give
us a larger market share and will force other countries to be more
efficient and environmentally aware, without increased logging,''
said Michael Klein, spokesman of the American Forest and Paper
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say the new claims are hogwash.
</P>
<P>
   In California, they say, the free-trade plan would mean
increased foreign demand for the state's redwoods, Douglas firs and
other prized trees, thus speeding up logging in federal forests and
in private lands that have stands of old-growth forest.
</P>
<P>
   They also say the negotiations could lead to broad new powers
for the WTO to overturn U.S. environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary negotiations, Japan has insisted that any
free-trade pact be accompanied by U.S. concessions on forestry
``non- &LR; tariff measures'' that protect U.S. jobs and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The activists charge that if the Clinton administration agreed
to the non- &LR; tariff barrier terms, the following domestic laws could
become illegal under the WTO:
</P>
<P>
   -- Laws enacted by California and 47 other states requiring the
purchase of recycled paper products.
</P>
<P>
   -- Laws banning the export of unprocessed logs from federal
lands. (California has a similar law for state lands.)
</P>
<P>
   -- State eco-labeling and certification laws limiting government
purchases of wood from unsustainably managed tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, there is increasing debate over the WTO
forestry issue.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's congressional letter warned Clinton that the U.S.
positions at the WTO ``may be contributing to a reduction in
environmental and consumer protections in the United States and
abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers urged Clinton to take the following steps:
</P>
<P>
   -- Abandon his support for the forestry pact.
</P>
<P>
   -- Advocate that the WTO stipulate that its rules cannot be used
to weaken national, state or local environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   -- Conduct a full environmental review of all new WTO agreements
before they are adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The administration scrambled quickly to contain the damage. The
same day that the letter was sent, the White House accepted the
demand for environmental reviews of future pacts. But it made no
mention of the other demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this debate about trade and the environment, some folks
have kind of taken the idea they're necessarily in conflict,'' said
Vice President Al Gore. ``I've never believed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists called the move a decent start but
insufficient. They noted unhappily that the new U.S. reviews would
cover only future pacts reached in the WTO and would ignore the
many existing WTO provisions that are blamed for endangering U.S.
environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is trying to spin its policy at the WTO as
being environment-friendly, when there's really only lip service,''
said Victor Menotti, director of the environmental program at
International Forum on Globalization, a San Francisco-based think
tank. ``It's going to be a very hard sell.''

ANTI-SUMMIT SENTIMENT LIKELY TO LEAD TO BIG SEATTLE PROTESTS
</HEADLINE>
 W/WTO-FIGHT)   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  It's likely to be one of the biggest American street protests
of the decade, and probably the largest ever about economic policy.
<P>
   Diplomats at the World Trade Organization summit are expected to
be met by tens of thousands of demonstrators. The scene will be
chaotic: climbers hanging banners from office buildings, huge
puppets dancing in the streets, cavalcades of tractors blocking
intersections.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters are headed to Seattle from around the world. There
will be Indian farmers, Mexican Zapatista rebels and Tennessee
Teamsters. Longshore and dock workers will stage a one-day strike
at ports from Vancouver to Long Beach on Tuesday, when a big labor
march is scheduled through downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers, who say they want to shut down the summit,
expect hundreds of people to be arrested as they try to block
almost anything WTO-related. Local police and the FBI are on alert,
fearing a replay of riots that have erupted in Geneva and other
cities where the WTO has met recently. Rumors of possible violence
are spreading, and local media outlets have issued gas masks to
their reporters.
</P>
<P>
   While organizers are pleased by the forces they have been able
to muster, they are also worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to spiral out of control, for good people to
be teargassed in the streets just because of the actions of a few
provocateurs,'' said John Sellers, director of the Berkeley,
Calif.-based Ruckus Society, which has trained many of the
activists in nonviolent techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct action is older than our country, back to the Boston
Tea Party. It's a great tradition, and that's why we want to shut
down the WTO, because it's undemocratic and corporate-controlled,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest contingents of protesters will be from the
San Francisco Bay Area, where activists have been organizing for
months to get people riled about the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do battle in Seattle, stopping the bad and
starting the good,'' said Randall Hayes, president of the San
Francisco-based Rainforest Action Network. Hayes' group is one of
many environmentalist organizations that is trying to stop a
proposed WTO pact to eliminate all tariffs on forest products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what you need to do to save the planet,'' Hayes said.
``This will rank as one of the biggest protests in U.S. history,
along with the Democratic Party convention in '68, the Vietnam
anti-war protests and the desegregation struggles.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists have shown plenty of spunk in drumming up free
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area-based organizations such as the Ruckus Society, Global
Exchange, and Art and Revolution Street Theater Troupe have invited
the media to their training sessions. Even the Wall Street Journal
gave front-page treatment to one such session, at which attendees
were taught essential skills such as scaling buildings, making
giant puppets and getting arrested nonviolently.
</P>
<P>
   At &LR;  In Seattle, innumerable teach-ins will feature experts,
pundits and activists. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader will debate
free-trade supporters. Rock and folk concerts will play into the
night.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Seattle Steel Party'' will see union members dump Chinese
steel into the city's harbor to protest ``globalization without
representation.'' (Don't worry, say organizers, the steel will be
recovered from the harbor after the protest so as not to offend
local environmentalists.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Every group in the world with an ax to grind is going to
Seattle to demonstrate,'' said President Clinton, who is scheduled
to address the WTO summit's opening session on Tuesday _ the same
day as the big labor march.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have more demonstrators against me than I've had in the
whole seven years I've been president.''

SWEET DREAMS ARE MADE OF THIS BORING COWBOYS GAME PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ What the Dallas Cowboys desired Thursday, they
achieved. A full-blown turkey was delivered coast to coast, which
had nothing to do with the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   For those expecting an afternoon of rapid-fire action, Texas
Stadium was the wrong venue. For those watching at home, it was a
good game for a late afternoon nap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more boring, the better it was for us,'' said coach Chan
Gailey. And boredom became a very good game plan for the Cowboys,
who continued a seasonlong binge on home cooking by using a
defensive and special-teams foundation for a 20-zip dominance of
Jimmy, Dan and the Dolphins. But while the game was a stinker,
``winning is a great deodorizer,'' observed quarterback Troy
Aikman. And winning at home _ it's now five straight _ is keeping
alive a 6-5 season.
</P>
<P>
   For all those critics who scream about Chan Gailey being too
conservative, he wasn't listening again Thursday. His entire
offensive game plan was built around a yawn of pounding on the
ground with Emmitt and trying to bust a bomb with Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that to work, we had to depend on our defense, and I
didn't have a doubt about putting that kind of responsibility in
their hands,'' said Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Such confidence, of course, had everything to do with that
Offense 101 the Dolphins play. And five interceptions off the rusty
and ailing arm of Dan Marino demostrated how good those Cowboys
defensive hands were.
</P>
<P>
   One of those picks, by linebacker Dexter Coakley, was the
single-biggest play of the afternoon. Coakley's 46-yard touchdown
return midway through the third quarter broke a scoreless tie that
appeared to be unbreakable.
</P>
<P>
   What Gailey did was borrow most of Jimmy Johnson's old-school
playbook: avoid offensive turnovers, play stout defense, collect
turnovers and, with Miami anyway, use an anemic offense to kick
field goals. Hey, the Dolphins came in at 8-2 using that snooze
approach.
</P>
<P>
   But they departed 8-3 because Marino, coming off a five-week
layoff with a sore shoulder, had an awful afternoon against the
same kind of defensive philosophy he faces in practice. Dave Campo
came to the Cowboys with Johnson in '89, and, as the only remaining
member here from Jimmy's original staff, cut his coordinator roots
``on what I learned about defense from Jimmy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How juicy do you think this turkey was for Campo? Not just the
shutout, but the shutout of Johnson's team. ``Jimmy and I go way
back,'' said Campo, who then refused to take the gloat bait. ``If
you know Jimmy, the fact he lost the game eats at him much more
than losing to the Cowboys or that it was a shutout,'' Campo added.
</P>
<P>
   But if Jimmy is thinking Super Bowl with this Dolphins offense _
and you know he has been _ then it's time for a couple of more
Heinekens over ice.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's best scoring chance _ field-goal kicker Olindo Mare _
missed two and had a third tipped at the line.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that kept the Dolphins within 20 points _ but
within striking distance until late _ was a pathetic 103 yards in
penalties on the Cowboys. And that doesn't count those flags
declined or wiped out by off-setting penalties.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the game went nearly 38 minutes with nary a point
being scored because both offensive units staggered around like
punch-drunk fighters waiting for the other guy to lead with his
chin. And Marino, it turned out, was all chin.
</P>
<P>
   What made the five interceptions and the shutout more remarkable
was the Cowboys playing their fourth and fifth cornerbacks _
Hawthorne and Charlie Williams _ on the side opposite Nine-Toed.
Injuries benched both Kevin Smith and Kevin Mathis. But the
seven-man front controlled the Dolphins' running game, allowing
Campo to commit safety help to both corners. ``That was the key
right there,'' said Campo, referring to Miami being held to 63
yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   A bonus for the Cowboys came on special teams creating constant
field position. In the second half, the Dolphins started six of
eight possessions at their 22-yard line or worse and had only one
possession outside the 30: An Aikman fumble out of a shotgun snap
(the only Cowboys' turnover) set the ball up at the Miami 44 in the
fourth quarter. ``I'm pleased we did that well, but also
surprised,'' said special-teams coach Joe Avezzano. ``Miami has a
great kicking game.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Rocket Ismail factor also surfaced in the fourth
quarter. ``I thought we had lost Rocket,'' said Gailey, meaning a
``slight concussion'' on the Cowboys' first possession of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Ismail reappeared in the second half, and iced the game with
a 65-yard touchdown bomb from Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   So despite what it looked like, all areas of the offensive game
plan worked _ be conservative, hammer with Emmitt (a season-high 31
carries for 103 yards) and spring Rocket on a deep one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we bored everybody,'' said Gailey, ``we meant to.'' nn

RATS! SHOWDOWN BETWEEN JIMMY, JERRY JUST A TURKEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It was Thanksgiving. A day to spend time with
family, old friends ...
</P>
<P>
   But probably not old owners.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, Jimmy Johnson said all the right things after
Thursday's 20-0 holiday roasting at the hands of the Dallas
Cowboys. He praised the host team's quarterback. He praised the
host team's defense.
</P>
<P>
   On the inside, though, his giblets must have been churning.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's Miami Dolphins did not rise to the Thanksgiving
occasion Thursday at Texas Stadium. His radar-perfect kicker kept
veering toward Texarkana. His quarterback hasn't looked so bad
since, well, since ``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy, for his fortunate sake, probably missed this on the 6
o'clock news, but as a farewell sight, there was his old owner,
Jerry Jones, standing in the Cowboys locker room, trying to keep
the gleeful clucking to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Jones allowed, ``I'm really pleased we won the game because of
Jimmy.'' But it wasn't at all like the first time that the two
former partners/adversaries met, back in 1996 in Miami, when Jones
was on the sideline at the end of the game, campaigning Barry
Switzer to run up the score.
</P>
<P>
   The page has turned, both men insist. The Jimmy-Jerry saga is
over, they contend.
</P>
<P>
   Rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this was not a division game,'' Johnson said Thursday,
dismissing the rift with a symbolic wave of the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our guys fought hard. I thought we gave good effort.
But we just didn't make enough plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing a team that was backed into a 5-5 corner, the Fish
seemed to lack neither the bravado nor the sharpness for pulling
this off. Maybe Jimmy's weeklong insistence that the homecoming to
Texas meant nothing and that a game with, say, the Buffalo Bills
was more consequential had a stupefying effect on his heretofore
8-2 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would have been a big win for us,'' Miami tight end Troy
Drayton said. ``But this doesn't really put us in a bad position.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   If you were expecting a morality play, a bloodletting, or
Jimmy's hair to be shaved and auctioned off at midfield, you
probably went home disappointed. It turned out, instead, to be just
another enigmatic Cowboys football game, studded with promising
moments just five days after bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be like that all season,'' Cowboys quarterback
Troy Aikman said, revealing a plot that now seems all too apparent.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, the Cowboys have been bad. Very bad. Which they had
to be to lose at Philadelphia and against a mediocre Cardinals team
last weekend in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But at home, the Cowboys have shown flashes of brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great players,'' Johnson said. ``Plus, you know,
they're 6-5 and they're playing on national television, and I
thought they played great.''
</P>
<P>
   Rats. It was Jimmy's way of saying that his old team was more
pumped than his new team. And _ on the surface, at least _ he
seemed almost at peace with that. He didn't threaten to send kicker
Olindo Mare to the asthma field or take Buddy Ryan's name in vain,
at least.
</P>
<P>
   Spared the rod, in particular, was Marino, who served up a
career-worst five interceptions. Because of a shoulder injury, he
hadn't played a full game since Oct. 10, and Marino looked it. Two
practices, Monday and Tuesday, clearly weren't enough.
</P>
<P>
   But on this day, Johnson was patient to a fault. He refused to
yank Marino, even as the rust became more and more visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to do that to Dan,'' Jimmy said. ``I wanted to
let him have the opportunity to go out there and finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan's our starting quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Cowboys' locker room, Jones suggested that the day will
be remembered as a milestone passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time we play,'' the owner said, ``maybe it won't be
such a big thing that we used to be teammates on a national
championship team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that he visited with Johnson briefly before the game
and praised the Dolphins considerably.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Jones noted, ``Certainly, I respect Jimmy and I
knew he would have his team ready. But we did not reflect on him
standing on the sideline at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Jones insisted, ``This is a big win because of the
stature of their team. Jimmy is a symbol of success, a symbol of
winning, and it was important to win the game against him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it got neither more pointed nor more heated than
that. Jerry-Jimmy II, like most sequels, failed to live up to the
hype.
</P>
<P>
   As Jimmy headed for the team bus, his face bore a South Florida
tan. His stomach may have been churning, but his ears seemed far
from smoking. His thoughts, Johnson repeated, were on next week's
game with the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   If you were expecting something else, something more Jimmy-ish,
the day was a turkey.
</P>
<P>

TRIMBLE'S BOLD MANEUVER PUTS UNIONISTS ON THE SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ In 1996, the year after he became leader of the Ulster
Unionists, a defiant David Trimble stood before the party faithful
and said: ``Compromise between nationalism and unionism is not
possible. And even if it were, it is not desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a decidedly different David Trimble acknowledged that
the nationalists' goal of unifying the two Irelands is legitimate
if sought through peaceful means, and he spoke in conciliatory
language unprecedented for a unionist leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a chance to create a genuine partnership between
unionists and nationalists in a novel form of government,'' he
said. ``It offers us the opportunity to put past failures behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Trimble, an enigmatic law professor, aficionado of
opera, and Nobel laureate, will put his position, and the Northern
Ireland peace process, on the line.
</P>
<P>
   He has asked his 860-member party council to back a compromise
aimed at breaking the impasse that has stalled implementation of
the 1998 Good Friday Agreement for more than a year. Trimble wants
his party to drop its demand that the Irish Republican Army begin
disarming before unionists form a power-sharing government with
members of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political allies.
</P>
<P>
   If the council does not decisively back him _ most observers say
he needs a least 60 percent of the vote _ Trimble will be finished
as the Unionists' leader.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Good Friday Agreement, which is supposed to
transform the debate over Northern Ireland's status from a violent
conflict to a strictly political one, will be all but dead, too.
The good will and momentum generated by the conciliatory statements
last week by Trimble, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, and the IRA
will have been wasted. If that happens, many here fear that history
will repeat itself, as it has so often in Ireland, with violence
filling the political vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has told his closest advisers that unionist
intransigence will be singled out for blame if the political
paralysis continues, and the paramilitary cease-fires that have
been the bedrock of the peace process collapse.
</P>
<P>
   His reasoning highlights the cold pragmatism that has replaced
the heated obstinacy that once defined him.
</P>
<P>
   If Trimble prevails, and a power-sharing government is formed
next week, he and his party will receive much of the credit, and
all the pressure will shift to the republican movement. Sinn Fein
last week said it believes that disarming the paramilitaries is
essential to the peace process, and the IRA has promised to appoint
a representative to discuss disarming after the power-sharing
government is formed.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments, not to mention the White
House, which remains a key player in the process, will expect the
IRA to keep its end of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   But Trimble's party is badly divided. It must decide whether
Trimble is a visionary leader who can safeguard Northern Ireland's
union with Britain, or a deluded appeaser who is compromising the
principles of democracy and pushing Northern Ireland down a
slippery slope to merger with the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Donaldson, one of Trimble's rivals for leadership,
thinks Trimble is the latter. He says Trimble has shifted so many
times that the party's word means nothing, that the proud Ulster
Protestant tradition of saying what you mean and meaning what you
say has been trivialized. He believes the party will reject
Trimble's compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe people will want to stand behind the word they gave
to the people of Northern Ireland in successive manifestos,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell, the former US senator from Maine who spent 11
weeks fashioning the compromise to save the Good Friday accord he
brokered in 1998, praised Trimble as a realistic, courageous
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``His critics have no alternative,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Northern Ireland was created by British fiat in 1920,
unionist leaders have been defined by their fundamental refusal to
countenance change. Yet as the leader of the biggest unionist
party, Trimble has shown an unprecedented willingness to change. If
dinosaurs were the creatures once mostly closely associated with
unionists, Trimble seems more like a chameleon, able to adapt to
his surroundings, especially when in peril.
</P>
<P>
   When Trimble and John Hume, the moderate nationalist leader
widely viewed as the architect of the Good Friday Agreement, shared
the Nobel Peace Prize last year, many people suggested that Trimble
was somehow not as deserving.
</P>
<P>
   Hume, after all, is a lifelong pacifist whose commitment to
nonviolence has made him an influential statesman and a revered
figure in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In comparision, Trimble, 55, was widely viewed as an
intransigent provincial politician, easy to anger, difficult, and
diffident. In 1974, he helped wreck the last attempt to share power
with Catholic nationalists and end the political career of Brian
Faulkner, the Ulster Unionist leader to whom he is now compared.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Trimble was elected party leader after holding himself
up as the candidate most hostile to appeasing Irish nationalists. A
few months earlier, he had been photographed dancing triumphantly
with the Rev. Ian Paisley, the hard-line Democratic Unionist
leader, after a disputed Protestant parade had gone through a
Catholic neighborhood in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   But Trimble's career as Ulster Unionist leader has been marked
by a willingness to abandon positions once considered
non-negotiable. While his predecessors shunned Dublin, he went
there after his election as party leader to dispel claims that
unionists were bigots.
</P>
<P>
   He initially said he would not talk to Sinn Fein. But eventually
he did, meeting and talking at length with Adams, most recently
under Mitchell's stewardship. ``Trimble got a chance to size up the
republicans, to judge their commitment to democracy,'' Mitchell
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks wound up, Mitchell said Adams told him, ``David
Trimble is our best bet, and we're his.''
</P>
<P>
   While he remains prickly, Trimble has made gestures that no
previous unionist leader would. Last year, after an IRA splinter
group exploded a bomb that killed 29 people in Omagh, the worst
atrocity of the Troubles, Trimble crossed the border into the Irish
Republic to attend the funerals of three boys from Donegal killed
in the blast. When the priest welcomed Trimble from the altar, the
Catholic congregation burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   But it was another, less public gesture after the Mass that
showed Trimble had matured in other ways. Mary McAleese, the Irish
president and a former colleague of Trimble's on the law faculty at
Queens University, attended the funerals, too. Trimble had once
complained that McAleese had gotten a promotion that he deserved
and had snubbed her since. But at the church he greeted her warmly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one is suggesting Trimble has suddenly become a cuddly
character. David Ervine, a leader of the Progressive Unionists,
political wing of a loyalist paramilitary group, said that Trimble
has matured personally and politically, and that it bodes well for
the people he represents. ``David Trimble is showing real
leadership,'' he said. ``He is not just mouthing words that condemn
another generation to conflict. He is providing an alternative to
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's party vote is by no means a sure thing. Seven of his
party's 10 members of the British Parliament are opposed to the
compromise, and to the Good Friday Agreement in principle. But
Trimble is a shrewd judge of the party faithful. Eighteen months
ago, he correctly calculated that the grass roots were more willing
to compromise than the party's elected officials, getting 72
percent of the council to back the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The voting was initially going to be at the Ulster Hall, the
imperialist Victorian auditorium where the Ulster Unionist Party
was founded in 1905. But Trimble moved the venue to the Waterfront
Hall, the modern, glistening glass structure on the River Lagan
that is a symbol of a new, more peaceful and prosperous Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the symbolism is not lost on the party faithful.

HOW DID REGIS PHILBIN BECOME THE MOST WATCHABLE PERSON ON TV?

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The hottest celebrity in America is a TV star with no
discernible talent who is 66 years old--that's 462 in TV
years--whose partner is the most detested woman on television, and
whose claims to fame are an evening game show that almost no one
wins (``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'') and a morning talk show
where nothing happens (``Live With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee''). Yet Regis
Philbin deserves all his acclaim and more.
</P>
<P>
   Regis has not come from nowhere. He has come from everywhere.
Until he hit big with ``Live'' in the late '80s, he was the
quintessential loser, a 25-year also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   A Notre Dame grad and Navy veteran, he got his start in the
early '60s hosting a talk show in San Diego, Calif., and spent the
next quarter century anchoring shows in New York, St. Louis and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, these stints would be interrupted by a shot at the
big time, which Regis would invariably blow. In 1964, he succeeded
Steve Allen as host of Westinghouse's marquee late-night show. It
flopped, and Philbin was dumped for Merv Griffin. In the late '60s,
Philbin spent three years as Joey Bishop's sidekick on another
doomed late-night show. Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show'' spanked
Bishop in the ratings. In the mid-'70s, Philbin bombed as host of a
couple of game shows. In 1981, he tanked as anchor of a national
morning program.
</P>
<P>
   No one could explain why Regis didn't work. He was too spastic
perhaps--''just a nerve ending'' as Bill Zehme, who co-wrote
Philbin's delightful autobiography, puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Regis returned to New York in 1983, took over a morning show,
hooked up with Kathie Lee Gifford (then Kathie Lee Johnson) two
years later, and went national with the show in 1988. ``Live'' has
been a monster hit ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Regis and Kathie Lee quickly became figures of ridicule, the
embodiment of unhip. He was the toothy moron; she, the unbearable
crooner. ``Live'' sounds like a joke, an hour of nothing: 20
minutes of ``host chat'' between Regis and Kathie Lee, celebrity
interviews, lame stunts, a trivia question. Watch it once, and it
seems pathetic. Watch it twice, and you begin to see genius.
</P>
<P>
   As host of ``Live'' (or ``Millionaire,'' or anything else he has
ever done), Regis displays no evident talent. He does not interview
guests well. He does not tell jokes. He lacks empathy. He displays
no particular intelligence. He speaks in a bizarre voice, equal
parts Bronx, sinus, and helium.
</P>
<P>
   So why is he the most watchable person on television? In the
autobiography, ``I'm Only One Man,'' he explains his success this
way: ``I started small and learned to keep it small. Small is
friendlier and more real. Small lasts longer.''
</P>
<P>
   This captures one of Regis' gifts. He has a modest but
captivating comic persona. He is the master of umbrage. Walloped by
a generation of rejection, failure, and sidekickdom, he has
perfected the persona of the aggrieved little guy.
</P>
<P>
   His hyperactivity has mellowed, but not too much. In ``host
chat,'' his specialty, Regis turns the mundane details of his
life--a lost wallet, a urinary-tract problem, a disagreement with
``Live's'' producer--into comic gems. Most performers mask their
insecurity with ego. Regis shares his insecurity. (He can take
offense at anything.) He is cotton candy, spinning TV sugar out of
thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee, endlessly chipper and extra-perfect, serves as
superb foil for Regis' peevishness. He jabs her, mocking her
singing and her tedious stories about her son. She punches right
back. It is an amusingly petty domestic drama, enacted every
morning at 9.
</P>
<P>
   Regis' comic persona reinforces his second gift: a perfect
relationship with the camera. No one talks to the screen better
than Regis. ``He is the last of the true broadcasters who can go on
the air and spout about nothing,'' says Zehme. ``He is never at a
loss to speak to the camera as if it were you.'' This is one reason
why David Letterman, Larry King, and other TV celebs idolize Reege.
</P>
<P>
   Regis seems genuine on camera in part because his personality
and TV persona have joined. Profiles of Philbin are tedious because
he has revealed everything on the show (his latest squabble with
his wife, etc.). There is no secret life of Regis Philbin. While
criticizing sensationalistic, confessional talk shows, he divulges
everything about himself. He just doesn't have anything salacious
to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It is too bad that so many Americans are meeting Regis as the
host of ``Millionaire.'' Though ``Millionaire'' has brought ABC its
first sweeps win since, oh, the 19th century, the show does not do
Regis justice. He is a creature of sunny day, not shadowy night. He
is restrained on `Millionaire,'' forbidden to indulge in his
stories, ad-libs, and insults.
</P>
<P>
   His job is to make the contestants sweat, but he's no good at
it. He's too light to play the heavy. The dark suits he wears make
him look like a lounge singer, not an enforcer. His voice cannot
convey menace. His attempts to daunt contestants are more genial
than ominous (although ``Is that your final answer?'' has become a
national catchphrase).
</P>
<P>
   And Regis certainly doesn't exude the Olympian wisdom you'd
expect from the host. He often seems more surprised to learn the
answer than the contestants do.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Reege may be the ideal game show host for this ironic
age: He allows the show to be both deadly serious and parody.
``Millionaire'' is portentously heavy, yet run by a man with no
gravitas. It concerns itself with something that matters--a million
bucks--yet Regis' presence makes it frivolous. With a somber host,
``Millionaire;; would be oppressive. Thanks to Regis, it is the
perfect '90s experience: You can enjoy it as challenge, kitsch, or
both.

 &HT;    Building a case for books - step by step
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A reader has weighed in with an e-mail asking for good books on
the subject of building bookcases.
</P>
<P>
   Funny you should ask. Just in are two books from The Taunton
Press, and one of them is called ``Bookcases,'' by Niall Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   My correspondent doesn't say what kind of bookcase he wants to
build, but in this handsome paperback Niall discusses the
construction of 11 very different kinds and styles, from ``country
Colonial'' through Shaker and Arts and Crafts up to quite modern.
</P>
<P>
   The styles, however, aren't what's important here. The main
thing is that by the time you have finished examining each project,
you will have been shown every conceivable way to put together a
bookcase _ well, maybe not every conceivable way, but every
practical way.
</P>
<P>
   Some have doors and some have drawers. Solid wood, plywood,
veneer and even granite are used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bookcases'' is typical of Taunton's publications _ profusely,
and usefully, illustrated, well-designed and well-written. It opens
with a good discussion of the theory behind bookcase-building _
basically, how to make sure the shelves don't sag and what kind of
hardware is available _ and how to design one.
</P>
<P>
   So many amateur woodworkers, mostly beginners, get a kind of
mulish tunnel vision when they approach a project. They have a
specific idea in mind _ a bookcase like that one grandma used to
have in the old house, only wider and not so tall.
</P>
<P>
   They look through a book like this and if they don't see an
exact replica of grandma's bookcase, they put it aside and look
elsewhere. They want to be told, step by step, how to do exactly
what it is they want to do.
</P>
<P>
   Not to put too fine a point on it, they seem unwilling to learn
anything.
</P>
<P>
   For those ready to open up and learn a little, ``Bookcases''
will teach all anyone needs to know about building the things. You
can pick and choose from among the various techniques and apply
them to your vision of what grandma's bookcase looked like.
</P>
<P>
   A companion book is called ``Beds,'' by Jeff Miller, and devotes
the same kind of attention to the construction of this most
essential piece of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   A bed is, essentially, just as simple as a bookcase, if not more
so, but it is also a good deal more personal. Sloppy work in this
case could result in a rude awakening.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's beds run the same broad gamut as Barrett's bookcases,
and are all very tasteful. A couple of them are pretty complicated
and involve bending wood; in one instance steaming large pieces and
in another using bent laminations.
</P>
<P>
   Before you ask, one of the examples is a bunk bed.
</P>
<P>
   These books are priced at $24.95 each, and are well worth it. If
your local bookstore doesn't have them, the best place I know to
buy woodworking books in Atlanta is Highland Hardware at 1065 N.
Highland Ave. (404-872-4466)

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Jesse Jackson is taking a lambasting for his
trouble on behalf of seven unruly high school kids in Decatur,

and new millennium celebrations. (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist

<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ Presidents hold wide latitude in how
they act abroad. History shows that specific foreign policy issues
raised in campaigns are rarely the same ones that officeholders

are key tests of what to expect. (Andy Glass is a columnist for Cox

   Who wants to be a multi-multi-billionaire? That's a gimme: The
networks, of course, which is why they bring out their glitziest
inventory during sweeps months, when Nielsen ratings set future ad
rates. You didn't think those ``all-new'' episodes and very special
guest stars (read: supermodels) were simply products of network
good will? You didn't believe that Regis Philbin has ruled prime
time since Nov. 7 just because he's tired of Kathie Lee? No, we've
been stuffed with turkeys like ``Y2K'' and ``Aftershock: Earthquake
in New York'' in the name of a game called Stupid Sweeps Tricks.
Here are November's most obnoxious.

   NBC's four-hour ``Magical Legend of the Leprechauns'' was no wee
bit o' yawnin', but what do you expect from such a monumentally bad
idea? Even the theft of the ``Romeo and Juliet'' plot couldn't give
this bottom-of-the-barrel baloney a boost. That little Lucky Charms

   ``ER'' gets a dart for not making a sweeps event of Gloria
Reuben's departure. Jeannie Boulet was a beautifully developed
character, and her happy-at-last exit was insultingly cursory. With
its expanding cast of newbies (I count four in eight episodes),
``ER'' finds it too easy to say hello and too challenging to say
goodbye. (Left: Reuben as Boulet.)

BOWLS STILL FILLED WITH CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the debate over who's No. 1 and No. 2 rages on as the
college fooball season moves toward its conclusion, one thing seems
apparent: There are no super teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State can state its case, and can point to an 11-0
regular season, culminating with a victory over Florida last
weekend, but as Gators coach Steve Spurrier said last week, ``This
is not Florida State's best team.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it isn't. The Seminoles have looked spotty and vulnerable at
times. They struggled against Georgia Tech and Clemson earlier in
the year and made enough mistakes to lose to Florida, although the
Gators made even more, guaranteeing their 30-23 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that while Floida State is No. 1, the
Seminoles are not that much better than everyone else, which leads
to the dilemma the Bowl Championship Series now faces.
</P>
<P>
   Who's No. 2? Is it Virginia Tech, unbeaten but with a suspect
schedule? Is it surging Nebraska, on a roll since its loss to Texas
Oct. 23? Is it Tennessee or Michigan or Wisconsin?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is probably all of the above, which again reinforces
the need for a modified playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   We've been down this road before, arguing everything from an
all-inclusive 16-team playoff, which includes all the conference
champions, as well as worthy at-large teams, to a four-team playoff
that would take the four BCS bowl winners and match them up.
</P>
<P>
   No such arrangement is even on the radar screen right now and if
either Virginia Tech or Nebraska loses in the next two weeks, the
debate is likely to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if the Hokies beat Boston College and the
Cornhuskers beat Colorado win their rematch against Texas in the
Big 12 title game.
</P>
<P>
   Who plays Florida State? The BCS computers will determine that,
which may or may not be better than a committee of administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious answer is that no one should have to choose. Even a
four-team playoff would be more fair. Granted, someone would have
to pick those four teams, but for each team you add to the mix, you
reduce the chances of making a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   For now, we're stuck with the BCS system, with the very real
possibility that a team deserving of at least playing for the
national championship will not get that chance. A playoff would
correct that problem, at least to some extent.

   Before Boston College fans get carried away over the Eagles' 8-2
record, we should point out a few things. The combined record of
the teams they've beaten is a putrid 27-61. Only Syracuse (at 6-4)
was above .500. The other wins were over 1-10 Baylor, 4-7 Navy,
1-10 Rutgers, 2-9 1-AA Northeasten, 5-5 Pitt, 3-7 West Virginia,
and 5-6 Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the two losses were against 6-4 Miami and 2-8
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a world-class list of opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It still does not diminish what the Eagles have accomplished.
They played the schedule handed to them and won the games necessary
to earn a bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   They have shown toughness in coming back from the devastating
loss to Miami, beating Syracuse at the Carrier Dome and
withstanding a last-minute surge by Notre Dame last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   They absolutely can stay with Virginia Tech if they hold onto
the football. Even if they don't win, they have had a remarkable
season. For that, they deserve all the credit in the world.

   Texas A&AMP;M will meet Texas in what will be one of the most somber
settings in the long and storied history of this series. The A&AMP;M
campus is still numb following the death of 12 students last week
when the wooden structure used for the traditional bonfire
collapsed on dozens of students. There was some debate about
playing the game, but Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum summed it up
best. ``We are first of all in the education business. That's what
this university is about. And one of the things in life that is an
absolute necessity is that you have to deal with the realities of
life and you have to go forward.'' So the game will be played and
life will go on, but that does not diminish the tragedy . . .
What's the story with Houston firing coach Kim Helton after a 7-4
season? Former Boston College athletic director Chet Gladchuk
wielded the axe? There has to be something more than wins and
losses involved. Going 7-4 at Houston should get you Coach of The
Year votes . . . Kudos to North Carolina for allowing coach Carl
Torbush another season. Firing him after only two years would have
been flat out wrong . . . Notre Dame, facing a losing season if it
gets beat by Stanford Saturday, expects to hear from the NCAA about
possible sanctions within the next three or four weeks . . . South
Carolina finished with an 0-11 record in Lou Holtz's first season,
the worst in school history. To make matters worse, following a
31-21 loss to archrival Clemson last weekend, the Clemson players
carried former South Carolina coach Brad Scott off the field on
their shoulders. Scott is now on Tommy Bowden's Clemson staff . . .
Marshall is this year's Tulane, the best team with the least
respect. At best, the Thundering Herd will get a spot in the Motor
City Bowl, as champions of the Mid-American Conference. But first,
Marshall must beat Western Michigan in the MAC title game. If they
lose, they could be faced with the possibility of staying home with
an 11-1 record, while a team like 6-5 Wake Forest gets a bowl game
in Hawaii . . . It looks like Michigan will get a BCS at-large bowl
berth, while Michigan State will not. What's wrong with that
picture? Well, Michigan State had the same 9-2 record as the
Wolverines and beat them head to head. Yet, Michigan has more
marquee value for the Orange Bowl people, so Michigan State will
likely get shuffled to the Citrus Bowl, against the Florida-Alabama
loser of the SEC title game . . . If Louisiana State calls Virginia
Tech's Frank Beamer about its coaching vacancy, Beamer might do
more than listen . . . Expect Hawaii's June Jones to be on the top
of most people's Coach of The Year ballots. The Rainbows went from
winless to Western Athletic Conference co-champions and a potential
9-3 record, which would be the greatest one-year turnaround in NCAA
history . . . The University of Massachusetts will probably make a
decision on whether to pursue a course in Division 1-A in the next
several weeks. If it's a go, the Minutemen must find a conference.
The Big Big East is not an option right now, but the MAC could be,
which would be a good fit for the Minutemen.

INIMITABLE HILLERMAN BACK AT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
HUNTING BADGER 
By Tony Hillerman 
HarperCollins, 275 pp., $26 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 14th mystery novel featuring his familiar contemporary
Navajo crime-busters, Tony Hillerman's powers haven't diminished a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   His new book, ``Hunting Badger,'' set in the dramatic Four
Corners region of the Southwest, reunites retired tribal cop Joe
Leaphorn and his protege on the force, Sergeant Jim Chee, on a case
that pits their wits against those of the FBI _ the Federal Bureau
of Ineptitude, as some of the Indians in local law enforcement call
it _ and an alphabet soup of other federal agencies who descend on
the area after a policeman is killed in the wake of a casino heist
on the Ute reservation.
</P>
<P>
   So typically smooth are the plot mechanics that you never hear
the gears shift as Hillerman accelerates the action. And his strong
sense of place pumps reality into the fiction (as do effective
allusions to a real-life 1998 manhunt in the region). He firmly
roots events in a locale both beloved and lovingly observed by his
main characters.
</P>
<P>
   But skillful yarn-spinning and vibrant local color aren't what
distinguish Hillerman as a first-rate genre writer. In fact, his
powers of physical description are quite frail. Hillerman is the
least metaphorical of writers, and he seems wary of almost any
effect that might be considered decorative or ``literary.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a typical descriptive passage from ``Hunting Badger'':
</P>
<P>
   ``And so they . . . headed south in Leaphorn's pickup, taking
Navajo Route 12 south, with the sandstone cliffs of the Manuelito
Plateau off to their right, the great emptiness of Black Creek
Valley on the left, and the clouds lit by the morning sun building
over the Painted Cliffs ahead of them.''
</P>
<P>
   True, his litanies of place names can have a chant-like
evocative magic, but Hillerman's prose, unlike the landscapes of
mountains and towering rock formations it denotes, is flat. So how
does he bring the world occupied by Chee and Leaphorn and all that
natural beauty so fully alive that reviewers often misguidedly
praise his painterly imagery?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is in the deep, often spiritual, responses of his
characters to the world around them, in the resonant traditions and
mythologies they have internalized, and that connect them to other
people and to the natural world and its timeless cycles. Hillerman
seamlessly weaves Indian ways and lore and modes of seeing into the
narrative. Sometimes it is as simple as a handshake, executed
``Navajo fashion, less grip and more the gentle touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, his observations are subtler and more telling, as
when Chee, strongly attracted to traditional Indian practices,
mentally compares the two women in his life. He has broken up with
Janet Pete, a striving Native American lawyer who has severed her
ties to tradition. And he's now being pursued by a female colleague
in the tribal police department ``who lacked Janet's high-gloss
glamour . . . and her sophistication.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``how did one rate sophistication? Did you rate it by the
standards of the Ivy League, Stanford and the rest of the
politically correct privileged class, or by the Chuska Mountain
sheep-camp society, where sophistication required the deeper and
more difficult knowledge of how one walked in beauty, content in a
difficult world?''
</P>
<P>
   None of this should suggest, incidentally, that Hillerman
idealizes Native American culture. Underpinning the plot of
``Hunting Badger'' is a bloody, ancient rivalry between the Utes
and the Navajos that, a character in the novel says, ``still
lingers on like Serb versus Croat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Badger himself, more commonly known as Ironhand, is a
dangerous and elusive Ute on the lam, descended from a murderous
horse thief legendary for his stealth. To some extent, ``Hunting
Badger'' is a revenge novel in which Navajo law enforcers are
presented with the opportunity to settle some old intertribal
scores.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we don't read Hillerman so much for the excitements of
plot as for his resonant characters and the way their experiences,
finely filtered through Navajo culture, shape them and their sense
of reality. This is his genius.
</P>
<P>
   And while neither ornamental nor musical, his writing is
deceptively impressive, with its simply chiseled inevitability. It
is so clean and clear you seem to fall through it directly into
Hillerman's timeless universe. There, quiet introspection and a
wealth of other dying civilities, poetic spiritual practices, and
humane values firmly anchor people to the earth, to one another,
and to eternity.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful place, and it handsomely repays every visit.

HOT COLORS FAN FIRE FOR GAME BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Childhood has come to this: dandelion, teal, or Tommy Hilfiger?
</P>
<P>
   Where being a kid once meant choosing up sides for dodgeball or
choosing between Jolly Ranchers or Now or Later as the ultimate
candy, now children have to make decisions between the Yummy Colors
collection and the Limited Edition Tommy Hilfiger.
</P>
<P>
   We're talkin' Game Boy Color here.
</P>
<P>
   It says something about the runaway popularity of Nintendo's
Game Boy Color that fashion designer Hilfiger _ also known as He
Who Must Have His Name On Everything _ has slapped his obnoxiously
omnipresent red, white, and blue logo on a version of the portable
game console, which is again predicted to be one of the hot toys of
the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   It's already been the must-have of 1999. If you see a bunch of
kids, it's a pretty good bet you'll see a bunch of Game Boys
popping and hissing as players furiously work the controls until
their thumbs grow numb.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you've never played WWF Wrestlemania 2000, Tetris, or
Super Mario Brothers Deluxe on a Game Boy, by now you certainly
know what it is. A hand-held video game about the size of a
calculator, the Nintendo Game Boy has been around since the late
1980s, and was an immediate hit. Small enough to fit into a coat or
jacket pocket, it was fun enough to keep the kids busy on long
trips. In 1996, Nintendo introduced an even smaller version, the
Game Boy Pocket, but for all of Game Boy's popularity, its
monochromatic screen renderings were too boring, and its stingy
processor (the machine's driving engine) too limiting to wow a
generation weaned on PC games and big-time consoles like those
produced by Sega and Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed in November 1998, with Game Boy Color.
</P>
<P>
   GBC _ as its ardent fans call it _ works like a minicomputer.
Yes, its plastic skin as well as its screen graphics come in
colors, but its creators also greatly improved the set's resolution
(so you can better see what you're shooting or where that golf ball
is landing), and it runs at a lively pace. Going to a color format
also allowed for major advancements in the game cartridges with
more detail, and true gamers are mad for detail.
</P>
<P>
   On her Game Boy site, www.the-gadgeteer.com, Julie
Strietelmeier, a self-described ``34-year-old female portable video
game freak,'' said of GBC, ``I love the color screen. It's bright
and crisp. When you play a game, there isn't any blurring that
happens with most gray-scale LCDs. It makes the game animation
really great.''
</P>
<P>
   With such an endorsement, I decided it was time to enter GBC
Nation.
</P>
<P>
   I've been a serious gamer for 20 years, having played just about
everything from Pong to Pac-Man to Mortal Kombat to Doom. I was
siphoning off laundry money in college so I could drop quarters at
the arcade for endless games of Donkey Kong, Dragon's Lair,
Centipede, and Asteroids. I even bought a new computer several
years ago when the original Quake proved way too much game for my
old 486 workhorse to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, a serious gamer.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed it was time to get my hands on a Game Boy _ which
was more difficult than I imagined it would be. A number of stores
had depleted their stocks and were nervously awaiting the arrival
of new orders. I finally found a stash of Game Boys _ in all the
new Yummy Colors _ in one of those electronics superstores. They
were kept locked in a plexiglass case, so I had to track down a
store assistant with the right key to open the Game Boy vault.
After 10 minutes of ``Sorry, it's not my department,'' I began to
feel as if I were trapped in some of pinball video game.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Game Boy warden appeared, and within minutes I had
a teal GBC in my hand _ well, almost. I was never actually allowed
to touch it until it was bagged and paid for. Apparently, these
pricey little babies _ about $70 _ are a shoplifter's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a couple of games was almost as daunting. With
literally hundreds of games available at $20 and up _ from
Chessmaster to Grand Theft Auto, from Hole-in-One Golf to (of
course) Pokemon _ there seems to be something for every interest. I
settled on Duke Nukem, a good old-fashioned shoot-everything-that
moves rave-up, and All-Star Baseball 2000.
</P>
<P>
   I was psyched, primed, and ready to do damage. Yet after several
days _ when both my eyes and thumbs finally gave out _ I found
myself wondering what all the fuss was about. This is the hot toy
of the season, the thing that has parents dropping so much money?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, with GBC's portable size, a gaming jones can be satisfied
anywhere. And the action is fairly smooth for such a small game.
It's fun watching Duke Nukem slide down a rooftop, or pull himself
up a ledge. But it's also something PC games like Commander Keen
were showing off a decade ago. And the screen, though much improved
over the original Game Boy, is still hard on the eyes. It's best
viewed in bright light, preferably directly under a lamp, which
made me feel I was about to cut diamonds, not play a video game.
</P>
<P>
   For me, GBC never rose above what it essentially is _ an
expensive game for kids. I couldn't quite shake the feeling that I
was playing with a toy. (And yes, I understand that I'm not
Nintendo's target audience; it is called Game Boy, not Game Woman.)
Perhaps, used to playing on ultra-powerful computers, I have
expectations that are just too high.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe it's because, when playing All-Star Baseball
2000, I, like my beloved New York Mets during the regular season,
could never sneak a fastball past Chipper Jones.

BUCKCHERRY JUST WANTS TO HAVE FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN AND STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Misconception No. 1 about Buckcherry: They are bad, bad boys who
snort lots of cocaine. ``I hate parties. I hate socializing and
going out. The last thing I want to do is party, and I am
absolutely not that bad,'' says Buckcherry frontman Joshua Todd,
the strutting, sinewy mass of tattoos whose job description
includes spewing ``Lit Up,'' Buckcherry's sonic shrine to the great
white high, and a clutch of other high-octane rockers that aim to
put the sex and drugs back into rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   We are talking poetic license. Creative latitude. Literary
justice, as far as Todd's concerned. ``You know, you get all these
entertainers singing about old relationships from 20 years ago. On
that song I was exercising my right to express an old love affair
with a substance,'' explains Todd, a surprisingly soft-spoken
27-year-old, on the phone from a tour stop in Hartford, Conn. ``The
funny thing is, we never even thought `Lit Up' would be given
attention, because of the lyrical content. I was blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   Misconception No. 2: Buckcherry is a lab-generated mutant
amalgam of the Black Crowes, Guns 'N Roses, and AC/DC. ``You know,
they're great, huge bands that we all like,'' Todd sighs. ``It's
flattering. But we are a little sick of the comparisons. When you
get that stuff all the time, it makes me think that the people
saying it haven't really listened to the whole record, or seen the
live show.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckcherry formed in LA in 1995 after Todd and guitarist Keith
Nelson were introduced by their tattoo artist. Todd, by the way,
has eight big ones that look like more; his favorite is a king of
hearts on his back surrounded by the words ``Love'' and ``Desire.''
From the start, Todd _ who wrote the lyrics and melodies on
Buckcherry's eponymous debut, released earlier this year _ set out
to write songs that were ``really easy to relate to, like the songs
I grew up on.'' Major influences were comedian Sam Kinison, with
whom he says he was obsessed; punk music; a brief period sneaking
into his sister's room to listen to Prince and Michael Jackson;
discovering AC/DC and Metallica in high school; and finally gangsta
rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you couldn't find a title in the choruses of
songs in the '90s really bothered me,'' Todd says. ``We wanted to
be entertaining instead of looking at our shoes and being upset. We
wanted to get back to the recklessness of going and having a good
time and forgetting about your life, losing yourself, getting too
drunk, and maybe finding some girl . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Misconception No. 3: Buckcherry has a
collective one-track mind. ``I write about my experiences, coupled
with observations of lives around me,'' Todd explains, pointing out
that there are only two songs about drugs on the album. As for sex,
well, inspiration comes in many forms. ``Sometimes I just make up
characters,'' Todd says. ``In `Lawless and LuLu' it was a villain
and a hooker. Or `Dirty Mind,' for instance. That was written after
watching a show on A&AMP;E. I really like that channel. It was a bio
about Marilyn Monroe.''
</P>
<P>
   Truly, there is a sensitive singer-songwriter lurking in Todd's
raucous, writhing shadows. He's writing songs like ``For The
Movies,'' the second single off the album and one that didn't _ for
obvious reasons _ quite capture the imagination of Buckcherry's
hard-core fans the same way rabble-rousing choruses of ``I love the
cocaine!'' did. The lyrics are a bit more introspective: ``Do you
feel singled out / do you feel less than all the rest / You know
it's interchangeable / The spotlight and the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, `For The Movies' expresses a different emotion,'' Todd
says. ``We're pigeonholed now, because of `Lit Up,' but we wrote a
record that left room to grow.'' The band is already writing songs
for a second album that Todd says will definitely please Buckcherry
fans, while stretching the boundaries. Meanwhile, the band is still
on the road and Todd is getting in as much as possible of that
time-honored extracurricular rock 'n' roll activity: reading. ``I
just finished `Pet Sematary.' I really loved it. . . . But John
Douglas is really the best true crime writer. If you're into serial
killer(s).''
</P>
<P>

   Bits and Pieces: Texas songwriter and musician Doug Sahm was
found dead in a Taos, N.M., motel room last week. The cause of
death was heart disease . . . Just in time for the millennium,
Kraftwerk _ Germany's reclusive techno pioneers _ will release its
first single of the decade, ``Expo 2000'' in Germany, according to
the English rock mag, NME. . . . Backstreet Boys have renegotiated
their record deal with Jive after throwing a hissy fit when Jive
signed rival boy band 'N Sync. Backstreet Boys will get $50
million-$60 million for its next two albums, plus royalties of more
than 20 percent, so no need to fret about where the next Happy Meal
is coming from. . . . For those craving a twisted dose of holiday
spirit, catch Wednesday's episode of Comedy Central's ``South
Park,'' which will feature songs from the just-released ``South
Park: Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics.'' Highlighting the seasonal
fare: ``Swiss Colony Beef Log'' performed by Cartman, ``The Lonely

   Rock's most popular nonconformist, Jimmy Buffett, is at it
again. After years of what he calls ``indentured servitude'' to
corporate record companies, Buffett broke away and started his own
label, Mailboat Records, which he's marketing over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been one to sit and do what everybody else did,''
says Buffett, who recently became a free agent after nearly three
decades of being signed to MCA and Island Records.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett thus becomes one of the first highly sought-after
artists who have turned their back on the traditional record
industry. It's common for younger, unknown acts to market records
on the Internet, but not for commercially viable acts like Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that at age 52 you can be in charge of your own
fate as an artist _ and most record companies don't want you to be
that way,'' he says, adding that the major-label corporations are
``upset with me _ and that's an understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buffett is not looking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be interesting _ and I've talked to some other
artists who are watching this closely,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett just released his first album on Mailboat, a live CD
entitled ``Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays'' (signifying the days of
the week he now performs during his reduced touring schedule). It's
available through www.margaritaville.com. It's also being shipped
to stores, but most copies are being made available through the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got orders for 400,000,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The album includes such Buffett classics as ``Cheeseburger in
Paradise,'' ``Margaritaville,'' and ``Coconut Telegraph.'' Some of
it was recorded at the Tweeter Center in Mansfield in early
September. It's also an enhanced CD and has video footage of
Buffett's daughter, Savannah Jane, giving a backstage tour before
one of the Mansfield shows.

REAGAN IDEOLOGY FUELS FORBES'S RUN 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ Steve Forbes's helicopter has landed. The
600 guests, who have dined at Forbes's expense at the stunning
hilltop setting of the Ronald Reagan Library, have assembled in an
auditorium. Finally, Nancy Reagan arrives, and Forbes strides
rather elegantly onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tear down the walls of big government!'' Forbes shouts. His
eyes gleam behind his glasses, showing pleasure as the echo of
Reagan's famous Berlin Wall exhortation fills the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tear down this tax code!'' Forbes continues, less ringingly,
referring to his long-cherished ideal: a 17 percent flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   It is his moment, Forbes believes, his chance to take title to
something that cannot _ unlike so much else in his campaign _ be
bought and paid for: Acceptance as Ronald Reagan's true ideological
heir.
</P>
<P>
   Not because he worked for Reagan, and broadcast the Reagan
revolution to the world as head of Radio Free Europe. Not because
he hired Reagan's defense secretary, Caspar Weinberger, as chairman
of Forbes Inc., and spent some of his millions to help build the
Reagan library and foundation.
</P>
<P>
   No, says Forbes, he is the true Reagan revolutionary in the 2000
presidential field because of what he believes and his rivals do
not. He views the other candidates as moderates and no match for
his conservative convictions and message. Texas Governor George W.
Bush draws his particular contempt for his ``government lite''
beliefs and ``cute'' but hollow slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes doesn't do cute. But after spending five years and at
least $56 million of his own money on his quest for the presidency,
he remains in single digits in national polls. His flat tax idea
may be catching on with some GOP candidates, but so far he is not.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this perfect setting _ before an audience of true
believers, with the Tapotapo mountains sunlit on the horizon _ the
music and magic of Reagan are not easily summoned, at least not by
someone who is, beyond his beliefs, so unlike Reagan _ in his
inwardness, his earnest intellectualism, his starched manner.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when campaigns realize that the selling of a candidate
requires a certain baring of the soul, Forbes will have none of it.
While Senator John McCain of Arizona makes headway with a
bestseller titled ``Faith of My Fathers,'' Forbes's recently
released campaign book is thick with economic plans and barely
mentions his own famous father, Malcolm Forbes. Forbes's wife,
Sabina, rarely talks to the press. No candidate running for the
presidency retains a sturdier curtain of privacy than Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, behind that curtain, Forbes is contemplating how to
proceed. He is once again dipping deep into his personal fortune to
finance a massive advertising campaign. And so far, the ads have
been biographical or issue-oriented, showing Forbes as a family man
with five daughters, or talking with people about his flat tax and
Social Security plans.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the Republican Party fear what may happen next.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans remember that in 1996, Forbes unleashed a
televised assault on front-runner Bob Dole in what was considered
to be the epitome of the ``attack ad,'' accusing the Kansan of
raising taxes by a trillion dollars. (Forbes still insists this
charge is true.) The commercials were brutally effective against
Dole, weakening him substantially in the early states, and Dole
never recovered. But the ads also backfired on Forbes, who dropped
out the race.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, some Republicans worry that a Forbes attack on
Bush _ which already has been filmed _ could temporarily help
upstart candidate McCain and hurt the GOP's chances in the long
run. The Republican Leadership Council, a moderate organization
that includes many Bush backers, last week launched an
extraordinary ad campaign saying that the anticipated Forbes attack
ads are ``just going to help the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes this week said the ads are unfair, the concern
expressed in them is real to many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   To Frank Zazanis, seated in the back row at the Reagan library
during the Forbes speech, the most important issue is not
necessarily Forbes's flat tax, but ``Whoever can win.'' It is
crucial, Zazanis said, that the Republican candidates ``not
demonize each other.'' Still, after Forbes's speech is over,
Zazanis said, ``I'm more impressed now.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, in an interview in the Newport Beach Four Seasons Hotel,
said that he has learned the lesson of the last campaign, saying,
``I'm not fighting the last war.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was slightly more than four years ago that Forbes launched
his first presidential campaign with little more than a dream and a
checkbook. He was barely known except to those who subscribe to the
magazine that bears his name. He ran almost entirely on his
proposal for a flat tax, with little grass-roots organization and
no ties to the social conservatives who can make or break a
candidate in the early states.
</P>
<P>
   With his money and his novelty tax notion, Forbes had his moment
in the national spotlight, appearing on the cover of Time and
Newsweek and winning the primaries in Delaware and Arizona. But the
campaign fizzled after Forbes's negative attacks began _ and
backfired.
</P>
<P>
   So Forbes remade himself this year. Instead of leaving the
impression that he opposes only late-term abortions as he did in
1996, the man who once called Christian Coalition founder Pat
Robertson a ``toothy flake'' now calls himself a ``pro-life''
absolutist, going much farther than Bush or McCain by vowing to
nominate avowed anti-abortionists for judges.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year, he has run ads in the first-caucus state of
Iowa and the first-primary state of New Hampshire that present him
as a kinder, gentler candidate. In one ad, Forbes's five photogenic
daughters talk about his kindnesses. Another ad implies that Forbes
helped tear down the Berlin Wall, saying that he ``was chosen by
Ronald Reagan to lead Radio Free Europe, which helped play a role
in the fall of communism.'' The ad then shows Forbes's picture on
the cover of Time and Newsweek, without giving the date: 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now Forbes is under attack from the party establishment and the
very constituency he is courting, the conservative wing of the
Republican Party. Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, writing
in a recent issue of The Weekly Standard magazine, belittled Forbes
for spending a fortune on a doomed campaign, blasting Forbes for
``ego-tripping through a mid-life crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mickey Pohl, who went to Princeton University with Forbes in
the 1960s and remains a close friend, said Forbes is driven more
than people realize by a lifelong zeal about his economic ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people early in life learn everything there is about
baseball statistics or guitars or whatever,'' Pohl said. ``Steve
has always been completely absorbed in economics, politics, history
and world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is not the sort of guy you would make social chairman of
your fraternity. But this is a guy you would put on your board or
make executor of your will or help you if you have a business
problem. He is like a computer with what he knows.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, Pohl said, is whether the country is so enamored
of style that ``they always vote for tallest guy with the best
cheekbones'' or a candidate with substance such as Forbes.

   TAKE-BOS  
 SIMI VALLEY, Calif.: ... as Forbes.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forbes has a one-word answer to those who say he can't win:
``Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to the first-caucus state, Forbes drew some of
the biggest crowds that any candidate has seen. More than 700
people showed up to greet Forbes in Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has made an impression on one of the most
politically important people in Davenport, State Representative
Jamie Van Fossen, who also chairs the tax-writing House Ways and
Means Committee. Van Fossen had been Bush's chairman in Scott
County, the third most-populated in Iowa. For weeks, Van Fossen had
been urging Bush to put forward a tax plan, but he never received a
response. Finally, a deeply frustrated Van Fossen decided earlier
this month to join the Forbes campaign, largely because of the
publisher's commitment to a flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign is very slow on moving,'' Van Fossen said.
``They just had an organizational meeting last week. I decided
philosophically I couldn't just sit there, and Forbes is in tune
with me on taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, in the interview, said that he would have to have a
``credible showing'' in Iowa in order to stay in the race. ``I have
to do well in the early contests, no question about it,'' Forbes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes believes he will do well in Iowa for three main reasons.
his proposal to eliminate the estate tax appeals to those who may
inherit family farms; Forbes has recast himself as an anti-abortion
candidate in a state where that is very important; and he has field
organizers and activists in all 99 counties, while he had nearly
none in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Forbes does reasonably well in Iowa, he may have a
tough time repeating his 1996 primary victories in Delaware and
Arizona. In 1996, all of the major candidates except Forbes
declined to participate in the Delaware primary, acceding to
complaints from New Hampshire officials that Delaware was holding
its vote too soon. This time around, all of the Republican
candidates are expected to compete in Delaware, which has switched
to a later date and a caucus system.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes may have even more trouble in his other victory state,
Arizona. McCain is the most popular politician in the state, and
Bush has the backing of the governor and is expected to do well
there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign headquarters is spread throughout a suite of
offices overlooking the Potomac River in Alexandria, Va. There is
no Forbes sign outside the building, which otherwise is occupied by
a spa and a health club. It is here that Forbes and his top aides
have debated for weeks about their break-out strategy. Some aides
argued for an assault on Bush, while others favored a more positive
approach.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of going negative is obvious. The research arm of the
Forbes campaign has paid for polling and focus groups in New
Hampshire, all of which confirmed the fear that negative ads would
hurt Forbes as much as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when you go with a more aggressive attack, you tend to
create another candidate in the race,'' Forbes strategist Greg
Mueller said. Mueller knows that better than anyone: he was a top
aide in 1996 to Patrick Buchanan, who benefited so much from
Forbes's attack on Dole that he won the New Hampshire primary. This
time around, there is concern that a Forbes attack will merely
serve to help McCain, who is competing strongly against Bush in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has compromised by filming all sorts of possible
commercials. The first set, which began airing this week, includes
the standard biographical and issue ads. But another set, which
could run at any time, shows Forbes speaking softly about how he
respects Bush, but disagrees with him on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to make it a coronation,'' Forbes said, referring
to Bush, ``It ain't going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's vision, as outlined at the Reagan library, is arguably
the most revolutionary put forward by any candidate in the
Republican race. Forbes's flat tax proposal is designed to wipe out
the Internal Revenue Service. Even popular deductions for mortgages
and charitable contributions would not be allowed. There is no
doubt that the wealthiest Americans and many large corporations
would be the biggest winners under the plan, which has led critics
such as Robert McIntyre of the labor-funded Citizens for Tax
Justice to complain that the program is a giveaway for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes said that ``99 percent'' of taxpayers will come out
ahead under his plan, and those who don't could still file under
the existing tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's vision goes far beyond taxes. He wants to eliminate the
departments of Commerce and Energy and barely maintain the
Department of Education. He wants to allow people to put money in
an IRA-like Medical Savings Accounts, which can be tapped for
routine health expenses or saved for retirement. He wants to allow
workers to invest a majority of the Social Security savings in the
stock market, with the government guaranteeing a minimum rate of
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the next stage of the Reagan revolution,'' Forbes
said.
</P>
<P>
   A day after delivering his speech at the Reagan Library, Forbes
made a similar visit to the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace,
where strip malls have replaced the citrus groves that surrounded
Nixon's modest childhood home in Yorba Linda. A plaque on the
library wall tells visitors that the Nixon birthplace should serve
as reminder that ``one may come from humble beginnings and aspire
to the presidency of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes hopes that his not-so-humble beginnings will allow him to
do the same.

DEMOCRATS' NATIONAL CHAIRMAN EXUDES CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before we entertain the claims of Joe Andrew as to where he
intends to lead the Democratic victory as its national chairman,
let us consider whence he springs.
</P>
<P>
   Poe, Ind., is his hometown, with a population of 87, before he
left for Yale. As a graduate of Wayne High School in nearby Fort
Wayne, he won an unusual scholarship that sent him east.
</P>
<P>
   On D-Day in 1944, a young Indiana lad named Glen Peters, who had
been a sophomore at Yale, stepped off an amphibious landing craft
on the French coast and was killed, the only son and heir to a
5,000-acre farm back home. His father set up a trust in his son's
name for an Indiana kid to go to Yale, and Joe Andrew won it.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was the fast track: Yale Law School, clerking for
a federal judge, a job back home in state government, hooking on
with a couple of live-wire law firms, all while developing a
ferocious appetite for organizational politics.
</P>
<P>
   His job as national chairman _ outgoing Philadelphia Mayor Ed
Rendell is general chairman _ is to be the nuts-and-bolts guy,
replacing Steve Grossman, the Massachusetts fund-raising wizard who
is back here weighing a run for governor. Staying out of the
Gore-Bradley battle, Andrew is piecing together a strategy for
holding the White House and taking back the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He talks confidently about winning back the House. ``There are
27 Republican seats in Democratic-preferring districts,'' that is,
congressional races where a Democrat can expect a solid base to
begin with. ``There are five GOP seats we can win in California
alone,'' he added in a recent Boston interview. ``We've got to be
sure we win six.''
</P>
<P>
   Six gives the Democrats control of the House, ejects Speaker
Denny Hastert of Illinois and the conservative Republicans who
cashed in on the Newt Gingrich tide in '94, and shifts control of
every House committee from Republican to Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Given the toxic atmosphere of congressional politics now,
control of the House is vital for deciding who gets investigated or
harassed over what. The Senate is a far less likely takeover target
for Andrew and the D's, although he talks bravely about good shots
at GOP seats in Michigan, Minnesota, and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, of course, is the grand prize, and Andrew
claims the Dems will try to hold it the old-fashioned way. He
reasons thus: congressional deadlock, partisan bickering, the
Lewinsky scandal, the failed impeachment drive, and assorted
fund-raising tiffs have escalated cynicism, skepticism, and will
probably drive down turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Given Republican advantages in fund-raising and the GOP's grip
on governorships _ three out of four voters live in states with GOP
governors _ the Democrats must rely on targeted get-out-the-vote
efforts among traditional Democrats, and people who'd tend to vote
D if they were voters, i.e. registered, massaged, enticed, and even
driven to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew made his bones in political organizing in Indiana, a
traditionally Republican state, where, he boasts, ``we have more
elected officials than at any time since 1932.'' He also points to
successful mayoral campaigns by Democrats in five cities _
Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis; Manchester, N.H., Montgomery, Ala.,
and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not rocket science,'' he says of traditional
techniques to drag in favorable voters _ phone banks augmented by
drivers feeding off voter lists updated in laptop computers. He
anticipates organizing Democratic mayors into a force to counter
the Republican edge in governors.
</P>
<P>
   Now 39, married with two kids and freshly moved into the D.C.
suburb of Bethesda, Md., Andrew says the Democrats cannot rely on a
polarizing figure like Newt Gingrich to motivate voters next year.
``With Gingrich it was hate,'' he sighs nostalgically. Now, voters
express a more generalized disillusionment with the political
process. But he worries about money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican National Committee is a bank,'' he cracks.
``We're a phone bank.'' He has heard Bill Clinton make the claim
that the Republicans ``had a $100 million advantage'' in the 1998
election cycle, which brought the Democrats within a handful of
seats of taking back the US House. ``And the president has said we
got outspent 2-to-1 in '96.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew is no stranger to conspiracy theories and outlandish
developments that flourish in the hothouse atmosphere of Beltway
politicking. He may be the first DNC chair in the party's 152 years
of esistence to have penned a spy novel, ``The Disciples,'' which
is probably reasonable training for a party operative in the D.C.
swampland.

ZERO TOLERANCE FOR YOUTHS? THINK AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Decatur, Illinois, a stony school board showed zero tolerance
for seven teenagers who engaged in a fist fight at a football game.
In Amarillo, Texas, the schools and a jury were shockingly lenient
toward a teenager who used his massive Cadillac during a brawl to
ram a rival and crush him to death.
</P>
<P>
   In Decatur, the teenagers would have been suspended from high
school for two years without any education alternatives had not
Jesse Jackson and Illinois Governor George Ryan intervened. In
Amarillo, the killer earned his high school diploma while awaiting
trial. Amidst the hype of zero tolerance, these two cases show the
galling divide over who is punished and who is all but praised. If
you are popular, you can tip the scales in your favor. If you are
undesirable, you will be rammed and crushed.
</P>
<P>
   The events in Decatur are well known because of Jackson. When
the school board meted out suspensions to seven African American
youths that most districts employ only if weapons were involved,
Jackson unleashed the full force of his rhetoric. Leading protest
marches in Decatur, he compared the town to the old South.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was blamed in several corners for racializing the
dispute, but few of his critics addressed a central point: Decatur,
like most cities, disproportionately suspends and expels African
American students. Nationally, studies show that African American
students are punished more often and more harshly for the same
behavior as white students, preparing them more for incarceration
than college. Indeed in Decatur, prosecutors have indicted some of
the fist fighters on felony ``mob action'' charges.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Decatur cut the suspensions to one year and will let
the students study in alternative classes. Jackson is pushing for
an even quicker return. While the Decatur case involved black
youth, Jackson said the issue ``is fundamentally not about race. It
is about fairness and proportion in dealing with all youth.''
</P>
<P>
   The dreadful case of Dustin Camp proved Jackson right. Camp, a
junior varsity football player in Amarillo, was part of the
``preps,'' a clique of athletes. The ``preps'' had a longstanding
feud with the ``punks,'' youths who dressed up with spiked collars,
dyed mohawks, body earrings and black leather jackets.
</P>
<P>
   One night two years ago, the feud erupted into a brawl. Camp
drove up to the fight in his Cadillac. He said he saw a friend
being beaten by the punks. He aimed his car at the punks. He
knocked one aside. He then hit another punk, Brian Deneke.
</P>
<P>
   Deneke was briefly knocked up onto the hood, then fell back off
the grill and underneath the car. As Camp drove over Deneke's skull
and spine with both sets of tires, a horrified rider in Camp's car
said Camp bragged, ``I bet he liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp bragged because he bagged an undesirable. Punks are so
scorned in Amarillo that Camp's mother felt free to say this week
on National Public Radio: ``Dustin is fiercely loyal. Dustin is
brave. We're so proud of him. The courage it took. Dustin has
always been taught to defend himself . . . They (the punks) like to
intimidate people. They like people to look at them and be shocked
by their appearance. I think they're just about drugs. I think
they're about alcohol. I think they're about satanism. I think
they're about sexual deviance. They don't bathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that there had been loads of alcohol in Camp's car.
Never mind that he and his parents were cowards. Camp drove away
without stopping to help Deneke. He did not report the attack to
the police. When he drove home and told his parents what happened,
news reports said his parents merely told him to go sleep and deal
with the incident in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Without protests, the boys in Decatur faced a virtual death
penalty on their high school education for a fist fight. In
Amarillo, Camp was freed on $100,000 bail, allowed to finish his
studies at an alternative school and attend graduation at his
original high school, despite being charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   While the boys in Decatur were strung up for fighting without
weapons, Camp's attorney, Warren Clark, claimed Camp's vicious use
of the Cadillac was legal to defend his friend from a deadly
attack. While many people wondered why Jackson would aid unruly
youths in Decatur, Clark turned Camp's trial into a witch hunt of
the punks, calling them ``goons.'' Camp was convicted of
manslaughter, but was not jailed. He is free on 10 years probation.
</P>
<P>
   Such an atrocity makes Jackson's crusade in Decatur suddenly
seem more sensible. No one can talk about zero tolerance with a
straight face when black students _ including the basketball
captain _ faced two-year suspensions for a fist fight while a
football player from a more desirable background is free with his
diploma despite a cowardly murder in which his own friend said,
``he didn't have the courage to get out and fight with his fists.''
Based on this, zero tolerance has zero credibility.

LEGENDARY BLANKET IS GIVEN A REDESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ After 220 years, it seemed about time for a new
blanket, even though that meant trifling with a design that is one
of Canada's most enduring symbols.
</P>
<P>
   So the venerable Hudson's Bay Company, the oldest company in
North America, is changing its stripes, adding new hues to the
legendary ``point'' blankets that for centuries served as a form of
currency at the farflung outposts of the fur trade _ with the
six-inch black lines, or points, woven into each woolen blanket
denoting its value in beaver skins.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is now a Toronto-based retail chain, selling more Guess
jeans and Swatches than Hudson's Bay blankets. But the densely
woven coverings, designed for barter with Indians, remain the
company's signature product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hermes has the scarf, Hudson's Bay has the blanket,'' said
Richard Edwards, designer for the company. ``It's our icon.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a national icon as well, deeply ingrained in Canadian myth
and history, much as Samuel Colt's six-shooters or Henry Ford's
Model T still loom in the American consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Big changes come slowly to the firm, chartered in 1670 by
Britain's King Charles II as the ``Company of Adventurers of
England Trading into Hudson's Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, The Bay _ as the company is best known in Canada
_ announced that it will offer the blankets in new colors for the
first time since the design, quality, and hues were standardized in
1779. That initial change was made after Indians complained that
earlier versions of the blankets were monotonous, itchy, and lumpy.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson's Bay blanket has been a huge hit ever since, and not
only with native peoples. Vintage blankets have become collectors'
items and a popular ``decor accent'' in American homes.
</P>
<P>
   For Indians and Eskimos, the blankets were a prized article of
clothing as well as something to snuggle under during the cold
Canadian nights. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the thick wool
coverlets were the company's second most popular trading item,
after firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, explorers of western waterways made jury-rigged sails
of the rugged bedclothes. Mountain men fashioned the
distinctively-striped wool into coats. The early Royal Canadian
Mounted Police kept them cinched behind their saddles while chasing
American riffraff _ whiskey sellers, gun toughs, snake oil salesmen
_ out of Canada's famously unwild west. Canada had tough gun laws
even then, and, much to the disgust of George Armstrong Custer and
his ilk, provided safe haven for Indian tribes hounded by the US
Cavalry. Prospectors in the Yukon gold rush used the blankets to
filter out river gravel while panning for the precious metal.
</P>
<P>
   In more modern times, Playboy bunnies have posed on the
distinctive bedding; glossy home design magazines have pronounced
the sturdy blankets haute fashion; Kramer of TV's ``Seinfield''
show put one on his bed; and trend-setter Martha Stewart boasts of
her Hudson's Bay blanket collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blanket has become a collectors' item, not only for
Canadians but internationally,'' said Marc Chouinard, president of
Hudson's Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The company sells about 6,000 blankets a year at prices ranging
from about $165 to $400, depending on size. The blankets are still
woven in Britain out of wool gathered from England, Scotland,
Wales, New Zealand, and India.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Hudson's Bay blankets came only in solid colors of
scarlet, empire blue, and green _ with a black stripe at each end _
or the more classic, thicker, and pricier blanket of white with
stripes of blue, yellow, red, and green. This was known as the
``chief's blanket.'' According to legend, white was chosen so the
blankets could serve double duty as winter camouflage for hunters
creeping up on deer.
</P>
<P>
   The blankets always bore thin black markings to show their point
value in beaver pelts: three-and-a-half points meant the blanket
was worth three large and one small beaver skins; four points meant
four large skins; and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blankets were colored brightly to attract the Indians, who
were extremely fastidious,'' reports a document in the company's
archives.
</P>
<P>
   The new colors will be ``earth tones,'' which is probably no
more surprising than the decision to call the new product
``millennium blankets.'' One version is an off-white blanket with
stripes in either taupe or dark brown. Another will be charcoal
gray with black bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a museum, we're a department store, so we had to
update,'' said Edwards, adding that the classic colors will still
be available.

CIA SHEDS SOME SECRECY TO BOOST RECRUITS, FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANGLEY, Va. _ A group of undercover officers convened here at
the Central Intelligence Agency last month, breaking away from
their covert duties to participate in one of the most daring
operations in espionage history:
</P>
<P>
   A movie preview.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Ron Silver was there. So were agency employees, gathered
for a lunchtime screening of ``In the Company of Spies,'' a cable
television thriller with scenes filmed on CIA grounds. When it was
over, CIA officials made another bold move. They went out of their
way to tell the public.
</P>
<P>
   All of which might seem out of place in a company where
employees are sworn to secrecy until death. But this is the new
CIA, where KGB T-shirts are sold in the gift shop, where guests can
tour a Cold War exhibit, and where a green sign at the highway
outside the sprawling headquarters proclaims, ``George Bush Center
for Intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get the word out and demystify the agency,''
said Mark Mansfield, the CIA's deputy director of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is to bring the CIA's image in from the cold. The
agency is working overtime to show its friendlier side, with public
affairs officers eager to lecture to school groups and recruit new
employees from college campuses. Certain groups, such as university
classes or reporters, are allowed to visit CIA headquarters. There
is even a CIA Web site for children.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in attitude is partly the result of global changes.
The end of the Cold War has made the sort of spying depicted in
John le Carre's novels seem less crucial, presenting a challenge to
CIA officials lobbying Congress for new funds. At the same time,
the agency is trying to sell itself to skilled college graduates
when espionage is more about technology than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the agency is trying to secure its future. But the
real problem, officials say, is its past. During its 52-year
history, the CIA has never been able to call public attention to
its victories, for fear of giving national secrets away.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the public hears about disasters. From the Bay of Pigs
to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the CIA has been blamed _
loudly _ for things it missed. More recently, India's nuclear test
and the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade put the CIA in
the news, both times because the agency erred.
</P>
<P>
   What the public does not, and still cannot, hear about are
maneuvers that went well. But there are less-sensitive matters the
public can be told about in broad strokes. Or at least that's what
CIA officials want to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't jeopardize the means of collecting information, but I
think the American public needs to know what our role is here and
how we fit into the effort to protect US interests in the world,''
said John McLaughlin, CIA deputy director. ``Hollywood and the spy
novels don't get the whole story here.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin, a gray-haired analyst wearing a blue shirt and
suspenders, proved his point during a briefing at CIA headquarters
last week. ``Harrison Ford plays me in the movies,'' he said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Officials complain that such fictional distortions, however
flattering, harm the agency's efforts to build public trust. To set
the record straight, officials have begun releasing heaps of
previously classified documents ahead of schedule. Among them are
papers distributed to the president in 1990 in which the CIA
accurately predicted the collapse of the USSR, contrary to earlier
accusations that the agency was so ideologically driven that it was
blind to the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors are only mildly impressed by the release of such
documents, especially since they are edited by the CIA itself. US
Representative James P. McGovern, a Worcester Democrat and a harsh
CIA critic, said he has for years demanded documents involving a
1980 murder in El Salvador, without luck. The same goes for papers
regarding the 1973 Pinochet coup in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking reporters on a tour of CIA headquarters and selling
them CIA T-shirts doesn't solve the problem with the CIA,''
McGovern said. ``There really needs to be a change of the culture
of the CIA, which has been a culture of secrecy and denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Former officers don't entirely disagree. Several said they were
heartened by the public relations effort, even though it has
rankled some agency officers.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Hulnick, a former officer who is now a professor at
Boston University, said he had ``argued for a long time that if the
CIA doesn't tell its story, other people will tell it, and they
won't like the way other people tell it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a democratic society like this one, an intelligence agency
can't be totally secret anymore, because if people believe the
worst about it . . . that they overthrow governments and kill
people, the CIA won't be able to attract good people to work there.
And the Congress won't give it money,'' Hulnick said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Congress this month approved a sizable hike in
intelligence spending, to $29.5 billion in the current fiscal year,
from $26.7 billion in 1997-98, according to sources familiar with
the budget. But the bill covers 11 agencies _ and, according to
McLaughlin, the CIA's resources are about one-fifth smaller than a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   George Tenet, the agency's director, is widely credited with
helping bolster the CIA's image in Congress. When the CIA made the
mapping error that led to the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Tenet quickly took responsibility. He is also the driving
force behind the current hiring push, which has sent officers
scrambling to college campuses to recruit thousands of new CIA
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tenet is not the architect of the public relations
effort _ the office opened in 1978 _ ``his leadership on this has
been the important thing,'' McLaughlin said, recalling that Tenet
promised an open society even before he took office. During his
confirmation hearing before the Senate Select Intelligence
Committee in 1997, Tenet described leadership as ``never allowing
the cloak of secrecy to stand in the way of an open and honest
dialogue with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, before viewing one of the movie screenings at CIA
headquarters, Tenet repeated his sense of vision. Then, in the
company of Ron Silver, the actor who portrayed him, he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then, we should take the opportunity to portray
ourselves,'' Tenet told reporters. ``A little bit of fun: There's
nothing wrong with that.''

 (For release Sunday, November 28, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I will be retiring in about seven years vat the
ages of 56 and 55 respectively. Our assets include a $141,000
401(k) account with my wifes former employer, of which $75,000 is
in a money market fund, $16,000 in Fidelity Market Index fund,
$5,000 each in Shell Royal Dutch Stock fund and Fidelity
Contrafund, $30,000 in Fidelity Low-Priced Stock fund, and $10,000
in Fidelity Dividend Growth fund. Her current 401(k) of $58,000,
with 20 percent in Janus Worldwide and 80 percent in Fidelity
Dividend Growth funds. My 401(k) of $45,000 is in American Century
Equity Index fund. My wife's 401(k) contributions, with the
employer match, come to $3,600 a year, and mine are $8,000 a year.
I have an IRA account of $57,000 with $10,000 in Vanguard Wellesley
and the rest in Vanguard Index 500 fund, and a Roth IRA of $4,300
invested in Vanguard Health Care. My wife has a Roth IRA of $6,500
invested in Vanguard Index 500. We fully fund both of these Roth
IRAs every year. My wife also has an IRA of $40,000 in an annuity
which has $32,000 in the State Street Research Growth fund and the
rest in their Stock Index fund. We plan on transferring this to a
Vanguard IRA early next year when the penalty expires. Finally, we
have a $12,000 money market account for emergencies. I will be
eligible for a $43,000 annual pension upon my retirement, and will
get a $250,000 windfall at the same time in a pre-tax account. My
wife will be eligible for Social Security at age 62, but since I
work for a municipality, I will not. We feel that our money is all
over the place and seek direction on how to allocate these funds.
We would like to live on about $60,000 a year in retirement. How
would you allocate this money to provide an income of about $17,000
above my pension? Will we have enough to last through retirement?
</P>
<P>
   R.N., Broken Arrow, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, it does seem like a lot of different accounts and funds,
but by and large it works pretty well. Presumably you could
simplify things by rolling your wife's 401(k) with her former
employer as well as her annuity IRA into a single Vanguard IRA, but
I can't see any particular reason to make that move. In fact, I
think what I'd suggest is to complicate things a little further,
adding mid-cap, balanced, and fixed-income funds -- either by
directing your ongoing Roth IRA investments in those directions, or
rolling the annuity IRA account into equal positions in either
Vanguard Balanced Index or Vanguard Star, and Vanguard Mid-Cap
Index and Vanguard GNMA funds.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether you will have enough to get through retirement,
the answer is -- of course you will. Let's put the emergency
savings account to one side, and then break the retirement accounts
into two segments -- that money market position and the rest of the
holdings, which are very heavily dominated by stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of seven years the money market account would
grow to $105,532, presuming average 5 percent returns. Assuming 9
percent returns from the balance of your savings -- a figure Im
using because I hope that you focus your contributions increasingly
on balanced and fixed-income holdings as you approach retirement --
the remaining retirement savings would grow from $276,800 to
$655,465, giving you a total of $760,997.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow my advice of moving modestly toward fixed-income
holdings, those positions could be combined with what you call your
windfall thats due on retirement, which I presume to be some form
of deferred compensation, to build a fixed income portfolio that
will be more than adequate to supply you with the $17,000 you will
need on top of your pension.
</P>
<P>
   But since that $250,000 in cash would come mighty close to
supplying that $17,000, why am I suggesting that you put some of
your ongoing savings into fixed-income holdings? Because in seven
years if inflation averages 3.5 percent, it will take $76,663 to
buy what $60,000 buys today. Thus if you want a fixed-income
portfolio which is likely to supply a $23,336 income stream in the
year 2006, you would need a $360,000 pool, presuming average
returns of 6.5 percent from the fixed-income portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, I suggest you arrange your savings during the next
seven years with the idea of building the fixed-income side to
$110,000 by the time you retire. Thereafter, you could simply
transfer enough additional funds to the fixed-income investments
each year so that you can give yourself a 3.5 percent raise and
keep up with inflation. In the first year, for example, you would
move about $40,000 to the fixed-income side. You might achieve that
by putting all the yield from the money market account into the
fixed-income funds and adding a further 34,724 that would be
withdrawn from the stock accounts. That represents about 7.8
percent of the total, and since you can expect the long-term growth
in the stock funds to exceed that level, you should easily have
enough money to last you through a long retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 43 years of age and have an annual income that ranges
from $110,000 to $160,000 per year, with a base salary of $70,000.
I have traditionally worked for small startup companies and hence
have no access to any pension plan or matching 401(k) plan. I have
two children, aged 4 and 6, and have about $180,000 in debt -- auto
and mortgage, etc. My portfolio consists of a $4,950 IRA in
Fidelity Blue Chip Growth, $13,000 in Janus 20 fund, $10,900 in
Fidelity Stock Selector, $98,712 in a 401(k) split evenly between
Fidelity Magellan and Fidelity Growth and Income, and $75,000 in
assorted high-tech stocks. I typically contribute about 12 percent
of my pay to the 401(k) and max this out by August or September,
and then for the rest of the year I continue saving at the same
rate in other investments. Keeping in mind that I still have two
children to put through college, I would like to retire at 60. Is
this reality? If not, what is reality?
</P>
<P>
   S.R., Westford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, if I start by pointing out that in 17 years, you will
need $197,414 to buy what $110,000 buys today (presuming a 3.5
percent average inflation rate) you will know right away where I am
going. Its not a very bright picture.
</P>
<P>
   I made some calculations based on the midpoint of your earnings
range -- $135,000 a year. If you saved 12 percent of those earnings
for each of the next 17 years, and if your overall portfolio growth
averaged 10 percent, you would accumulate $1,710,903 -- a pool that
would run dry after about 12 1/2 years if you made withdrawals that
would give you the same buying power as $110,000 of today's money.
If you worked until age 65 and saved at the same rate, the
accumulation would be $2,858,822, but by that point you would need
$234,466 to match the buying power of $110,000 in today's money.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fairly high variability of your income, I have a
suggestion. Why not set a base rate of, say, $120,000, at which you
will save at the 12 percent level, or $14,400 a year. Beyond that,
you might decide to save a set percentage of your earnings? If you
chose 50 percent, in that median year of $135,000, you would thus
save $21,900 instead of $16,200. And in a bonanza year in which you
reached the top of your estimated range, you would put $34,400 into
the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Although its impossible to estimate where that might get you, it
probably would make an enormous difference. And if you manage to
pull off a number of good years, it would probably make the idea of
retirement at age 60 a reality rather than a dream.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have two grandsons who are just starting out in the work
force. For now they will go for the usual IRA; later on perhaps we
will look at the Roth. Since they are young, they are willing to
take some risks. However, I remember you recommended some Vanguard
fund with low to moderate risk. What was it?
</P>
<P>
   P.D., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a number of Vanguard funds with low or moderate
risk levels, but I don't think the element of risk should loom
overlarge for a couple of fellows who are just entering the work
force, and who will probably be putting the money away for about 40
years. What they want is a broad exposure to the stock market, and
the best long-term vehicle for that is the Vanguard Index 500 fund,
which seeks (with a great degree of success) to track the results
of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index, which includes the nation's
500 dominant companies. Not the world's sexiest investment, but if
its results they are looking for, that's a fine place to start.

THE SMART MONEY IS ON COMMERCIAL WEB FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watch an hour of prime-time television this weekend and you
might conclude that retail is at the heart of today's Internet
world.
</P>
<P>
   Toys, books, sporting goods. The unprecedented barrage of
broadcast and print ads from Internet retailers is only going to
intensify between now and Christmas. But as the Web's ``e-tailers''
spend millions on media ads trying to woo the consumer this holiday
season, the smart money is moving in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, both venture capitalists and public stockholders, are
throwing huge sums of money at business-to-business Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Web companies that serve commercial rather than retail customers
are the latest hot thing because they sell into a much larger
market, often face less competition, and are more likely to hold
onto a customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business-to-business side is just going to be so much
bigger,'' said Stephen Demirjian of Westfield Capital Management, a
Boston investment firm with large technology holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The idea: Use the electronic medium to order and deliver most
things businesses buy from their suppliers, from paper clips to
industrial steel.
</P>
<P>
   Staples Inc. has separated the part of its business that
delivers office supplies over the Web and created a tracking stock
to follow its progress. RoweCom Inc. of Cambridge, which went
public this spring, organizes companywide purchases and
subscriptions to periodicals over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The best example of Internet money shifting around may be the
stocks of two companies known for their Web investing, CMGI Inc. of
Andover and Internet Capital Group Inc. of Wayne, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, a much more established company with huge investment wins
like Lycos Inc. and GeoCities under its belt, is valued at $16.8
billion by the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Capital Group, which went public just three months ago,
has a market value of $21 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The difference: Internet Capital Group targets
business-to-business ventures exclusively when it writes checks.
CMGI's investment portfolio of 50 companies is divided about
equally between consumer and commercial businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies have a track record for sensing the shifts in the
Internet world like CMGI. This week it announced plans to launch a
$1 billion investment pool, called the CMGI (at)Ventures B2B fund,
taking dead aim at the commercial world.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Internet Capital Group took steps to make the most of
its own staggering stock performance. This week the company said it
would split its stock 2-for-1 and sell 6 million new shares to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Capital Group shares, which went public in August at
12, traded at 165 1/2 this week.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI and Internet Capital Group are hardly alone. Venture
capital firms targeting the Internet, many of them raising new
pools of as much as $1 billion each, are spending much more money
on commercial Web ventures. As those small companies mature, the
business-to-business theme will become even more pronounced in the
flow of initial public stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the dot-com stories will have a
business-to-business angle for the foreseeable future,'' said
Michael Halloran, a Boston-based investment banker and managing
director of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Retail Internet businesses certainly continue to grow, but most
of the fattest consumer markets are served by a dozen or more
competitors today. What are the odds that the latest new bookseller
or stock brokerage is going to make it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming increasingly difficult for companies in the
consumer space to rise above the noise,'' said Brad Garlinghouse, a
general partner at (at)Ventures. ``There are a lot of Internet
companies clamoring for the customer's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Garlinghouse said the new (at)Ventures B2B fund is looking for
companies where conventional methods of delivering goods and
services to businesses are cumbersome or less efficient. ``The Web
is a great medium to eliminate some of those pains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger markets, less competition, better customer retention. It
sounds like Web nirvana. Don't get too carried away, said Bill
Burnham, a general partner at Softbank Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business-to-business market is a big opportunity but it's
going to follow the same, predictable cycle,'' said Burnham.
``There are going to be a few big winners, but there will also be a
lot of substandard companies that people will quickly forget about.
There's so much (Internet investment) money floating around looking
for the next big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Zefer Corp. of Cambridge would seem to be a shining example of
the rush to capitalize business-to-business Internet companies, the
recipient of a record $100 million in venture funding this year.
</P>
<P>
   Zefer, which advises firms moving out and expanding on the Web,
is in a prime position to measure where actual commerce is moving.
President William Seibel said Zefer's current clientele is split
between commercial and retail.
</P>
<P>
   That mix is expected to shift toward commercial work this year.
``But consumer business is doing nothing but growing at a 59
percent annual compound rate,'' said Seibel. ``That's not a market
to walk away from.''

 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
wont be doing much New Years Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed Y2K-compliant, other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   Thats why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian and
U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold Wars superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isnt to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles arent attacking Russia _ if thats what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscows computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   We will prevent that from occurring, said Air Force Lt. Col. Jon
Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and theyll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russias
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that its important for the U.S and Russia to
show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team, said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians wont be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain, the
heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russias potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russias missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his nuclear briefcase in the first stages
of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the Russian
armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
hotline communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,'' Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K is
going to manifest itself on New Years Day, said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are extremely remote that there could be
an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,'' it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.''Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called mission critical systems _ those considered essential for
waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be Y2K compliant by the
New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air Forces
Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.
</P>
<P>
   Weve checked them, weve rechecked them. Theyre ready, Warren
said.

   Testing. Please ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass operations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

TURKEY INSTANT REPLAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: For use Friday, Nov. 26 or later) &HT;     By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many a cook, you roasted extra turkey Thursday so you could
relax and end up with plenty of leftover meat stashed in the fridge
to score an instant replay. But this time around, plan to put this
most valuable player in a different guise _ such as pasta, salads,
sandwiches, casseroles or chili.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of inspired easy-to-make options offered in
today's collection _ or you can use the recipes as a base to create
your own concoctions with whatever you have handy. You might even
toss some cooked turkey into favorite recipes like quiches,
toastadas, quesadillas, macaroni and cheese, pizza and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey pairs well with a wide variety of flavors, ingredients
and herbs and spices _ from curry, basil and cumin to chili powder,
cilantro, tomatoes, cheeses, and more. You may need an extra dose
of seasonings since turkey tends to be bland.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid overcooking the prepared meat, add it to chilis,
pastas, soups and such the last few minutes of the cooking time. Or
turn it into an interesting cold salad or sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that refrigerated leftover turkey should be used
within two to three days. Otherwise freeze it (well wrapped) and
use within a month or two.
</P>
<P>
   These turkey replays should score with family and friends. And
if you run out of turkey, give these creations a try during the
hectic holiday season with cooked store-bought chicken. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY MELTS WITH CHEDDAR AND CHUTNEY
</P>
<P>
   Ever since their debut in the '70s, tuna melts have been a
favorite luncheon sandwich. The concept soars to delicious
post-Thanksgiving heights, as leftover turkey replaces the tuna
fish and teams compatibly with sweet chutney and sharp Cheddar
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cooked diced turkey
</P>
<P>
   1 rib celery, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 green onions, trimmed and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chutney
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 sandwich-sized English muffins, split and lightly toasted
</P>
<P>
   Sliced tomatoes (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Sprouts (optional)
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, combine turkey, celery, green onions, cilantro and
chutney. Mix in mayonnaise to bind and season to taste with salt.
Store in refrigerator until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble melts, arrange English muffin halves on a baking
sheet and top with sliced tomatoes, turkey mixture, a sprinkling of
sprouts and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In preheated broiler, broil a few inches from heat until hot and
bubbling, about 3 to 4 minutes. Serve at once. Makes 8 open-face
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   TUSCAN PUMPKIN, WHITE BEAN AND TURKEY SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin and white bean soup is a favorite cold-weather
combination and the post-Thanksgiving addition of leftover roast
turkey makes this Americanized version hearty enough to be a main
course.
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 ribs celery, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   5 to 6 cups turkey, chicken OR vegetable broth
</P>
<P>
   1 can (15 ounces) 100 percent pure pumpkin (puree)
</P>
<P>
   1 can (15 ounces) cannellini OR Great Northern beans, drained
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups cooked coarsely chopped turkey
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Grated Parmesan cheese for garnishing
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat in a soup pot. Add
onion, celery and garlic. Saute, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes,
until vegetables are very soft and just beginning to brown.
</P>
<P>
   Add broth and pumpkin, stirring until smooth. Simmer 15 minutes.
Stir in beans and turkey; season with salt and pepper. Continue
simmering until heated through, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serve soup hot and drizzle a teaspoon or so of olive oil over
top of each portion and sprinkle with cheese. Makes 6 to 8
servings.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY TORTILLA PIZZAS
</P>
<P>
   Toasted flour tortillas serve as the base to these delicious and
colorful Southwestern-style pizzas.

</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, cut into crescent slivers
</P>
<P>
   6 (8-inch) flour tortillas
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound shredded smoked Cheddar OR regular Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   4 plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Combine all dried herbs and spices, tossing to blend. Toss herbs
with turkey strips and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high
heat. Add pepper strips and onion, saute until softened, 5 to 7
minutes. Add turkey mixture and saute another 2 minutes. Remove
from heat and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble pizzas, brush tortillas lightly on one side with
remaining oil. Place tortillas, oil-side up, on baking sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 375-degree oven about 5 minutes until just
beginning to crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Remove tortillas from oven and sprinkle each with some cheese to
cover surface lightly all over. Divide turkey-vegetable mixture
evenly among pizzas. Sprinkle top of each with some diced tomatoes
and cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Return pizzas to oven and bake about 10 minutes until cheese has
melted and tops are beginning to brown lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Cut each pizza with a pizza cutter into 6 wedges and serve at
one. Makes 3 dozen wedges.

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: THE MEANING OF CLINTON'S TRIP
 &HT;    For Saturday, Nov. 27, or thereafter
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria _ Perched atop her father's broad shoulders,
two-year-old Maria Sevlievski gazed out across the throngs jamming
historic Nevski Square, her thick quilted jacket girding her from
the cold night air, her soft blonde curls tumbling from the edges
of her snug red hood.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, in this very place, her father stood up for
democracy, one voice among thousands determined to rid Bulgaria of
its communist past and seize the chance to stake their future on a
better way.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, as the light of a full moon glistened off the
golden dome of the Russian Orthodox Church that dominates the
square, Milo Sevlievski came back to see the embodiment of his own
nation's dream, the symbol of the mightiest democratic state the
world has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   He had come to see President Clinton, and he brought his little
girl with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking this as a sign of a new age, a new start,'' said
Sevlievski, 34, an advisor to foreign investors eyeing the
Bulgarian market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each life has to start with something significant,'' said
Sevlievski, a stylish necktie flashing from within his long woolen
overcoat.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a prospector's faith and a father's pride, he glanced
up to his little girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``After ten years, after 20 years,'' he said, ``Maria's memories
will start with President Clinton's visit to Bulgaria.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes a great crisis, a war perhaps, historians often say, to
give a president a shot at true greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years into his presidency, though, it is not a war but the
absence of one that is largely shaping Clinton's legacy. The end of
the Cold War, and all that fell with it, has spawned scores of
budding, if imperfect, democracies _ from the stark Balkan
hinterlands of Bulgaria to the steamy jungles of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made it largely his calling to try to feed this
movement, one of the most powerful, and empowering, revolutions of
all time.
</P>
<P>
   If history had simply dropped this moment in Clinton's lap and
allowed him to stand quietly in the wings and do no harm, the White
House still would have given him a role to play, and a stage to
play it upon, as the symbol of democracy's grand design.
</P>
<P>
   The quadrennial election of a president, after all, remains the
sole democratic exercise the American voters undertake as one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, has embraced this calling, traveling to new
democracies from South Korea to South Africa, from Macedonia to
Chile and from the Philippines to Haiti, like some itinerant global
demo-evangelist, preaching the gospel according to Jefferson,
Lincoln and the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, for the first time in human history, more than half the
world's people live under governments of their own choosing,''
Clinton said in a speech last week in Athens, the cradle of Western
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What began here two and a half thousand years ago has at last,
after all the bloody struggles of the 20th Century, been embraced
all around the world,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet, democracy still remains a truly revolutionary idea.
People still fight and die for it, from Africa to Asia to Europe,''
said Clinton. ``Its advance is still the key to building a better
global society in this most modern of ages.''
</P>
<P>
   To tag along with Clinton on this global crusade for government
by the people is to see that, whether it's Clinton, the office he
holds or simply his moment in time, his words have inspired a
generation of aspiring democrats _ with a little ``d'' _ all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may annoy his political detractors to no end, but this master
of the message in the global media age has come to represent much
of what the rest of the world regards as essential to the American
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his face you can see the U.S. all over the world, the U.S.
policy, the U.S. as a country,'' said Kris Pingelov, 30, a
telecommunications salesman in Sofia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton finds opponents in his travels, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10,000 demonstrators turned out to protest his visit to
Greece, where more than 90 percent of the public opposed the NATO
air war Clinton led last spring against nearby Serbia, which has
close historical ties to Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition was high, as well, here in Sofia, an hour's drive
from the Serbian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it is the way to resolve these problems,''
said Gergonna Boyadjieva, a 26-year-old woman building a career in
the import-export business.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the rest of the world been insulated from the personal
travails that drove the House to vote to impeach Clinton a year ago
_ and the Senate to narrowly acquit him last February.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of foreign travel, and no body of high-minded
rhetoric, can erase the chapter in Clinton's presidency when he
used the full weight and authority of his office to try to deceive
his own country about the nature of his relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, tarnishing his office in the
process and prompting more than 150 American newspapers to call on
him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Polls make clear that many Americans still think Clinton has
done his office more harm than good, and there may be little he can
do in his remaining year in office to much change that.
</P>
<P>
   And advocating democracy is, at best, only one facet of the
foreign policy record of an administration that continues to
struggle with such big picture problems as Russia, China, the
nuclear threat and the ambiguities of the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a world that looks increasingly to the sole remaining
superpower for support and leadership in troubled times,
representing the country's ideals abroad has become no small part
of the American presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a role spelled out in the Constitution, nor is it
played with the advice and consent of Congress. It is simply as
large or as small as the president makes it.
</P>
<P>
   It was cold and bleak last Tuesday morning, when Clinton boarded
a gun barrel grey Air Force cargo jet and flew into the heart of
the latest Balkan nightmare, to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling by helicopter the last part of the way to the city of
Urosevac Ferizaj to the Albanians Clinton could look down upon the
charred wreckage of lives below.
</P>
<P>
   He saw the shattered foundations of homes destroyed by marauding
Serbs, who targeted ethnic Albanians in one of the last traumatic
pages of the blood-stained century.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in faded blue jeans, his black shoes spackled by the
brown Balkan mud, Visar Demiri stood on his tiptoes against the
chipped grey paint of a gymnasium floor, hoping to see above the
heads of the thousands of other ethnic Albanians who, like young
Visar, had come to see the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saved us, he did this war to save us,'' said Visar, age 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now, we are alive,'' he said. ``You see for yourself.''

Drew Carey Webcast a hit  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By David Bloom 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's Entertaindom
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time coming, but as you read this, about
200,000 Webheads are busily pawing through a dress-rehearsal
version of Warner Bros.' massive new Web site, Entertaindom.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site debuts Monday, though Warner Bros. Online execs have
been jumping the gun the past several days with a series of
extremely ambitious and popular Web events, including a week of
free streaming audio of Metallica's new album and a live Webcast
connected to ``The Drew Carey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carey Webcast humorously showed a staggering 1.9 million
fans online what was happening while he was out of the house, said
Warner Bros. Online president Jim Moloshok. That was about 15
percent of the network show's audience that night, and would have
been the fourth-largest audience on cable TV that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first experiment in whatever the next generation of
entertainment will be,'' Moloshok said of his site.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has tried this before, a couple of years back, but the
technology just wasn't ready, nor were potential audiences big
enough, said the company's executive vice president, Jim Banister.
</P>
<P>
   Now, both have developed significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have the technology to do over a 56K connection that
two years ago would need a broadband connection,'' Banister said.
``We don't need TV to entertain you any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The site will debut with a ton of original content, sandwiched
between ``programming'' that uses existing Warner Bros.' franchises
such as Looney Tunes and Superman.
</P>
<P>
   Warners is betting those familiar faces, and services such as an
Internet tutorial featuring the Tasmanian Devil, will draw
customers, who then will at least look at new shows, much as NBC
has used its powerhouse Thursday night lineup to build viewership
for new shows that later were moved to other nights.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Entertaindom programs will use several low-bandwidth
technologies such as Pulse and Flash Web animation and 3-D
interactive stories from Woodland Hills-based Brilliant Digital
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But as the technology improves and more people get fast cable
modems and DSL phone lines, expect to see more TV-like experiences
at Entertaindom, Banister said.
</P>
<P>
   People interested in the future of the Web should cheer
Entertaindom's debut. Major media companies have been slow to
create distinctive original content designed specifically for the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   This site represents one of the first times a big player isn't
just recycling old material or using its site to market its
old-media properties, and its success will help shape how Hollywood
approaches the Net for some years to come.

`Shoah' project becomes reality for Spielberg, Holocaust
survivors  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By David Bloom 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; When director Steven Spielberg began the ``Survivors of the
Shoah'' project five years ago to preserve the memories of
Holocaust survivors, a lot of people doubted he'd achieve the
foundation's ambitious goals.
</P>
<P>
   But with more than 50,000 survivors' stories now on videotape in
32 languages from 57 countries, Spielberg is shifting the Shoah
Foundation's efforts from collecting information to making it
usable and available, helped substantially by $30 million in
donated technology from companies such as Unisys and Sony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud we've been able to get 50,000 people on tape,''
said Spielberg, in an interview before a foundation fund-raiser
last weekend at the DreamWorks SKG complex at Universal Studios.
``The 50,000 survivors have become 50,000 educators, teaching
children how to get along. This is like the original dream coming
true. But like all dreams, you realize there's a lot more work
ahead of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Foundation workers have already indexed 22,000 survivors'
videotapes, laboriously building cross references of names, places
and events that can be used to call up any segment of tape on any
topic in a 15,000-term glossary, said Sam Gustman, the foundation's
executive director of technology.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has been establishing super-fast OC-3 data
transmission lines to several Holocaust-related repositories,
including Los Angeles' Simon Wiesenthal Center (the fund-raiser's
proceeds will help build a Visual History Center there for the
database) and the National Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Visual History Center computer kiosks and theaters ``should
be up and running pretty soon, so you can sit at a user-friendly
data interface and go through this material,'' said Spielberg, who
emphasized the importance of distributing ``this motherlode about
the greatest crime against humanity ever to our children. This
allows the database to penetrate deeper and quicker to all the
places we want to get into.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is also working through the Internet 2 project to
provide database access to about 160 universities, Gustman said.
But don't expect it to be broadly available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be Internet access per se,'' Gustman said.
``There are two concerns: security and high quality.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, you can get a taste of the database's many treasures in
the beautifully realized Survivors CD-ROM issued last summer by the
foundation through Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've proven a point I've been trying to get Bill Gates to
understand: that technology and emotion can go hand in hand,''
Spielberg said of the widely praised CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Survivors CD-ROM is a great place to start for
those looking to create an all-Spielberg World War II multimedia
gift set.
</P>
<P>
   Add a videotape of the Oscar-winning ``Schindler's List,'' which
started all this, and the DVD of his grimly magnificent ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' which comes loaded with extras about the
much-lauded 1998 film, its making and the soldiers who fought the
war.
</P>
<P>
   And to get a first-person sense (beyond the extraordinary
opening scene in ``Private Ryan'') of fighting in World War II,
check out the PlayStation game Medal of Honor, from DreamWorks
Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg suggested the game's creation while making ``Private
Ryan,'' and its makers used the same consultant, retired Army Capt.
Dale Dye, to give it a gritty sense of real combat. You play as a
commando working behind Nazi lines in and around the D-Day invasion
of Europe. It's one of the season's best games.

Clinton's just-completed foreign trip accomplished anything, it was

and democracy _ and heard their future. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   IRAN-POPMUSIC _ TEHRAN, Iran _ Pity Nema Mojhimi, a lead
guitarist in fundamentalist Iran. With the necessary approval of
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, his band recently
sold out its three debut concerts in a small movie theater. They
can play George Michael and Dire Straits, but not sing the lyrics.
Crowds cannot dance, but they occasionally sing the words they know
from their black-market cassette collections. Some of the women
asked for autographs of the would-be stars, but Mojhimi felt like
he could not really hit his riffs without endangering his right to
rock. ``The electric guitar,'' he said, ``is not familiar to my
government.'' But, as the strict codes of Iran are loosening up,
the electric guitar is finding its audience. The three recent shows
pushed rock and roll further to the edge than any time since the
Islamic Revolution and highlighted the new ``pop music'' phenomenon
in Tehran. ``This means the government and ministry are interested
in the arts,'' said concert-goer Navid Assar, a business student.
``It can be a kind of freedom.'' (Kaplow, Cox News Service). WITH

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: As a neophyte with computers, I thought I had
discovered a nifty shortcut for dating letters, using Shift-Alt-D.
Now I find that when I retrieve one of my letters from file, its
date is updated to today's date. Is there any way I can retrieve
the original date of a letter? This can have serious legal
implications. _ Time Marches On
</P>
<P>
   Dear Time: I have the same problem with the wrong dates showing
up on checks I write. However, I'm sure the mortgage company knows
I meant to write ``Nov. 26'' instead of ``Dec. 26.'' I must have
been thinking of the next time I'll actually be able to cover a
check that size.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I'm guessing you're using Microsoft Word, because that's
the only word processor I could find lying around the office that
would do the same trick. Shift-Alt-D inserts a variable date, based
on whatever day your computer's clock says it is. Why Microsoft
thought that was important enough to deserve its own hot key is
anybody's guess. About the only time I use it is when I dust off
last year's Christmas letter to the family and send it out again
like I actually took time to write a new one.
</P>
<P>
   As for your problem, most versions of Word keep track of the
creation date. Open the letter, go to the File menu and pick
Properties. If you can't find that, go to the Insert menu and
select Field. Highlight ``Date and Time'' in the left pane and
``CreateDate'' in the right pane of the box that opens, then click
OK. The creation date is dumped into your letter.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's make your own date-insertion key, since I can't find a
built-in one, and I refuse to read the manual. Open a blank file in
Word, go to the Tools menu, then select Macro, then Record New
Macro. You'll see a box that lets you name your macro. Please use
something more descriptive than ``Macro 1,'' then click OK. Every
keystroke you make now is being recorded. Type in ``Duh'' (without
the quotes). Stop and Pause buttons will have popped up when you
started recording. Click Stop.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to the Tools menu, select Macro, then Macros..., and
you'll see a list with yours on it. Highlight it, then click the
Edit button, and you'll be hurled into the Visual Basic editor.
Don't be scared. We're almost done. Your cursor should be sitting
somewhere near the following code: Selection.TypeText
Text:(equals)''Duh''. Change it to read like this:
Selection.TypeText Text:(equals)Format(Date, ``mmmm d, yyyy'').
Leave off the period at the end of that last sentence. The editors
insist on them, but they'll really mess up your macros.
</P>
<P>
   While still in the VB editor, save the change with Control-S,
then go back to your document. Go into the Tools menu, then pick
Customize. Click the Keyboard button. Now, in the Customize
Keyboard dialog box, highlight Macros in the Categories list. You
should see all current macros listed to the right. Highlight yours,
then click your cursor into Press New Shortcut Key box and press
the curiously unassigned Alt-D. Click the Assign button, back your
way out of all those boxes and test your hot-key.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above may not work with your version of Word if it's
more than a couple of years old, but you can get similar results if
you poke around in the manual long enough. And, yes, I know there
are about 12 different ways to create a similar macro, some of them
quicker, so please don't call me an idiot. I get enough of that
around the office.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Watching ``Jackie: Behind the Myth'' makes you wonder what
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis would have been like had she been born
20 or 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1929, Jackie was very much a product of her times and
upper-class social status. She was charming, a debutante with an
Audrey Hepburn quality. Her career as a journalist _ the inquiring
photographer for the Washington Times-Herald _ was a brief
interlude until she married John F. Kennedy, the junior senator
from Massachusetts and most eligible bachelor in town. She had set
her sights on him so she wouldn't lead the ordinary life that she
feared.
</P>
<P>
   She then played the dutiful wife and mother, working behind the
scenes, offering suggestions for her husband's speeches and finding
ways to promote the arts by bringing entertainers such as classical
cellist Pablo Casals to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In her famous television tour of the redesigned White House in
1962, she was asked about what role the government should play in
aiding the arts. Jackie sidestepped the question, saying it was
complicated and that she thought the White House should have the
best. Unlike, say, Hillary Clinton, Jackie did not see herself as a
full partner in the administration, but she was perhaps the most
effective first lady this country has had since Eleanor Roosevelt.
Both the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and the Kennedy
Library in Boston owe much of their existence to her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But like the current first lady, she had a straying husband.
Jackie was no stranger to this kind of behavior _ her own mother
had divorced her father when Jackie was 11, a victim of his
philandering ways. In the documentary, Pierre Salinger tells about
being confronted by a reporter about the president having
mistresses. He says his reply was that the president spent 15 to 16
hours a day running the country, and if he were having some
extracurricular activity, so what. Salinger says he never heard
anything again from the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   While this may be relevant as a historic note about how times
have changed, it tells us nothing about Jackie. The only allusion
the documentary makes about how she might feel about JFK's affairs
is an observation from a friend that Jackie had the ability to pull
a ``curtain'' over some parts of her life. Given how she adored her
father despite his indiscretions _ and was upset when her mother
conspired to keep him away from her wedding _ and looked away from
her husband's transgressions, there is no attempt in the
documentary to examine this.
</P>
<P>
   Does this documentary really tell us the story of ``Jackie:
Behind the Myth''? No. Like the Salinger quote, there is too much
information about events and such that don't deal directly with the
woman and her struggles. Its tone is also too reverential, not a
sainted portrait per se, but one that refuses to go too deep and
that glosses over other events. The assassination of Robert F.
Kennedy on June 6, 1968, clearly was a factor in her marriage to
Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis a little more than four
months later, but this is only mentioned in passing. Nor is there
any real explanation about the turbulence at the end of their
marriage just before Onassis died in 1975 in Greece. It is simply
noted that she was in New York City at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the documentary succeeds to a degree despite itself, and
that is because of Jackie. She was a fascinating character on the
world stage, who through her poise (look at her at JFK's funeral),
style (a glamorous first lady who wore designer clothes) and taste
(she chose relatively unknown architect I.M. Pei to design the
Kennedy Library, helping to spark his career) has had a lasting
influence on culture.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, she begin a career as a book editor and edited more
than 100 books over the next 16 years until her death from cancer
in 1994. Hearing testaments about Jackie's encouragement from
authors such as Peter Sis, who wrote a children's book for her,
gives the viewer a glimpse into Jackie's depths.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary contains no mention of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
death this year, though there are numerous shots of his youth. It
does offer one tantalizing tidbit _ Jackie left behind tapes to be
played after her last child has died.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it will be up to future historians to give us the
real Jackie behind the myth. This documentary will give you only a
taste.

</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Saturday, Nov. 27:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-TALKS (Belfast) _ The grim, unyielding men from the
remote poles of Ulster politics were still getting adjusted to
being seated side by side around a dining room table when their
host hit them with another novelty. George Mitchell told a joke at
the expense of his listeners, men with absolutely no history of
enjoying being made fun of. But they laughed. That moment may have
been the opening of the wall that came down in the last few weeks
as the seemingly dead Northern Ireland peace plan has revived. By
Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ As russian forces pound Grozny, the
Chechen capital, commanders say they will go up to the hills to
wipe out the rebels. Story will also include developments on the
ailing Boris Yeltsin. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   YUGOSLAVIA-FRANCE (Dateline to kum) _ France denies a Yugoslav
government charge that it plotted to kill President Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   RWANDA-TRIBUNAL (Nairobi) _ The appeals court of the U.N.
tribunal trying those accused of Rwanda's 1994 genocide has ordered
a week's delay in the release of a key suspect it acquitted earlier
this month. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-SHIP (Beijing) _ The death toll in the sinking of a ferry
is now expected to exceed 300; only 22 survivors have been found.
By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>

   AIRCRASH (Washington) _ Developments in the EgyptAir crash. By
Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY-JOHNSON (Dallas) _ Thirty-six years ago this week, John
F. Kennedy was killed by a sniper's bullet in Dallas, and Lyndon B.
Johnson succeeded at once to the presidency. Time has treated them
differently. Kennedy has been transformed over the years into one
of the great, romantic American heroes, his shortcomings obscured
by tragedy of an early, violent death. For all his achievements,
Johnson is still remembered mainly as the president who presided
over the wretched war in Vietnam, the most loathed in American
history. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   NY-TAX-PROTEST (Rye, N.H.) _ A half dozen towns, upset over
higher rates on property taxes they have to pay because of
inequitable school funding, are telling the state they will not pay
the extra money until their challenge to the new taxes is settled.
By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>

   ELDERLY-CARE (Undated) _ Results of a survey on expenses in
caring for aging relatives. By Sarah Rimer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-SHOPPING (Undated) _ The sights and sounds of the
opening day of the Christmas shopping season. Retailers are very
bullish, yet discounters and department stores are trumpeting big
sales to induce consumers to shop in person instead of online. By
Leslie Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   EURO-DOLLAR (Frankfurt) _ The euro dropped as low as $1.0082
against the dollar, its lowest level yet after starting last
January at $1.16675. It also fell against the yen and the pound,
but the European Central Bank indicated it would not buy euros to
try to bolster its value. Still, the bank's president, Wim
Duisenberg, was quoted as saying he had ``some concern'' about the
decline. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   HONGKONG-ECON (Hong Kong) _ In a rosy report that makes the
Asian crisis seem a distant memory, Hong Kong said its economy grew
4.5 percent in the third quarter. The government also upgraded its
forecast of growth for the full year to 1.8 percent from 0.5
percent. The numbers, which were well above estimates, attest to
Hong Kong's remarkable recovery from its worst recession since
World War II. Like other Asian economies, Hong Kong has shrugged
off the calamities of two years ago and is regaining its strength
far faster than analysts had predicted. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   BRITIAN-BANKS (London) _ Seeking to head off a rival counterbid,
Bank of Scotland raised its hostile takeover offer for National
Westminster Bank to 27.58 billion pounds ($44.5 billion). Bank of
Scotland said it also planned to pay a special dividend after
selling off three NatWest units. It is not clear whether the new
offer is big enough to discourage an bid from the Royal Bank of
Scotland. By Andrew Ross Sorkin.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ On the eve of the last month of this
millennium, the three major stocks indexes are poised to have
double digit annual returns for the fifth year in a row _ something
that has never happened before. At the same time, the indexes
themselves are the biggest threat to that kind of performance in
the year 2000. If the indexes keep rising, many economists argue,
the stock market will continue to fuel consumer spending. That
buying will make it unlikely that the economy, which surged ahead
at a 5.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter, will slow enough
to satisfy Federal Reserve policy makers. And that would force the
Fed to raise interest rates again, adding to the three-quarter
point increases the central bank has made since June. On Friday, in
a shortened trading day, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 19
points. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.
</P>
<P>
   ARIEL-SHARES (Undated) _ Shares of Ariel, a company in Cranbury,
N.J., that makes modem cards for Internet-access providers, surged
for the second session, rising more than fivefold after the company
said government agencies had approved its new product. The shares,
which traded below $2 in August, touched $57, before closing at
$39. Trading volume exceeded 41 million shares; the company has
less than 10 million shares outstanding. The company has never had
an annual profit. By Floyd Norris.
</P>
<P>
   SEGA-OUTLOOK (Tokyo) _ Sega Enterprises Inc., the beleaguered
video game company, commits itself to a radical reorientation of
its business aimed at harnessing the power of the Internet. The
maker of the new Dreamcast game system, which competes with Sony
and Nintendo in the multibillion-dollar home videogame industry,
also reveals that its losses in the first half of the fiscal year
were larger than expected. By Stephanie Strom.

Camellias dress up drab   winter garden 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By Carol Bidwell 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The garden can be a pretty bleak place between late fall and
early spring. The perennials have died back, the roses are pooped
after a summer of blooming, and there's nary a spot of color to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, that is, you've planted camellias.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times in the winter, they'll be the only things
blooming in the garden,'' said Tim Thibault, curator of the
camellia forest at Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge.
``They're a really welcome spot of color in what otherwise is a
really drab time.''
</P>
<P>
   Because fall is planting time, nurseries are stocking camellias
right now, and _ with any luck and a bit of help from Mother Nature
_ you could have bushes of blooms by February.
</P>
<P>
   Many gardeners shy away from camellias, mistakenly believing the
frilly pink, red and white flowers are impossibly demanding,
impossibly fragile.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could be further from the truth, said Thibault and
Tom Nuccio, part-owner of Nuccio's Nurseries in Altadena, since
1935 one of the prime camellia breeders and sellers in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have this reputation for being fussy plants, and I just
don't understand it,'' said Thibault. ``About the only way to kill
a camellia is with root-rot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put camellias in the ground and they take care of
themselves,'' said Nuccio. ``I think probably more camellias are
killed from too much care than through too little. They're not that
hard to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they do need a bit of help. Like just the right
filtered-sunlight conditions, and just enough _ but not too much _
water. But if you have only sunny spots in your garden, check with
your nursery; some varieties thrive in sun. And camellias can adapt
their watering demands to fit in with other growing companions,
said Thibault.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Valley gardeners will find two kinds of camellias in
local nurseries: japonicas, the medium-size, ruffly flowers on
glossy-green shrubs that most people envision when they think of
camellias, and sasanquas, tough, tall plants with delicate, single
flowers whose petals fall like snow when they're spent.
</P>
<P>
   Varieties of both will grow in the Valley, but most will be
happier with less sun and more moisture than most Valley growers
are used to providing for perennials or other flowers.
</P>
<P>
   A third type of camellia, sinensis, is sometimes available in
nurseries, but is known for its dark-green foliage rather than its
tiny, unspectacular blooms.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to plant camellias is when you can feel fall in
the air, when daytime temperatures go down into the 70s, Thibault
said. Check labels on plants at the nursery to see whether they're
sun or shade varieties, and look for vigorous plants with glossy
leaves, round, fat buds, and one or two open flowers so you can see
what you're buying.
</P>
<P>
   To plant camellias in the ground, dig a shallow hole _ the roots
grow sideways shallowly rather than straight down _ and replace
half the dirt dug from the hole with potting soil to lighten the
mix. Then use the soil to cover the camellia, making sure the
plant's crown is above-ground, advises Nuccio.
</P>
<P>
   If your soil is heavy clay, it's a good idea to line the bottom
of the hole with gravel to ensure good drainage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like to be sloppy wet,'' Nuccio said. ``You can't
give them too much water, when you water, but it needs to drain
away. They don't like to stand in water.''
</P>
<P>
   If planting camellias in the ground, it's a good idea to
surround them with other plants that thrive in the same
sun-and-water conditions, such as azaleas, magnolias,
forget-me-nots or old-fashioned violets.
</P>
<P>
   Most camellias will also be happy in a large tub or a
half-whiskey-barrel of potting soil; just make sure the container
has drainage holes, said Nuccio.
</P>
<P>
   In the ground, most camellias need a good soaking once a week,
with an extra drink on especially hot, dry, windy days. In
containers, they usually need regular watering two or three times a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Camellias need steady moisture, particularly when they're
getting established, said Thibault. He feeds his camellias a 4-to-1
(cottonseed-to-bloodmeal) fertilizer when the first signs of spring
growth appear, then a second dose six to eight weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Both experts recommend a layer of high-acid mulch _ pine leaves
are good _ to keep the ground moist. The oak and pine forest in the
middle of Descanso Gardens, where 35 acres of camellias grow 15 to
20 feet tall, provides the perfect environment.
</P>
<P>
   The best time for pruning is when blossoms are fading, Thibault
said. Prune any limbs or shoots that drag on the ground, he
advises, and any dead wood in the center of the shrub to open up
the center of the plant. Make sure to haul away any cuttings, as
well as any brown leaves or blossoms, which may carry petal blight.
</P>
<P>
   At Descanso Gardens, visitors can see hundreds of varieties of
camellia _ many of them purchased from the nursery of Frank E.
Uyematsu, who had been ordered to an internment camp in 1942 in the
early days of World War II. The gardens' original owner, newspaper
magnate E. Manchester Boddy, bought 100,000 plants, enabling
Uyematsu to close down his nursery and bank a bit of cash before
his family was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-century later, the flowers still put on a
breathtaking show in the early morning, when sunlight filters
through a mist of fog over Descanso's Japanese Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest-blooming varieties of camellias set flowers in
midfall, or whenever the daytime temperature dips consistently
below 75 degrees, but the blossoms won't open until temperatures
hit 60 degrees. Other kinds of camellias bloom later, through the
winter and into the spring. Peak blooming time is usually in
February, although some varieties can continue to flower into the
late spring or even early summer if the weather is cool.
</P>
<P>
   Camellias are sort of a trick of nature. Their flowers are
gorgeous _ especially the multipetaled japonica _ and most people's
reaction is to plunge their nose into the blossoms for a sniff. But
they're almost always surprised; most camellias have little or no
fragrance _ bred for show, not for smell.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll probably never see a yellow camellia; the only yellow
found in the flowers you'll buy at the local nursery have yellow
pistils at the center of the white, pink or red flowers. Rare
yellow camellias have been found deep in the darkness of tropic
bamboo forests, and breeders have been working unsuccessfully for
years to cross the genes for the yellow petals with the
better-known _ and hardier _ varieties, said Thibault.

THE SMART MONEY IS ON COMMERCIAL WEB FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watch an hour of prime-time television this weekend and you
might conclude that retail is at the heart of today's Internet
world.
</P>
<P>
   Toys, books, sporting goods. The unprecedented barrage of
broadcast and print ads from Internet retailers is only going to
intensify between now and Christmas. But as the Web's ``e-tailers''
spend millions on media ads trying to woo the consumer this holiday
season, the smart money is moving in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, both venture capitalists and public stockholders, are
throwing huge sums of money at business-to-business Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Web companies that serve commercial rather than retail customers
are the latest hot thing because they sell into a much larger
market, often face less competition, and are more likely to hold
onto a customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business-to-business side is just going to be so much
bigger,'' said Stephen Demirjian of Westfield Capital Management, a
Boston investment firm with large technology holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The idea: Use the electronic medium to order and deliver most
things businesses buy from their suppliers, from paper clips to
industrial steel.
</P>
<P>
   Staples Inc. has separated the part of its business that
delivers office supplies over the Web and created a tracking stock
to follow its progress. RoweCom Inc. of Cambridge, which went
public this spring, organizes companywide purchases and
subscriptions to periodicals over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The best example of Internet money shifting around may be the
stocks of two companies known for their Web investing, CMGI Inc. of
Andover and Internet Capital Group Inc. of Wayne, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, a much more established company with huge investment wins
like Lycos Inc. and GeoCities under its belt, is valued at $16.8
billion by the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Capital Group, which went public just three months ago,
has a market value of $21 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The difference: Internet Capital Group targets
business-to-business ventures exclusively when it writes checks.
CMGI's investment portfolio of 50 companies is divided about
equally between consumer and commercial businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies have a track record for sensing the shifts in the
Internet world like CMGI. This week it announced plans to launch a
$1 billion investment pool, called the CMGI (at)Ventures B2B fund,
taking dead aim at the commercial world.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Internet Capital Group took steps to make the most of
its own staggering stock performance. This week the company said it
would split its stock 2-for-1 and sell 6 million new shares to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Capital Group shares, which went public in August at
12, traded at 165 1/2 this week.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI and Internet Capital Group are hardly alone. Venture
capital firms targeting the Internet, many of them raising new
pools of as much as $1 billion each, are spending much more money
on commercial Web ventures. As those small companies mature, the
business-to-business theme will become even more pronounced in the
flow of initial public stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the dot-com stories will have a
business-to-business angle for the foreseeable future,'' said
Michael Halloran, a Boston-based investment banker and managing
director of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Retail Internet businesses certainly continue to grow, but most
of the fattest consumer markets are served by a dozen or more
competitors today. What are the odds that the latest new bookseller
or stock brokerage is going to make it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming increasingly difficult for companies in the
consumer space to rise above the noise,'' said Brad Garlinghouse, a
general partner at (at)Ventures. ``There are a lot of Internet
companies clamoring for the customer's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Garlinghouse said the new (at)Ventures B2B fund is looking for
companies where conventional methods of delivering goods and
services to businesses are cumbersome or less efficient. ``The Web
is a great medium to eliminate some of those pains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger markets, less competition, better customer retention. It
sounds like Web nirvana. Don't get too carried away, said Bill
Burnham, a general partner at Softbank Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business-to-business market is a big opportunity but it's
going to follow the same, predictable cycle,'' said Burnham.
``There are going to be a few big winners, but there will also be a
lot of substandard companies that people will quickly forget about.
There's so much (Internet investment) money floating around looking
for the next big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Zefer Corp. of Cambridge would seem to be a shining example of
the rush to capitalize business-to-business Internet companies, the
recipient of a record $100 million in venture funding this year.
</P>
<P>
   Zefer, which advises firms moving out and expanding on the Web,
is in a prime position to measure where actual commerce is moving.
President William Seibel said Zefer's current clientele is split
between commercial and retail.
</P>
<P>
   That mix is expected to shift toward commercial work this year.
``But consumer business is doing nothing but growing at a 59
percent annual compound rate,'' said Seibel. ``That's not a market
to walk away from.''

GEORGE W. IS THE ``VELVET HAMMER'' OF THE BUSH FAMILY 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28 EDITIONS AND THEREAFTER)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1986, then-Vice President George Bush summoned
his family to the rustic presidential hideaway at Camp David to lay
out his plan for succeeding Ronald Reagan in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Bush's eldest son did not mince words.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush didn't much care for his dad's chief political
strategist, and he didn't hesitate to say so.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we know we can trust you?'' the younger Bush asked Lee
Atwater, a brilliant but personally erratic Republican operative
known for hardball tactics. Atwater responded with an offer that
many of Bush's friends believe help make him what he is today _ the
leading Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're so worried about my loyalty,'' said Atwater, who has
since died, ``why don't you come to Washington and help me with the
campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, then 40, accepted the challenge. He put aside his oil
business in Midland, moved his family to Washington and spent the
next 18 months in the controlled chaos of his father's 1988
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade later, Bush is applying the lessons he
learned to his own White House bid, hoping to become the first
president since John Quincy Adams to follow his father into the
nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and associates who worked with Bush during his father's
presidential years _ from the 1988 victory through the 1992 defeat
_ say the experience was a telling preview of Bush's approach to
politics and governing. The White House years also offer some
insights into a personality that combines good-ol'-boy affability
with drill-sergeant discipline. ___
</P>
<P>
   Former White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater remembers the
president's son as a convivial jokester who was unimpressed by the
trappings of the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president was making a speech, it would be George W.
and me in the back of the room smoking cigars and telling jokes,''
he said. ``Very seldom did George W. weigh in on policies or issues
or even people.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he did, he got results. As his father's eyes and ears
with the staff, Bush served as the family's Sonny Corleone, ever
vigilant for signs of disloyalty or incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the enforcer when I thought things were going wrong,''
he told Washington writer Ann Grimes in an interview for her 1990
book on political spouses. ``I had the ability to go and lay down
some behavioral modification.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most sensitive missions came in late 1991, when his
father asked George W. to begin laying the groundwork for the
president's re-election campaign. Nearly everyone the younger Bush
talked to agreed that White House chief of staff John Sununu had
become a liability.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the younger delivered the message to Sununu in a
face-to-face White House meeting. The blustery chief of staff
announced his resignation about a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Other encounters were less dramatic. When Atwater posed for
Esquire magazine in gym shorts, with his pants around his ankles,
Bush made him apologize to first lady Barbara Bush for his lack of
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W., as a member of the family, was the perfect
representative to try to instill loyalty,'' Fitzwater said.
``Anybody with any sense is intimidated by a member of the
president's family. That's just the way it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress and journalists were also subjected to
Bush's loyalty test.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate Republican from Connecticut, ran
afoul of Bush by voting against his father's 1989 legislative
program more than any other GOP lawmaker. To compound the affront,
Shays represented the congressional district where President Bush
spent his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The district was sprinkled with Bush family members, including
Dorothy Stapleton of South Norwalk, George W.'s cousin and Shay's
chief campaign fundraiser. Although the president's son was back in
Texas by then in his new job as managing partner of the Texas
Rangers baseball team, he still kept close watch on events in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior phoned me this afternoon about this and I reassured him
that I had already taken up the gauntlet,'' Stapleton told
President Bush in follow-up letter that is now on file at the
George Bush Library in College Station. Stapleton warned Shays that
his independence could bring a quick end to his congressional
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely got my attention,'' Shays recalled in an
interview. ``She was unhappy that the president's son was unhappy.
I was unhappy that my finance chairman was unhappy and the
president's was unhappy. He's a tough, sharp, intelligent,
take-no-prisoners kind of person.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington-based political reporters learned that George W.
could be a helpful ally or a vengeful enemy, depending on how he
felt about them. At times, his frustration over unfavorable stories
and unfriendly questions got the best of him.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1988 campaign, he cursed Al Hunt, then The Wall Street
Journal's Washington bureau chief, in front of Hunt's family during
a chance encounter at a restaurant. In the 1992 campaign, he ripped
off his microphone and stormed off the set when a Salt Lake City
television reporter started to ask about his father's personal
life. ___
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a velvet hammer. He can charm with the best of them, but
he can also cut you off at the knees if he thinks you've got it
coming,'' said Thomas DeFrank, who covered the Bush White House for
Newsweek.

 WASHINGTON: xxx for Newsweek. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DeFrank, a transplanted Texan and former Arlington resident who
developed a good relationship with the Bush family, got a taste of
Bush vengeance when his magazine published a cover story on the
``Wimp Factor'' in the early days of the 1988 campaign. DeFrank,
who had arranged for an insider's view of the campaign, got a call
from George W.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy,'' DeFrank said Bush told him, ``I've got some bad news
for you. You're out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   But DeFrank said the real lesson of that encounter was Bush's
next move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having delivered the message to me, George W. then quietly
worked on his dad to help work out a compromise,'' DeFrank said.
``It shows his pragmatism. He can be an enforcer, but he also
understands the value of good relations with the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Former campaign and presidential aides said Bush took a similar
approach with them, using punishment and reward to keep them in
line and motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He held people to very high standards, in some ways, higher
than his father,'' campaign consultant Charles Black said. ``He's a
very tough taskmaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 campaign also gave Bush a chance to forge some
alliances that have proved helpful in his own race. His
wide-ranging duties included shoring up his father's ties to
Christian conservatives, including Pat Robertson of the Christian
Coalition and James Dobson of Focus on the Family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed with him. I thought then that he
certainly had a political future,'' said the Rev. Jerry Falwell,
who is backing Bush's presidential bid. ___
</P>
<P>
   After his father's 1988 victory, Bush joined a handful of other
trusted advisers in doling out coveted jobs in the new
administration. Bush made sure that loyalists were rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does value loyalty,'' said David Bates, who also served on
the screening committee. ``He's not one to forget anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush continued to offer advice and job recommendations even
after his return to Texas. When Donald Ensenat, a college
fraternity brother, suggested a judicial candidate for a Louisiana
vacancy, Bush forwarded the proposal to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Ensenat is a very good man and a good friend of all
Bushes,'' the president's son explained in a handwritten note to
White House counsel C. Boyden Gray. Ensenat was later rewarded with
his own appointment as ambassador to Brunei.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his advice was more personal. In another note, Bush told
a White House aide that one of his jogging buddies, a physician who
specialized in sleep disorders, might be able to help his father
get more rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for the thoughtful letter. But I do not have
insomnia,'' the president wrote back. ``Only when I have jet lag do
I have any trouble sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush was less involved in his father's 1992 campaign,
the failed re-election bid also offered some valuable lessons. In
contrast to 1988, the campaign was plagued by complacency,
in-fighting and disorganization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just bad. The whole feel to it was different,'' Bates
said. ``The campaign was trying to dig out of a hole. We were
beleaguered. There wasn't a great esprit de corps.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush bristled at any criticism of his father, and his
frustration was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the 1988 campaign, my dad was able to define himself.
In 1992, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan defined him,
and he lost in a long miserable year,'' Bush wrote in his recently
published memoir, A Charge to Keep.
</P>
<P>
   On election day, the family gathered in Texas at the Houstonian
Hotel to await the outcome. Late that afternoon, George W. Bush,
checked the exit polls and announced the results to his family:
Clinton was going to be the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzwater left the room to let the president and his family deal
with their agony alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just very somber and solemn, a sadness that was just
too personal for me to be a part of,'' he said. ``For the people
around a losing candidate, especially family, it's an enormous kind
of loss that I think stays with you forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But the experience also gave George W. Bush rare insights for
first-time presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's learned not to take anything for granted,'' Bates
said. ``I don't think there's anything that's going to happen in a
campaign that he hasn't seen.''

   It is hard not to believe in Jeff Bezos. His gurgling laugh
explodes any suspicion that the story he spins so effortlessly may
be just a little too slick, a little too removed from the
murderously competitive world of Web retailing that Amazon has done
so much to shape.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the wild gyrations of Amazon's share price over the
past year caused its founder and chief executive to lose sleep.
Bezos manages to be simultaneously both bouncy and imperturbable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these are testing times. Only 16 months ago Amazon sold
nothing but books. Last week the company opened four new ``stores''
_ home improvement, software, video games and presents _ to join
music, electronics, toys, DVD/video, auctions and its ``shop the
Web'' portal, zShops.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, it expects to add as many new businesses again.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos is placing a huge bet that Amazon can dominate just about
every big category of Web retailing. He expects that before long
Amazon.com will be a ``destination site'' where customers can find
anything they could possibly want and be certain, no matter what
they buy, of impeccable service.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, he says, will be the ``most customer-centric company in
the world.'' But it is also possible that Amazon is overreaching
itself in an ill-judged rush to become the Wal-Mart of the Web
(Wal-Mart's own online efforts have got off to a slow start).
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Bezos take for granted the willingness of Amazon's
investors indefinitely to tolerate the firm's accelerating
operating losses, particularly if, in spite of its relentless
expansion, sales growth continues to slow.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, Bezos is a persuasive advocate of the
course he has set _ were he not, Amazon would hardly be worth $25
billion today.
</P>
<P>
   Although Amazon is now in many businesses, he maintains that
they are all essentially similar, and that ``tremendous'' scale
economies can be reaped by ``extending the technology platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon can cut shipping costs by parcelling together different
types of purchase. Expensively developed features, such as Amazon's
proprietary ``one-click'' buying, can be made to work across the
entire range of goods it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, according to Bezos, is there any danger of Amazon becoming
a dull generalist. Like a diversified publisher, Amazon can offer
expert advice and information in every category, with the best
editorial teams lured by the promise of valuable share options and
its ability to out-invest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As for the worry that Amazon is stretching its elastic young
brand too far, Bezos argues that this is to miss the point. Such is
the sophistication of the firm's software that coming to Amazon
will not be like entering the halls of a huge, soulless department
store. It will be more like stopping by at a local shop where your
every taste and preference is known.
</P>
<P>
   And the threat from Wal-Mart when it really gets going on the
Web? Not focused enough, retorts Bezos; online and offline
businesses are just not the same.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, compelling though the Bezos vision may be, there are signs
of restlessness in the ranks of generally admiring Wall Street
Internet analysts, five of whom downgraded their rating of the
firm's shares after Amazon's third-quarter results a couple of
weeks ago. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch, who made his name
last year by setting what seemed an impossibly ambitious
share-price target for the firm, and was promptly proved right.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget was upset by Amazon's apparent unconcern in projecting a
massive increase in future losses without a corresponding
improvement in forecast revenues. Such nonchalance was becoming
``numbingly routine.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, he said, investors will tire of postponed
gratification. Blodget worries that Amazon spends more to generate
revenues than he ever thought possible: whatever Bezos says about
synergies, Amazon seems to be facing decreasing returns to scale.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget still supports Amazon's expansion and believes it will
eventually pay off, but he is concerned that investors may not want
to stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos is not terribly sympathetic, suggesting that only those in
for the long haul should invest. He acknowledges, however, that
Amazon has been amazingly free to spend money almost without limit
_ and that this freedom won't last forever, especially if the firm
continues to burn through capital at a rate of about $250 million a
quarter. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is more worrying is the possibility that Amazon may be
going in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   There are many _ most of them, admittedly, rivals _ who think
that Amazon's insatiable appetite will be its undoing. They say the
Web, with its indifference to distance and place, is ideally suited
not to general stores but to ``category killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is eToys, eBay (auctions), CDNow, Outpost (computers
and software), Home Depot, Reel.com (videos) or Garden.com, they
and hundreds of like-minded competitors think specialists
understand their customers better and can provide superior service
and lower prices than a generalist such as Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   By coming together in virtual shopping malls organized by
portals such as Yahoo! and America Online, they argue, they can
also offer web shoppers a greater range of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Christmas will provide some clues as to who is right.
Jupiter Communications, an e-commerce market-research firm, expects
Americans to buy $5 billion worth of products on the Internet in
November and December.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, when Jupiter predicts that Christmas e-spending will
reach nearly $80 billion, there should be enough business for both
Amazon and the best specialists to thrive. Assuming that Bezos has
not made a hash of things, Amazon may by then even have turned a
profit. &QL;

`Myth' gives slightest of peeks behind Jackie O legend &HT;     (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;     Our rating:   3 stars 
 &HT;    (Eds: Not for use before Monday, Nov. 29) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom) &HT;    By ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Watching ``Jackie: Behind the Myth'' makes you wonder what
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis would have been like had she been born
20 or 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1929, Jackie was very much a product of her times and
upper-class social status. She was charming, a debutante with an
Audrey Hepburn quality. Her career as a journalist _ the inquiring
photographer for the Washington Times-Herald _ was a brief
interlude until she married John F. Kennedy, the junior senator
from Massachusetts and most eligible bachelor in town. She had set
her sights on him so she wouldn't lead the ordinary life that she
feared.
</P>
<P>
   She then played the dutiful wife and mother, working behind the
scenes, offering suggestions for her husband's speeches and finding
ways to promote the arts by bringing entertainers such as classical
cellist Pablo Casals to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In her famous television tour of the redesigned White House in
1962, she was asked about what role the government should play in
aiding the arts. Jackie sidestepped the question, saying it was
complicated and that she thought the White House should have the
best. Unlike, say, Hillary Clinton, Jackie did not see herself as a
full partner in the administration, but she was perhaps the most
effective first lady this country has had since Eleanor Roosevelt.
Both the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and the Kennedy
Library in Boston owe much of their existence to her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But like the current first lady, she had a straying husband.
Jackie was no stranger to this kind of behavior _ her own mother
had divorced her father when Jackie was 11, a victim of his
philandering ways. In the documentary, Pierre Salinger tells about
being confronted by a reporter about the president having
mistresses. He says his reply was that the president spent 15 to 16
hours a day running the country, and if he were having some
extracurricular activity, so what. Salinger says he never heard
anything again from the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   While this may be relevant as a historic note about how times
have changed, it tells us nothing about Jackie. The only allusion
the documentary makes about how she might feel about JFK's affairs
is an observation from a friend that Jackie had the ability to pull
a ``curtain'' over some parts of her life. Given how she adored her
father despite his indiscretions _ and was upset when her mother
conspired to keep him away from her wedding _ and looked away from
her husband's transgressions, there is no attempt in the
documentary to examine this.
</P>
<P>
   Does this documentary really tell us the story of ``Jackie:
Behind the Myth''? No. Like the Salinger quote, there is too much
information about events and such that don't deal directly with the
woman and her struggles. Its tone is also too reverential, not a
sainted portrait per se, but one that refuses to go too deep and
that glosses over other events. The assassination of Robert F.
Kennedy on June 6, 1968, clearly was a factor in her marriage to
Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis a little more than four
months later, but this is only mentioned in passing. Nor is there
any real explanation about the turbulence at the end of their
marriage just before Onassis died in 1975 in Greece. It is simply
noted that she was in New York City at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the documentary succeeds to a degree despite itself, and
that is because of Jackie. She was a fascinating character on the
world stage, who through her poise (look at her at JFK's funeral),
style (a glamorous first lady who wore designer clothes) and taste
(she chose relatively unknown architect I.M. Pei to design the
Kennedy Library, helping to spark his career) has had a lasting
influence on culture.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, she begin a career as a book editor and edited more
than 100 books over the next 16 years until her death from cancer
in 1994. Hearing testaments about Jackie's encouragement from
authors such as Peter Sis, who wrote a children's book for her,
gives the viewer a glimpse into Jackie's depths.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary contains no mention of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
death this year, though there are numerous shots of his youth. It
does offer one tantalizing tidbit _ Jackie left behind tapes to be
played after her last child has died.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it will be up to future historians to give us the
real Jackie behind the myth. This documentary will give you only a
taste. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard not to believe in Jeff Bezos. His gurgling laugh
explodes any suspicion that the story he spins so effortlessly may
be just a little too slick, a little too removed from the
murderously competitive world of Web retailing that Amazon has done
so much to shape.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the wild gyrations of Amazon's share price over the
past year caused its founder and chief executive to lose sleep.
Bezos manages to be simultaneously both bouncy and imperturbable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these are testing times. Only 16 months ago Amazon sold
nothing but books. Last week the company opened four new ``stores''
_ home improvement, software, video games and presents _ to join
music, electronics, toys, DVD/video, auctions and its ``shop the
Web'' portal, zShops.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, it expects to add as many new businesses again.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos is placing a huge bet that Amazon can dominate just about
every big category of Web retailing. He expects that before long
Amazon.com will be a ``destination site'' where customers can find
anything they could possibly want and be certain, no matter what
they buy, of impeccable service.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, he says, will be the ``most customer-centric company in
the world.'' But it is also possible that Amazon is overreaching
itself in an ill-judged rush to become the Wal-Mart of the Web
(Wal-Mart's own online efforts have got off to a slow start).
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Bezos take for granted the willingness of Amazon's
investors indefinitely to tolerate the firm's accelerating
operating losses, particularly if, in spite of its relentless
expansion, sales growth continues to slow.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, Bezos is a persuasive advocate of the
course he has set _ were he not, Amazon would hardly be worth $25
billion today.
</P>
<P>
   Although Amazon is now in many businesses, he maintains that
they are all essentially similar, and that ``tremendous'' scale
economies can be reaped by ``extending the technology platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon can cut shipping costs by parcelling together different
types of purchase. Expensively developed features, such as Amazon's
proprietary ``one-click'' buying, can be made to work across the
entire range of goods it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, according to Bezos, is there any danger of Amazon becoming
a dull generalist. Like a diversified publisher, Amazon can offer
expert advice and information in every category, with the best
editorial teams lured by the promise of valuable share options and
its ability to out-invest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As for the worry that Amazon is stretching its elastic young
brand too far, Bezos argues that this is to miss the point. Such is
the sophistication of the firm's software that coming to Amazon
will not be like entering the halls of a huge, soulless department
store. It will be more like stopping by at a local shop where your
every taste and preference is known.
</P>
<P>
   And the threat from Wal-Mart when it really gets going on the
Web? Not focused enough, retorts Bezos; online and offline
businesses are just not the same.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, compelling though the Bezos vision may be, there are signs
of restlessness in the ranks of generally admiring Wall Street
Internet analysts, five of whom downgraded their rating of the
firm's shares after Amazon's third-quarter results a couple of
weeks ago. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch, who made his name
last year by setting what seemed an impossibly ambitious
share-price target for the firm, and was promptly proved right.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget was upset by Amazon's apparent unconcern in projecting a
massive increase in future losses without a corresponding
improvement in forecast revenues. Such nonchalance was becoming
``numbingly routine.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, he said, investors will tire of postponed
gratification. Blodget worries that Amazon spends more to generate
revenues than he ever thought possible: whatever Bezos says about
synergies, Amazon seems to be facing decreasing returns to scale.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget still supports Amazon's expansion and believes it will
eventually pay off, but he is concerned that investors may not want
to stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos is not terribly sympathetic, suggesting that only those in
for the long haul should invest. He acknowledges, however, that
Amazon has been amazingly free to spend money almost without limit
_ and that this freedom won't last forever, especially if the firm
continues to burn through capital at a rate of about $250 million a
quarter. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is more worrying is the possibility that Amazon may be
going in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   There are many _ most of them, admittedly, rivals _ who think
that Amazon's insatiable appetite will be its undoing. They say the
Web, with its indifference to distance and place, is ideally suited
not to general stores but to ``category killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is eToys, eBay (auctions), CDNow, Outpost (computers
and software), Home Depot, Reel.com (videos) or Garden.com, they
and hundreds of like-minded competitors think specialists
understand their customers better and can provide superior service
and lower prices than a generalist such as Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   By coming together in virtual shopping malls organized by
portals such as Yahoo! and America Online, they argue, they can
also offer web shoppers a greater range of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Christmas will provide some clues as to who is right.
Jupiter Communications, an e-commerce market-research firm, expects
Americans to buy $5 billion worth of products on the Internet in
November and December.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, when Jupiter predicts that Christmas e-spending will
reach nearly $80 billion, there should be enough business for both
Amazon and the best specialists to thrive. Assuming that Bezos has
not made a hash of things, Amazon may by then even have turned a
profit. &QL;

<P>
   It is an irony worth pondering that, a week before the World
Trade Organization meets in Seattle, the entire child population of
America is enslaved by a Japanese fad.
</P>
<P>
   The most heartfelt complaint of globalization's critics is that
the process leads inexorably to the triumph of American pop
culture. The French believe this so strongly that they have
repeatedly threatened to scupper trade talks unless ``cultural''
goods are exempted.
</P>
<P>
   The world's nongovernmental organizations believe it so strongly
that a collection of them have placed a series of huge
advertisements in the New York Times complaining about the
McDonaldization of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But any trade negotiator who feels tempted to agree should take
the precaution of consulting a ten-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' _ parents, note that threatening
adjective _ raked in over $50 million over its opening weekend; and
when a Los Angeles radio station announced a contest for free
tickets, 70,000 calls a minute overwhelmed its switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   A television series based on the Japanese pocket monsters is the
most popular children's program in the country. More than 50
million Pokemon game cards have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The five top-selling video games are all Pokemon-themed.
Pokemon.com is the most popular Web site for children of 12 and
under, and eBay, an Internet auction house, is doing a roaring
business in rare Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   The British are not far behind the Japanese in the race to
seduce America's children. The literary sensation of the summer was
J.K. Rowling's trilogy about Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is so lathered up about the child wizard that all the
town's leading directors, from Steven Spielberg to Barry Levinson,
are squabbling over the rights to direct the film and Time Warner,
the studio that owns the rights to the books, is muttering about a
billion-dollar franchise, with sequels, television shows, cartoon
spin-offs, theme-park rides, interactive games and merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   And for younger children yet another British product, the
Teletubbies, is almost as popular as that quintessentially American
program, ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   This triple invasion not only disproves the idea that Americans
have a monopoly of popular culture. It also disproves the idea that
non-Americans have a monopoly of silly complaints about the evils
of popular culture, particularly the foreign-made variety.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Falwell, a televangelist, played on a widespread American
suspicion that the British favor homosexuals when he ``outed'' one
of the Teletubbies, Tinky Winky, on the ground that he carries a
handbag.
</P>
<P>
   Other evangelists have called for the Harry Potter books to be
banned for promoting superstition and witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine calls Pokemon a ``pestilential Ponzi scheme'' that
encourages acquisitiveness and aggression. It also portrays its
inventor as a Japanese misfit who obsessively collected beetles as
a child.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek asks ``Is Pokemon evil?'' (though, to be fair, it
answers ``probably not'').
</P>
<P>
   A San Diego law firm has filed a class-action suit against the
manufacturer of Pokemon cards on the ground that they promote
illegal gambling; and a Colorado preacher required children in his
congregation to watch as he torched Pokemon cards and chopped up a
Pokemon toy with a sword.
</P>
<P>
   An important part of the anti-globalist growl is that global
companies are marketing fads to children with a ruthlessness that
verges on the obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro is indeed churning out licensed toys and collectibles.
Burger King is giving away 57 varieties of Pokemon in a $22 million
promotion. The Pokemon television show functions as a relentless
advertisement for a cavalcade of products.
</P>
<P>
   There is something in the fad for every age. Toys pull in young
children, who then move on to cards and other collectibles before
finally graduating to Nintendo's video games. And there is more to
come: a hundred more Pokemon on their way from Japan to add to the
151 that have already arrived on America's shores. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of the conclusions that anti-globalists draw from this
evidence of ruthlessness are mistaken. They are wrong to argue that
everything is being reduced to marketing, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder bins of the world's toyshops are full of brilliant
ideas that were dreamed up by marketing departments only to be
forcefully rejected by children. And the people behind the latest
fads sweeping through young America are mavericks, not cynical
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   J.K. Rowling is a publicity-shy divorcee who wrote her first
Harry Potter book when she was on the dole.
</P>
<P>
   Satoshi Tajiri, the man behind Pokemon, persisted with his idea
even when Nintendo told him that technology was passing it by.
</P>
<P>
   He then persisted with it again when Nintendo America told him
that role-playing games were not popular with the local children,
and when a bizarre incident, in which 700 Japanese children had
fits while watching a Pokemon television program, put the idea of
exporting the craze under a cloud. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM; STORY CAN STAND HERE AT 825, OR CONTINUE TO

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The anti-globalists are also wrong when they argue that
conglomerates inevitably homogenize the ideas that they choose to
hoover up. Some of the Pokemon have certainly had their names
westernized: Zenigame, a turtle who squirts water, has became
Squirtle, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But the little monsters still teach distinctively Japanese
values about the importance of team-building and performing your
duties. The only way to succeed at the game is to cooperate with
others _ and the easiest way to fail is to neglect to care for your
charges.
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk in Hollywood about setting the filmed
version of Harry Potter in an American school, Hogwarts High,
complete with cheerleaders and a blonde girlfriend. But the moguls
soon decided that Britishness is part of the book's charm.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, played by a British actor, will still attend a
1,000-year-old school with crenellated towers and a Latin motto.
Hermione will not change her name to Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon will soon be history; with luck, the sickeningly
cute Teletubbies will be history even sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of children will find a new craze to fill
their time and soak up their parents' money. But why so many
cultural protectionists assume that the craze will be dreamed up by
some faceless American corporation rather than by a Japanese
bug-collector or a British welfare mother is getting more
mysterious by the day. &QL;

promotion. The Pokemon television show functions as a relentless
advertisement for a cavalcade of products.
</P>
<P>
   There is something in the fad for every age. Toys pull in young
children, who then move on to cards and other collectibles before
finally graduating to Nintendo's video games. And there is more to
come: a hundred more Pokemon on their way from Japan to add to the
151 that have already arrived on America's shores. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Yet many of the conclusions that anti-globalists draw from this
evidence of ruthlessness are mistaken. They are wrong to argue that
everything is being reduced to marketing, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder bins of the world's toyshops are full of brilliant
ideas that were dreamed up by marketing departments only to be
forcefully rejected by children. And the people behind the latest
fads sweeping through young America are mavericks, not cynical
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   J.K. Rowling is a publicity-shy divorcee who wrote her first
Harry Potter book when she was on the dole.
</P>
<P>
   Satoshi Tajiri, the man behind Pokemon, persisted with his idea
even when Nintendo told him that technology was passing it by.
</P>
<P>
   He then persisted with it again when Nintendo America told him
that role-playing games were not popular with the local children,
and when a bizarre incident, in which 700 Japanese children had
fits while watching a Pokemon television program, put the idea of
exporting the craze under a cloud. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM; STORY CAN STAND HERE AT 825, OR CONTINUE TO

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The anti-globalists are also wrong when they argue that
conglomerates inevitably homogenize the ideas that they choose to
hoover up. Some of the Pokemon have certainly had their names
westernized: Zenigame, a turtle who squirts water, has became
Squirtle, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But the little monsters still teach distinctively Japanese
values about the importance of team-building and performing your
duties. The only way to succeed at the game is to cooperate with
others _ and the easiest way to fail is to neglect to care for your
charges.
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk in Hollywood about setting the filmed
version of Harry Potter in an American school, Hogwarts High,
complete with cheerleaders and a blonde girlfriend. But the moguls
soon decided that Britishness is part of the book's charm.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, played by a British actor, will still attend a
1,000-year-old school with crenellated towers and a Latin motto.
Hermione will not change her name to Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon will soon be history; with luck, the sickeningly
cute Teletubbies will be history even sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of children will find a new craze to fill
their time and soak up their parents' money. But why so many
cultural protectionists assume that the craze will be dreamed up by
some faceless American corporation rather than by a Japanese
bug-collector or a British welfare mother is getting more
mysterious by the day. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-TALKS (Belfast) _ The grim, unyielding men from the
remote poles of Ulster politics were still getting adjusted to
being seated side by side around a dining room table when their
host hit them with another novelty. George Mitchell told a joke at
the expense of his listeners, men with absolutely no history of
enjoying being made fun of. But they laughed. That moment may have
been the opening of the wall that came down in the last few weeks
as the seemingly dead Northern Ireland peace plan has revived. By
Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   MALASIA-POLITICS (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) _ Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad is all but certain to win a parliamentary election
next week, but already, to many people here, he seems like a relic
of the past. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   URUGUAY-POLITICS (Montevideo, Uruguay) _ While driving to his
congressional office the other morning, Senator-elect Jose Mujica
took a trip down memory lane to the days when he was imprisoned for
his guerrilla activities by the military dictatorship that ruled
here in the 1970s and '80s. ``Becoming a Senator never entered my
mind,'' he said. ``It just goes to show that if you wait long
enough, the impossible can happen.'' It has been a 35-year wait
since a handful of student and labor radicals launched a daring
urban guerrilla war. After Sunday's runoff presidential election
they will finally take power _ or at least a piece of it _ but
nonviolently, at the ballot box. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-STYLE (Stratham, N.H.) _ When George W. Bush is not
reciting memorized lines during an official speech or rendering
careful answers during a formal interview, he is folksy and feisty,
a politician more playful than most of his peers. This disarming
demeanor goes a long way toward explaining the commitment and
confidence of Bush's core Republican supporters. But Bush's looser,
lighter style also contributes, fairly or not, to the questions
that opponents and reporters have raised about his intellectual
maturity. By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   FINANCIAL
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in ``f'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-SHOPPING (Undated) _ The sights and sounds of the
opening day of the Christmas shopping season. Retailers are very
bullish, yet discounters and department stores are trumpeting big
sales to induce consumers to shop in person instead of online. By
Leslie Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   EURO-DOLLAR (Frankfurt) _ The euro dropped as low as $1.0082
against the dollar, its lowest level yet after starting last
January at $1.16675. It also fell against the yen and the pound,
but the European Central Bank indicated it would not buy euros to
try to bolster its value. Still, the bank's president, Wim
Duisenberg, was quoted as saying he had ``some concern'' about the
decline. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   BRITIAN-BANKS (London) _ Seeking to head off a rival counterbid,
Bank of Scotland raised its hostile takeover offer for National
Westminster Bank to to $41.3 billion as it audaciously attempts to
acquire an institution twice its size to produce Britain's second
largest bank. It is not clear whether the new offer is big enough
to discourage an bid from the Royal Bank of Scotland. By Andrew
Ross Sorkin.
</P>
<P>
   CULTURE
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in ``e'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   EVEREST-MALLORY (Undated) _ Putting yourself in the boots of a
dead stranger to deduce what he thought and did in his final hours
is a detective's technique. But when the death occurred more than
75 years ago in one of the most remote points of the earth, the
task seems nigh impossible. The discovery on May 1 of the frozen
body of George Leigh Mallory high on Mount Everest has revived a
decades-old debate about what happened to Mallory and his young
companion, Andrew Irvine, on June 8, 1924, when they attempted the
first ascent of the world's highest mountain. By Christopher S.
Wren.

<P>
   TRADE-REVIEW (Washington) _ They are pouring into Seattle this
weekend in vans and on buses, by air and on foot _ the college
students and the church groups, the environmental activists, the
Teamsters, Ralph Nader, Chinese dissidents and the man who became a
hero in France for defacing a McDonalds. All of them say they are
outraged at the growing power of a group few even heard about five
years ago, the World Trade Organization. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-REVIEW (Washington) _ Fair or unfair, the portrayals of
presidential candidates by the news media, the pundits and the
late-night comics are often exaggerated. But perhaps because these
images are often founded on some truth, they can be impossible for
politicians to overcome. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   AIR-TRAVEL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Here are some of the things that
airline flight attendants have watched passengers lug on board:
Mariachi hats, potted palms, boogie boards, shopping bags brimming
with canned hams, a live duck in a cage, cases of wine,
covered-dish casseroles, multi-tiered wedding cakes, a
three-foot-tall religious statue for lawn display, an automobile
transmission and a freshly severed buck's head with its antlers
poking out of a trash bag. And they're carting a lot more stuff
aboard than ever before. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-RACE-REVIEW (Washington) _ At first, the survey results
seemed depressingly familiar: Nearly two-thirds of those who
responded in a poll said they had had a racially-offensive
encounter with a colleague during the 12 previous months. What is
startling about the latest manifestation of divergent racial
perceptions is the setting in which they occurred. This was the
military, an institution that has been held up as the paragon of
racial integration, tolerance and equal opportunity. By Steven A.
Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   LAWYERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Soon after EgyptAir Flight 990
plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, the personal-injury lawyers at R.
Jack Clapp and Associates marshaled their resources and mobilized
their forces. Faster than you can say class-action lawsuit, the
Washington, D.C., firm, which specializes in aviation disasters,
launched EgyptAir990.com _ a Web site that at first blush appears
primarily concerned with helping the bereaved deal with loss, but
on closer examination is all about financial gain. Such on-line
opportunism hardly burnishes the flagging reputation of lawyers. By
David Wallas.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ Once, Internet search sites served
as helpful road maps. With advances in artificial intelligence, one
day they might be brilliant secretaries. But today, they are in a
state of transition, slouching toward the human, growing more
philosophical. Mixing mechanical and personal elements, they have
turned into accidental wisefolk, spiritual advisers and drive-by
psychoanalysts. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST-FAMILIES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The White House has often
seemed confining to the wives of the men who lived there. Hillary
Rodham Clinton, seeking power that she did not have to exercise
through her husband, announced last week that she was moving to
Chappaqua, N.Y. Mrs. Clinton is not the first president's wife to
find the White House stifling and to leave a husband rattling
around in the whitewashed old pile on Pennsylvania Avenue. Several
presidential wives sought refuge from the burdens of first
ladyship. By John N. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Timlje, Kosovo) _ The former Kosovo Liberation
Army, which has supposedly transformed itself into a civilian force
with no military or police responsibilities, is not the only
challenge to the authority of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, known as
Unmik; the mission is also undermined by the international civilian
agencies that are supposed to serve it, and by the sheer size and
resources of the NATO-led force here _ 42,000 troops _ whose role
tends to be defined only as peacekeeping. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-COMRADE-REVIEW (Undated) _ It was perhaps no surprise that
the latest edition of China's dictionary of record, Cihai (The Sea
of Words), narrowed the definition of the word comrade _ or tongzhi
_ out of everyday life, concluding that it could no longer be
regarded as the greeting among China's citizens. By Elisabeth
Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-REVIEW (Washington) _ A new question has entered the
calculations of those who plan for peace or war in the Middle East:
Would democracies or dictatorships make the best neighbors and
partners in the emerging peace with Israel? By Jane Perlez.
</P>

   BRITAIN-LETTERS-REVIEW (London) _ There remains a place where
letter-writing lives _ England. By Sarah Lyall.

   MIAMI-HOLIDAY (Miami Beach) _ For party pilgrims, this billion
dollar sandbar is Plymouth Rock. Over this four-day Thanksgiving
weekend, Miami Beach is full of visitors thankful to be celebrating
freedom from the holiday traditions of traffic, indigestion and
even family. Clearly, they are making up their own traditions as
they went along. By Bob Morris. Photo. &QL;

<P>
   SENIOR-FASHION (New York) _ The faces of women in their 40s, 50s
and even 60s, which with few exceptions were once confined to Mop &AMP;
Glo or Geritol ads, are now turning up in all kinds of fashion and
beauty marketing. From Bergdorf Goodman, Brooks Brothers and
Bloomingdale's, which are including older women in catalogs and ad
campaigns, to the designer Jean Paul Gaultier, who signed off his
runway show for fall and winter 1999 in Paris with an older,
white-haired bride and bridegroom, the mature model is invading
territory once held exclusively by extreme youth. By Anne Jarrell.

   NITEOUT-SILVER/FARRELL (New York) _ Matt E. Silver, the rave
music producer, anxiously paced the bar at Wetlands on Tuesday
night, waiting for his friend, the alternative rock star Perry
Farrell, to speak. The Spitfire college speaking tour had hit New
York. The tour features musicians, actors like Woody Harrelson, and
advocates speaking on topics ranging from the legalization of
marijuana to vegetarianism. By Douglas Century. Photo. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HARLEM-FASHION-AFFAIR (New York) _ It was no ordinary night on
122nd Street. The crowd of about 100 people pressed into the carved
cherrywood corners of Martha Chandler Dolly's historic brownstone,
turned out in an assortment of little black dresses, tiny
spectacles and wildly coifed dreadlocks. A troupe of models wearing
battle-weary expressions stepped Kabuki-like through the house,
displaying the fall and spring collections of Epperson, a SoHo
fashion designer. By Nina Siegal. Photo. &QL;

<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ My bougainvillea-in-a-basket was an
attempt to bring a touch of the tropics to my sun deck in
Pennsylvania, to which end I spent months feeding, watering,
pinching and otherwise cosseting a couple of rooted cuttings. By
Cass Peterson. &QL;

WHERE THE BOUGAINVILEA GROWS WILDLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CASS PETERSON 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was content with a blooming bougainvillea in a 10-inch hanging
basket until I saw a 20-foot-long hedge of bougainvillea so densely
covered with scarlet blossoms that it appeared to have no foliage
at all.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look like a flowering vine. It looked like the base of
a float for the annual Tournament of Roses Parade.
</P>
<P>
   My bougainvillea-in-a-basket was an attempt to bring a touch of
the tropics to my sun deck in Pennsylvania, to which end I spent
months feeding, watering, pinching and otherwise cosseting a couple
of rooted cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   The towering spreading hedge of bougainvillea was clambering
over a derelict wooden corral at the edge of a dusty road in
Mhende, a village in rural Zimbabwe. Someone planted it there
deliberately, but it certainly had not been watered, fed or given
one iota of attention since.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing humbles a gardener more thoroughly than seeing, robust
and lush in its natural habitat, a plant that one can grow only as
a pale representation and then only with the most diligent of care.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen potted crotons have died under my ministrations, for
example, but on the Pacific coast of Mexico, crotons grow through
the cracks in sidewalks. Where they are not native _ which
certainly includes my living room _ crotons are finicky plants, and
fanciers spend time and effort making them comfortable. Where they
are native, they're uprooted as weeds and cast aside without a
qualm.
</P>
<P>
   I was humbled repeatedly during a recent visit to Zimbabwe, in
sub-Saharan Africa, during its spring when the jacaranda is in full
bloom. I know I cannot have jacaranda, with its clouds of lavender
blossoms, because it is a tropical tree. It won't survive outdoors
in my climate, and it's far too large to fit into a pot indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can I grow the glorious tropical shrub called
yesterday-today-and-tomorrow (Brunfelsia australis), which scents
the air so sweetly. It grows to 10 feet or more, and bears fragrant
flowers that open deep purple and fade gradually to white, so that
the shrub is covered in blossoms of white and purple and every
shade between. An eight-foot-tall poinsettia in the front yard is
probably out of the question, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even my favorite annual flowers offer different gardening
possibilities in Africa, where nothing seems to respect a season. I
think of dahlias as a late-summer flower, and pansies as a spring
bloomer, but in the public gardens of Harare, Zimbabwe's capital
city, they bloom contentedly together.
</P>
<P>
   Snapdragons, which are so cold-tolerant that I can set out
seedlings in frosty March, bloom side by side with lily of the Nile
and calla lilies, both tropical bulbs that I would not dare plant
outside until late May or June.
</P>
<P>
   In rural areas, where the scarcity of water precludes growing
many purely decorative plants, I find more reasons to be humbled,
not to mention envious.
</P>
<P>
   The yucca clump by my mailbox in Pennsylvania is there for
ornamental reasons, and each year I look forward to seeing the
towering spikes of creamy flowers over its swordlike leaves. But a
border of plants near a rural homestead put my display to shame.
</P>
<P>
   The plants appeared to be some yucca relative in the Agave
family, easily five feet tall, with mottled green foliage that had
a broad, luminous yellow strip down the center of each leaf. They
were not in bloom, and when I asked its owner what the flowers
looked like, he seemed puzzled at the question.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are not there to look at, he explained, but to
provide a supply of fiber to make baskets and to repair thethatched roofs of his buildings. With a shrug, he indicated that
the flowers were tall, and beyond that, he could not describe them.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the flowers that bloom along the rural roadsides are
noticed and valued for their usefulness, not their beauty. If they
are common but not particularly useful, they are scorned as
thoroughly as are crotons in coastal Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   I grow golden ageratum or African daisy (Lonas annua) for its
sunny yellow flowers _ nice in the garden and as a filler flower
for fresh bouquets. It also keeps its color well when dried for
winter arrangements. My African daisies grow in a row, the better
to keep them weeded and watered and to make it easy to cut each
precious stem.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, African daisies bloom in large numbers on the side
of the road, where they are casually trodden underfoot, as we would
walk across a bed of dandelions.
</P>
<P>
   Less likely to be stepped on is the common wildflower called
soso in Shona, the language spoken most widely in Zimbabwe. It's a
creeping plant with gray-green, slightly fuzzy leaves and lovely
lipped flowers that resemble pink foxgloves. I was able to identify
it as Dicerocaryum zanguebarium.
</P>
<P>
   Soso is an annual plant, and it looks worth trying in
Pennsylvania if I can find a source for the seeds. Zimbabweans
avoid crushing it underfoot in deference to its usefulness. It
contains a compound that makes a lather and is used as a soap
substitute. It's also valued by native herbalists to ease the pain
of childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   I've no objection to the concept of ``pretty is as pretty
does,'' especially when the plants fulfill both roles so admirably.
Even the bougainvillea, as it turns out, was not growing over the
corral purely as decoration. The vine is well provided with sharp
thorns _ a little extra persuasion to keep the livestock inside the
fence.

sold out its three debut concerts in a small movie theater. They
can play George Michael and Dire Straits, but not sing the lyrics.
Crowds cannot dance, but they occasionally sing the words they know
from their black-market cassette collections. Some of the women
asked for autographs of the would-be stars, but Mojhimi felt like
he could not really hit his riffs without endangering his right to
rock. ``The electric guitar,'' he said, ``is not familiar to my
government.'' But, as the strict codes of Iran are loosening up,
the electric guitar is finding its audience. The three recent shows
pushed rock and roll further to the edge than any time since the
Islamic Revolution and highlighted the new ``pop music'' phenomenon
in Tehran. ``This means the government and ministry are interested
in the arts,'' said concert-goer Navid Assar, a business student.
``It can be a kind of freedom.'' (Kaplow, Cox News Service). WITH

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably mild, moist air will be pushed off the Northeast
Coast as a cold front reaches eastern New England. Rain will
persist into the afternoon from Cape Cod, Mass., through Maine.
Clouds will break inland and sunshine will dominate by late morning
in the Middle Atlantic region, east of the Appalachians. A drier,
somewhat cooler air flow from the west will bring temperatures down
from near record levels to just above seasonal values in the
interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure in the eastern Gulf states will promote sunny and
very pleasant weather across the Southeast and northern Florida.
The Carolina coast and southern Florida will stay dull part of the
time as a front moves out to sea. The air will be noticeably less
humid as drier air moves into the area on breezes from the
northwest.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of polar air will reach from the Great Lakes to the
lower Missouri Valley. A sprinkle will accompany the cold front in
Indiana, and snow showers will develop as much colder air moves
into upper Michigan and northern Wisconsin. Gusty winds from the
northwest will enhance the chill in the northern Plains. High
pressure over Nebraska should sponsor sunny and a cooler conditions
in the central Plains. Texas will stay bright and rather warm.
</P>
<P>
   Milder, moist air from the Pacific will enter the West. A warm
front will progress into Washington and Idaho with snow showers
inland and rain on the shoreline. Patches of thick and thin clouds
will stream into California, Nevada and Utah. A little rain will
fall in northern California. The Southwest will remain sunny and
become a bit warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Down East Warmth
</P>
<P>
   The snow has yet to cover the ground in Portland, Maine, this
season. In fact, Wednesday was the warmest Nov. 24 on record as the
mercury rose to 60 degrees surpassing the 59-degree record set in
1987. Even on Thanksgiving, the temperature hit 57 degrees, just
shy of the record 61. November has averaged nearly 3 degrees above
normal. But important changes are afoot for New England. A surge of
cool air will arrive this weekend, and this will be followed by
frigid air by Tuesday. An offshore storm could produce the first
measurable snowfall about the middle of the week.

AN EARLIER VERSION OF `GATSBY' IS PREPARED FOR PUBLICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Words in bold should be set in italics.)

 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To Professor James L.W. West III, ```Ulysses' is
the great novel that no one has ever read, and `The Great Gatsby'
is the great novel that everyone has.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the nation's great authorities on ``Gatsby'' and other
works by F. Scott Fitzgerald, West might be permitted a bit of
cheerleading for his man over James Joyce, especially now as he
prepares to bring out the 1924 novel that Fitzgerald completed and
then tore apart to create ``Gatsby.''
</P>
<P>
   The underlying novel was called ``Trimalchio'' by Fitzgerald,
who wrote it while staying at St.-Raphael on the French Riviera. By
contrast, West worked on its reconstruction in the less salubrious
mountains at Pennsylvania State University, where he is a
specialist in the history of publishing and its impact on society.
</P>
<P>
   And while Fitzgerald worked with an advance from Charles
Scribner's Sons under the guidance of its great editor, Maxwell
Perkins, West's work was partly financed by a $30,000 grant from
the National Endowment for the Humanities, which is publishing an
article by West on ``Trimalchio'' in the January-February issue of
its magazine Humanities.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of discarded works by Fitzgerald's friend Ernest
Hemingway has not been well received by critics. Of the most recent
posthumous Hemingway, ``True at First Light,'' Michiko Kakutani
wrote in The New York Times in June that it ``never should have
seen the light of day.'' Given that reaction, was it wise to bring
out the old Fitzgerald work?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very definitely yes,'' West said. ```Trimalchio' was a
finished novel, which he submitted to his publisher in October
1924. That's different from an aborted novel or a fragment.
Fitzgerald submitted `Trimalchio' and in part because of his own
second thoughts and in part because of Perkins' comments, he tore
it apart and came up with `The Great Gatsby,' which is entirely
different.''
</P>
<P>
   There are enough differences to allow teachers to broaden their
courses in covering Fitzgerald's works, he said, adding, ``The
teaching has become formulaic. `Trimalchio' will give some new
material for teachers to put into their lectures.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Fitzgerald scholars agree that bringing out `Trimalchio'
is wise.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Jackson R. Bryer, a specialist in Fitzgerald and
Hemingway at the University of Maryland, said that at best he was
ambivalent on publishing ``Trimalchio'' and at worst felt it was
``a little unfair to Fitzgerald because that's not what he ended up
with.''
</P>
<P>
   While the underlying novel might be useful to some scholars,
including himself, he questioned whether the book would have a
broad readership.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of worlds, he said, he would consider teaching a
course on Fitzgerald by having his students read both
``Trimalchio'' and ``The Great Gatsby.'' But it is unrealistic, he
said, to hope that any student would read beyond ``Gatsby.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of whether art was being served by publishing
``Trimalchio,'' Bryer asked, ``Would it be helpful to peel away the
paint from the Sistine Chapel to see what Michelangelo put there
first?''
</P>
<P>
   No, he said, because Michelangelo wanted people to see his end
result, and that was the case also with ``The Great Gatsby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trimalchio'' (pronounced tree-MAL-kee-oh) is very similar to
``Gatsby'' in the first two chapters, West said. ``In chapter 3,
Fitzgerald started to revise the book,'' he went on, ``making
significant changes in 3, 4 and 5 and completely rewriting chapters
6 and 7 and making significant changes in 8 and 9.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maxwell Perkins was unhappy with the way Gatsby's character
was revealed,'' West said. ``He wanted us to learn about Gatsby in
bits and pieces. There was big, big rewriting, and most of the book
had to be reset.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1925 Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, spent six weeks in Rome
and Capri, where Fitzgerald, a rapid worker, rewrote the book to
meet Perkins' recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   It is known that Fitzgerald worried endlessly over what to call
his masterwork. ``At the end, Fitzgerald preferred `Under the Red,
White and Blue,''' West said, ``but Perkins told him, blessedly,
that it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   His rejected choice of ``Trimalchio'' drops a broad hint as to
Gatsby's character, since it is taken from the name of a former
slave who becomes rich and tastelessly tries to win the respect of
the establishment in first century Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told in ``The Satyricon'' by Petronius, and
Fitzgerald shifted it to New York City and Long Island of the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new party in `Trimalchio,' a masquerade affair that
presents a homily on celebrity,'' West said. ``Gatsby, an
arriviste, thinks others will be impressed that he has as guests
show business people _ performers, producers, sports stars. They
are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the discovery of ``Trimalchio'' the result of great
detective work?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. It was sitting in the Princeton University Library.
``People had known it was there,'' West explained. ``A number of
scholars have commented on the differences between the two
versions.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Fitzgerald scholars have know for years that there
was an underlying manuscript to `Gatsby.' The mind-set had been
that it was the dross from which the golden icon was created.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, West said, scholars have been seeking out such underlying
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerome McGann, at the University of Virginia, has urged us to
see texts as existing in flux,'' he said. ``You study a literary
work as it changes and exists in various stages.''
</P>
<P>
   Other writers whose underlying works have benefited from such
scholarly re-examination, West said, are William Faulkner, Virginia
Woolf, D.H. Lawrence and Richard Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald died in 1940, at the age of 44, the victim of too
much success too soon, but ``The Great Gatsby'' continues to sell
300,000 copies a year.
</P>
<P>
   West's revival of the underlying book, with comments, footnotes
and tables, will be published in May as ``Trimalchio: An Early
Version of `The Great Gatsby,''' by the Cambridge University Press,
priced at $39.95. A year later, a popular edition, stripped of the
scholarly paraphernalia, is to be published in paperback.

   MIAMI BEACH _ For party pilgrims, this billion dollar sandbar is
Plymouth Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Over this four-day Thanksgiving weekend, Miami Beach is full of
visitors thankful to be celebrating freedom from the holiday
traditions of traffic, indigestion and even family. Clearly, they
are making up their own traditions as they went along. There are
affluent, muscular gay men in town for the bacchanal known as White
Party Weekend. There are also droves of antic straight people
infected with Running Sickness, which might be described as the
uncontrollable urge to race around seeing and being seen while on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   There is even a disheveled, antifashion icon in town _ Lou Reed
_ staying at the oh-so-fashionable Delano hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be out of New York,'' he said on Wednesday
night. Along with an unruly mob of dancing kings and queens, he was
hanging out at the hotel's new weekly bash known, quite simply, as
the Wednesday party, and for a man with such a dark view of the
world, he seemed strangely happy. ``The beach is beautiful, the
people are nice and the food is great down here,'' he said,
sounding more like a Chamber of Commerce spokesman than a dyspetic
downtown art rocker. ``So what's not to like about it?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to a family-free-zone where anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami during Thanksgiving,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, fashion
director of Bloomingdale's, ``is for people who don't want to be
with family and for people who don't have family to be with. It
works for me. All I require is a piece of pumpkin pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Makos, the photographer who used to help his pal
Andy Warhol find cheap caviar for Thanksgiving dinners, said: ``I
don't bother going up to Massachusetts to see my father for the
holiday. If I went with Dad, he'd just take me to some dinner
filled with relatives who I don't even know. A girl once told me
she was my niece and I said, `What's a niece?' To be honest, my
family likes seeing my name in print more than seeing me in person.
My favorite holiday is Halloween because it's about the self.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his fellow revelers in Miami, Makos is partying as
though it well, 1999. The gay influx of 15,000 visitors alone is
expected to generate $10 to 12 million dollars in revenue,
according to the City Manager's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of these people, the gay ones especially,'' said Mark
Leventhal, a popular local D.J., ``this holiday brings up upsetting
issues having to do with family, so they come here to party
instead. If they do see their parents, you don't hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Rubell, whose family owns the chic Albion Hotel and the
Beach House in nearby Bal Harbour, agreed, adding that some gay
revelers quietly visit parents, then make a beeline for South
Beach. Although she opted to spend the holiday in Boston with her
boyfriend's family, she said she understood the extravagances of
White Party Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanksgiving is a real question for gay people,'' she said.
``They want a sense of community and family, and that's what their
weekend here together is all about. It's a time for celebrating
freedom in the extreme. Not that long ago, gay people could not be
so out of the closet. That's something to be thankful for, and it
has nothing to do with eating turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The White Party is one of a number of gay events known as
circuit parties held year-round in various cities, and they have
sometimes been criticized for drug use and unsafe sex. A Fire
Island edition, the Morning Party, was cancelled last summer after
a fatal drug overdose at the 1998 party. With all the drug use and
alcoholism and the relentless trawling for sexual partners at
circuit parties, one could be puritanical and argue that there's
something a bit unhealthy about all the celebration, no matter how
fabulous it appears.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Leichter, a clinical psychologist at Beth Israel
hospital in New York, who did not make it down this year, said:
``The whole party scene in Miami, straight or gay, might be as
overblown as it is because its some kind of desperate reaction
against the reality of who you are. Many of these people are
bothered by how normal or fragile their families are. I know I was
when I was younger. Wanting to be fabulous was this kind of
desperate attempt for me to pretend I wasn't from a plain family
from New Jersey. But of course I was. I used to hate Thanksgiving.
Now I love it, from my father's bad jokes to the canned cranberry
sauce. I look forward to every silly ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, meanwhile, when most of Manhattan was
shutting down for the holiday, the South Beach ritual of aggressive
socializing was at a fever pitch. From Joia and Cafe Tabac on the
lower end of the beach to the Forge up north on 41st Street, I
seemed more like Halloween than Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Field, the kooky downtown fashion designer, was skulking at
the Delano party under a head of candy-red hair. Over at Bar Room,
owned by the F.O.M. (Friend of Madonna) Ingrid Casares, a raucous
party given by Ocean Drive magazine drew in a teeming mass of
tatooed men, all talking into little wires attached to cellular
phones (the latest thing _ to prevent brain cancer, you know), and
bodacious women wearing masks of heavy makeup and not much else.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   They weren't all experiencing complete freedom from want,
however, since many of them, even at 3 o'clock in the morning, were
standing outside on the wrong side of a velvet rope.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Up at the Forge, where a Wednesday singles night attracts a
lubricious and vehemently straight crowd, the influx of implants
was intense. Next door, at Cafe Nostalgia, a new club for Cuban
music, the dance floor was filled with trendy Latins who were
dancing to a song about sugar daddies.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Protestants in buckle shoes. All over town there were
Pradastants in Prada shoes. Even if they weren't model citizens,
many of them looked like models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the city of Miami Beach itself,'' said Tom Austin, who
covers the scene for Ocean Drive magazine, ``people around here
look better at night.'' It was only a few hours before dawn and he
was walking past a shockingly busy News Cafe when a prostitute
emerged from the shadows, and patted his belly. ``Hey beer gut,''
she said, ``got a light?''
</P>
<P>
   He told her he did not smoke. ``Well,'' she said, ``you
should.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time not so long ago, this was a family kind of
destination. Despite the fact that the Delano now likes to promote
its fashionable self as a family resort, the whole city seems more
of a playground for people with very loud inner children, rather
than real ones.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. on Thursday, however, five beautifully dressed and
well-behaved little boys in jackets and club ties did sit down with
their parents for Thanksgiving dinner at the Delano. That's when a
guest got up and complained to the host that he and his wife wanted
to have a romantic evening, and that he had been guaranteed that
there would not be any children around. ``I told him that was
ridiculous,'' said Gilbert Stafford, the host.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, when the hotel's bar and lounge areas were
really hopping, John Lyons, a New York-based movie producer whose
hits include ``Boogie Nights'' and ``Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who
Shagged Me,'' walked into the lobby. He had just returned from a
big family dinner at his mother's home in suburban Boynton Beach,
where he dutifully mashed potatoes and put up with a few lovingly
raised eyebrows from relatives about his life as a New York City
hotshot.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed relieved to be back at the Delano, where he has spent
his last five Thanksgiving weekends. ``I love my mother and she
makes a beautiful turkey dinner, but I don't really feel at home in
her house,'' he said as he walked through the surreally decorated
hotel lobby teeming with surreally thin fashion people. ``Of
course, I'm not exactly sure I feel at home here either,'' he said,
``but that's another story.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, he was walking into Joe Allen to deliver a
piece of his mother's pumpkin pie to Ruttenstein, who was finishing
dinner with a friend. Ruttenstein has not had a family Thanksgiving
in years, and he seemed very thankful to be experiencing a mother's
cooking without actually experiencing a mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very touched that you and your mother remembered me,'' he
told Lyons. After taking one bite, he broke into a smile so wide it
almost seemed as though he was going to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pie,'' he exclaimed, ``is absolutely perfect.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Flipping through Banana Republic's new winter and
holiday catalogs, shoppers are confronted with page after page of
flawless young beauties showing off the chain's stylish, modern
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Sigrid Rothe, whose white hair and lined face stand
out like a flag of confidence. Ms. Rothe is shown wearing a number
of items, including a pompom hat, an ivory quilted parka and a
svelte gray stretch wool suit that matches her coloring perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic says it has had an outpouring of fan mail for
Ms. Rothe, thanking the company for using an older woman to sell
hip clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers are finally catching on to what my friends and I
have known all along _ older women are sexy and beautiful and
stunning,'' said Yolanda Hawkins, 45, an actress and theater
director in New York. ``To me, it's `What took you so long?'''
</P>
<P>
   The faces of women in their 40s, 50s and even 60s, which with
few exceptions were once confined to Mop &AMP; Glo or Geritol ads, are
now turning up in all kinds of fashion and beauty marketing.
</P>
<P>
   From Bergdorf Goodman, Brooks Brothers and Bloomingdale's, which
are including older women in catalogs and ad campaigns, to the
designer Jean Paul Gaultier, who signed off his runway show for
fall and winter 1999 in Paris with an older, white-haired bride and
bridegroom, the mature model is invading territory once held
exclusively by extreme youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older women are definitely a trend in fashion,'' said Katie
Ford, the president of the Ford modeling agency, which has recently
hired several women 45 and older who have never modeled before to
meet the demand. ``Advertisers want them more and more, and they're
showing them looking vibrant and sensual and glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Howley, a booking agent for Elite Model Management, which
represents several top models over 40, including Iman and Isabella
Rossellini, said, ``When you see a national chain like Banana
Republic with billions in sales doing it, you know it's a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities of all ages have always been viable as fashion
models, from the Blackglama ads of a decade ago, featuring Lauren
Bacall, Lena Horne and Elizabeth Taylor dressed in nothing but
mink, to Lauren Hutton as a J. Crew spokeswoman in the '90s. But in
recent years, Ms. Ford said, women are proving they can earn
six-figure salaries for fashion and high-paying cosmetic work, not
just in their 20s and early 30s, but also in their late 40s and 50s
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, older models still have to look good. That's the
law. But for the first time it's OK to show a few wrinkles, the
hint of dark circles under the eyes, even gray hair _ jolts of
stark reality in the advertising world, where the message is often
subliminal. ``Suddenly, advertisers want real, they want natural,''
Howley said. ``And believe me, no one shows gray unless there's a
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The market, of course, is the 82 million aging baby boomers,
who, with their considerable disposable income and lifelong
fixation on youth, are taking care of themselves and looking good
well into their middle years. Marketers are trying to reach them
with faces and figures they can identify with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, after 40, you wouldn't dream of wearing a
20-year-old's clothes,'' said Nesta David, creative director of RCC
Arcade, which places scent strips and makeup samples in magazines.
``After 50, it was the grandma look. Women in buns, girdles,
orthopedic shoes. But now, people are going to the gym, eating
right, and they haven't given up dressing nicely just because they
have kids.''
</P>
<P>
   With the commitment to not letting oneself go, Ms. David added,
has come a proliferation of products, from anti-aging creams to
estrogen replacements, that need realistic models to sell them.
``Menopause, fiber for regularity, cellulite, Viagra for men, no
one ever talked about these things before, much less advertised
them,'' Ms. David said.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Fisher, the president of the clothing stores that carry
her name, which this fall introduced a campaign using two models in
their late 40s, said she's convinced that there's a consumer
backlash to the androgynous young women who have dominated fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a new, more realistic image for women to aspire to,''
Ms. Fisher said. ``I'm tired of everyone being so tall, so thin, so
young. I want to say, Women have arrived, we have the confidence to
be ourselves, we can get old.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the American population will be older than 40 in
the year 2000, according to projections from the United States
Census Bureau. As this group redefines conventional images of
middle and old age, marketers are squarely taking aim.
</P>
<P>
   In a double-page ad that ran in national magazines, Vanity Fair
lingerie recently showed a svelte body in beige lace bra and
underwear on one page, and on the facing page, that body's face _
an attractive, mature woman.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Brothers this fall has stamped on the side of New York
City buses the images of a 40-ish couple in chic black leather and
gray. A year ago, Estee Lauder brought back from retirement Karen
Graham, its banner model in the 1970s and '80s, who is now 53 and
sporting lines between her eyebrows, to plug its Resilient Lift
face cream.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Donna Karan and Giorgio Armani have run
ads of the model Benedetta Barzini, a Georgia O'Keeffe look-alike
in her 60s, who also walked the runways in Europe showing the
recent spring collections.
</P>
<P>
   And Anthropologie, in its December catalog, is showing for the
first time an over-35 face _ that of Grethe Holby, 50, who, posing
in a snug-fitting baby T with a felt and jeweled applique of a cat,
doesn't look her age, but doesn't look 35, either.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Sank, the president of Anthropologie, which has $100
million in annual sales with 16 stores nationwide, said he did a
lot of research before deciding to go with an older woman.

 &HT;    For `Sleepy Hollow' director, images are key
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 28.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never judge a man by his beret.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Burton wears the Salvador Dali-esque veneer of the stuffy
film artiste: the all-black clothing, the virtuoso goatee, the
shoulder-length dark hair frantically flowing beneath a billowy
beret.
</P>
<P>
   At 41, he's a vision as pronounced as the oddly compelling
images he creates in his movies. The zebra-striped Michael Keaton
in 1988's ``Beetlejuice.'' The scissor-fingered Johnny Depp in
1990's ``Edward Scissorhands.'' And now, the razor-toothed,
devil-eyed Christopher Walken terrorizing Colonial Americans in
Burton's latest, critically acclaimed movie, ``Sleepy Hollow,''
which opened Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``People warned me about meeting Burton,'' says Oscar-winning
actor Rod Steiger, who co-starred in the director's loopy 1996
sci-fi spoof ``Mars Attacks!'' ``They would say, `He's sensitive,'
`You've got to be careful.' So I figured I'm going to see somebody
in the corner, all in black with tousled hair, holding up his
fingers in the sign of the cross, saying, `Twelve feet, that's as
far as you can come.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I went in,'' Steiger continues. ``And he needs a shave
and he's got the suit that must have come from Ibsen's first play.
You know, the black suit. And he says, `Hi, I'm Tim Burton.' In 60
seconds you could hear us 40 miles down the hall. We were carrying
on. Had a great time. I like him. Anybody who maintains their
independence in any industry, you've got to have respect for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' is clearly Burton's independent vision. Based
on Washington Irving's classic bogeyman tale and starring Depp as
Ichabod Crane, a constable sent to investigate beheadings in Sleepy
Hollow, the film is a wicked mix of witchcraft, numerous
decapitations at the hands of a headless horseman and Burton's
joyously evil tinges of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The films that had impact on me as a child, I could never
remember any of the story,'' Burton says. ``What I could remember
was images which were burned into my consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   He's inspired especially by England's Hammer horror films (for
instance, Christopher Lee in the 1957 ``Dracula') and early horror
from visionaries such as James Whale (1931's ``Frankenstein,''
1933's ``The Invisible Man'').
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed recently by telephone, Burton talked about his love
of horror movies, working with Depp and finally meeting Lee, one of
his idols:
</P>
<P>
   Q: How old were you when you saw the 1958 Disney cartoon version
of ``Sleepy Hollow''?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's the funny thing about the story. I knew about it but
didn't really know about it. I can't recall exactly when I saw it.
The cartoon is just in your subconscious as a child. Very powerful
images. And that's the great thing about horror movies and why I
like them. The beautiful ones have that sense of imagery, and it
becomes part of your subconscious and stays with you forever.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's interesting because your version of Ichabod Crane really
delves into his subconscious _ his memories as a child.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're kind of formed early in life. You can have experiences
that you repress. As time goes by you think of things differently.
I was always interested in that subject matter. Ichabod was very
human to me. His emphasis on thinking and pure brainpower was a way
for him to avoid other things. You know, what you want and what you
are are two different things. That's very charming. He's such a
human being that way. And here's another theme in this film I like:
Here's a character who thinks too much and he's up against a guy
with no head.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long had you been thinking about doing ``Sleepy Hollow''?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was working on ``Superman'' (the planned ``Superman Lives''
movie with Nicolas Cage) for a year, and then that ended. And then,
luckily, I was presented with a script. So this kind of came to me.
I had known the story and the images. It was just good timing. I
generally just do one thing at a time, so I was ready for something
new.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you and the scriptwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker
(``Seven,'' ``8MM''), hook up?
</P>
<P>
   A: I really didn't know much about Andy's other work. I have
just seen ``Seven.'' I just liked the script. Tom Stoppard helped
us in working on it. For me, it was just an opportunity to do a
movie I'd always liked.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was Johnny Depp always a lock? He's physically not someone
you think of for Ichabod Crane.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, yeah, in some ways. Each time working with him is
different and great. One of the greatest and interesting challenges
was to find that tone of humor and not go too far. One of the great
things is when you work with actors who get to that tone. With him,
it's just easy to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The faces in the supporting cast _ Jeffrey Jones, Michael
Gambon, Ian McDiarmid _ are extraordinary. So cartoonlike.
</P>
<P>
   A: The first scene we shot was when Ichabod opened the study
door and those great guys are just sitting there. It was a surreal
moment. I would have bet somebody a million dollars a couple of
years ago that I'd never be making a movie with a bunch of people
looking like George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What Hammer horror films did you have in mind while making
this movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: We usually use inspirations more loosely than that. It's more
a state of mind than something specific. Each of those films have
their own moments. What they brought to horror is a beautiful,
lurid, sexy mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But it must have felt special to have Christopher Lee in a
small part in your movie.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's hard to describe what it's like. There are these people
who have inspired you, and then you meet them. I was so grateful.
He's just so powerful and a distinct presence. He's got such a
wealth of experience. His resume is like a phone book. He's just so
amazing. Who better to send Ichabod to Sleepy Hollow than Dracula?

 NEW YORK: older woman.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Our core customers are 35 to 40, and they're upscale and
hip,'' he said. ``They're not wasted, they look great, they look
younger than they are. They want to be able to envision themselves
in our clothing, and if we're only showing it on 20-year-olds,
that's hard for them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Do older models help sales?
</P>
<P>
   Sank said he would know soon enough when he compiles the sales
of the outfits that Ms. Holby is shown modeling.
</P>
<P>
   Other retailers said they have already seen positive results.
Robert Luzzi, senior vice president for advertising at Estee
Lauder, said the campaign with Ms. Graham, who is shown
fly-fishing, has been a winner, although he would not cite specific
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The company will soon use Ms. Graham to market a second product,
Resilient Lift eye cream. ``We're promoting this to the max,''
Luzzi said. ``We get letters all the time thanking us for showing a
mature woman who is active and outdoorsy and not a hausfrau.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Banana Republic, Cindy Capobianco, said the
response to the single older model it showed last holiday season
had been so positive that this fall the company used more older
faces, not only in its catalogs but also in its television
campaign. It will continue to do so during the all-important coming
holiday season, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the one high-profile area that older models have not
penetrated is the editorial pages of the influential fashion
magazines, despite the fact that many of the readers are older than
35. ``The only model over 30 that the magazines will touch is Linda
Evangelista,'' said Howley, of Elite.
</P>
<P>
   Why this is so is a bit mysterious. Magazines may be lagging
behind their own advertisers in a significant trend, or they may
more clearly understand that readers don't care to be reminded,
when flipping through a fashion magazine, of their own laugh lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw an ad with an older woman, and I was shocked,''
said Olivia Harcourt, 34, an actress and writer in New York. ``She
was so plain and uninteresting and really not very attractive. She
wasn't selling the clothes, and that's what it's about. Fashion is
fantasy. Older is great, but you better be hot or exotic or worldly
or have something.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Weinstein, the bookings director for Elle, said that the
magazine has on at least one occasion used a model in her 40s for a
fashion spread (it was for haute couture, three or four years ago)
and that it would consider doing it again if ``the clothes and the
image we wanted to convey lent itself to it.''
</P>
<P>
   For many marketers, the biggest problem may be finding older
models who transcend expectations about their age. It's OK to show
a few wrinkles and some gray, but the models ought to look as if
they could get away with wearing their daughters' clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Sank, of Anthropologie, said he had trouble finding models older
than 35 who exuded a youthful, modern spirit. ``Not that many
agencies have them,'' he said. ``And the ones that do, mostly they
look like they belong at the country club.''
</P>
<P>
   Sank finally found Ms. Holby, a Ford model, with a long chestnut
mane and a size 6 body that can still carry off the store's hip,
youthful clothes. Besides the tight T-shirt, Ms. Holby is also
pictured in the coming Anthropologie catalog wearing a wrap dress
with a ruffled white petticoat underneath, and a voile blouse with
a patchwork vintage handkerchief skirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford model Gabrielle von Canal, 55, who this fall is
featured in Brooks Brothers and J. Crew ads, said that 20 years ago
she felt as if she were washed up. ``I had done all the influential
magazine covers, I had done every cosmetic there was, but then
there I was in my prime _ and I think a woman is most beautiful at
35 _ and suddenly I wasn't working,'' she recalled. ``I don't think
the world knew what to do with me. I wasn't young, and I wasn't
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Not willing to quit, Ms. von Canal persuaded Eileen Ford, then
the head of the agency, to begin a division for older models. Then
a backwater of the agency with a handful of models, the division
has grown to more than 30 women today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few years, I've never been more successful, I've
never earned more money,'' Ms. von Canal said. ``It's strange.
Suddenly, I'm welcome again. In the Brooks Brothers ads on the
buses, I think I look terrible, like a dog in the rain. They shot
me without reflecting light _ and you need that to look good when
you get older _ and they touched up nothing. But they say, `No, you
look wonderful, you look real.' If anything I feel I need more
wrinkles, and I'd get even more work.''

 &HT;    Paintings that exalt God and cathedrals that soar toward heaven
_ for much of the millennium, faith has been the prism giving color
and life to Western art and architecture.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you build a museum hailed as one of the greatest works of
20th century architecture, they will come. More than 2 million
people have made a pilgrimage to northern Spain to see the
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao since it opened in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Eight centuries earlier, the crowds gathered in the nearby
Santiago de Compostela, one of the most admired Romanesque churches
of medieval times.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, cathedrals, not skyscrapers, were the tallest
buildings in town, and soaring, transcendental interior spaces the
property of cathedrals rather than hotel atriums. Visual art was in
the church reinforcing its values, not in museums and, as the
recent controversy about the elephant dung on the Madonna painting
at the Brooklyn Museum of Art exemplifies, at odds with it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the better part of this millennium, the church was
the major building type in Western Europe, and the Catholic Church
was the major landlord and art patron.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other institution has had the impact on art, its content
and style,'' asserts Don Saliers, F.N. Parker professor of theology
and worship at Emory University. ``Even its absence (in the 19th
and 20th centuries) as an influence has had an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Christianity began affecting the direction of art and
architecture almost immediately after the Crucifixion. An early
wave of believers escaped persecution by fleeing to Turkey, where
they created small hidden communities by burrowing into soft
volcanic rock that composes the lunar landscape of the Cappadocia
region. They dug out dwellings, monasteries and chapels, which they
decorated with religious imagery.
</P>
<P>
   As Christianity came up from the underground, growing into a
dominant religion, the creativity it spawned grew more visible. By
A.D. 1,000, Christianity was a powerful religion, aligned with
rulers who considered a strong church essential to political
stability. This alliance coincided with _ or set off _ a building
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each Christian people strove against the others to erect
nobler ones,'' wrote 11th century monk Raoul Glaber. ``It was as if
the whole earth ... were clothing itself everywhere in the white
robe of the Church.''
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of Gothic architecture during the 12th through the
16th centuries epitomizes the interrelationship of Christianity and
advances in the building arts. During this period, light and height
became the theological symbolism and aesthetic goal of sacred
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The sacred buildings dominated the skyline, tributes to the
majesty of God and the power of the church. From Notre Dame in
Paris and the Cologne Cathedral in Germany to Salisbury Cathedral
in England, they still evoke awe and occupy a place of pride in
their communities.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, the dome of Florence's cathedral, in candy-colored
green, pink and white marble, is a beacon for visitors lost in the
web of disorientingly winding streets.
</P>
<P>
   This medieval mess did not sit well with 16th and 17th century
popes headquartered in Rome. At times they exchanged their miters
for a new hat, that of urban planner.
</P>
<P>
   According to architectural historian Spiro Kostof, generations
of popes remade Rome with the intention of modernizing the city,
opening up the airless medieval core, creating new residential
areas, linking the great monuments and quarters with roads, and
putting their stamp on it wherever possible.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they hired the great artists of their time _
Michelangelo, Raphael, Bernini _ to embellish and design the
monuments and cityscape they built. To this day, Rome remains one
of the most impressive repositories of art and architecture in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of the artists' personal faith is mostly a mystery. We
do know that, unlike today, most people shared the view that the
visible world represents the divine and that art was the effort to
make the transcendent visible.
</P>
<P>
   Religious subject matter served as the equivalent of a poet's
iambic pentameter, a set of parameters within which artists
explored their mediums and their interpretive powers. Comparing
versions of the Madonna and Child by Cimabue, Giotto and Domenico
Veneziano at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence is to watch the
progression from flat iconic presentation to the
three-dimensionality and naturalism of the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   There was room for eccentrics as well. Painted in the 1500s,
Flemish artist Hieronymus Bosch's visions of naked figures peopling
the surreal landscapes of heaven and hell make for a Freudian field
day.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeenth century Italian artist Caravaggio was one of the art
world's first rebels, shocking viewers with his down-home vision of
holy eminences. He painted the Madonna as if she were just another
resident of the lower-class Trastevere quarter in Rome, dirty feet
and all.
</P>
<P>
   And the Spanish artist El Greco's elongated figures still exert
an otherworldly hold on the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Reformation Protestants of Northern Europe frowned upon the
lavish, theatrical spectacles in which the Catholic Church reveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no room in the Protestant church for religious
images,'' says Ronni Baer, European art curator at the Carlos
Museum. ``Protestants believed you should not depict what you
couldn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   They enforced that view during the mid-16th century when they
whitewashed fresco-covered church walls and beheaded sculptures of
the Virgin Mary. No wonder artists in Protestant countries like
Holland looked for other patrons, whom they found among the growing
bourgeoisie. Although Rembrandt still found personal sustenance in
Old and New Testament stories, most artists turned to secular
subjects _ visions of the world that interested them and their
patrons, thus spurring the growth of the still life, landscape and
scenes of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   With Louis XIV, France came to dominance in political and
cultural realms, which also moved art away from religion. Royalty
vied with popes as major patrons. Then, growing democratic
sentiment during the 18th century, which opposed absolutism,
spiritual or secular, eroded Christian hegemony as well. The
absence of a singular overriding force made the way for the great
variety of visual languages and subjects that have flowered in the
past two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Though diminished in power, Christianity has not disappeared as
an impetus for artmaking. It has still inspired great architectural
expression during the past two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commissions (for religious structures) seem to make architects
think through from the beginning what they are doing and what a
building for worship means,'' says Emory architectural historian
Judith Rohrer. ``They often become the architect's most thoughtful
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Designing Barcelona's Sagrada Familia cathedral, whose
fairy-tale forms are imagination incarnate, deepened architect
Antonio Gaudi's faith and transformed his life, says the associate
professor of art history. The commission for Notre Dame du Haut in
Ronchamp, France, helped inspire archmodernist Le Corbusier to move
from his highly rational approach to a symbolic spiritual one
expressed in expressionist, sculptural forms.
</P>
<P>
   On a deliberately less spectacular scale, the American Shakers
developed an ascetic aesthetic in architecture and decorative arts
in which simple functionality ascends to humble beauty. And
Francois de Menil used a modernist vocabulary to create a small,
sleek, meditative space for Cypriot frescoes at his late parents'
art complex in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   You can find Christian themes in the visual arts in the work of
African-American and Latin American artists and visionary
self-taught artists, such as the Rev. Howard Finster.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, artists largely ignore specifically Christian subject
matter, except for ironic purposes. Indeed, no longer partners, art
and organized religion are often antagonists. Remember the
firestorm that erupted in 1989 when contemporary artist Andres
Serrano stuck a crucifix in a container of urine and made a dreamy
photograph of it?
</P>
<P>
   Set off by Serrano's ``Piss Christ,'' art, religion and politics
collided with a nasty bang. Offensive artwork became a rallying cry
for the Christian right in the culture wars and the means by which
it succeeded in reducing government support for the arts.
</P>
<P>
   A similar battle erupted recently about a display of
controversial art at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. An image of a
Madonna made with elephant dung provoked Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ a
presumed senatorial candidate _ to threaten to cease funding, and
even evict the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tempests they have stirred, these controversial
works will ultimately be a historical blip. The real legacy of
Christianity's relationship to the arts will be the great
architecture and visual art made in its name.
</P>
<P>
   1163:
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame, Paris. The embodiment of the Gothic style, which is
the architectural vocabulary most closely associated with
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   1427:
</P>
<P>
   Masaccio, Brancacci Chapel, Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence.
The introduction of three-dimensional figures in perspectival space
marks the flowering of the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   1432:
</P>
<P>
   Jan van Eyck, Ghent Altarpiece, Belgium. A sumptuous masterpiece
of the Northern Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   1495:
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo da Vinci, ``Last Supper,'' Milan. One of the few
surviving works by this genius, Leonardo's rendition is the
ultimate version of this critical moment in the life of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   1508:
</P>
<P>
   Michelangelo, Sistine Chapel, Rome. One of the millennium's
greatest works of art, a series of frescoes stretching from the
creation of Adam to the Last Judgment.
</P>
<P>
   1586:
</P>
<P>
   El Greco, ``Burial of the Count de Orgaz,'' Toledo, Spain. The
elongated figures of the Mannerist style add to the ethereal drama
of the ascension of Orgaz's spirit to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   1607:
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter's, Rome. Baroque additions give this emblem of
Catholicism its spectacular Baroque theatricality.
</P>
<P>
   1666:
</P>
<P>
   Rembrandt, ``Return of the Prodigal Son.'' This most
introspective of artists captures the human as well as the
religious aspects of this famous story.
</P>
<P>
   1675:
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Wren, St. Paul's, London. England's most renowned
architect wedged this graceful Baroque church into its urban site
with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   1880s:
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Gaudi, Sagrada Familia cathedral, Barcelona. The most
personal interpretation of tradition is also one of the great
flights of imagination in architecture.
</P>
<P>
   1950:
</P>
<P>
   Le Corbusier, Notre Dame du Haut, Ronchamp, France. A modernist
take on an old form.
</P>
<P>
   1989:
</P>
<P>
   Controversy sparked by Andres Serrano's ``Piss Christ.''
Politicians make hay over an artwork regarded as disrespectful; the
National Endowment for the Arts takes the hit.
</P>
<P>
   1999:
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn Museum controversy. More of the same about dung on a
Madonna; this time, the politician ends up with mud on his face.

   Jingle bells or elfin hell? You never know what you'll get when
you pop open a holiday-themed CD. No pop star or classical tenor or

   This local choir's CD is the find of the season, with an
assortment of classical and contemporary carols (Debussy, Benjamin
Britten, John Rutter) and a gospel spiritual (``Go Where I Send
Thee'') sung with a refreshing lack of coyness. And it comes with a
bonus: the entire ``Ceremony of Carols,'' Britten's delicate

<P>
   Garth Brooks has morphed yet again. Here he's no longer pop
singer Chris Gaines. He's Andy Williams _ circa 1964. This lineup
of standards (``Let It Snow,'' ``Silver Bells,'' ``Have Yourself a
Merry Little Christmas'') is produced with the sweeping string and
big-band arrangements of a vintage TV Christmas special, as if
Garth and his family were gathered around a fireplace on a sound
stage. The nostalgic approach works, and works well.

<P>
   Though a little on the background music side, these
arrangements/improvisations of Appalachian hymns and American

choir voices of High Mass with sentimental, whiskers-on-kittens
holiday tunes, as if Julie Andrews were swinging an incense censer.
Oddly, it works.

   Here we get renditions of familiar carols and a contemporary

traditional and ear-catching new arrangements, cleanly sung,
handled with taste. Philip Rice, who directs this group, also
conducts Orchestra Atlanta, and seems as gifted in his work with
singers as with instrumentalists. Too bad the special attraction of
the album is the premiere of an arrangement of ``We Three Kings''
by Dave Brubeck, whose jazz harmonies stick out like a sore thumb
in this chaste classical context.

   Ever the most festive of former Beatles, what with the madcap

eventually have to make a Christmas record. It is, like all things
Ringo, eager to amuse _ and completely predictable that way. The
sitars and the conductor's banter are instantly familiar from the
Beatles era, while the opener ``Come on Christmas, Christmas Come
On,'' borrows its beat from Gary Glitter. Guileless children may be
more immune to Ringo's hammy manner than adults, and diehard
Beatlemaniacs will probably eat it up. Anyone else can avoid this.

A LOOK BACK AT THE 1999 NASCAR SEASON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Calif., Mich.)   By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte was the most improved driver on the Winston Cup
circuit while brother Terry continued to slip as the 1999 season
concluded last Sunday at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   When the final checkered flag fell, it marked the end of one of
the most eventful campaigns in history, mostly because of what took
place off the track, not on it.
</P>
<P>
   Of primary importance was the $2.8 billion network TV contract
signed by NASCAR, which goes into effect in 2001 and gives stock
car racing the potential to surpass all sports except football.
</P>
<P>
   But if the events on the track were not as momentous, they did
generate interest.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett won a well-deserved Winston Cup championship, but
arguably, Jeff Gordon was still the dominant driver.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Winston Cup championship puts its emphasis on
finishing races, not winning and leading them, it is not always a
true reflection of who is most competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won seven times, more than anybody, and was usually
competing for a top spot if nothing happened to his car.
</P>
<P>
   At Rockingham, N.C., in February, he led or was close to the
lead for three-quarters of the race, then blew an engine and wound
up 39th. Jarrett was second in the same race, but never led a lap.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Gordon was probably more competitive at Rockingham than
all but three cars, but 37 drivers got more points.
</P>
<P>
   That takes away nothing from Jarrett, who was probably the
second most competitive driver, with Bobby Labonte right behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Some other observations:
</P>
<P>
   MOST IMPROVED DRIVERS
</P>
<P>
   1. Bobby Labonte; 2. Ward Burton; 3. John Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by new teammate Tony Stewart, Labonte moved into elite
status in 1999. Labonte has always had the talent, but sometimes
seemed to lack the motivation necessary to get to the top. He
appears to have it now.
</P>
<P>
   Burton has been trying to find the right combination and, teamed
with crew chief Tommy Baldwin, was more competitive this year than
he's ever been. Andretti is becoming more patient and smarter on
the track and would have done better if he hadn't been the victim
of events beyond his control, such as Kenny Irwin knocking him into
the wall on pit road at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   MOST DISAPPOINTING DRIVERS
</P>
<P>
   1. Terry Labonte; 2. Jeremy Mayfield; 3. Bobby Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's career is in a rapid downhill slide, most of it
probably not his fault. Labonte still has the ability to run with
the best, but he had a terrible car. Although he won one race, he
was almost never competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's stock went up when he won his first race last year,
but he did nothing to distinguish himself in 1999 as his team took
a big step back. Hamilton really plummeted in his second year with
Larry McClure's team, which was magic at Daytona and Talladega a
few years ago, but has bombed lately.
</P>
<P>
   BEST DRIVER-CREW CHIEF COMBO
</P>
<P>
   1. Dale Jarrett and Todd Parrott; 2. Bobby Labonte and Jimmy
Makar; 3. Jeff Burton and Frank Stoddard.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody works better together than Jarrett and Parrott and nobody
works harder. If they win the championship again in 2000, nobody
should be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one can say how the redesigned cars will factor in,
Bobby Labonte and Makar just keep making strides toward the top and
if they continue to improve as much as they did this year, nobody
will beat them. When Roush racing reorganized and Burton's crew
chief, Buddy Parrott, was promoted in 1998, Stoddard stepped in
without missing a beat. He and Burton are rapidly becoming a force
among the best teams.
</P>
<P>
   TEAMS TO WATCH IN 2000
</P>
<P>
   1. Joe Gibbs; 2. Hendrick Motorsports; 3. Robert Yates.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fantastic finish by his two drivers, Bobby Labonte and
Tony Stewart, this year, Gibbs' team may be on the verge of
becoming the best in NASCAR, if it isn't already. The last third of
the season, nobody was more competitive than Labonte and Stewart.
In fact, the only car that even approached them was Dale Jarrett's.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick Motorsports will be under scrutiny for the opposite
reason people are watching Gibbs; it seems to be falling apart.
With Ray Evernham gone, Jeff Gordon's performance went from
outstanding to good, Terry Labonte is in a deep hole. The third
Hendrick car, which will be driven by Jerry Nadeau in 2000, never
has been competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Yates falls in-between Gibbs and Hendrick. At his best, Yates
offers Jarrett's car, which can run with anybody. But then there's
his second entry which has done almost nothing since Yates became a
two-car team in 1996. Yates' two teams have never really worked
well together, but that should change with Ricky Rudd, a true
professional, driving next year.
</P>
<P>
   MOST TO PROVE IN 2000
</P>
<P>
   1. Jeff Gordon: Can he win without Ray Evernham?
</P>
<P>
   2. Dale Earnhardt: Dominant at Daytona and Talladega, out of it
almost everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   3. Rusty Wallace: Seems to be stuck in neutral.
</P>
<P>
   TOP YOUNG TALENT
</P>
<P>
   1. Tony Stewart: About as good as anybody right now.
</P>
<P>
   2. Matt Kenseth: Makes debut with Roush. Some think he's better
than Dale Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   3. Dale Earnhardt Jr.: Extremely poised. Won't try and do more
than he's capable of doing.

 By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was no ordinary night on 122nd Street. The crowd
of about 100 people pressed into the carved cherrywood corners of
Martha Chandler Dolly's historic brownstone, turned out in an
assortment of little black dresses, tiny spectacles and wildly
coiffed dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   A troupe of models wearing battle-weary expressions stepped
Kabuki-like through the house, displaying the fall and spring
collections of Epperson, a SoHo fashion designer.
</P>
<P>
   But even with its strictly-below-14th-Street airs, this was a
uniquely Harlem event. Where else would Epperson's subtly
Afrocentric designs (which sometimes adorn Lauryn Hill and Erykah
Badu) be set against a lavishly detailed, turn-of-the-century
brownstone? Where else would fashion designers mingle with
politicians, and artists stand toe-to-toe with businessmen, with
barely a smirk between them?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really eclectic,'' said James R. Reynolds, an artist and
teacher, who sings in the choir at the Abyssinian Baptist Church
but admits to drifting southward most nights for socializing.
``When I go to parties downtown, you don't have as much of a
mixture of people, beyond color.''
</P>
<P>
   The eclecticism was cultivated by Lenn Shebar and Larry Ortiz,
who organized the event, part of a recently established series of
cocktail parties known as the Harlem Affair. The party, on Nov. 6,
was the second in the series (a third, by invitation only, is
scheduled for February), designed as a kind of homage to the
literary and artistic salons of the Harlem Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Shebar, 35, a public relations and political consultant, and
Ortiz, 29, a retail specialist and fashion consultant, served as
the hosts of the evening, with the help of Nikoa Evans, 30, the
director for business investments of the Upper Manhattan
Empowerment Zone, a development corporation created by the federal
government in 1994 to promote economic revitalization, and Andrew
A. Babb, 30, an editorial assistant for Martha Stewart Weddings
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider ourselves to be love children of the Harlem
Renaissance,'' Ortiz said, noting that he and Shebar were born and
raised in Harlem, and live there now. ``We love poetry and we love
the arts, and that's what we want to bring back to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Harlem is experiencing an economic boom, with retail
complexes opening throughout the area, now is the time, Ortiz and
Shebar said, to tap the neighborhood's cultural heritage and to add
an artistic component to what is being called the Second
Renaissance. Hoping to bring together artists of various
disciplines, they asked Epperson to showcase his fashions and also
invited Reynolds to exhibit his work, black-and-white portraits of
family and friends, in Ms. Dolly's home.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts clearly chose the setting, bordering Marcus Garvey
Park in the Mount Morris Historic District, to conjure the feel of
Harlem's heyday. Ms. Dolly's brownstone, completed in 1889 by
William B. Tuthill, the architect for Carnegie Hall, was designed
as the home of a New York developer, William A. Martin.
</P>
<P>
   It was the widest and one of the most lovingly decorated row
houses on the block, featuring Tiffany stained-glass windows,
intricate parquet floors of oak and mahogany, and fireplaces in
almost every room. (It will be profiled in a planned PBS
documentary about Harlem.)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Henry Adams, a neighborhood historian and
preservationist, leaned on an ivory-handled cane while recounting
the home's history. Adams, a friend of Ms. Dolly's, created
elaborate flower arrangements for the party, with white roses,
orchids and tulips. Such touches, Shebar said, help ``raise the bar
on expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So often, Harlem is associated with social services and as a
village that's in need,'' he said. ``But this is identifying
another aspect of Harlem: that there are people here who entertain
on the same social level as anyone on Park Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as the event was a gathering of artists, it might just
as easily have been promoted as a networking opportunity for the
city's black elite. ``I've met several people of caliber here
tonight,'' said Jackie Rowe-Adams, 51, a member of central Harlem's
community and school boards. ``District leaders, actors, models,
some entrepreneurs. I think you're seeing the beginning of the
rising stars of the neighborhood's leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the fashion show, Epperson, who uses only his last name
professionally, and his wife and partner, Lisha Gh'Rael Epperson,
waited near the grand piano in Ms. Dolly's furnished basement.
Their studio is on Thompson Street in SoHo, but they have both
lived in Harlem and said they wanted to use the Harlem Affair as a
way to promote their work for a new audience. ``We haven't had a
presence in Harlem,'' Mrs. Epperson said. ``It's really
transcultural work, it's not really downtown or uptown.''
</P>
<P>
   Princess Jenkins, an image consultant and an owner of the
Brownstone, a retail shop on Fifth Avenue near 125th Street, sat on
an antique velvet sofa in the living room under a painting by
Reynolds'. She said the event was the perfect way to promote new
designs for black consumers, because ``this is who you would want
in a room.'' She added, ``These are the people who would see it,
recognize it, and take it to the right audience.''
</P>
<P>
   She saw advantages for Harlem, too. ``Any event like this that
brings important style to this community is going to be key,
because Harlem has not been known for fashion and cutting-edge
work,'' she said. ``We want some more high-end style uptown. We
want some SoHo uptown.''

CHANGING OF THE MANAGED-CARE GUARD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., Ark., Tenn.)   (af)  
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In March, Dr. Archelle Georgiou, chief medical officer at
UnitedHealthcare, called together 18 clinical managers from around
the nation to spell out a significant shift in policy. Doctors,
they were told, would no longer be forced to seek approval for
treatments. Instead, the emphasis would be on meeting patients'
medical needs effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The idea met with some skepticism. Many of those at the meeting,
she said, sat with arms firmly folded across their chests. And body
language soon gave way to more concrete criticism. In the hallway,
she heard comments like, ``This will never work.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Kazlauskas, senior medical director with
UnitedHealthcare of New England, said his questions were primarily
``whether she and the company were really serious.''
</P>
<P>
   They were. Earlier this month, the insurer, based in
Minneapolis, returned decision-making to doctors in its
8.7-million-member managed-care network. The company plans to phase
in the program nationally to all of its 14.5 million members. And
another big insurer, Aetna, is considering following suit.
</P>
<P>
   But this is more than just a story of the transformation of a
managed-care company _ a shift that could have major consequences
for patients. It also shows what happens when a corporate culture
must do an abrupt about-face. New systems had to be developed, Dr.
Georgiou said, and workers had to learn a new way of thinking,
right down to the language they speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a medical director used to be on the phone with another
physician,'' she said, ``their language might have been: `Could you
tell me what the clinical criterion is for this hysterectomy,
because I'm not sure I can approve this case.' The new language
would go something like, `We've received notification you'd like to
do a hysterectomy. Help me understand why you chose to do this, and
are there other means you might consider?''
</P>
<P>
   But the changes go well beyond semantics. Under the new system,
such notification is required in fewer than a half-dozen
situations, Dr. Georgiou said, and doctors have the final say.
Instead, 1,200 nurses and medical directors who had been assigned
to ``pre-authorization'' tasks were retrained to help members and
isolate potential problems; 300 were laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Retrained staff members are now assigned to programs like
``Welcome Home,'' which works with patients after release from a
hospital, or to dealing with issues like admission counseling and
preventive medicine. Costs are still scrutinized, but the
elimination of pre-authorization removes patients from that
discussion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new approach was based on the realization that the company
was spending millions of dollars every year to approve or deny
care, when 99 percent of the time the procedure was approved. That
remaining 1 percent, said Dr. Sandra B. Nichols, chief medical
officer for UnitedHealthcare in Arkansas, ``was just one big
hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nichols, a former state health officer for Arkansas, sees a
chance to help patients, not to mention mend her reputation. When
she joined the company last year, she was familiar with managed
care from the regulatory side but not from the provider's. ``I got
on board and realized I was a person who was supposed to say no,''
she said. ``I went from being the most-loved physician in the state
to being the most despised.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her role still requires thorough review of cases, the
emphasis is different. Previously, she felt that she was ``beating
doctors over the head'' with guidelines; she now sees her role as
that of an educator and a facilitator.
</P>
<P>
   In once recent case, a liver transplant patient who had suffered
a stroke had nearly exhausted his rehabilitation benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ```I'm sorry, I have no flexibility' would have been my response
in the past,'' Dr. Nichols said. But under the new approach, she
and her team worked with the employer to extend the patient's
benefits while they found additional assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Glenn Davis, the patient's gastroenterologist in Little
Rock, said: ``I feel very good and very comfortable with what
happened to him. I think it indicates the insurance company itself
was willing to expend its energy and resources to find a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1995, United ended the practice of requiring
pre-authorization for many procedures, and it has built on that
notion, trying instead to pinpoint where overall costs are high and
to contain them. A 1998 trial program in Tennessee coupled fewer
required authorizations with case and cost management, cutting
medical costs by 8 percent, and United used the experience to
expand on the philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the results, officials said, it seems to be hitting the
mark. They mention an emphysema patient who was admitted to a
hospital three times in 36 days. A nurse who called the patient's
home found that relatives were smoking in the home and that three
kittens had been nipping at the tubes to the oxygen tank.
</P>
<P>
   The problems were easily addressed _ the smoking was stopped,
the kittens removed, the damaged tubes replaced _ and the patient
hasn't been in the hospital since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all been very positive,'' said Denise Keger, a nurse who
works with the new Welcome Home program. ``You really get that
sense of the nurse in you.''

possible BCS bowl; a great Joe Hamilton performance would be
invaluable to his Heisman Trophy campaign; a win also would give
Tech back-to-back wins in the series and huge bragging rights. For
Georgia, the one thing that can salvage the season is a win over

   OIL-MERGERS (Washington) _ A close look at the antitrust
implications in two major proposed mergers in the oil industry.
(Exclusive.) By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-SHOPPING (Undated) _ The sights and sounds of the
opening day of the Christmas shopping season. Retailers are very
bullish, yet discounters and department stores are trumpeting big
sales to induce consumers to shop in person instead of online. By
Leslie Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-TALKS (Belfast) _ The grim, unyielding men from the
remote poles of Ulster politics were still getting adjusted to
being seated side by side around a dining room table when their
host hit them with another novelty. George Mitchell told a joke at
the expense of his listeners, men with absolutely no history of
enjoying being made fun of. But they laughed. That moment may have
been the opening of the wall that came down in the last few weeks
as the seemingly dead Northern Ireland peace plan has revived. By
Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   MALAYSIA-POLITICS (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) _ Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad is all but certain to win a parliamentary election
next week, but already, to many people here, he seems like a relic
of the past. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-STYLE (Stratham, N.H.) _ When George W. Bush is not
reciting memorized lines during an official speech or rendering
careful answers during a formal interview, he is folksy and feisty,
a politician more playful than most of his peers. This disarming
demeanor goes a long way toward explaining the commitment and
confidence of Bush's core Republican supporters. But Bush's looser,
lighter style also contributes, fairly or not, to the questions
that opponents and reporters have raised about his intellectual
maturity. By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   NY-Y2K (New York) _ Last month, after searching and testing
nearly every computer and microchip in New York City's vast
inventory of technology, city officials took one of the final steps
in a four-year, $300 million effort to prevent any turmoil stemming
from the Year 2000 computer problem. They canvassed every city
agency to identify each jackhammer, bullhorn, tent, chain saw and
portable toilet. They made a list of every city employee who is a
qualified nurse, elevator mechanic, electrician, cook _ even scuba
diver _ so appropriate gear and specialists can quickly be
dispatched should trouble erupt after clocks and computers tick
from 1999 to 2000. The challenge is that despite spending more than
any other city in the world to fight the computer glitch, the
city's technology and emergency management experts say things may
yet go wrong _ and no one can predict exactly which things. By
Andrew C. Revkin and Barnaby J. Feder.

WEIRD AL: MAN OF MANY HATS, HAWAIIAN SHIRTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN BOYANOSKI   
 Herald-Journal, Spartanburg, S.C.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weird Al Yankovic turned his Dr. Demento radio show hits like
``My Bologna'' and ``Another One Rides the Bus'' into a 20-year
career that has earned him two Grammy Awards, seven platinum
albums, seven MTV specials, a CBS Saturday morning television show,
a cult-classic movie and a legion of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very blessed that I don't have to work to pay for
macaroni and cheese,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yankovic is currently on the road with ``Touring with
Scissors,'' a tour promoting songs off his latest album, ``Running
with Scissors.'' The show includes a song from each of his previous
albums as well some never-released stuff ``just to surprise the
hard-core fans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have a strong connection with the fans,'' he said.
``I try to assume the rock star pose and parody the conventional.
The fans seem to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical show includes many costume changes and video clips to
coincide with the many stage personas Yankovic has developed over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make it as theatrical as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing six shows a week during the tour, Yankovic admitted that
things are pretty laid back backstage and that the band will eat
dinner together just to unwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first few weeks we're still trying to work out
difficulties and find new ways of supporting the show, so it's
tense back there,'' he said. ``After a few weeks it's more
automatic, kind of a relaxed atmosphere back there.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is more to Yankovic than meets the eye. He
laments that many people don't realize that he writes much of his
own music, and even released an entire album of his own work in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He also laughs that many people thinks he is the only person
creating parodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will tell me, `I just heard your new song. It's great,'
and I tell them I don't have anything out,'' Yankovic quipped.
``They then say, `Wow, I loved the lyrics,' and I'm like, thanks
... sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he's far from ready to retire, Yankovic believes
somebody will come along to take his place in the parody kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be somebody who does funny music. When I
stop, somebody else will fill the void,'' he said. ``It just seems
like I've had this to myself for some time because no one has
produced the big-budget videos.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankovic drew his inspirations from Spike Jones, Alan Sherman
and other parody-driven musicians. He also drew from a heavy source
of classic rock acts like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the
Kinks and Elton John.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have fairly eclectic tastes,'' he said. ``I draw from a lot
of music.''
</P>
<P>
   He also leads an eclectic career outside of music. Not only does
he produce his own albums, he also directs his own videos. In
addition, he has directed videos for the Jon Spencer Blues
Explosion, Hanson, The Black Crowes and the opening sequence to the
movie ``Spy Hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote, directed and starred in the movie ``UHF,'' which
featured Fran Drescher and Michael Richards (aka Kramer). However,
he doesn't expect to be in another movie any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle that `UHF' was made at all,'' he quipped.
``Actually it's very tough to write a screenplay. Basically, I
would have to take a year off of my life to work on something that
may not be as successful as a tour or new album, which I could be
working on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankovic was also soured by his experience with his CBS Saturday
morning television show in 1997. At times it did not live up to the
vision he had for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pitching it since 1984, and finally got it on the air.
In the end I had very mixed feelings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The show did lead him to make friends with television star Drew
Carey. They met when the Cleveland funny man was on the ``Late Show
with David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   The two shows filmed across the hall from each another, and
Yankovic would scour the hallway to get guests for his show, and
one day Carey was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy to work with,'' he said of Carey, who has
since appeared in several music videos with Yankovic. ``I admire
and respect a lot of comedians and I hate to mention any because
there are so many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankovic's songs have also led him to jam with some of the
musicians he has parodied, including the Crash Test Dummies.
</P>
<P>
   After all his years in the entertainment business, the
entertainer has learned some important lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There're tons of things that I wish I could have done
differently, but I'm glad that I'm able to do this for a living,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's also learned another valuable lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never stick a fork in a toaster that is plugged in.''

 &HT;    After a week of mourning, A&AMP;M, Texas meet on gridiron
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ They finally played the game.
</P>
<P>
   And in many ways Friday's contest, which the Aggies won 20-16,
was like any other in the storied football rivalry between the
University of Texas and Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gaeke's parked his recreation vehicle at the stadium two
days before the game as he has for the last 25 years. Alumni,
friends and family ate pigs in a blanket, drank coffee and watched
the A&AMP;M Corps of Cadets march into the stadium. About one hour
later, at 10:10 a.m., Shane Lechler's opening kickoff sailed
through the air, as if held up by the crowd's thundering cheers.
</P>
<P>
   But eight days after the Aggies' traditional pre-UT bonfire
structure collapsed, killing 12 and injuring 27, the stadium was
covered by a thin veil of sadness, measured in maroon and white
ribbons painted on the A&AMP;M players' helmets, a halftime show that
at times resembled a funeral dirge and moments of plaintive silence
that pierced the normal pandemonium that marks this rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic game, featuring a fourth quarter
come-from-behind touchdown pass that pushed the underdog Aggies to
victory At the same time, it was the culmination of an emotional,
taxing week.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, A&AMP;M football players kneeled together in a
tight huddle at midfield. And the crowd of 86,128 _ the largest
crowd ever to see a football game in Texas _ stayed silent as an
Air Force squadron flew over the stadium in a ``missing man''
formation: The F-16 planes formed the outline of a ``V,'' with the
wing man absent.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 12 white doves were released from a box in the endzone.
They circled the stadium once and followed the wind out of the Kyle
Field.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the game, the somber mood had been replaced by
raucous victory chants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy was trying on all of us,'' Robert Davila yelled
over the din in Section 312 as the game's final seconds ticked
away. ``We needed this win. It helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bonfire collapse, UT and A&AMP;M fans said they thought
the game should go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids who lost their lives wouldn't want us to be blase,''
said Mike Kasper, an A&AMP;M alumnus from Round Rock. ``They wouldn't
want us to sit on our hands. They would want the Aggie spirit to
come out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been crying all week,'' Gaeke said. ``Now it's
time to cheer.''
</P>
<P>
   John Crawford, an 28-year-old Aggie, said the game could not
``erase the tragedy. But it's a chance to let out some emotion
that's been building up.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Thursday night's ``yell practice,'' where Aggie fans
rehearse their songs and chants, he said he was wondering ``if
everyone was going to be somber or was everyone going to be geared
up for the game. We were geared up, and that's how it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   UT fans, decked out in burnt orange, started gathering outside
the stadium at 7:30 a.m. to welcome the Longhorn players.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul Sanchez, a 27-year-old UT alumnus, said that initially
after the bonfire collapse he forgot about the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter to me if we played this game or not,'' he
said. ``I was indifferent. But as the game got closer, I got more
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said he couldn't bring himself to root against the
Aggies. ``I'll just root for the Horns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Healy, a UT alumnus at the game, put a number 12 sticker on
the side of his UT baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was the right thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Aggies thought so as well.
</P>
<P>
   On the ride here from Dallas, Healy stopped at an all-night
pancake house where he said a couple of A&AMP;M parents noticed his
hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came up crying and shook my hand, and told me I'd always
be welcome in Aggieland,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, the UT band dedicated its performance to the 12
dead and played ``Amazing Grace'' and ended with ``Taps.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M band members, who normally sprint off the field to
wild cheers after their halftime performances, formed a giant T to
the sound of drumbeats.
</P>
<P>
   Then they walked off the field slowly and in silence.

FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By David Warsh 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has Microsoft hurt consumers? One way to answer this question is
to study Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's vigorous condemnation of
Microsoft's competitive practices ``within'' the personal computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Another is personal experience. Compare your own involvement
with personal computers over the years with your experience of a
rival product.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, of course, the Internet. Too little attention has been
paid to the parallel rise of these once distinct but now
inextricably linked technologies. Each possesses a technical and
commercial culture of its own.
</P>
<P>
   And if the symbol of the PC culture is Bill Gates, the world's
richest man, Scott Bradner is as good a symbol of the Internet
culture as might be found.
</P>
<P>
   Bradner, 55, is neither rich nor famous, at least outside the
the Internet community. His two-family house in Cambridge belonged
long ago to a chief of police. His day job is as a consultant on
data networks to the Office of the Provost at Harvard University.
He writes a weekly column for Network World as well.
</P>
<P>
   But as co-director of the Transport Area of the Internet
Engineering Task Force and vice president for standards of the
Internet Society, he and the handful of others overseeing the
evolution of the Internet have been almost unbelievably powerful
over the last decade, in terms of empowering individuals and
bringing, among others, Bill Gates to his knees (insofar as anybody
worth $100 billion can be considered kneeling). Judge Jackson must
play a role as well.
</P>
<P>
   Which system of development _ Gates'? or Bradner's? _ has been
more advantageous to consumers? The question is far beyond the
ability of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to answer. Nevertheless, it
is PC culture that should be on trial in your daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Which technology do you use more easily? Which technology has
benefited you more?
</P>
<P>
   Peter H. Lewis of the New York Times put it succinctly the other
day, ``After nearly a quarter-century of intense research by many
of the greatest technical and marketing minds on the planet,
personal computers still force the average consumer to decipher an
eyeball-glazing catalog of technical mumbo-jumbo like this from a
recent newspaper advertisment:
</P>
<P>
   ``ATX w/300 Watt PS, 48x CD Rom, 9.1 GIG LVD U2W 2MB Buffer,
128MB PC100 ECC RAM, Intel P3 500 w/Fan, 8 MEG ATI Expert 98 AGP,
3Com 905tX 10/100 NIC . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Lewis, once you have decided on kinds of tasks
you want your new hardware to perform _ play music? view movies?
make phone calls? crunch numbers? process words? send e-mail? roam
the Web? _ you've got to choose between systems with which to give
instructions to your machines, Windows or Macintosh as a rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice between these operating systems is almost religious
in nature,'' says Lewis. ``Mac users are in the minority but
believe they are a click closer to heaven. Windows could be
described as a digital code version of a Hieronymous Bosch
painting. ... Both systems are more complicated and unstable than
they ought to be,'' though once you get on line, Lewis says, ``It
matters less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should that be the case? Consider the history of the
Internet. It had its rude beginnings in the 1960s as a system of
``packet switching'' _ conceived nearly simultaneously in
California and England with very different purposes in mind. The
Defense Deparment financed the development of the pioneering
ARPANET in the '70s; in the '80s in the hands of its government
contractors it unexpectedly mutated into a network of networks.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only in the '90s that its use exploded, thanks to the
ultimate user-friendly invention of the World Wide Web, a piece of
software and attendant protocols that made it easy to prowl around
the Internet simply by pointing and clicking with a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The long-sought ``killer ap,'' an application so popular that it
soon would create a demand for a computer in nearly every home,
emerged not from PC manufacturers nor software companies, but
instead all but unbidden from a couple of government labs, one in
Switzerland and the other in farm-belt Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   (Dependable histories of these events have finally begun to
appear. Thomas Hughes' chapter on the Internet in ``Rescuing
Prometheus'' remains the most readable, but now his doctoral
student Janet Abbate has gone far beyond the master to delineate
the separate strands in ``Inventing the Internet,'' published by
MIT Press earlier this year. It is an appropriately matter-of-fact
but thoroughly wonderful account _ it is a reworked dissertation,
after all.)
</P>
<P>
   So how is it that a program written by a young man in
Switzerland (Tim Berners-Lee), given away in 1990, and enhanced
dramatically three years later by a ``browser'' developed by some
other young men halfway around the world (Marc Andreessen and his
colleagues) could become the dominant techology in computing, in a
remarkably short period of time, with the permission of no one at
all?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of the Internet Enginering Task Force,
which creates the routing, management, and transport standards
without which the Internet would not exist. ``For something that
does not exist, the IETF has had quite an impact,'' says Scott
Bradner.
</P>
<P>
   In its own description, the IETF is ``a loosely self-organized
group of people who make technical and other contributions to the
engineering and evolution of the Internet and of new Internet
standards.
</P>
<P>
   It met for the first time in January 1986 in San Diego _ 15
persons attended, all of them government contractors who advised
the Pentagon on its spending stream. Eighteen months later, more
than 100 computer scientists and engineers attended the seventh
meeting, many of them vendors with no link to government.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Society was formed in January 1992 in Kobe, Japan,
and the present-day structure emerged. The next year the IETF met
in Europe for the first time (the history and much else of interest
can be found in the entry on The Tao of the IETF, posted at
www.ietf.org). When the task force met earlier this month in
Washington, some 2,400 persons showed up and quickly sorted
themselves into the 115 or so working groups or birds-of-a-feather
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   There is no membership in the IETF; anybody who wants can show
up. There is, however, a definite hierarchy, with a decision-making
steering group composed of the directors and co-directors of the
eight functional groups (applications, Internet, next generation,
network management, operational requirements, routing, security,
transport, and user service) _ fewer than 15 people in all.
</P>
<P>
   The IETF, in others words, is a users' group _ the biggest and
most powerful in the world. No government underwrites its
standards; no company manipulates its decisions: indeed, attendees
represent only themselves. ``If someone got up and said, `Nortel
thinks ...,' they would be booed,'' says Bradner. A tiny staff
office in Virginia runs its meetings and offers limited staff
support. Its meeting are strictly pay-as-you go.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Linux operating system for personal computers _ a
rising alternative to Windows and Macintosh _ has gotten the lion's
share of the attention for ``open source'' software, whose
underlying code many be modified by any and all, the IETF also is a
case study in the open-source movement, Bradner says. In fact, it
existed long before there was such a convenient label to describe
the process by which software is written that nobody owns. The Task
Force has no proprietary secrets; its documents are freely
available over the Internet and can be reproduced at will.
</P>
<P>
   The IETF also differs from other standard-setting organizations
such as the International Telecommunications Union and the
International Standards Organization in that its motto is ``rough
consensus and running code.'' ``Running code'' means that it
undertakes only projects demonstrated to be practical; ``rough
consensus'' means that, since absolute unanimity is not required
among its executive committee, its proposals have fewer features
added to quiet noisy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Simpler standards mean greater success. And it was the elegant
standards of the IETF, simply written and speedily established,
that have made possible the rapid dissemination of innovations like
the World Wide Web and its browsers which loosened the grip of
Microsoft on a key part of the market. That doesn't mean Judge
Jackson needn't play a role in restraining the abuse of Microsoft's
awsome market power; it just means it is only one part of an epic
contest. The next target for the Internet model: the telephone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Kids of a certain sort in my generation grew up on Isaac
Asimov's ``Foundation'' novels of the far-off future, in which a
struggle unfolds between a galactic empire and a mysterious
nonprofit foundation. (A watered-down version of the story provides
the underpinnings of the ``Star Wars'' films.)
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, a band of self-effacing wise men, is shielded
from the wrath of the emperor by the superiority of their wisdom
and the ordinariness of their surroundings. How astonishing to find
the plot at the heart of the main developments in industrial
organization of our time!

FOYT'S WINSTON CUP TEAM PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cars are being built even before the shop is finished.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Waddell Wilson says, the team has three intermediate
cars about ready to go and is working on two more for Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to work around the construction,'' said Wilson, the
general manager for A.J. Foyt's new Winston Cup team. ``We brought
in an air compressor to blow the dust off so we can keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The building is pretty much just a shell with power in it,''
Wilson said. ``We're adding an engine shop, a chassis shop We're
dividing it up and expanding it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt and Wilson are battle-scarred warriors of the racing world.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt is an open-wheel veteran and one of the most versatile
drivers who ever lived. He is the only man ever to win the Indy 500
(four times), the Daytona 500 and the 24 Hours of LeMans.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was a respected engine builder and key figure behind the
scenes as stock racing developed, serving as crew chief for such as
Cale Yarborough, Bobby Allison and Buddy Baker. When Yarborough
became the first man ever to top 200 mph at Daytona in 1983, he did
it with an engine built by Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   So on the surface, this would seem to be a very strong
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Although his major interest has been Indy cars _ Foyt owns an
Indy Racing League team and his driver, Kenny Brack, won this
year's Indy 500 _ he has always liked stock car racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I always wanted to get involved with, but I
never had the right opportunity before now,'' Foyt said.
</P>
<P>
   The right opportunity came when Conseco, a firm specializing in
financial services, agreed to sponsor his effort beginning with the
2000 Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt will run Pontiacs and the cars will carry the number 14,
Foyt's number when he was competing.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bliss, 34 and a five-year veteran of NASCAR's truck series,
will drive for Foyt. Bliss finished in the top 10 in points and won
at least one race each year he raced trucks. He won once and was
ninth in points in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss' crew chief will be veteran mechanic Terry Wooten, who
worked for Junior Johnson and Robert Yates. Greg Wilson, Waddell
Wilson's son, heads up the engine department.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Foyt's team has 17 employees and will expand to about
30, according to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a common theme that runs through the shaping of the
team, it is experience.
</P>
<P>
   From Foyt and Wilson on down, essentially, the team is and will
be composed of people who have been there, done that in racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running a school here, I've had enough of that,'' said
Wilson, who worked with some teams that struggled in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a negative here, it is that while the leaders of
this team are old guard, racing has changed tremendously since they
were in their prime, and some wonder whether they can adapt to it.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson says both he and Foyt realize this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting people with a lot of experience from a lot of
different sources,'' Wilson said. ``We're compiling a lot of
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said they bought a car from Joe Gibbs that Tony Stewart
ran at Charlotte when he won The Winston. He also said the team has
been working with experts in areas like engineering, shocks and
tires.
</P>
<P>
   And although Stewart raised the bar for rookies and new teams
with his three wins this year, Wilson said Foyt's operation won't
try to jump over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Stewart had everything in place and he was able to make
it all happen,'' Wilson said. ``We're starting from scratch. We
haven't even completed our building yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can finish in the top 20 in points and make every race,
I think that would be a good start,'' Wilson added.
</P>
<P>
   And it could happen, because it's not as if these guys haven't
done it before.

ECOLOGY CAN BE FUN

   (For release Sunday, Nov. 28)

 By DOUGLAS CENTURY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Matt E. Silver, the rave music producer, anxiously
paced the bar at Wetlands on Tuesday night, waiting for his friend,
the alternative rock star Perry Farrell, to speak. ``Perry looks
like a little boy up there,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   The Spitfire college speaking tour had hit New York. The tour
features musicians, actors like Woody Harrelson, and advocates
speaking on topics ranging from the legalization of marijuana to
vegetarianism. For Wetlands, the eco-friendly nightclub in TriBeCa,
it was another night of youthful idealism, as the crowd, mostly of
college age, milled around in hemp clothing and T-shirts with
slogans like ``Please don't eat Babe for breakfast.'' Michael
Franti, a rapper in dreadlocks, read fiery freestyle poetry. Julia
Butterfly Hill, an environmental attention-getter, called from her
cell phone in her treehouse home in Stafford, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell, former front man for the bands Jane's Addiction and
Porno for Pyros, spoke about the Jubilee 2000 Coalition, an
organization dedicated to the cancellation of debt in developing
nations. Farrell, formerly Perry Bernstein, began his speech with a
booming Hebrew call: ``Sh'ma Yisroel,'' meaning ``Hear, O Israel.''
To which Silver said, ``There's the bar mitzvah boy.''
</P>
<P>
   If Farrell is the wide-eyed rock idealist, Silver is decidedly
the more cynical of the pair. ``This is Perry's thing, not mine,''
he said of Spitfire. With close-cropped hair and boxy Gucci
eyeglasses, Silver, known for producing events ranging from the
rave at Woodstock to Stephen Sprouse fashion shows, appears more
interested in the cause of fun.
</P>
<P>
   For an exit from the club, with a harem of models in tow, Silver
had arranged a long gas-guzzling limousine. They headed to
Waterloo, the West Village restaurant, where Farrell ordered
poached trout and Silver had baked codfish. A member of their party
proclaimed himself a member of the ``raw food movement'' and
preached against the ``unnatural'' practice of cooking. He ate a
green salad.
</P>
<P>
   As dinner arrived, Silver was shaking his head about some old
friends he had run into at Wetlands. ``I can't believe I saw those
kids who went to the same Yeshiva I went to in kindergarten,''
Silver said. He reminisced about his first girlfriend, a rabbi's
daughter. ``It started in second grade, we went steady in the
third, and in the fourth we had problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell said, ``I always wanted to date a rabbi's daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair met five years ago at an alternative rock festival, and
since then Silver has produced Farrell's concerts. They recently
had a concert in the jungle outside Sao Paolo, Brazil, and they are
planning a New Year's Eve beach party for Miami Beach. As they
turned to leave, Farrell said: ``You know, Matt E. is from the
Studio 54 days, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Silver confessed: ``I was a disco bartender. At midnight I used
to take off my shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   The posse returned to the limo, stopped at Hush, a club on West
19th Street, and by 2:30 a.m. had arrived at Sway, a
Moroccan-themed club on Spring Street. A fresh gaggle of models
piled into their booth. Soon, Farrell was dancing to Arabic music,
and Silver, ever the businessman, was working the room, talking to
filmmakers. And actresses.

NEW INSIGHT INTO EVEREST MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putting yourself in the boots of a dead stranger to deduce what
he thought and did in his final hours is a detective's technique.
But when the death occurred more than 75 years ago in one of the
most remote points of the earth, the task seems nigh impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery on May 1 of the frozen body of George Leigh
Mallory high on Mount Everest has revived a decades-old debate
about what happened to Mallory and his young companion, Andrew
Irvine, on June 8, 1924, when they attempted the first ascent of
the world's highest mountain. Did they reach the 29,035-foot-high
summit before they died? What misjudgment precipitated their
deaths? Why were Mallory's snow goggles found in his pocket?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions have generated a spirited debate in
mountaineering circles that pits scientific theory against wisdom
accumulated at high altitude, generating three new books whose
authors include veterans of Mount Everest. Sifting among the clues,
the climber-sleuths have drawn upon old journals, letters and
recovered relics _ a hobnailed boot, an oxygen cylinder, snow
goggles, a frayed rope _ that look antiquated to climbers today,
who venture forth costumed and equipped more like astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting theories agree only that Mallory and his
companions merit far more respect than history accorded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The historical record does not prove them to be naive and
bumbling amateurs, but tough, able and exceptionally strong
mountaineers who succeeded repeatedly and often brilliantly in
uncharted terrain with none of the modern conveniences that today's
climbers have come to take for granted,'' Eric Simonson, Jochen
Hemmleb and Larry Johnson wrote in their book, ``Ghosts of Everest:
The Search for Mallory and Irvine'' (Mountaineers Books).
</P>
<P>
   Simon, who led the expedition that found Mallory's body, and
Hemmleb and Johnson, who were members, went further, arguing that
Mallory and Irvine may well have reached the summit before
perishing on their descent.
</P>
<P>
   But David Breashears, the co-author with Audrey Salkeld of
``Last Climb: The Legendary Everest Expeditions of Mallory and
Irvine,'' (National Geographic) thinks not, based on his own four
ascents of Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great leap of faith to get those two men up to the top
that day,'' said Breashears, who co-produced and filmed last year's
IMAX documentary about Everest. ``It's an even greater leap of
faith to get them down to where Mallory's body was found.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Anker, who found Mallory's body, is as dubious in his
book, written with David Roberts, ``The Lost Explorer: Finding
Mallory on Mount Everest'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster).
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me sad to be on the skeptical, debunking side of the
debate,'' Anker wrote, concluding nonetheless, ``I believe there is
no possible way Mallory and Irvine could have reached the summit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghosts of Everest'' explains its rationale by quoting Sherlock
Holmes: ``When you have eliminated what cannot be, whatever
remains, no matter how improbable, is what must be.''
</P>
<P>
   By calculating how long each cylinder of supplementary oxygen
could have lasted (3 hours 40 minutes) and how fast the climbers
could have ascended (230 feet an hour), the authors deduced that
Mallory and Irvine succeeded because they packed extra oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible, even probable, that Mallory and Irvine were
carrying a full load of three cylinders each when they left Camp VI
on June 8, 1924 _ enough to last nearly 12 hours on full flow, and
even longer on a lower flow,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Breashears disputed the scientific inference, saying, ``The
weakness is when you cannot take yourself out of the laboratory and
into the crucible of climbing at 28,000 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallory, he pointed out, referred to two bottles apiece in a
note sent down to the rest of the expedition. ``It doesn't make
sense to me that you wake up after a sleepless night and say you
want to carry more, when the real climbing begins,'' Breashears
said. ``Suddenly they're going to add 8 more pounds?''
</P>
<P>
   And because Mallory did not take his flashlight, he could not
have set out before dawn, as Everest climbers do today. This meant
that Mallory and Irvine would have had to race to the summit in
order to descend to high camp before dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of your performance goes down with the level of
oxygen available,'' Breashears said. ``No one has ever run a
six-minute mile at sea level and a four-minute mile at 28,000
feet.`
</P>
<P>
   As for the crux of the ascent, a sheer cliff more than 90 feet
high called the Second Step, Simonson and his co-authors suggested
that Mallory and Irvine had climbed it and that on their way down,
Mallory could have lowered Irvine down the cliff with their rope
and then descended unaided.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, a respected mountaineer, called the scenario
preposterous. ``I think one has to be cautious not to overdeduce,''
he said, ``not to build a house of cards on a theory in which there
are three oxygen bottles.``
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days after finding Mallory, Anker set out to climb the
Second Step without using a rickety ladder left by Chinese climbers
in 1975, to determine whether Mallory and Irvine could have done
it. Anker, a fine technical climber, pronounced it too difficult
for the two men with their limited tools in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Mallory and Irvine had miraculously climbed the Second
Step, they would have been stranded above it,'' Anker wrote. ``Few
climbing ropes at the time were longer than 100 feet.'' A piece of
the rope found around Mallory's body indicated that he and Irvine
had been tied together when they fell.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmleb, a German amateur historian, scrutinized a photograph
taken by the Chinese expedition to calculate where Mallory's high
camp would have been and where his body would have fallen. Yet
Anker, when he found Mallory, was searching outside the area
designated by Hemmleb.
</P>
<P>
   The discoverers of Mallory's body, struck by the ``repose in
which he lay,'' concluded that he did not fall from a great height
and had not died instantly. But Conrad observed that Mallory could
not have lived long because his body showed no signs of frostbite.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts explained, ``If he had spent the night out, there would
have been frostbite on the face.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Irvine's corpse might have been spotted in 1975 by one of the
Chinese climbers who was later killed in an avalanche, but has not
been seen since. Why Mallory, who at age 37 was considered the best
mountaineer of his era, chose to take along Irvine, who was only 22
and had minimal climbing experience, is another of the expedition's
unanswered questions. Breashears suggested that Mallory had wanted
someone younger who would obey rather than challenge his decisions.
And Irvine understood how the oxygen system worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Mallory is going to have this last attempt and is going
to use bottled oxygen _ a temperamental apparatus that needs
constant maintenance,'' Breashears said, ``he needs a man who can
look after that and knows it well.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The goggles in Mallory's pocket encouraged speculation that he
was descending after dark when he fell. But Breashears ticked off
other possibilities: the goggles might have gotten clogged with
snow; Mallory might have removed them to climb in shadow; or he
might have carried a spare set, because the expedition's acting
leader, Edward F. Norton, was immobilized with snow blindness a few
days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   More perplexing, the searchers found on Mallory no photograph of
his wife Ruth, which he was carrying to the top of Everest, nor any
letter from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are they if not at the summit?'' the authors of ``Ghosts
of Everest'' asked.
</P>
<P>
   Most investigators doubt that the mystery will be unraveled
until Irvine's body is found, because he may have carried Mallory's
small Kodak camera. If Mallory wanted to be the first man atop
Everest, they reason, he would have had Irvine take the photograph.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When other artifacts retrieved from Mallory's body were
displayed two weeks ago in Explorers Hall at the National
Geographical Society in Washington, Roberts was struck by how
flimsy the rope was. ``When you look at that rope, you can't
imagine tying into it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Breashears and Ms. Salkeld, a mountaineering historian,
contended in ``Last Climb'' that the preoccupation over whether
Mallory and Irvine made the summit is really beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote: ``The death of these two heroes _ for surely that is
what they were _ reminds us of a time when there were still
triumphant moments of exploration on this planet, when it was still
possible to walk off the map _ when the slopes of the world's
highest peaks were untrodden and the shape of the great mountain
could only be imagined.''

INFLATION IS STILL THE ONLY REAL THREAT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By TOM REDBURN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American economy is on track to break the record set in the
1960s of 8 years and 10 months of uninterrupted growth without a
recession. So before the real celebrations begin early next year,
it's only fair to ask the question: What will bring the good times
to an end?
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure something will. For while there is no end in
sight for the current expansion, which began in March 1991, and
there is plenty of evidence that the American economy has entered a
new era of higher productivity growth than in the 1970s and '80s,
that does not mean the business cycle is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mix of growth and inflation looks pretty good to us,''
said Kim Schoenholtz, chief economist at Salomon Smith Barney, the
investment banking arm of Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Schoenholtz and his team at Salomon Smith Barney are
convinced that the economy has plenty of life in it still. They are
probably right. ``But if you want to find reasons to worry,'' he
says, ``you can round up the usual suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the usual suspects. The words made me think not so much of
Claude Rains's great line near the end of ``Casablanca,'' as of the
1995 movie that used the phrase as its title and made Kevin Spacey
a star. And the echoes from that film are even more apt: Just as
Keyser Soze, the hero-villain in ``The Usual Suspects,'' walks away
from the mayhem with a fortune, so too the American economy is
likely to emerge relatively unscathed from the next downturn,
whenever it comes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: There are several clear sources of tension within
the economy today. Household debt has risen to record levels, just
as it did before nearly every previous recession. The current
account deficit _ which requires Americans to sell off assets to
pay for all the extra imports we buy _ has soared well past its old
peak. Oil prices are on the upswing. And the stock market, by
almost any measure, is overvalued, stirring fears that a sharp fall
on Wall Street could prompt many affluent Americans, no longer so
flush with their winnings, to tighten their belts.
</P>
<P>
   But consider the suspects one by one.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, Americans have never stopped spending on their own
merely because their debts reached what seemed like excessive
levels. Yes, real consumer spending cannot continue growing at its
breathless pace of over 5 percent a year. But even when consumers
do take a much-needed breather, a slowdown in spending would almost
certainly not be enough to bring the expansion to a halt. It is
only after a recession hits and job losses rise that Americans tend
to begin repairing their personal balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The one recession sometimes attributed to a spontaneous drop in
consumer spending _ the 1990-91 downturn that coincided with the
buildup and fighting of the gulf war _ is more logically blamed on
the sudden shock of higher oil prices on top of the Federal
Reserve's earlier efforts, at the end of the 1980s, to reverse a
buildup of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of oil prices, they played a starring role in the
recession of 1973-74 (Arab oil embargo), the extended downturn at
the beginning of the 1980s (Iranian revolution) and at the time of
the gulf war. But each time oil prices took off, they also prompted
or helped perpetuate a broader wage-price spiral, forcing the Fed
to react by sharply raising interest rates to control inflation.
There is no sign in the markets that the latest jump in oil prices,
to around $27 a barrel, will have a similarly broad effect.
</P>
<P>
   And even if higher oil prices, combined perhaps with a drop in
the value of the dollar from worries over the big deficits with
America's trading partners, caused a flurry of inflation fears, the
Fed could probably dampen them with only a modest further
tightening of the monetary spigot.
</P>
<P>
   Of the handful of usual suspects, then, only one, a stock market
collapse, probably can spread enough fear to cause a recession by
itself. That's clearly worth worrying about _ but remember October
1987 (or October 1998, for that matter) vs. October 1929. The Fed
does.
</P>
<P>
   Policy makers have a clear script to follow in response to panic
on Wall Street: flood the markets with cash and bring interest
rates down quickly. That may create problems later on, but such
moves would certainly limit any damage to the real economy from the
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   So for all these other worries, the real risk to the economy
remains the traditional bad guy: price inflation driven by wage
gains well in excess of productivity improvements. ``The danger,''
says Robert DiClemente, who watches the American economy for
Salomon Smith Barney, ``is that success breeds excess.''
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, like Franco, is still dead. But just as in ``The
Usual Suspects,'' the least likely suspect could turn out to be the
murderer in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keaton once said, `I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of
him,''' Kevin Spacey's character, Verbal Kint, tells the agents
investigating the crime. ``Well, I believe in God, and the only
thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that should scare us these days is the threat of
inflation. Allowed to escape, inflation could kill our remarkably
healthy economy just as it is beginning to help those long left out
of America's rising prosperity. Fortunately, the villain _ at least
for now _ is safely locked away.

 &HT;    Reform Party faces uphill battle in Campaign 2000
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Reform Party is attracting national attention with
fiery conservative Pat Buchanan seeking the party's presidential
nomination. Donald Trump, a flamboyant New York real estate mogul,
is already taking shots at Buchanan, and he may soon enter the
race.
</P>
<P>
   So it's frustrating to Anne Merkl, chairwoman of Georgia's
Reform Party, when people tell her they're intrigued by the party
but that they doubt they'll get the chance to vote for one of its
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hear it every day,'' Merkl said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no guarantee that the names of the Reform Party's
presidential nominees will appear on ballots in Georgia, the
District of Columbia and 28 other states. In most of those states,
the party's candidates did not win a high enough percentage of
votes in the most recent statewide elections to gain automatic
ballot access in the Nov. 7, 2000 general election.
</P>
<P>
   In coming months, Reform Party officials and candidates face a
daunting election-year hurdle: collecting enough signatures on
petitions to qualify the presidential candidates for next year's
election.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, to qualify for the election, the Reform Party must
collect 39,107 valid signatures, which represents 1 percent of
Georgians registered to vote in the 1998 state election. Georgia
party officials hope to collect twice as many signatures as
required to offset ones they expect to be invalidated by the
Georgia secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Around the South, petition signatures also must be collected in
Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia,
according to the Reform Party USA.
</P>
<P>
   The party already has a place on the ballot in Florida,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not easy, it is not cheap, but it is doable,'' said
University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party will hold a primary election to select its
presidential nominee. National balloting will take place in July,
by mail and over the Internet. The party will announce its
presidential nominee during it Aug. 10-13 national convention in
Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, candidates seeking the presidential nominee
must qualify as ''independent candidates'' under varying rules in
the states where the Reform Party does not have automatic ballot
access.
</P>
<P>
   A registered voter can participate in the Reform Party's primary
if he belongs to one of the Reform Party's state affiliates or if
he signed a ballot-access petition. Or, a voter can contact the
Reform Party affiliate in his state and express his desire to vote
in the primary, said Michael Farris, chairman of the party's
nominations committee.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Republican until he switched to the Reform Party last
month, Buchanan is gearing up his ballot-access campaign. Recently,
he hired Matt Sawyer, who worked for Ross Perot campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato credited Texas billionaire Perot, the Reform Party's
founder and its 1992 and 1996 presidential nominee, for
''developing a road map for producing 50-state ballot access.''
</P>
<P>
   In those elections, Perot's backers turned out to sign up voters
to the Reform Party, billed as an alternative to Republicans and
Democrats whose partisan bickering, according to complaints, had
bogged down Congress and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is growing, said Reform Party officials who
believe it will spur the drive for 2000 ballot access.
</P>
<P>
   ''Early in the campaign season, it is a foregone conclusion that
(Vice President) Al Gore and (Texas Gov.) George W. Bush will be
their respective parties' nominees,'' Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People do not feel like their vote counts for anything,'' he
said. ''People are looking for an alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Merkl said, Reform Party workers will urge
registered voters at shopping centers and other public places to
sign petitions ''if they would like to see the Reform Party on the
ballot in Georgia. We will not ask about individual candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Merkl said she expects Buchanan and other candidates to mount
campaign drives, starting early next year. That's a crucial part of
winning ballot access, said national party official Donna Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is up to the candidates to inspire the Reform Party as a
whole to get out and do the petitioning work necessary to get the
ballot access we need in all 50 states,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates typically hire professional signature gatherers. They
charge a dollar or two, or more, per signature _ an expense that
Trump, if he seeks the presidential nomination, could easily pay
out of own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan's campaign said it is not worried by Trump's
wealth, at least not in gaining ballot access. ''It is not like it
is going to cost $30 million to get on the ballot,'' said Buchanan
finance director Robert Bowes, estimating the cost at $4 million to
$6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The party's Web page - www.reformparty.org - contains further
information about ballot access.

 &HT;    Time Warner to introduce cartoons through internet
 &HT;    By Michael Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Time Warner is set to launch a Web-based cartoon
channel next week.
</P>
<P>
   The site, Entertaindom, will take content from a variety of
sources within the $26.8 billion-a-year Time Warner empire,
including Warner Bros. studios and Time's Entertainment Weekly.
Time Warner also owns Atlanta-based Cable News Network.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials were unavailable for comment Friday. But they
told Reuters earlier this week that they hope to draw more than 2
million users in its first month of operation. Among the draws will
be programs like Looney Tunes cartoons and a three-dimensional
``Superman.'' Also planned is ``The God and Devil Show,'' in which
animated versions of the deity and Satan will ``interview''
celebrities and viewers will be asked to vote on the fate to which
the guests will be consigned.
</P>
<P>
   The launch will be another step in the Net's continuing
exploration of what consumers want and how much companies will pay
for the right to be in front of a consumer's eyes. At least at
first, Time Warner expects to reap revenue from the site via
advertising and fees charged to retailers who will have Internet
links to their sites on the Entertaindom site.
</P>
<P>
   Media companies continue to toy with the Internet. Much of the
talk about video has been tempered by knowledge that for most

WHAT YOU EAT TO LIVE (OR LIVE TO EAT) IS WHO YOU ARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Russia, France, Italy, Calif.)   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of story.)  (DW) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

<P>
   When Vladimir I, the Prince of Kiev in the 10th century, decided
he was going to abandon paganism, he summoned representatives of
four great religions to his court: Christians from Rome, Christians
from Byzantium, Muslims and Jews. After long discussions of the
differing faiths, the prince's attention turned to food. Vladimir,
who apparently loved roast pig, was dismayed by the Jewish
avoidance of pork. He was put off by the Bulgarian Muslims' disdain
for alcohol (``We Russians like to drink, and there is no way we
can live without it''). The occasional fasting of Roman Christians
worried him (``Our forefathers would not approve''). So, Byzantine
Christianity became Russia's diet of choice.
</P>
<P>
   But what determines food's powers? Why are tastes so different?
Insects are devoured in Africa and South America, but not in
Europe. Frogs are savored in France, but not elsewhere. A Scottish
dish, haggis, is made from the heart, lungs and livers of sheep,
and a medieval Arab delicacy is perfumed fat extracted from a
sheep's tail; but have these specialties caught on in any other
sheep-grazing culture?
</P>
<P>
   Such unsolved food mysteries, though, can hardly be blamed on
the subject's neglect, particularly not in France. As Gertrude
Stein put it, ``Every country talks about eating but in that
country they talk about talking about eating.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact in the last 40 years, beginning in France, the study of
food has become a full-scale academic preoccupation, seasoned by
the influence of the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, whose
magisterial studies of food and culture revealed how many meanings
lie coded in seemingly arbitrary tastes.
</P>
<P>
   These preoccupations can now be sampled in the book ``Food: A
Culinary History'' (Columbia University Press), a French academic
smorgasbord edited by Jean-Louis Flandrin, a professor of social
science in Paris, and Massimo Montanari, a professor at the
University of Bologna (the translations have been edited and
abridged by Albert Sonnenfeld, a professor of French at the
University of Southern California). The selections have something
for almost every taste, ranging from ``Food Culture in Ancient
Egypt'' to ``The Origins of Public Hostelries in Europe,'' from
``The Social Function of Banquets'' to ``The `McDonaldization' of
Culture.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is somewhat shocking to find no biographical
information about the contributing scholars and no publication
history for these papers (I recall one from The New York Review of
Books), such flaws can be overlooked for the sake of the plentiful
details. We learn, for example, that in medieval Europe, just as
fields were measured by their production of sheaves of wheat and
meadows by cart-loads of hay, forests were measured by their
population of pigs. We learn that the first ``restaurant'' was
opened in 1765 near the Louvre in Paris, offering ``restaurants'' _
meat-based consommes meant to ``restore'' a diner's strength. In
passing, we find out that the night before the American bombing of
Baghdad in 1991, Domino's delivered 101 pizzas to the Pentagon
instead of the usual 3.
</P>
<P>
   But in the midst of the detail, one theme recurs: food
establishes who we are and who we are not. In ancient Rome the
daily consumption of meat was considered a sign of barbarian
tastes; in the late Middle Ages, aristocrats looked down on
plebeian vegetables; in Renaissance Italy a nobleman claimed that
partridges and other ``delicate meats'' create a ``supple
intelligence and sensibility'' lacking in those who eat only beef
and pork. When it comes to food, in fact, distinction seems to be
part of the point. One writer, in 1685, called taste ``the
noblest'' of the senses), partly because it implies social and
national hierarchies.
</P>
<P>
   The best essays in this book, influenced by Levi-Strauss, take
one more step. The preparation of food, they suggest, reflects each
society's internal logic. Cultures create a language of food out of
undifferentiated fodder. Some foods may be eaten raw, others only
cooked; some combinations are encouraged, others forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   The book's most brilliant offering, an analysis of the dietary
rules of the ancient Hebrews by Jean Soler, shows how the biblical
injunctions of kashrut _ keeping kosher _ were attempts to
reproduce divine order in the realm of food. Each creature, in this
view, belongs to one and only one realm: the sea, the land, the
air, and each realm's creatures have their own distinctive forms of
locomotion: swimming, walking, flying. Any creature violating those
distinctions or ambiguously straddling them (like mussels or
snakes) is forbidden. These dietary laws are meant to have both
moral and metaphysical implications.
</P>
<P>
   As Florence Dupont shows, a different set of distinctions was
made in ancient Rome: foods were associated with either farmers or
shepherds, the countryside or the city, the snack or the banquet.
In the 16th century, there were attempts to organize foods
according to alchemical law. Nine flavors were identified
(proceeding from acerbic through sour and sweet, all the way to
acrid), each of which had a relationship to the four elements of
the universe (earth, air, fire, water); each flavor could be
transformed into another through the application of heat.
</P>
<P>
   These examples whet the appetite for analysis the anthology
cannot satisfy. But even the contemporary world gets surprisingly
cursory treatment. Why not apply the weighty evidence from the past
to current-day eating habits? How does contemporary food reflect
distinctions, when fast-food franchises eliminate all distinctions
of time and place? Can food create a powerful social language when
the dominant categories in mass culture are convenience and cost?
Have pricey restaurants become the last refuge for food's ordered
meanings? If so they may be flourishing not just for gustatory
reasons, but also for metaphysical ones.

IN MALAYSIA, A STRONG MAN IS WEAKENED BY CHANGING ASIAN VALUES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is all
but certain to win a parliamentary election next week, but already,
to many people here, he seems like a relic of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning against a disorganized and overmatched opposition,
he is demanding _ and is likely to gain _ a vote of thanks on
Monday for the stability and economic growth he has brought during
his 18-year rule, the longest in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has been an exercise in raw political dominance
despite widespread public uneasiness over Mahathir's firing, trial
and public humiliation of his former deputy and heir apparent,
Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   But like other countries in the region, Malaysia has begun to
outgrow the father-knows-best style of leadership that Mahathir
helped to promote under the label ``Asian values.'' Like people in
other Southeast Asian countries, Malaysians have grown more
prosperous, better educated, better informed and more politically
assertive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a more questioning electorate, no longer bound by the
traditional mentality of accepting goodies from the government in
exchange for their loyalty,'' said Husein Mutalib, an expert on
Malaysia at the National University of Singapore. ``For better or
for worse, Mahathir's days are numbered.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift is part of a tide of political change that is sweeping
through Southeast Asia, fueled by more than a decade of rapid
growth and in some cases accelerated by the shock of the region's
economic crisis during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   From the upheavals of Indonesia to the hard-fought
constitutional changes of Thailand, strongman rule is giving way to
the clamor and jostle of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key word is participation,'' said William J. Klausner, an
American political scientist who teaches at Chulalongkorn
University in Thailand. ``It's the creation of alternative centers
of power, whether they are non-governmental organizations or the
media or investigative reporting or bolder academic research.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one form or another this is happening in all the countries
in the region. People like Mahathir have to face up to this, face
up to the fact that they can no longer operate unchallenged.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Mahathir, 73, could be forgiven if he misses
this point. With a crack of the whip and a shout through the
bullhorn, he still has his people jumping through hoops.
</P>
<P>
   The press and the airwaves belong to him. So does almost all of
the country's political infrastructure. Much of Malaysia's wealth
is his to distribute. When it counts, the police and the courts
answer to his needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without authority and stability there can be no civility,''
Mahathir argues in a recently published book, ``A New Deal for
Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some of his strongest allies _ as once happened with
the former Indonesian president, Suharto _ whisper that he has
outstayed his welcome.
</P>
<P>
   They are employing the ruling party's overwhelming dominance to
keep the opposition on the run. But they are hearing the kinds of
criticisms that preceded Suharto's forced resignation in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing the last stages not only of Mahathir's rule but
also of the type of leadership he represents,'' said Lim Guan Eng,
a prominent opponent of the prime minister. ``Whether he wins or
not, the point is, many Malaysians are fed up with the corruption,
the abuses of power and the crony capitalism. He feels he can get
away with anything he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they have not run an effective campaign, Mahathir's
mutually antagonistic political opponents _ an ethnic Chinese
party, Islamic fundamentalists and liberal democrats _ have united
for the first time in an attempt to capitalize on the growing
discontent with his autocratic ways.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal is a symbolic one: to deny his party, known as Umno,
the two-thirds majority it has always enjoyed in Parliament. If
they succeed, many political analysts say his party is likely to
remove him as its leader _ and as prime minister _ at a congress
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect things to change no matter who wins,'' said M.G.G.
Pillai, a political commentator. ``The government has lost its
right to dictate. The attitude has always been, `You elected us,
now shut up. We have the mandate.' That doesn't work any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes surfaced in Malaysia in 1997 when the region's
economic crisis put a halt to its decade-long growth spurt of 8
percent a year and made Mahathir's obsession with monumental
building projects look foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``That year was to be the apotheosis; Mahathir was to be taken
up bodily into into Valhalla,'' said Ronald Palmer, a former
American ambassador here who is a professor at George Washington
University. Malaysia was host to the Commonwealth Games, it opened
a new airport, it prepared to move the seat of government to a
newly built city and it inaugurated the twin Petronas Towers, the
world's tallest buildings.
</P>
<P>
   When things went wrong, Mahathir turned his anger on the West,
blaming George Soros and other currency traders, who he said were
upset at his success.
</P>
<P>
   Then in September 1998 he shocked his countrymen by firing and
shaming Anwar, 52, who has since been sentenced to six years in
prison for corruption and is now on trial on charges of sexual
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   That trial has been suspended during the election campaign, and
few people here have any doubt that the intention was to remove
Anwar from the public eye. The chief judge pleaded a backache.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like Anwar; I think he's just as much a rascal as the
others, only better packaged,'' said Pillai. But in a typical
comment, he added: ``I support him because I don't want to see my
deputy prime minister treated this way. If this can happen to my
deputy prime minister, it can happen to me, and there'll be nobody
to cry for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Discontent over the treatment of Anwar has divided the ethnic
Malays who make up about 60 percent of the population. Mahathir's
most solid support now comes from the Chinese minority of 30
percent and the Indians, who make up about 10 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Another key constituency worries the ruling party: the young.
Some political analysts say Mahathir called an early election to
keep at bay 680,000 newly registered voters who will not be
eligible to participate until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's generational, the ideas of liberalism, of wanting to
chart Asia on a different course of participatory democracy,'' said
Charles Santiago, who heads the Center for Economic and Social
Research at Stamford College in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been dissent in the past but not in the magnitude
you see it right now,'' he said. ``And that was because of
prosperity. Prosperity has a certain co-opting tendency. But now
people are waking up and saying, `Wow, what's going on? What's
happening to this poor country of ours?'''

MEDIATOR'S PATIENT HAND CUT PATH OUT OF NORTHERN IRELAND
STALEMATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The grim, unyielding men from the
remote poles of Ulster politics were still getting adjusted to
being seated side by side around a dining room table when their
host hit them with another novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, you guys, tonight I don't want anyone talking about the
negotiations,'' said George Mitchell, the mediator of peace talks
then in their seventh grinding week. ``I want us to talk about
other things and see if we can just have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation turned to fishing, family, sports and, as is
inevitable in Northern Ireland, the weather. Then someone mentioned
opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why I love opera?'' Mitchell interjected. ``When I go
home and put on `La Boheme,' I know Rodolfo's going to sing the
same words every time, and it gets me prepared to come back to
Belfast because the one thing I know is that I'm going to have to
sit here and listen to you guys saying the same thing over and over
again every time.''
</P>
<P>
   His listeners were men with no history of enjoying being made
fun of. But they laughed.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, people had been waiting for a breakthrough
in the deadlocked effort to put into place the measures called for
in the Northern Ireland peace agreement of April 1998. As Mitchell
recalled in an interview weeks later, this lighthearted moment may
have been the beginning of it.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians would go on to develop a solution that, subject
to a crucial approval vote by the quarrelsome Ulster Unionist Party
Council in Belfast on Saturday, will lead to the start-up next week
of the new power-sharing Northern Ireland government called for in
the original settlement.
</P>
<P>
   That accord, a set of measures that balances the demands of the
conflicted province's two religious communities and parcels out
authority between them, holds the promise of lasting civic peace
and an end to paramilitary violence that has taken more than 3,300
lives in the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the outbreak of dinner-table camaraderie,
the barbs and snubs that had been the only means of communication
between the sworn enemies were replaced by the first expressions of
mutual understanding. Some comments were positively quaint coming
from such longtime antagonists.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, the hard-bitten chief negotiator of Sinn
Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, began a
session one morning by reciting the opening lines of a poem. ``The
days of our future stand before us like a row of little lighted
candles,'' he said. David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists,
told the group pointedly that he had devoted his opera- listening
the night before to Richard Strauss' ``Friedenstag'' (``Day of
Peace'').
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Catholic and Protestant parties had long
refused to exchange a single word, but under Mitchell's patient
strategy of holding extended gatherings in isolated locations under
a strict news blackout, they developed a shared level of comfort
and succeeded in producing the long-sought exit from stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The day last July that Mitchell got the surprise call to take up
his mediation role in Belfast was coincidentally the day that he
was being feted for the successful outcome of his last extended
stay in the province. He had been chairman of the talks that
produced the Northern Ireland peace agreement 15 months earlier,
and July 16 found him at Buckingham Palace receiving a knighthood _
honorary because he is not a British subject _ from Queen Elizabeth
II.
</P>
<P>
   In his hotel room that evening he got a call from Mo Mowlam,
then Britain's secretary for Northern Ireland. ``The agreement is
going to crash,'' she said. The Ulster Unionists had the day before
boycotted the meeting of the Northern Ireland Assembly that was
supposed to have started up the new power-sharing provincial
administration in Belfast, saying they would not sit in government
with Sinn Fein while the IRA refused to start disarming. Ms. Mowlam
told him that Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, wanted him to pursue a rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   On his triumphant departure from Northern Ireland in April 1998,
he had been definitive about stating that his work was finished. He
said then that he looked forward to getting back to his law
practice in Washington and spending time in New York with his wife,
Heather MacLachlan, and son, Andrew, then 6 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Now he hesitated in responding to the plea to return. ``It was a
very, very difficult thing for me,'' Mitchell said, ``but my wife
was the one who said, `You'll never forgive yourself if you don't
do it.' Of course she was right.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrived back in London the next week, met with the two prime
ministers at No. 10 Downing Street and then flew to Belfast to
reacquaint himself with the province's feuding politicians. Blair
and Ahern, sponsors of the original agreement, had been ``burned''
by the failure of marathon talks they had presided over during the
summer to break the deadlock. They would stay in the background and
give him a free and independent hand, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster politicians were angrier than Mitchell had ever seen
them. ``It really looked hopeless,'' he recalled, but he said he
would be back in Belfast in September to begin his formal review.
He told his wife it would take two weeks, maybe three. It took
three months.
</P>
<P>
   He announced that his review would focus solely on the dispute
over empowering the new government and beginning the process of
guerrilla disarmament that had stalled progress. Mitchell quietly
decided to focus the talks themselves on the two warring parties,
Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists, while keeping the other six
parties that had signed the agreement fully informed.
</P>
<P>
   He began by letting them all vent their grievances, and that
alone took up three weeks. ``It was confrontational and
acrimonious,'' he said. ``There was nothing but harsh words and
recriminations.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He resolved to set no deadlines, indulge in no pressure tactics.
He put his thoughts and proposals down on paper, but he never
circulated the documents, choosing instead to read them to the
participants in an effort to allow them greater flexibility. One
participant described his unfailing serenity, even when tempers
were high around him, as ``infectious.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He was determined to keep the talks secret, and he imposed on
all the participants a no-comment order, which they honored.
Remembering the publicity during the original talks, he said, ``You
have no idea how much time we used to waste every morning on going
over what was in the papers and having people accuse each other of
planting things.'' A British official, he said, called the exercise
``chasing the hare of the day,'' and it regularly wasted a couple
of hours.
</P>
<P>
   One day in September, one of the leaders entered the conference
room in a fury at an article that had appeared that morning.
Mitchell calmed him by predicting that one of his rivals would
probably march in with his own angry remark about another article.
In moments the door opened, and the man he had just mentioned
appeared. He was holding up a newspaper page and jutting an
accusatory finger at a column he had circled. The complaining over
press leaks ceased.
</P>
<P>
   The talks dragged on in the drab civil service conference center
in the Stormont Castle buildings, with Mitchell making the
trans-Atlantic journey each week for three long days of sessions.
The Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, said the atmosphere was only
slightly better than at a notorious police interrogation center
where he used to spend a lot of time. ``I call it Castlereagh with
coffee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the desultory pace inside the conference room, Mitchell
had daily reminders of the life-or-death urgency of his mission
from the security provisions put in place to protect him. He moved
continually among four different Belfast area hotels, and he
wouldn't decide which of three routes to follow to Stormont until
beginning his daily trip.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions in Belfast continued to be dominated by taunts and
rebukes. The early-falling northern darkness each afternoon
reflected the spreading public mood of pessimism. ``We were talking
at each other, not to each other,'' McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell decided to move the talks to an undisclosed location,
the Regents Park mansion in London that is the official home of the
American ambassador, Philip Lader. There, the men had free run of
the elegant Georgian-style estate with its 12 acres of land. They
gathered in salons with grand names like the Gold Drawing Room and
dined in the gilt-trimmed main dining room beneath two gleaming
crystal chandeliers and under the watchful gaze of the 18th-century
London-based American painter Benjamin West, whose self-portrait
hangs there.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The talks were held in rooms whose tables and chairs had been
replaced with sofas and easy chairs. When he sprung his surprise
dinner invitation, Mitchell made the point that there was no
seating plan and everybody should mix.
</P>
<P>
   His purpose by this time was to establish common ground for
communication. ``Politicians in Northern Ireland are very
proprietary about words,'' he said. ``Each party owns its set of
words, and I wanted them to get them off their words and using the
same language.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Something about separate position papers he received from the
parties one day caught his eye, and he called the leaders in
jointly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have any of you ever seen Woody Allen's film `Zelig'?'' he
asked. No one had. ``Well,'' he said, ``the premise is if you
associate with someone long enough, you begin to look like them and
act like them and talk like them. You guys have now been together
with me for a couple of months, and I want to read back to you
these statements you've given to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Each document set out the compromises made, the limits on any
more being made and the frustrations with the intransigence of the
other side. There was nothing new in that for Mitchell, who by then
had spent nearly five years listening to the irritations of Ulster
politicians. But there was something new in the choice of words.
Many of the passages were identical. After his public reading,
there was satisfied acknowledgment from the leaders, and Mitchell
concluded that he was making progress.
</P>
<P>
   In the successful conclusion to the talks last week, the various
leaders and the Irish Republican Army issued a series of
prearranged, interlocking statements that charted the path toward
finally putting the peace accord into effect. In a telling
reflection of the advances made by Mitchell, the parties took care
to accommodate the concerns of their opponents, and they did so
using many of the same words.
</P>
<P>
   McGuinness said that while no real friendships had developed,
the participants had learned to be ``cordial'' to one another for
the first time. ``Trust crept in,'' was the way a negotiator from
the Social Democratic and Labor Party put it. ``Actually trust is
an overstatement,'' concluded Mitchell. ``But at least they stopped
insulting each other, and that's what enabled us to reach
agreement.''

   The noise is music to the nation's retailers, the
bricks-and-mortar people who do business in real stores instead of
in cyberspace. And the stakes are high: the rule of thumb is that
just under half of a retailer's annual profit is realized in the
fourth quarter. According to estimates from the National Retail
Federation, total sales for the holiday season will top $180
billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, compared with other sectors, the so-called broad-line
retailers have received a cool reception from investors. This year,
the Standard &AMP; Poor's retailing index is up only about 8.6 percent
through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Exstein, a retailing analyst at Credit Suisse First
Boston, talked last week about retailing, e-tailing and the
holidays. Following are excerpts of the conversation. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sort of an early read are you getting on Christmas? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. On the surface, people are very nervous. There has been a
notable slowdown in business since mid-October, which nobody can
explain. So there is some concern out there that Christmas won't
come. But it will come.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers understand that Christmas comes later every year
because customers understand that retailers won't run out of
merchandise, and if they wait long enough, prices sometimes come
down. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What would constitute a good selling season for the companies
you follow? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For the majority of the dozen general merchandisers I follow,
if they get a 3 percent to 4 percent gain, that will be a very good
Christmas, and those sorts of gains have been the norm rather than
the exception for the past few years. A gain of less than 2.5
percent would make it a bad season. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Switching gears a little, how are big retailers reacting to
the emergence of e-tailers? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Most retailers are not worried about the impact of the
Internet on their businesses. They are worried about structural
change. And there is not a retailer out there today who knows how
much structural change will take place because of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   I break down the retail world in terms of how they are dealing
with the whole e-commerce issue into four categories: embracing,
evolving, reinforcing and considering.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are two companies that have embraced e-commerce
aggressively: Federated Department Stores and Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Federated spent $1.7 billion to buy Fingerhut, and has created
Web sites for Macy's and Bloomingdale's and an online catalog for
Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom adopted a different strategy and developed its
capabilities in-house. They knew the catalog industry
infrastructure could be leveraged as e-commerce developed. Today,
their online catalog does about $200 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Last August they sold off 15 percent of the online catalog to
venture capital interests. At the same time they created Nordstrom
Shoes, the world's biggest online shoe store. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This is a brutally competitive business, even without
e-tailers. Are there potential problems out there that worry you? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Consumer installment debt has started to accelerate again,
and I worry about that, because that is the last thing that keeps
spending going.
</P>
<P>
   I also worry about overbuilding. When times were flush in the
past, companies would build new stores, and when things got bad
they would either slow the pace of building or close stores.
</P>
<P>
   Right now companies are building stores. Overall, the industry
increased capital spending by 21 percent in 1998, and as of the
first quarter of this year it was projected to be up another 11 to
12 percent. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The market has not been kind to most of these stocks. Why? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What you are seeing is that the market is reacting very, very
rationally, and is sorting out the winners and the losers. Wal-Mart
has been a good stock this year.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the performance is based on a tremendous amount of
skepticism that traditional retailers will be able to fashion a
competitive response to e-tailing.
</P>
<P>
   My response to that is that companies like Federated, Nordstrom,
Wal-Mart and Sears are not sitting idly by, and while they may not
get it perfectly, there is a lot to be said for offering both
traditional retailing and e-tailing. Infrastructure matters.
Customer service will matter. It is not just a one-way flow of
goods. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So which stocks do you like? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I like four: Federated, Wal-Mart, Nordstrom and Zale's.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that unifies those four stocks is that they have
continuing growth in market share and margin opportunities. There
is not much room to raise prices in this industry. But there is
room to source better, have differentiated product and to continue
to improve efficiency.

 By JOEL KOTKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Twenty-nine, single and childless, Dmitri Gurevich may
seem an odd man to be plotting an assault on the fantasy life of
young girls.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, his Web design studio in this city's thriving
``cyberdistrict,''on the South Side, will roll out a new
Internet-based service that he hopes will transform the way that
girls play with _ and buy _ dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The new Web site, called iDolls, lets girls design their dolls
from scratch, choosing facial features, clothes and accessories in
any of 69 billion possible combinations. Paid for with a parent's
credit card, an ordered doll is manufactured to specifications in
China and shipped to the customer within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of an attempt to create a whole new set
of options for girls,'' said Gurevich, who immigrated from Russia
in 1990 and founded his company, Double Decker Studios, three years
later. ``This is not a set piece. This is a revolutionary thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not the first doll Web site, iDolls is a mold-breaker,
using technology to overturn conventional marketing notions in the
industry. Mike Collins, president of iDolls, noted that dollmakers
like Mattel have spent millions of dollars developing and promoting
specific doll characters like the Barbie and Friends line or the
American Girl historical figures made by the Pleasant Company, a
Mattel subsidiary in Middleton, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Collins contended that iDolls' approach, with its huge range of
possible designs and no set characters, represents ``the future of
doll play.''
</P>
<P>
   This notion of giving power to young shoppers is the latest
trend in an increasingly expensive and sophisticated drive to tap a
market that is growing in numbers and buying potential: girls 8 to
12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   These girls have emerged as a prime target for companies from
camera makers to entertainment conglomerates. Their impact is
visible in the strong ratings of television shows like ``Buffy, the
Vampire Slayer,'' and they are credited with much of the success of
films like ``Titanic'' and ``Mulan'' and pop groups like the Spice
Girls, 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-to-12 group of girls, now numbering more than 15 million
nationwide, is also having more impact at the shopping mall. Retail
chains like Limited Too have sprung up specifically to address the
$5 billion-a-year market in preadolescent girls' clothing. And
mainstream cosmetics marketers like Bath &AMP; Body Works (owned by
Intimate Apparel Inc.), Avon and Estee Lauder have introduced
lipstick, blush and accessory brands for girls.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive brick-and-mortar expression of niche
marketing to girls may be the Pleasant Co.'s American Girl Place, a
35,000-square-foot retail outlet in downtown Chicago. The sprawling
emporium of dolls and girls' clothing opened a year ago and
features a tea room, live entertainment and elaborate displays
about the historical characters upon whom the Pleasant Co. bases
its dolls.
</P>
<P>
   In its first year, American Girl Place counted more than 750,000
visitors; the store has become a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, the real action for dollmakers seems to be in
cyberspace, where, perhaps surprisingly, preteenage girls appear to
outnumber preteenage boys. Two-thirds of girls in the 8 to 12 group
have access to a computer, compared with only 58 percent of boys,
according to surveys by the Zandl Group, a New York market research
firm.
</P>
<P>
   And girls seem to use the computer differently, according to
Irma Zandl, one of the firm's principals: they generally prefer to
treat it as a communication device or a way to exercise their
imaginations, rather than as a platform for playing competitive or
shoot-'em-up games, the preferred mode for boys of similar ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like designing things,'' Ms. Zandl said. ``They are
checking out looks and outfits _ like playing with dolls in a more
sophisticated and contemporary way.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins of iDolls said he believes these characteristics will
give his company's business model an online edge over vendors like
the Pleasant Co., where he worked until Mattel acquired it in 1995.
Companies like Mattel are stuck in the past, he said, selling girls
a story of a 1980s vintage, while Barbie herself reflects ``an
essentially '50s image of girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattel doesn't see it that way, of course, and its
quintessential California-girl flagship product is putting up a
fight in cyberspace. Despite Mattel's well-publicized financial
woes _ its stock price has fallen by more than half in the last two
years _ the company has maintained a strong hold on computer
software for girls, with Barbie-related CD-ROMs accounting for 6 of
the 10 best-selling titles last year.
</P>
<P>
   Its year-old Barbie.Com Web site, which features a ``my design''
program that allows some customization of Barbie dolls, averages
more than a million hits a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brand is very vital,'' said Adrian Fontenella, president
of Mattel's Barbie Girls division. Noting that the Barbie brand
continues to bring in about $1.5 billion in annual sales, or
roughly 30 percent of Mattel's total revenue, Fontenella dismissed
the suggestion that Barbie was outdated: ``People like to advertise
a perception about our being old, but reality tells you something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the fate of the dollmakers is in the hands of the
young shoppers themselves. Laurie Meyer, 27, a Web page designer
brought to Double Decker by Gurevich to give the iDolls site a
feminine feel, thinks the power of computer technology will make
girls impatient to exercise control and make choices far beyond
what even the most flexible traditional dollmaker can offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was that little, nothing like that existed,'' Ms. Meyer
said of iDolls. ``This has opened a whole realm of activity'' for
preteenage girls, she added. ``It creates a new world of imaginary
play. You can design them _ and you can own them. It opens all
kinds of doors.''

Southern California, at least, is Pasadena -- where the turn of the
century and a couple of hot Rose Bowl teams are proving an
attractive lure for thousands of partiers and fans from across the
country. The 2,500 rooms in Pasadena hotels already are booked,
prompting tourist bureau officials to recommend visitors check out
the nearby San Fernando Valley. ``It's going to be a crazy year,''

A QUAKE STRENGTHENS A BASILICA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASSISI, Italy _ Seconds after the earthquake of September 1997
rocked large parts of central Italy, the Rev. Vincenzo Fortunato
surveyed the nave of the upper church of the Basilica of St.
Francis in Assisi. The ground around him was strewn with chunks of
its vaulted ceiling and its frescoes attributed to Giotto and
Cimabue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid the entire ceiling had collapsed, there was so
much dust everywhere,'' he recalled. ``I thought things were a lot
worse, that it was all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that morning brought on a remarkable restoration, one
that used new construction techniques and materials and unearthed
secrets behind the basilica's more-than-700-year-old masterpieces.
The upper church is set to reopen on Sunday in a subdued ceremony,
even as the aftereffects of the quake continue to reverberate
through the Umbria and the Marches, where more than 10,000 people
are still living in temporary metal container homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for nothing that it's been called the construction
site of Utopia,'' said Fortunato, who was in the basilica with four
people who perished when the vaulted ceiling collapsed. At first no
one believed the basilica would be ready for the Roman Catholic
celebrations of the year 2000, when nearly 30 million tourists are
expected to visit Italy, with Assisi an important destination for
many.
</P>
<P>
   Architects, restorers, engineers, skilled laborers and
volunteers have been working around the clock for 26 months _ for a
total of about 40,000 individual working days _ on the project,
which has cost about $39 million.
</P>
<P>
   Structurally, the basilica, an early Renaissance jewel, is
probably in better shape today than it has been in nearly 700
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the vault of the nave still bares broad swatches of dull
beige that delineate sections that collapsed. Originally restorers
thought they would project a photographic image of the original
frescoes onto the bare plaster of the vault, but that plan was
abandoned. Two frescoes of St. Rufino and St. Vittorino, attributed
to Giotto, were returned to their positions on the entrance arch
this month. Their isolation increases the sensation that they are
floating in a sea of emptiness, solitary and sad.
</P>
<P>
   The two saints, composed of about 3,000 fragments, were manually
reconstructed. Restorers, however, located only about 80 percent of
the fragments. ``Yes, the clear signs of destruction are still
visible in the figures of these saints,'' said Giovanna Melandri,
the Italian culture minister. ``We wanted to put them up as a
symbol of a wound we want to heal but cannot forget.''
</P>
<P>
   All together, about 2,000 square feet of frescoes were destroyed
in the ceilings of the first, fourth and fifth bays of the vault,
or about a quarter of each bay.
</P>
<P>
   The church was begun after St. Francis died in 1226. The first
part to be built was the squat lower church in a northern Italian
Romanesque style. The upper church, built in a Gothic style, was
completed in 1236. The friars who oversaw construction viewed the
lower church, where St. Francis is buried, as a place of prayer and
meditation, whereas the upper church, brighter and more open, was a
place of exultation.
</P>
<P>
   The repairs to the basilica have mostly been structural,
including safeguarding it against future quakes, and cleaning the
13th- and 14th-century frescoes that cover nearly every inch of the
walls. Some repairs were straightforward, like securing the top of
the Romanesque bell tower and filling enormous cracks in the walls
of the cloister of Sixtus IV. During the work on the cloister,
restorers were surprised to uncover a fountain under its floor,
directly behind the apse of the church.
</P>
<P>
   For more delicate restorations, innovative techniques were used
for the first time. Probably the most precarious involved the
safeguarding of the badly damaged tympanum near the ceiling of the
left transept, which was in danger of falling. The partly rebuilt
structure was finally affixed to the roof with wires made of a
special material known as shape-memory alloy, which not only
reinforced it but also absorbs the force of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   The vaulted ceiling of the basilica required the most work.
After more than a thousand tons of debris was removed from under
the roof (the weight may have contributed to the collapse) the
fallen sections of the vault and the supporting entrance arch were
rebuilt using as many of the original bricks as possible.
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce and consolidate the vault, a giant rib cage made of
thin strips of flexible wood covered with a composite made of
aramidic fibers, the material used in bulletproof jackets, was
glued to the back of the Gothic arches and ribs that crisscross the
basilica's interior. The structure, both flexible and light, is
five times as strong as steel based on its weight. The vaults were
also attached to the roof with cables. Finally, many miles of
cracks in the vaults were filled with a nonsaline mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio Croci, the engineer who masterminded the structural
restoration of the basilica, is proud of the results. ``This was a
unique and exceptional project,'' he said. ``It gave us the chance
to experiment with a series of innovative measures that now can be
used in other situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Some work remains to be done. Repairs to the convent attached to
the basilica, most notably the refectory and the friars' cells, are
still under way, and the interior of the basilica also needs to be
completed. The remaining six saints of the entrance arch are to be
recomposed by Easter, but it is unlikely that they will join St.
Rufino and St. Vittorino until after 2000 because church officials
do not want the interior marred by bulky scaffolding. The vault
section at the entry of the church with the figure of St. Jerome,
also attributed to Giotto, will be put into place at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The two other vault sections, Cimabue's St. Matthew and a
section of starry sky _ about 120,000 pieces _ could be restored by
2001. Each fragment of these vaults has been photographed and the
engineering department of the University of Rome is completing a
computer program that will show restorers how each of the pieces
fits into the whole.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction and cleaning of the 50,000 square feet of
frescoes in the upper church shed new light on how some of the
artists worked. For example, restorers found that the artist known
only as the foreign master used oil paints in the frescoes of six
apostles in the right transept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previously it had been thought that the first artists to use
oil paints in wall decorations were British artists working in the
mid-14th century,'' explained Giuseppe Basile of the Central
Restoration Institute, ``but now we know that this was happening in
1270 in the Basilica of St. Francis, 100 years earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Basile explained that this discovery proved that Assisi was a
revolutionary workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that Assisi was not only the birthplace of painting
from a formal point of view,'' he said, ``it was also the
birthplace of modern art, with painters working in every known wall
painting technique.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains intact is the knowledge that the Basilica of St.
Francis attracted the greatest artists of the 13th and 14th
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Paola Passalaqua, who is responsible for the laboratory where
the reconstruction of the fresco fragments has been taking place,
says that she was amazed by the quality. ``The fragments were
preserved perfectly,'' she marveled. ``Notwithstanding what they
had gone through, they remained legible. It attests to the high
quality of the painters who worked in Assisi.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the holiday race for the consumer's dollar
already under way, the satellite television industry is still
poised anxiously at the gate. The starting gun for a marketing push
that could put its pizza-size dishes under hundreds of thousands of
Christmas trees this year sits on President Clinton's desk.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton is expected to sign the omnibus spending plan
approved by Congress last week. Attached to that bill is the
Satellite Television Home Viewers Act, which will for the first
time enable companies like DirecTV and EchoStar Communications
Corp. to compete with cable television providers on equal footing
by allowing them to carry local TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   The rules eliminate a key stumbling block to competition between
local cable monopolies and satellite providers that offer expansive
channels on a generation of satellite dishes that sell for $100 to
$200. Until now, satellite subscribers also needed a traditional
television antenna or cable service to receive their local news,
sports and weather. Under licensing laws enacted in 1988 to
increase the programming available in rural and other small
markets, satellite companies could not carry local stations but
they could carry network affiliates from other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As those provisions approached a January expiration date, the
satellite industry and congressional leaders wanted to expand the
law to enable the satellite companies to carry local programming.
While local affiliates also wanted to be carried by satellite
services, however, they demanded concessions that would prevent the
satellite companies from also beaming in broadcasts from other
affiliates of the same network.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the local stations won provisions that will
prohibit satellite services from carrying another network affiliate
to households within approximately a 75-mile radius of a local
affiliate _ twice the radius to which cable companies must adhere.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the bill's signing, DirecTV says it will begin
sending local network affiliate stations to its subscribers in New
York City and Los Angeles. And the company says it will be ready to
offer local stations to the top 25 television markets, or about
half of the country's 100 million television households, by
January.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar says it hopes to have local programming available in 13
markets next week, and in 30 to 35 cities by the end of the first
quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the stroke of the president's pen, we will begin lighting
up local channels,'' said Bob Marsocci, the communications director
for DirecTV, the leading satellite service, based in El Segundo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Marsocci said the inability to give households local programs
``has been our No. 1 impediment for potential customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they find out local channels are not available, they
don't buy,'' he said. ``This should remove the final barrier to
entry.''
</P>
<P>
   A congressional aide for Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., who heads
the House Commerce Committee, called the legislation the ``the last
piece of the puzzle'' for deregulating the cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, within the satellite television industry, there is
disagreement about just how successful the bill will be in opening
the marketplace to fair competition.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV, a division of Hughes Electronics Corp., a wholly owned
subsidiary of General Motors, calls the legislation a tremendous
win for consumers, ``finally leveling the playing field between
satellite and cable.''
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar, on the other hand, had aggressively opposed some of
the final provisions, saying Congress caved in to lobbyists.
Perhaps surprisingly, much of the lobbying came from local
broadcasters, not cable companies. In fact, the cable companies
supported the bill for their own political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Although cable companies have traditionally held monopolies in
their local markets, Congress, as part of its overhaul of
telecommunications laws, deregulated cable rates in 1996 because a
new generation of inexpensive satellite television delivery was
coming on the scene and was considered sufficient competition.
</P>
<P>
   That competition, however, was stifled by the satellite
companies' inability to carry local channels.
</P>
<P>
   The cable companies supported this year's satellite act on the
premise that a piece of pro-competitive legislation was far more
desirable than a return to tighter regulation of their rates,
especially at a time when the cable industry is poised for a new
era of competition in markets for local phone service and
high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   So the showdown in Congress was between satellite operators and
the local affiliates of networks like ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, which
do not want to put their local stations in the position of
competing with each other. Represented by the powerful lobbying of
the National Association of Broadcasters, the local stations were
able to thwart several key provisions of the original bill sought
by satellite companies.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar wanted provisions to guarantee that satellite companies
would not have to pay more than their cable competitors in any
market for the rights to retransmit local broadcasts. Echostar also
opposed a provision requiring satellite companies to carry all
channels in a local market because the provision would require the
company to negotiate separate contracts with each station.
</P>
<P>
   The real fight came over the rules for carrying distant
channels, or network programming from other markets. The bill
codifies a court ruling earlier this year that requires satellite
companies to cut off subscriber access to distant network
programming if viewers are in an area capable of picking up a local
network signal with a traditional antenna.
</P>
<P>
   But a station's theoretical broadcast area is often meaningless
to viewers who cannot get the signal because of interference. That
has left some viewers in a gray area, unable to pick up a clear
local signal and unable to receive distant network broadcasts. With
the new bill, the viewers will be able to receive the local
stations, although there is a bigger blackout area for distant
signals on satellite than cable. Cable companies cannot provide
distant signals to customers within a 35-mile radius of a local
station on the same network. That window is more like 70 miles for
satellite customers.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Echostar's chairman and chief executive, Charlie Ergen, said
earlier this month that the final bill ``limits consumer channel
choices and takes more money out of the consumer's pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no question that the legislation unlocks true
competition between the satellite and cable industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a perfect bill, `` said Marsocci of DirecTV. ``We
are not happy with every provision, but on balance we do support
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rates for satellite television are very competitive with
those of most cable services, ranging from under $10 a month for a
basic package to upwards of $100 for access to extensive packages
that include hundreds of channels of digital quality entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The price of satellite dishes required for reception have
dropped as low as $100, and are often accompanied by special deals
on service to help offset the initial purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Marsocci said his company's new marketing campaign was already
in place, targeting the top 25 television markets just in time for
the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been gearing up for this and preparing for quite some
time,'' he said. ``We'll be placing primarily print advertisements,
full-page print ads in the daily newspapers in each of the
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Judi Anne Atencio, director of communications for EchoStar, said
similar plans were in the works at that company's Littleton, Colo.,
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's like yellow tape around the marketing department right
now,'' she said. ``That is a dangerous place to be. The president
is expected to sign the bill around noon on Monday, and about five
minutes later we'll be selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Egan, a cable and satellite analyst with Paine Webber in
New York, said consumers would quickly see the effects of the
legislation in the rollout of new services over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going to happen is every few months month there is
going to be a new development,'' he said. ``I think what will
happen is they will try to compete less on price and try to compete
more on services.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan said he expected cable companies to focus their energy on
high-speed Internet and new digital services, while satellite
companies will be focusing on increased programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning. It is going to get very exciting
in the year 2000.''

NEW YORK IS CHECKING ITS CHIPS AND BRACING FOR LAST-MINUTE Y2K
PROBLEMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW C. REVKIN and BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last month, after searching and testing nearly every
computer and microchip in New York City's vast inventory of
technology, city officials took one of the final steps in a
four-year, $300 million effort to prevent any turmoil stemming from
the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   They canvassed every city agency, right down to Off-Track
Betting, to identify each jackhammer, bullhorn, tent, chain saw and
portable toilet. They made a list of every city employee who is a
qualified nurse, elevator mechanic, electrician, cook _ even scuba
diver _ so appropriate gear and specialists can quickly be
dispatched should trouble erupt after clocks and computers tick
from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is that despite spending more than any other city
in the world to fight the computer glitch, the city's technology
and emergency management experts say things may yet go wrong _ and
no one can predict exactly which things.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 computer problem could manifest itself almost
anywhere, in ways small and large, because computers and microchips
have become enmeshed in every aspect of urban life. Or _ given how
much work has been done _ it could cause almost no trouble at all,
as most city officials and independent experts expect.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Year 2000 experts say they have checked for almost
every conceivable situation:
</P>
<P>
   --They worried about traffic lights all blinking yellow, or
failing altogether. (The traffic-management system has since been
tested four times by rolling the date past 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   --They envisioned death certificates delayed, with bodies piling
up at funeral homes. (That computer system has since been updated
and tested.)
</P>
<P>
   --They imagined the chaos of scrambled city checks. (The system
was overhauled, and, as an extra precaution, the city has
pre-printed several hundred thousand payroll and pension checks.)
</P>
<P>
   But what is left could still add up to a galaxy of irritating
glitches.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stems from the early days of computing. To conserve
memory, years were usually indicated as just two digits.
Unfortunately, 00 _ instead of being read as 2000 _ may be
interpreted as 1900 or simply not compute. The result in both cases
can be a frozen computer or faulty data.
</P>
<P>
   When multiplied by the number of computers and chips involved in
daily living, this bit of shorthand has added up to the first
potential global crisis of the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is particularly daunting because technical
problems may coincide with an epic celebration that is expected to
swell the city's population by a million or more, and with
officials on alert for possible terrorism or other millennial
disorder. New York's own success or failure in preventing
disruptions in services and commerce will have implications far
beyond the city's five boroughs, given its status as a hub of
finance, trade and travel.
</P>
<P>
   If prevention alone should not suffice, officials are determined
to be ready for any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
   The city is assembling a small fleet of truck-mounted generators
to deploy should some high-rise or housing project go dark. More
than 50,000 self-heating boxed beef-and-mushroom dinners sit
waiting to be rushed to shelters in case of evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of city employees normally on vacation over the New
Year's weekend have been told to plan on working, including 4,000
additional police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to balance between panicking people and having people
prepared,'' said Police Commissioner Howard Safir. ``I expect
things will function as normal, but if not, we're ready to go in
and help.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 29, the city's emergency management ``bunker'' _ a sleek
$13 million room on the 23rd floor of 7 World Trade Center _ will
become the round-the-clock home for more than 100 crisis managers
from several dozen city agencies, power, banking and phone
companies, and emergency response groups ranging from the Red Cross
to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Through New Year's Day, and for several weeks beyond if
necessary, it will be the nerve center for the city's handling of
any trouble stemming from the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the computer and crisis managers are still
working to eliminate or anticipate other still-hidden snags. In the
hottest of many hot seats are Jerome M. Hauer, the director of the
mayor's Office of Emergency Management _ known to some as the
office of ``what if''_ and Brian T. Cohen, executive director of
the city's Year 2000 Project Office, which has been pushing city
agencies for three years, occasionally even browbeating them, to
fix everything.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who chain smokes Marlboros and rarely tightens his tie,
sat at his cluttered desk recently and said that the checking and
rechecking would continue even as the ball drops in Times Square.
``There are going to be no parties here,'' he said. ``I'm going to
feel good about nothing until long after Jan. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even if the city's own computers work perfectly as
2000 begins, that does not ensure that all will be well. Failures
of computers or other systems at independent public agencies like
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the New York City
Board of Education, at private financial or health services
businesses, chemical plants or a host of other enterprises could
spin the city toward chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Independent experts who have analyzed the efforts of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's team say the mayor is probably right to be
confident that the city is in good shape. In recent weeks, the city
comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, whose office audited Year 2000
computer work by 49 city agencies over the last two years, raised
most of the grades to ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite spending so much time, money, and effort, no one
expects every computer or hidden chip to make the transition to
2000 faultlessly and no one can be sure how the public will react _
perhaps in ways that create new problems. For example, if everyone
picks up a telephone at 12:01 a.m. New Year's Day to check for a
dial tone, circuits will quickly become overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say what they want, but something will happen,'' said
one city official who helped investigate the readiness of many
agencies. ``Everyone has to have a fallback position.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the backup plans for entering the next century
involve going back to the last one. The city is planning to use
dozens of old coal-heated schools _ once seen as a sign of the
school system's state of disrepair _as shelters, because the
boilers can run without electricity to pump fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials say they are prepared to temporarily abandon
their new system for digital fingerprinting and revert to the old
``ink and roll'' method used on suspects' fingers for generations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   With five weeks to go, Hauer, the city's emergency management
director, is never far from a three-inch-thick binder that lays out
the overall contingency plan. In an office near the emergency
operations center, there is a wall nearly filled with the
individual agencies' preparations.
</P>
<P>
   The next-to-last step will come on Dec. 8, when the city's
computer crisis team meets in the emergency center at 9 p.m. for a
full dress rehearsal, with the clock running forward as if it is
New Year's Eve _ and with an assortment of imaginary crises coming
at them from every phone line and computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The scripts that will control the mayhem facing them during the
drill are being written now by Hauer's staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this real-time drill to be far more stressful than
New Year's Eve,'' Hauer said. ``It's going to have a lot of
scenarios we don't think will happen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But no matter what imaginary scenarios unfold during the drill,
the Year 2000 team, and the city, will still confront the
unknowable as the last hours of 1999 tick down and the first moment
of Zero Day arrives.

LEARNING THE PRICE OF LUNCH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: S.C.)   (af)  
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time it happened, my 12-year-old daughter, Marian, hid
the bill in her room. It scared her, and I think she hoped it would
just go away. The second time, she left the bill in resignation on
the dining room table, where I couldn't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Marian had fallen for two tantalizing offers. One was a
collection of books, all for only $5, and the other for a free copy
of a magazine for teenagers. Except they were both subscription
come-ons. Within weeks, she received bills totaling about $35. This
for a girl with a weekly allowance of $4.
</P>
<P>
   About $13 billion a year is spent on marketing to children, $1
billion of it in direct marketing. Despite industry guidelines that
urge companies not to pitch directly to children, they are targets
nonetheless. My children also get mailings offering credit cards
and long-distance phone service. They even get calls from
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If children are spending money and leave a record, they will
be marketed to,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the
Consumer Federation of America. ``The problem is they are
inexperienced buyers and are not always aware of what they are
signing or verbally approving.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kamins, associate professor of marketing at the
University of Southern California, can speak from experience about
marketers' overzealousness. His son Joshua, 9, recently received a
magazine offer directly. ``It was addressed to Joshua, not to me,''
Kamins said. ``I was angry that he was petitioned to subscribe when
he didn't understand the consequences. He thought they were going
to send it to him and he wouldn't have to pay anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are more open than adults. They don't have the defensive
techniques against marketing scams. We get the phone calls and we
hang up. Kids get them and they think, `Hey, this sounds good.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission announced rules last month that
limit marketing directly to children over the Internet. ``The
purpose of the new rules was to empower parents to control these
kinds of solicitations,'' said Jodie Z. Bernstein, director of the
commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
</P>
<P>
   No such regulations govern the older technology of direct mail,
which Ms. Bernstein said was self-regulated through the Direct
Marketing Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The association urges members who want to market to children to
address their pitches to the parents, and to include statements
advising children to consult with mom and dad. Stephen Altobelli, a
spokesman for the group, said the marketers assumed that children
are talking with parents about these offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sensitive that marketing to children must be done more
sensitively than what is done for adults,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope that parents look at the mail before the
children do.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not always possible, however, especially if both parents
work. I never get first crack at the mail, and ever since Grandma
started sticking dollar bills in greeting cards, my children grab
the mail as soon as they get home from school. And at a certain
age, most children, including mine, stop seeking advice, because
they think they know everything.
</P>
<P>
   There is a safety net, Ms. Bernstein said. If children up to 16
or 18 do buy the product, they don't have to pay for it. The age
limit varies state by state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't contract under those circumstances,'' she said.
``They aren't liable for the bill and neither are their parents.''
But she feels that companies are focusing on children because they
expect that the parents will give in and pay.
</P>
<P>
   Kamins, after talking with Joshua about the lures of marketing,
ended up subscribing to the magazine anyway. I had a similar talk
with my daughter, repeating the adage, ``If it sounds too good to
be true, it probably is,'' but I declined to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Kamins said the best defense was simply to educate your child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to explain to the kids that they are promotions to sell
products and explain what the marketing world is all about,'' he
said. ``So the next time they are cognizant of it. Parents need to
explain that there is no such thing as a free lunch in this
world.'' &QL;

   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They were just looking for an oceanfront
property in Palm Beach. When they bought their North Ocean
Boulevard house in 1995, John and Marianne Castle inherited a
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   That's not such a rarity in Palm Beach, where if mansion walls
could talk they tell stories of some of the most wealthy and
influential people of the century. But La Guerida, the 1923
Mediterranean Revival-style house designed by Addison Mizner for
Rodman Wanamaker II sold in 1932 to Joseph P. Kennedy. It remained
the Palm Beach quarters of several Kennedy family for more than 60
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Castles viewed the house as a place that fit their
requirements. They wanted a home overlooking the sea with enough
room to accommodate their familythey have three sons and expect in
a few years need enough room for wives and grandchildren The a
center for family life impressed them more than the lineage of the
illustrious clan who occupied it.
</P>
<P>
   In the four years they've owned the property, the Castles have
thoroughly renovated the house and grounds, bringing them up to
date after many decades of wear and tear. When they bought the
house, they also purchased much of its contents. everal original
Mizner-designed furniture pieces installed at the time of mansion's
construction as well as many Kennedy family furnishings. ``We
wanted to preserve the things that were preservable,'' says John
Castle.
</P>
<P>
   A respect for the history guided the Castles as they remade the
house into a home that was as much theirs as it was a site. They
did not want to create anything museum, according to Castle. but
they could not ignore the past.
</P>
<P>
   There are several intact homages to the heritage. The Castles
research into the how the house has appeared since 1923. ``We had
lots of photographs to consult, though there are no plans for the
house filed in (town) records,'' says Castle, who believes the
floor plans as a security measure at the time of John F. Kennedy's
election as President.
</P>
<P>
   Two adjacent bedrooms are still referred to as the President's
room and the Attorney General's room. These were the chambers used
by John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy when they were in
residence. The Castles fully refurbished these bedrooms, but were
careful in restoring the beds, chests and tables they found there,
referring to historic photographs during the process to replicate
original arrangements. Among the prize pieces in these rooms is the
massage table John F. Kennedy during his recuperation from from
back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The library, a paneled space off the dining room, also preserved
a la Kennedy, with most of the same furniture merely recovered and
refreshed. ``As President-elect, Jack Kennedy interviewed potential
cabinet members here,'' says Castle. It was also a place where the
family gathered to watch election returns on television over the
years, he says of the room, describes as a private sanctum within
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Some additions were necessary. ``We had to rework the whole
house,'' says Castle, who notes that Joe Kennedy hired Maurice
Fatio to make alterations to the Mizner house in 1933 to
accommodate his family and that several redecoration schemes over
the years by the Kennedys
</P>
<P>
   A former loggia off the living room a family room. It's called
the 'Model' room because a the Castle's 42-foot boat that has
circumnavigated the glo-- is on display above the hearth, with a
scene of the yacht moored in a Moorean bay carved into the stone
mantelpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen has been completely redone, with a pantry area
expanded into a kitchen dining room. A curved stair tower has been
constructed which replaced ``a small, dark stairway,'' according to
Castle. A walled ``bullpen,'' where Joe Kennedy would sun himself
during the season, has been rebuilt as a fully enclosed two-level
pool house, with billiards table upstairs and gymnasium on the
lower level overlooking the tennis court
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, a number of smaller staff bedrooms more spacious guest
bedrooms and work areas. ``There are six large masters and five
smaller bedrooms in the house now,'' says Castle. Most bedroom
furniture has been replaced, though the Castles which rooms were
used by which Kennedys. The central bedroom is known as Rose's
room, and two bedrooms are called John-John and Caroline's rooms,
as they are the chambers Jackie and Jack Kennedy's children were
known to have occupied on the many occasions that brought them to
Palm Beach.

 &HT;    Yamacraw recruits 2 chip designers
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia is adding two more corporate partners in a bid
to make the state a hothouse for designing and making microchips
for the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   National Semiconductor and Broadcom, two California microchip
design firms with Atlanta-area offices, are expected to sign an
agreement with the state's Yamacraw Mission in the next few weeks,
said Joy Laskar, an associate professor in Georgia Tech's
electrical engineering department. Laskar, 36, teaches a class at
Tech on integrated circuit design. He also heads one of the
Yamacraw Mission's three research areas.
</P>
<P>
   For each of the first four participating companies, the state
will contribute $250,000 toward research in one of the research
areas, said Michael Cummins, head of the Georgia Center for
Advanced Telecommunications Technology.
</P>
<P>
   In return, member companies either contribute $250,000 per year
for five years or they pay $25,000 a year and agree to employ 100
chip designers here by 2003. National and Broadcom decided to match
the state investment, Laskar said.
</P>
<P>
   Yamacraw's 11-month-old hope is to recruit 10 new companies in
chip design, add 2,000 design engineers and 85 faculty members at
state universities in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The research should create several new jobs in the next six
months, but it plants the seeds for still more. Laskar said the
work here should continue to raise Tech's national reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of 2000, we're pretty confident we'll be viewed as
the leading group in the country in a couple of areas, wireless
integrated circuit design and analog design,'' he said. ``My
friends and peers at other top-10 institutions are envious of this
whole situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcom and National Semiconductor were closed Friday.
Employees there could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcom has a residential broadband facility in Duluth, Ga. The
company develops integrated circuits used to move voice, video and
data over traditional phone lines. The chips are also used in cable
television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Tech has been working with National Semiconductor on projects
for two years, Laskar said. National has a chip design center in
Norcross, Ga., as well as ones in Arizona, Washington and
California, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These design centers aren't huge, maybe 15 to 35 people,'' he
said. ``But it starts to create an environment. There is huge
demand for designers. These centers are almost like small
companies. Most of the kids who graduate from Tech leave for jobs
now. These centers pop up, and once they do you start keeping some
of the talent. We've got the ingredients. Now we're just putting
them together.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Yamacraw announced that Star Core, a joint venture
between Motorola and Lucent Technologies, would be the first of its
four ``pioneer'' members.

 &HT;    Commission to conduct investigation on bonfire accident
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLELGE STATION, Texas _ A Houston construction executive, Leo
E. Linbeck Jr., was named Friday by Texas A&AMP;M University as
chairman of a commission to investigate the collapse of the Aggie
bonfire tower.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck, 65, is chairman and chief executive officer of Linbeck
Construction Corp., whose projects have included office buildings,
stores, garages, manufacturing plants and airports.
</P>
<P>
   Ray M. Bowen, president of Texas A&AMP;M, said in a statement issued
by the university that Linbeck was chosen to head the investigation
because of his reputation for integrity and openness and because of
his wide-ranging construction experience. Bowen said Linbeck would
select the other members of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a tremendous sense of responsibility and obligation to
find the truth associated with this occurrence,'' Linbeck said in
the statement. ``This undertaking dictates an open and totally
transparent procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven A&AMP;M students and one recent graduate were killed in the
Nov. 18 collapse of the giant stack of logs intended for a bonfire
before Friday's football game between rivals Texas A&AMP;M and the
University of Texas. Twenty-seven other people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's charge is to determine the cause of the
collapse and to examine all related activities, including safety,
engineering, design and construction. Its report is due no by March
31.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck, a lanky, bow-tied executive with a drawl, has more than
40 years of experience in construction. He joined Linbeck
Construction, which was founded by his father, in 1956 after
graduating from the University of Notre Dame. The company's
completed projects in the past 10 years exceeded $1.5 billion in
value.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck is also active in financial and lobbying circles. He is
chairman and an investor in Americans for Fair Taxation, a national
organization advocating the replacement of federal income taxes
with a national sales tax, and he has served as chairman and
director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. He serves on the
boards of several corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen and Linbeck were not available for additional comment or
questions. Lane Stephenson, a spokesman for the university, said
both men were taking time off for the Thanksgiving holiday and
would not be available until Monday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   One question is how independent of the university the
investigation will be. Bowen has pledged an independent review.
</P>
<P>
   However, support for the commission will be provided by a team
of university staff and faculty members headed by John Weese, a
professor of mechanical engineering at Texas A&AMP;M. Bowen said
earlier this week that all documents, reports, photographs, videos
and other evidence gathered by the commission would be catalogued
in the office of the university's chief lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is that the gentleman who has accepted this, Leo
Linbeck, will have the authority to name who he wants to the
commission _ his call,'' Stephenson said. ``That makes it more of
an independent deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the university would be paying for the
investigation, Stephenson replied: ``I don't know. That is not an
issue.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warren E. Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, is
known for his concentrated bets on big brand-name companies with
solid franchises. So why has Buffett, the sage of Omaha, put his
own money in a lackluster closed-end fund by the name of Baker,
Fentress &AMP; Co., founded over 100 years ago, which is in
liquidation?
</P>
<P>
   Buffett's purchase of almost 2.1 million shares, or 5.3 percent
of the fund, was disclosed in July in a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. (Buffett is often granted waivers from the SEC
that allow him to delay disclosure of his stock purchases for a
year. In this case, apparently, no such waiver was granted.)
</P>
<P>
   What piqued Buffett's interest? He did not return a telephone
call seeking comment. But experts believe that the move was a
classic arbitrage play. Buffett bought the Baker Fentress shares
for his personal account, not for Berkshire Hathaway, his public
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Buffett is apparently trying to capture the difference''
between Baker Fentress' share price and the value of the portfolio
after the company sells the shares in the open market and returns
the proceeds to shareholders, said Timothy P. Vick, editor of
Today's Value Investor, a newsletter in Hammond, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mutual funds, closed-end funds issue a fixed number of
shares, which trade on stock markets in the same way as shares of
ordinary companies. They may trade at a premium or discount to the
value of the securities they hold, their net asset value. Mutual
funds, by contrast, issue and redeem shares on demand, always at
their net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   Baker Fentress owns the shares of mostly large American
companies. The fund's value orientation hasn't helped it in recent
years, according to Gregg Wolper, an analyst at Morningstar Inc.,
the Chicago financial publisher, as such stocks have
underperformed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Baker Fentress been aided by the fact that it owns 79
percent of a closely held real estate development business, the
Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co. of Daytona Beach, Fla., making it
especially difficult to value. The fund is also unusual in that it
owns the investment management firm that manages it, John A. Levin
&AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   For the three years ended Nov. 19, the fund's market return has
been 14.6 percent, annualized, versus 19.7 percent for the average
closed-end large-capitalization value fund, according to
Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrage opportunity for Buffett resulted from Baker
Fentress' attempt to eliminate the extraordinarily wide discount at
which it has traded to its net asset value _ an average of close to
20 percent over the last five or so years, according to James P.
Koeneman, chief financial officer for the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Over that time, Baker Fentress management tried to drum up more
attention from investors in the hope that greater demand would
shrink the discount. Koeneman said the fund tried shifting its
listing from Nasdaq to the more liquid New York Stock Exchange and
expanding its investor relations and shareholder education
programs. Those efforts bore little fruit: On April 13, the
discount stood at 27.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the board decided to liquidate its assets and
distribute the proceeds to shareholders. ``We wanted to maximize
shareholder value,'' Koeneman said.
</P>
<P>
   The approach has had an effect. Immediately after the
liquidation plan was announced on May 6, the fund's discount
narrowed to about 10 percent to 12 percent. It gradually tightened
further, and was just 6.21 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Vick, the liquidation plan seems to have caught the
attention of Buffett, who has made short-term bets in the past.
``It's not a long-term investment,'' added Vick, who also runs a
Web site that tracks Buffett's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's first distributions were paid on Sept. 24. They
consisted of two cash payments totaling $4 a share, plus stock in
Consolidated-Tomoka worth $1.76, which the fund could not have
liquidated readily.
</P>
<P>
   A final distribution of $12.24 a share in cash, including return
of capital equal to $8.95 a share, is expected to be paid on Jan.
7, bringing the total to $18 in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Baker Fentress will cease operating as a closed-end
fund and open its doors as a holding company. Its principal asset
will be the Levin firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffett tactic appears to have been profitable so far,
according to Thomas J. Herzfeld, an investment adviser in Miami who
specializes in closed-end funds and who also bought shares in Baker
Fentress as an arbitrage play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shares were being sold at a pretty big discount, so we bought
Baker Fentress for the liquidation,'' he said. ``Because of the
discount, we'll wind up with shares of John Levin &AMP; Co. for free.
We'll hold it and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I like being a shareholder with Mr. Buffett.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Buffett, he seems to be earning himself a tidy profit. In
four months _ from July 21 through Nov. 19 _ his $38 million
investment grew to $39.8 million, roughly a 4.5 percent return,
Vick estimated, assuming that Buffett hasn't made any changes in
his position. That works out to an annual return of about 14
percent, with relatively little risk.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett may not be the only big-name investor reaping the
rewards of an arbitrage play. Others who bought shares in the
second quarter include Mario Gabelli's Gamco Investors, which held
just over 135,000 shares in the fund as of Sept. 30; Gabelli said
he bought the shares on the day of the announcement because he was
interested in John Levin &AMP; Co. And Royce &AMP; Associates, run by
Charles M. Royce, owned 45,000 shares as of that date. Royce was
unavailable for comment last week.

   NY-Y2K (New York) _ Last month, after searching and testing
nearly every computer and microchip in New York City's vast
inventory of technology, city officials took one of the final steps
in a four-year, $300 million effort to prevent any turmoil stemming
from the Year 2000 computer problem. They canvassed every city
agency to identify each jackhammer, bullhorn, tent, chain saw and
portable toilet. They made a list of every city employee who is a
qualified nurse, elevator mechanic, electrician, cook _ even scuba
diver _ so appropriate gear and specialists can quickly be
dispatched should trouble erupt after clocks and computers tick
from 1999 to 2000. The challenge is that despite spending more than
any other city in the world to fight the computer glitch, the
city's technology and emergency management experts say things may
yet go wrong _ and no one can predict exactly which things. By

   Two days after non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer, was
diagnosed in her, Julie Lerner asked a doctor whether she could
still have children. According to Ms. Lerner, his terse,
unemotional reply was: ``Why are you worried about that? You might
not live.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a long battle with cancer beginning seven years ago,
when she was 26, Ms. Lerner was frustrated by what she saw as a
lack of sympathy and understanding from hospitals, doctors and
insurance companies. One day in early 1997, after leaving a
hospital's especially bureaucratic billing department, Ms. Lerner
opened her Zagat Survey to make restaurant reservations for that
evening in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   She had a thought: Why not rate hospitals and health plans the
same way, by surveying regular customers?
</P>
<P>
   So in April 1998, she and her brother, Paul Lerner, began Lerner
Communications to publish guides for navigating the health care
system. Their first book, the Lerner Survey of Health Care in New
York ($17.95), which includes New York City, Westchester and Long
Island, was released in September.
</P>
<P>
   Many a book and Web site have sprung up to feed a huge and
growing demand for health care information. A baby boomer
generation raising children and, often, taking care of aging
parents as well has furthered that demand. But rarely does an
entrepreneur's own potentially fatal disease result not just in a
new book, but also in plans for a new business.
</P>
<P>
   The Lerners are selling their book through several channels: a
Web site, www.lernersurvey.com; a toll-free number, 888-953-7637;
online bookstores like Amazon.com; and direct sales to libraries
and bookstores. They cite small triumphs _ like invitations from
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders stores in Manhattan to discuss their
book with customers and sign copies in January.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Lerner, now at Lerner Communications full time, and Julie
Lerner, a marketing executive in the restaurant industry, have
begun research on a book of general advice, due next fall, for
obtaining the best health care for less. They plan for their guides
to cover regions across the nation, with the next book about Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lerner, whose lymphoma has been in remission for almost five
years after two bone marrow transplants, chemotherapy and
radiation, and Lerner, who has worked for AIDS groups in Los
Angeles, have drawn one main conclusion from their experience:
informed and assertive patients achieve better medical results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stop worrying about being a good patient and start
worrying about being a good consumer,'' Lerner said, especially
when facing life-or-death decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As patients demand more, he said, the system will improve.

 &HT;    The Wright Stuff: 100 years before, all they needed was wind
 &HT;    By Benjamin Kline
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Orville and Wilbur Wright needed a strong wind.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 27, 1899, Wilbur wrote from his Dayton bicycle shop to
the U.S. Weather Bureau, asking for wind velocities of ``Chicago or
vicinity'' for August, September, October and November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been doing some experimenting with kites, with a view
to constructing one capable of sustaining a man,'' Wilbur wrote.
``We wish to carry the experiment further next year.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Dec. 4 reply, the chief of the weather bureau, Willis L.
Moore, sent copies of a publication called the ``Monthly Weather
Review'' listing average hourly wind velocities at 120 weather
stations. He also enclosed the hourly record of velocities at
Chicago for August 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, as expected, was the windiest city. It had an average
daily velocity of 16.9 mph for September 1899.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilbur already had rejected Chicago and all other urban
areas, Wright biographer Tom Crouch says. Octave Chanute's
experiments in 1896, near Gary, Ind., had demonstrated how any
activity near a big city would get immediate press attention.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur moved down the list. He found the sixth-highest average
wind in the United States, at 13.4 mph, had been recorded at a
place called Kitty Hawk, N.C., Crouch says in ``The Bishop's
Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A few places on the list were on the West Coast, which was too
far,'' says John Sanford, of the Wright State University Archives.
``Chicago was too urban. The only other place close to Dayton was
Kitty Hawk.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1900, the brothers decided to build a man-carrying
glider. Wilbur wrote to the chief of the weather station at the
desolate strip of land on the outer banks of North Carolina. He
asked if he and his brother could find board and lodging in the
vicinity until they could establish a camp.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Dosher, chief of the weather station, wrote back.
Dosher also referred the Wright inquiry to William J. Tate, a
prominent former postmaster in the hamlet of Kitty Hawk. Tate wrote
to Wilbur Aug. 18, describing the area in great detail.
</P>
<P>
   With this information the Wrights decided Kitty Hawk was the
place for their glider experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision would have historic impact and give notoriety to
a windy, desolate spit of land.
</P>

THE A&AMP;M FAITHFUL FIND THAT FOOTBALL NOT AS IMPORTANT AS IT ONCE
WAS

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ If football is ever a necessary part of
life in Texas, it seemed so here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Riven by the deaths of 12 young people building the bonfire
stack last week during what is ordinarily the most festive time for
the campus of Texas A&AMP;M University, many an Aggie counted on
Friday's game against the University of Texas to lift the sense of
mourning that had settled on this area.
</P>
<P>
   They got what they wanted. And surprisingly enough, at a college
where football lies very close to the heart, the 20-16 win over its
archrival seemed almost irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we needed to win,'' said Joe Powell, a 1961
graduate of A&AMP;M. ``We got support from people all over the world in
the last week, and that's more important than this game. It means a
lot to these kids to win, but it's not as important as everything
else this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a warming Texas sun, more than 86,128 people crammed into
Kyle Field _ capacity is 80,210 _ including former President George
Bush, who has close ties to A&AMP;M, and his son, Gov. George W. Bush.
The crowd was the largest ever to watch a football game in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, it looked like an ordinary autumn college
football day _ tail-gating in the parking lots, seat cushions
stuffed under arms, a sea of orange and maroon sweatshirts
struggling to get up and down the stadium steps.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't ordinary at all. The flags still flew at
half-staff, one of literally dozens of reminders of the deaths of
11 A&AMP;M students and a recent graduate who died when the bonfire
stack suddenly collapsed in the early morning of Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-game and half-time ceremonies, poignant rather than
celebratory, eclipsed the game for a lot of people, both A&AMP;M and UT
alums, who perhaps are sharing more kindness toward each other than
at any other time in their sometimes bitter history. A number of
A&AMP;M fans could be heard telling Texas fans, ``Good luck in San
Antonio,'' a reference to their Big 12 championship game against
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened here at A&AMP;M is at a totally different level than
football,'' said Ed Guttes, a Texas graduate who lives in Austin.
``This is not life or death. This is a game. We should not forget
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before kickoff, four F-16 fighter jets, piloted by a
quartet of Aggies from the Air Force Reserve at Naval Air Station
Fort Worth, zoomed overhead in a missing man formation, a salute to
the dead the military usually saves only for its own.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the university released 12 white doves,
which fluttered out of the end zone, circled the stadium and left.
</P>
<P>
   Then the record crowd watched, thankfully a lot of them said, a
football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that we're tired of grieving, but I think everybody is
looking forward to three hours of thinking about something else,''
said Curtis Jaggars, a 1984 A&AMP;M.MDRV/.MDNM/ graduate from Dallas
who tossed a football around in a parking lot Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   His father-in-law, Perry Schwierzke, who graduated in 1960 when
A&AMP;M was all-male and all-military, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean any disrespect, but I think it's time we think
about something else,'' Schwierzke said. ``Sooner or later, we have
got to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that way for everybody, particularly the 43,000-strong
student body, which had been stunned silent for a week. Several
students said on Friday that while they looked forward to the game,
the candlelight vigil on Thursday night had not purged them of all
their collective pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game isn't a distraction,'' said Erin Malone, an
18-year-old A&AMP;M freshman from Houston. ``If anything, it only helps
us remember the Aggies who died and what they were doing when they
died.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, the Longhorn Band marched onto Kyle Field and
earned a standing ovation from the Aggie crowd with its stirring
performance of ``Amazing Grace'' and ``Taps.'' They lowered their
orange-and-white flags and raised A&AMP;M's flag, which for Aggie Bryon
Morgan may forever change the way he views UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed a lot of class,'' Morgan said. Working at an
engineering firm in Houston, where A&AMP;M-UT barbs used to be traded
among colleagues daily, Morgan said things changed in the past
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I'm ever going to be able to say, `Beat the hell
out of t.u.' again,'' he said _ it is Aggie tradition is to use
lower case when regferring to the state university. ``I suspect
that in the future there will be a lot more camaraderie between us
than bitterness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Graves, an Aggie who hasn't missed more than a half-dozen
home games in 40 years, was one of many who was relieved, glad
even, that Friday's game went on as scheduled. He said he never
expects to see another game like it.
</P>
<P>
   And Graves, who lives in Nacogdoches, Texas, isn't sure he'll
ever feel closer to the young students of his alma mater than he
has in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has renewed my spirit,'' he said, standing in the Flag
Room of the Memorial Student Center after the game. ``I'm an old
Ag. I guess I thought through the years that there had been a
waning of the traditions, of the spirit of this school and this
state. But I've seen the spirit is alive and well.''

MONTEVIDEO JOURNAL: EX-GUERRILLA TAKES STRUGGLE TO THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay _ While driving to his congressional office
the other morning, Sen.-elect Jose Mujica took a trip down memory
lane to the days when he was imprisoned for his guerrilla
activities by the military dictatorship that ruled here in the '70s
and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would never stop fighting,'' he said as he
recalled his reveries in solitary confinement between torture
sessions. ``Becoming a senator never entered my mind. It just goes
to show that if you wait long enough, the impossible can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a 35-year wait since Mujica and a handful of student
and labor radicals began an urban guerrilla war with the goal of
installing a revolutionary government that would mix anarchist
ideas with the lessons of the Cuban and Algerian revolutions. If
they are successful, after a runoff presidential election on Sunday
they will finally take power _ or at least a piece of it _ but
nonviolently, at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   The former Tupamaro guerrillas _ the group's name honors Tupac
Amaro, an Inca warrior who resisted the Spanish _ now form part of
a leftist coalition called the Frente Amplio. The coalition's
presidential candidate, Tabare Vazquez, is in a very close race
with Jorge Batlle, the candidate of the governing Colorado party.
The Tupamaros already won two seats in the Senate and four more in
the Chamber of Deputies in voting on Oct. 31, and they expect to
gain a seat in a future Vazquez cabinet, most likely taking charge
of the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Eleuterio Fernandez Huidobro, a Tupamaro founder and now also a
senator-elect, is a leading adviser to Vazquez on military matters,
leading some officers to express concerns that a leftist government
would reopen the issue of the dozens of people who disappeared
during the military dictatorship and whose fates remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 24 hours every day, for 12 years, I was at the beck and
call of the military,'' Fernandez Huidobro, 57, recalled in a
recent interview. ``Being their prisoner gave me a lot of
understanding of how the military thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when the Tupamaros dressed as garbage
collectors and policemen as they robbed banks and stole court
documents providing evidence of government corruption. Gone also
are their clandestine hideouts, complete with sophisticated
trapdoors and ``people's prisons,'' sometimes only blocks from army
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Tupamaros decorate their wood-paneled congressional
suites with Cuban flags and Che Guevara posters. Their main
Montevideo headquarters is a musty dive whose poor lighting,
disheveled furnishings and wall posters heralding guerrilla
struggles that continue in Peru and Colombia help maintain the
mystique of their underground days.
</P>
<P>
   The Tupamaros have shown amazing resilience over the years, and
they have taken new forms. Now a rumpled 65 and a weekend gardener
of gladioluses, Mujica has put bomb-throwing behind him and
broadcasts a daily radio commentary program.
</P>
<P>
   The Tupamaros publish a lively weekly newspaper called Mate
Amargo, named after the spicy herbal drink Uruguayans like to share
from a silver straw. In last week's edition, Mate Amargo's front
page highlighted Batlle's name above Pinocchio's nose and, in a
typically pointed headline, accused him of waging a ``terrorist
manipulation campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War has ended since the Tupamaros' daring exploits _
including the 1970 kidnapping and execution of Daniel Mitrione, a
U.S. adviser to the Uruguayan police _ earned them a heroic
depiction in the Costa-Gavras film ``State of Siege.'' And the
military dictators who vowed to crush the Tupamaros went into
retirement 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even as most other Latin American guerrilla groups have
faded into history, the Tupamaros continue to keep the old
revolutionary flame burning.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night a group of the new generation of Tupamaros,
mostly students who were infants or not even born during the heyday
of the armed struggle, gathered at Tupamaro headquarters in
downtown Montevideo to paste Tabare Vazquez campaign posters around
the city. It was too rainy to go out and campaign, so the young
people rolled cigarettes and sipped mate as political phrases heard
less and less around most of Latin America rolled off their lips.
``We know this is a bourgeois democracy that works in the interests
of the dominant classes,'' said Alejandro, 19, a college student
who like others in the group spoke on condition that his last name
not be published for security reasons. ``Our purpose of building
socialism is long-term and there could be many stages.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafael, 23, an unemployed mechanic who said his two aunts fought
with the original Tupamaros, added: ``The essence of our concepts
are maintained. It's a great responsibility to be a vanguard within
the Frente Amplio.''
</P>
<P>
   Such words from the Tupamaros is one reason that more
traditional Uruguayans fear a Vazquez victory, leading to a recent
rise in interest rates on Uruguayan bonds, sinking real estate
prices and rising withdrawals from bank accounts in what could be
the beginning of a flood of capital flight as a possible Vazquez
inauguration in March approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Soviet Union fell, so they have to play a different
game,'' said Daniel Gianelli, a columnist at the newspaper
Busqueda. ``If the Frente wins, the Tupamaros will see how far they
can go.''
</P>
<P>
   At least publicly, Tupamaro leaders say they are willing to work
peacefully within the system, since the times are not ripe for a
violent revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do now is distribute government services
better to the people,'' said Mujica, sipping a cup of tea under a
portrait of Raul Sendic, the late principal founder of the
Tupamaros. ``What we have in Latin America today are fat, stupid
governments that are expensive and don't serve for anything. We
need smaller, but more muscular governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a Tupamaro representative has joined groups of Frente
Amplio officials in discussions with U.S. diplomats in efforts to
smooth relations in case the left wins on Sunday. Talks have
included keeping trade and investment flowing, but there has been
no discussion of Mitrione's execution 29 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a topic,'' Mujica said, ``that is untouchable.''

DAY MEANT SO MUCH MORE THAN 20-16 WIN FOR TEXAS A&AMP;M 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Sarasota, Fla.) 
 
By DAVID BARRON 
and JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Eight days after 12 people were killed
in the collapse of the Texas A&AMP;M Bonfire stack, the Aggies beat the
Texas Longhorns 20-16 on Friday at Kyle Field before 86,128 fans,
the largest crowd to see a football game in the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-ranked Longhorns led 16-6 at halftime before the No.
24 Aggies rallied with two second-half touchdowns. The winning
score came with 5:02 to play on A&AMP;M quarterback Randy McCown's
14-yard pass to his roommate, Matt Bumgardner. Victory was sealed
when Aggies linebacker Brian Gamble recovered a fumble with 1:29 to
play by Texas quarterback Major Applewhite, who played in relief of
heralded freshman Chris Simms after missing most of the game with a
stomach ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Ja'Mar Toombs scored both of A&AMP;M's other touchdowns and
had a game-high 126 rushing yards _ 37 more than the Texas roster.
It was the Aggies' 94th victory of the 1990s and their sixth win of
the decade over the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the dry, bare-bones facts, figures, names and numbers
of this Friday after Thanksgiving, and the whole lot of them do
precious little to describe what the day meant to a campus only
beginning to emerge from nine days of deep mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could conjure up a word to explain what it means I would,
but I can't,'' Gamble said. ``Until the day I die, I won't be able
to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble's quandary would seem to be that the day meant so much to
so many people.
</P>
<P>
   To Shaleah Hester, an A&AMP;M sophomore from Nacogdoches, and for
Jim Sears, an Aggie's dad from Clifton, it was a day for symbols, a
day for going home.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days ago, while walking back across campus from the site of
the shattered Bonfire stack, Hester came across a wounded dove with
a broken wing. The bird died before she could take it to a
veterinarian, another casualty on that saddest of days.
</P>
<P>
   But the chance encounter sparked something. Hester and her
roommate, Lauren Harms of Houston, brought an idea to university
officials, who in turn contacted Sears, who trains pigeons for a
living. Prior to Friday's game, the three walked onto the Kyle
Field turf with a cage of 12 white pigeons _ one for each Aggie who
was killed in the Bonfire's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   When Sears released the birds, they fluttered once around the
stadium, then disappeared beyond the rim, headed north toward home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do something special for the families and their
friends and for Aggieland,'' Hester said. ``If our friends were
here, we knew they wouldn't want us mourning. They would be
cheering and carrying and on, and we know they're here with us.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chip Thiel of Livingston, one of 27 survivors of the
collapse, it was a day to be back on the sidelines with his fellow
seniors from Company E-1, even if he was in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sore. I'm beat up,'' said Thiel, who suffered two compound
fractures of the lower left leg, a cracked ankle, two broken ribs
and a shoulder injury. ``But I was going to be here. This is my
senior year. My doctor and I had some words, but I told him I was
going to be here even if they had to kidnap me out of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you want to know what happened. People ask what
went wrong, and if I knew what went wrong with the Bonfire, me and
everybody who worked with me would have done something about it. We
don't know what happened. If we knew what happened, we wouldn't
have had to bury 12 Aggies.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a rivalry that all too often has been marked by
bitterness and hatred, Thiel realized this was a day for
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the rivalry is still there, and we want to beat the
hell out of them,'' Thiel said. ``But I don't hate them like I used
to. They're people over there, and they've actually got hearts. I
like them a little bit more now.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is done. My one year is over. But next year, I'll be
out there helping the new guys on the Bonfire. I just hope we build
it bigger, taller and better, and it burns brighter. That's all you
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dianne and Joe Brickner of Sarasota, Fla., it was a day for
family, a day to remember absent loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Brickner traveled from Florida seven months ago to give
birth to her daughter Sara Lauren in Kerrville so she could be
close to her own mother, who would die from cancer three months
after cutting her granddaughter's umbilical cord. This was the
Brickners' first trip back to A&AMP;M with their new child.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, with my daughter and mother, and now Bonfire, it
makes me realize how important family is,'' Dianne Brickner said.
``1999 has been a tough year for my family and A&AMP;M. I'm ready for
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Smith, a member of the A&AMP;M Corps of Cadets from
Hallettsville, is ready for 2000, too. He plans to be married to
Joy Kutach of Yoakum, who accepted his proposal on the east
sideline in front of the Aggies band and student section.
</P>
<P>
   Proposing in front of an audience might seem like a stacked deck
to the jaded witness. But Smith is a true believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the only place to do it, in front of my Aggie
family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a day, as well, for families divided. As the final
seconds ticked away in the fourth quarter, Warren Trahan stood
behind the south end zone, silently rooting for the Aggies to beat
his son, Beau, and the rest of the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   He's not a bad dad, just an old all-conference defensive lineman
for the Aggies in the mid-1970s. In this case, old school ties ran
thicker than blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking to Beau every day, and I said, `Hey, I know what
we're going to do here,''' said Trahan, who coached his son at Bay
City. ```We're going to play for those kids, so you'd better be
ready, you know what I'm saying. We're not going to be down in the
dumps.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the final gun, Warren Trahan was an Aggie first and foremost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so good for these kids,'' he shouted. ``This is so
good for A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   Five seconds later, he was a dad again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the boy,'' he said, shaking his head. ``It's
kind of weird. But I'll give him a big hug. He'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   When it wasn't a day for yelling or hugging, it was a day for
silence. The record crowd stood transfixed _ quiet enough to hear
the flags snapping in the wind _ when the Texas band performed
``Amazing Grace`` and ``Taps`` in honor of the fallen Aggies, then
doffed their hats as they marched from the field. Never in Kyle
Field's history have Aggies cheered so loudly for Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd fell silent again when the Aggies band ended its
show by forming the traditional Block-T formation. Instead of
marching off the field to the ``Aggie War Hymn,'' the band marched
silently in formation, without so much as the click of a drumstick
to keep cadence, and exited the field to the sound of silence.
</P>
<P>
   On only one other occasion, after the death of longtime band
director Col. E.V. Adams in 1974, has the band left in silence.
</P>
<P>
   In silence, and in the counseling sessions between Aggies young
and old through the last week, school officials hope the healing
can begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important,'' said Col. Ray E. Toler, the band's director,
``to realize that life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   For the A&AMP;M players, the men for whom the doomed Bonfire was
being built, this was a day to give back. A&AMP;M offensive lineman
Chris Valletta wore a T-shirt with the victims' names under his
pads and jersey Friday, but the names and faces of the dead were
never out of his sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the thought and memory of those 12 who died in our
hearts and minds every single play,'' he said. ``I hope this can
ease the pain a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it will. Corps member Casey ``Scooterbutt''
Utterbeck, who lost a friend from his unit in the Bonfire's
collapse, was more relieved than elated as he left Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have been the same if we hadn't beaten Texas,''
Utterbeck said. ``Now, we can move on. I'm tired of being sad.''

   Off the Hook On Phone Stocks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brokers at Merrill Lynch don't have to hold their phone pitches
after all.
</P>
<P>
   When Merrill lost its top telecommunications stock analyst, Dan
Reingold, to a rival last week, the firm's brokers were suddenly
prohibited from calling clients and urging them to buy shares of
some of the nation's biggest companies, including AT&AMP;T and MCI
Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   Under a longstanding rule, Merrill's 14,000 brokers cannot
solicit purchases of stocks that the firm's research department
doesn't follow. The abrupt defection of Reingold and two other
analysts to Credit Suisse First Boston knocked the stocks they had
covered off the firm's list of recommended stocks, putting them
``under review,'' in brokerage parlance.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill has not decided how and when it will replace the
analysts. But Merrill didn't want to leave its brokers on hold
indefinitely, so it made an exception.
</P>
<P>
   The firm notified brokers last week that, despite the suspension
of coverage, they were free to suggest purchases of shares of seven
major telecommunications companies: AT&AMP;T, MCI, GTE, Bell Atlantic,
BellSouth, SBC Communications and US West.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McCabe, a spokeswoman for Merrill, said the exception was
made because the companies are large and their stocks are popular
with investors. ``It would be a disservice to our clients to limit
access to them,'' she said.

<P>
   A New Internet Play &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baron Capital of New York, which currently offers a trim lineup
of just three mutual funds, apparently is bullish enough on the
growth prospects for the Web to become the latest money management
firm to start an Internet fund.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
company said it expected the fund to begin operations on Feb. 29,
2000. It said the fund would invest both in emerging Internet
companies and in more mature ``bricks and mortar'' businesses that
it expects to benefit from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, called Baron iOpportunity, will be managed by a team
of advisers, but the filing did not disclose their names.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Baron, chief executive, is known for taking substantial
positions in small and midcap companies and holding on to them for
years; as a result, his funds' turnover is usually light. How will
such a style mesh with the volatile world of the Web, where today's
hot stock can easily be tomorrow's road kill?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not traders,'' said Morty Schaja, chief operating
officer at Baron. ``If we don't see long-term competitive
advantages we won't invest.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Teitelbaum &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A New Path to Biotechnology &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch last Monday rolled out a different version of one
of its more successful new investment products, pricing 4.5 million
Biotech Holdr's, which hold the stock of 20 biotechnology
companies, at $109.18 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Holdr's, which trade on the American Stock Exchange,
represent ownership in a fixed number of shares of a roster of
companies including Amgen, Genentech, Biogen, Alkermes and QLT
PhotoTherapeutics.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of shares represented by the Holdr's will
remain fixed, except in the case of corporate events like share
splits or mergers. Because of the way they are put together,
Holdr's have some tax advantages over mutual funds.

   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The 106th meeting between the Texas and
Texas A&AMP;M football teams was unlike any other, a mixture of orange
and maroon, of ribbons and triumphant tributes. Friday afternoon
here at Kyle Field, there was deafening cheering. There was also
solemn silence.
</P>
<P>
   No one tried to explain the accident of Nov. 18 when 12 A&AMP;M
students died while building the school's traditional 55-foot-high
bonfire made of thousands of huge logs. The bonfire is built by
students each year before the Texas game, the big game, the only
one here that matters. But this year something went wrong in the
construction. With the structure at nearly 40 feet and growing, it
collapsed. Besides those killed, 28 students were injured.
</P>
<P>
   So, for the first time that anyone in Texas orange or A&AMP;M maroon
could remember, there was something more important than the
football rivalry _ there was a need for healing and for
remembering. A need for unity between the Texas Longhorns and the
Texas A&AMP;M Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Texas A&AMP;M did win, 20-16, in a thrilling game decided in the
final seconds. And it did so before 86,128 fans, the largest crowd
ever to watch a football game in the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those here, deep in Texas, arrived and left with
pensive minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis and the whole meaning of the game has been
changed this year,'' said Doug Pinion, 45, a 1976 A&AMP;M graduate who
attended the game and lives in Flower Mound, Texas. ``The rivalry
in recent years had grown to the point of hatred. People had taken
it to an extreme. Now everybody's doing some serious thinking.
Maybe we both need a new rival.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Simms, son of the former New York Giants quarterback Phil
Simms, made his first college start at quarterback for Texas. He
was 10-of-21 for 130 yards with an interception before being pulled
in the fourth quarter. Major Applewhite, the usual starter who had
a stomach virus and who sat at the start of the game, entered in
the final quarter but could not save the Longhorns. Randy McCown,
the A&AMP;M quarterback, threw for 156 yards, more yards than Simms and
Applewhite combined, and tossed the game-winning touchdown to wide
receiver Matt Bumgardner with 5 minutes 2 seconds left. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not have had a bonfire here Thursday night,'' McCown
said, ``but we had a bonfire burning in our hearts. There's a
saying here: Once an Aggie, always an Aggie, no matter who you are
or what your skin color. This wasn't a win for the football team;
this was a win for the university and all the people. Hopefully, we
made everyone's burden a little lighter.''
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;M players and their fans were full of tears and cheers
after the game. There was a sense of relief, if only for a few
moments. It was a scene filled with raw emotion. Offensive lineman
Chris Valletta wore the names of each victim on a white T-shirt
under his jersey. He said several of his A&AMP;M teammates did, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotions ran high today, and we came into this game
knowing we had a lot more to play for than a game,'' Valletta said.
``We thought of the people that died on every play.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M began preparing for the game with a candlelight vigil at the
bonfire site on Thursday night. More than 85,000 people attended.
Then most of them went to nearby Kyle Stadium for a pep rally _
what A&AMP;M calls yell practice. The night's most memorable moment
came when the stadium lights were turned off and the huge video
screen behind the south end zone showed footage of last year's
bonfire celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's game, Will Hurd, A&AMP;M's student president, led
the 86,128 fans in an invocation. It was followed by moments of
silence. Four Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcons flew overhead in a
missing-man formation in honor of the dead students. Twelve doves
were released, and 20,000 maroon balloons.
</P>
<P>
   In the game, A&AMP;M players wore decals on their helmets that
outlined a bonfire stack with '99 placed near it. Two maroon
ribbons and the Roman numeral XII were painted on the playing
field. At halftime, the Texas band flew its flags low and played
``Amazing Grace.'' The A&AMP;M band ended its show by filing silently
off the field in a T formation. School executives said that had
been done only once in the school's 123-year history, in the 1960s
when a favorite band director had died.
</P>
<P>
   For the entire halftime, only a handful of fans left. All
present stood solemnly for the entire presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up that Thursday morning and saw on TV where the logs
had fallen, the mourners, the flowers _ I cried then and every time
I've seen it since, I've cried,'' said a 23-year-old Texas student
who only gave her first name, Misty. She is a junior government
major from Wichita Falls. A friend got a ticket to Friday's game
from his boss and he gave it to Misty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect A&AMP;M as a good institution and school,'' she said.
``Now, I don't think the rivalry will ever be the same. Back at
school, when this happened here, I gave blood to the Red Cross that
was sent here for the injured and survivors to use. Some people
back at school waited six hours on line to donate. We care. That's
the reason I came today.''
</P>
<P>
   One pervasive question since the accident has been: What were
college students doing trying to build a bonfire?
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Whitehead, from the A&AMP;M class of 1993, said that many
people from outside Texas don't understand the bonfire's meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The football team comes, the band, the coaches _ it's not just
a fire, it's 60,000 people celebrating school tradition,'' said
Whitehead, who lives in Dallas and who attended Friday's game. ``I
went to four bonfires when I was a student here, and I've been to
about six total.
</P>
<P>
   ``I helped build bonfires when I was at A&AMP;M. You learn so much
about yourself and work ethic and working in a team environment.
You can't understand it unless you're an Aggie. For a lot of us, it
was a sort of pilgrimage. I made friends during that experience
that have lasted a lifetime.''

GALBRAITH NOW SEES LBJ AS A FORCE OF SOCIAL CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Thirty-six years ago this week, John F. Kennedy was
killed by a sniper's bullet in Dallas, and Lyndon B. Johnson
succeeded at once to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Time has treated them differently. Kennedy has been transformed
over the years into one of the great, romantic American heroes, his
shortcomings obscured by the tragedy of an early, violent death.
For all his achievements, Johnson is still remembered mainly as the
president who presided over the war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But this week John Kenneth Galbraith, the eminent economist,
came to Texas to seek, as he put it, ``substantial modification''
of the historical record _ ``a more modest, I trust more
informed,'' view of Johnson's five years in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Tuesday night at the LBJ Library in Austin,
Galbraith said that after long reflection he now placed Johnson
``next only to Franklin D. Roosevelt as a force for a civilized and
civilizing social policy essential for human well-being and for the
peaceful coexistence between the economically favored (or
financially fortunate) and the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   He also termed Johnson ``the most effective political activist
of our time,'' with a commanding role vis-a-vis Congress that no
other modern president has approached.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all of that, Galbraith said, now ``lies in the historical
backwater'' because of Vietnam and its dire domestic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   For Galbraith, 91, the speech represented a considerable
departure. He and Joseph L. Rauh Jr., a Washington lawyer and
liberal activist, decided in 1967 that Johnson, with whom both had
been friendly if not intimate, had to be defeated in order to end
the war. Together with a few others, they settled on Sen. Eugene J.
McCarthy of Minnesota, a Democrat like Johnson, as their candidate,
and started urging him to run.
</P>
<P>
   That effort precipitated a final, unpleasant meeting between
Galbraith and Johnson, at which the two argued bitterly about
Vietnam. Galbraith never talked to Johnson again, he said in an
interview after his speech _ ``not even a few words on the
telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, McCarthy announced his candidacy in Galbraith's
house in Cambridge, Mass., and Galbraith served as McCarthy's floor
manager at the ill-fated 1968 Democratic National Convention in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I've wanted to talk about for years,''
Galbraith said, ``but I have worried about getting the balance
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith, who taught at Harvard University for many years, said
he had not changed his mind about the futility of the war _ he
called it ``this cruel and hopeless effort'' _ or about ``sending
our youth, still under draft, to serve and die.''
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed remorse over the way Johnson has come to
personify the mistakes made by the United States in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not regret my effort against this error,'' he told an
audience of several hundred people, including Lady Bird Johnson.
``One must, however, regret the way in which we allowed the Vietnam
War to become the totally defining effort of those years, and
likewise of history. In the Johnson years it was Vietnam and
nothing else. And so in history it remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who were involved allowed that response; at the
time, perhaps it was inevitable. But certainly we have done far too
little to correct the history since.''
</P>
<P>
   One element in his revised view, Galbraith said, is the new
material in a forthcoming book by David Kaiser, who teaches at the
Naval War College. Titled ``American Tragedy: Kennedy, Johnson and
the Origins of the Vietnam War,'' it ``makes full, intelligent,
even exhaustive use,'' Galbraith said, of newly declassified
documents. It is to be published next year by Harvard University
Press; Galbraith read the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaiser tells in extensive and, to this day, alarming detail of
the military pressure on Presidents Kennedy and Johnson,'' he said.
``The generals and their acolytes took over, and were even eager
for a war. Nuclear weapons were freely proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Kaiser revelations, Galbraith said that he
had recently come to realize more fully that during Johnson's
presidency ``what was called the American democracy'' became a more
complete democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a long step toward peaceful coexistence between
ethnic groups,'' he said. ``And for the first time we had a clear
recognition of the presence of deep, unforgiving poverty in this
generally affluent land.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed particularly to the Voting Rights Act of 1964 and the
range of antipoverty programs known collectively as the Great
Society.

EURO TAKES A DIVE TO RECORD DEPTHS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Defying predictions of accelerated growth
in Europe, Europe's single currency sank to record lows Friday
against the U.S. dollar, the British pound and the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   In a move with tremendous symbolic value, Europe's 11-month-old
euro slipped to barely 1 penny above one-to-one parity with the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was introduced at nearly $1.18 on Jan. 4 amid buoyant
enthusiasm about new opportunities in Europe's unified market.
Friday, the euro sank as low as $1.0076 before closing at $1.1056.
</P>
<P>
   Though the decline was not in itself alarming, it provided yet
another reminder of Europe's nagging economic problems and its
inability to match the relentless growth of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The euro also hit record lows against the British pound, which
is certain to stir the new wave of hostility within Britain about
joining the European currency union.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's most drastic decline has been against the Japanese
yen, which has climbed sharply against all major currencies and is
now about 30 percent higher against the euro than it was in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's problems have repeatedly defied investors'
expectations. At the time it was introduced, the euro seemed so
strong that some economists and political leaders worried about its
climbing so high that it might make European exports too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the euro sank throughout the first six months of its
life and came perilously close to parity with the dollar in June.
The euro then recovered part of its lost ground, a rebound partly
attributed to signs of new economic growth and to speculators who
were convinced the euro was poised for a big bounce up.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's economy has indeed perked up in recent months, but it
is still growing much more slowly than that of the United States.
The U.S. economy expanded at a surprisingly strong rate of 5.5
percent in the third quarter of this year. By contrast, growth in
the 11-nation euro zone is about 2.5 percent this year and is
expected to reach about 3 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the euro had also been hobbled by growing
skittishness among Japanese investors, who have seen the value of
euro-denominated stocks and bonds plunge as a result of the yen's
surge.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank aggravated that skittishness on
Wednesday, when top officials said they would do nothing to shore
up the euro against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, many currency traders who bet on a strong
recovery in the euro last summer are now selling euros in order to
adopt a more neutral stance relative to other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about economic growth or this week's economic
numbers,'' said Michael Saunders, European economist at Salomon
Smith Barney in London. ``This is about investors' trying to reduce
their risks before year-end and trying to get back to neutral
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the European Central Bank, which governs monetary
policy in the euro zone, made it clear this week that they would
not try to shore up the euro through their trading operations.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenio Domingo Solans, the bank's board member in charge of
international issues, said Thursday that the bank had no intention
of intervening in the currency to prevent the euro from sinking
below parity against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And Wim Duisenberg, the European bank's president, in an
interview published Friday in The Financial Times, reiterated his
long-held position that the euro's exchange rate is only important
if it fuels inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the actual movement give rise to concern?'' Duisenberg
asked rhetorically. ``The answer is no. It doesn't matter very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Duisenberg admitted to ``some concern'' about
perceptions created by a falling euro. ``A continued further
movement in this direction would contribute to undermining the
confidence in the euro,'' he said. ``Unjustified, but still it is a
public perception.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Belgium, officials at the European Commission said
the euro's decline was attributable merely to strong economic data
in the United States rather than to fundamental weaknesses in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the strength of the dollar rather than the weakness of
the euro that has led to these developments in the past few days,''
said Gerassimos Thomas, a commission spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese central bankers and investors may well be the most
worried about the euro. The extraordinary surge of the yen against
the euro threatens to strangle Japanese exports to Europe because
Japanese goods cost more in European currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Although euro notes and coins will not enter circulation until
2002, the euro trades in financial markets and the existing
currencies of euro-member countries have been permanently locked to
the value of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Haruhiko Kuroda, a senior official at the Japanese Ministry of
Finance, was quoted by Reuters Friday as saying that the euro's
fall was unjustified. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has
previously said that Japan is ready to intervene if necessary, and
the Bank of Japan did in fact intervene, with assistance from the
European Central Bank, earlier this summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some analysts have speculated that the euro has been hurt by
recent political machinations in Germany. In the last week, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has inveighed against Vodafone
Airtouch's hostile takeover bid against Mannesmann, giving rise to
fears that Germany might try to block certain types of mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder kicked off another round of controversy on Wednesday,
when he orchestrated a $2.2 billion bailout of Germany's huge
construction company, Philipp Holzmann.
</P>
<P>
   But most economists say the euro's problems are rooted in more
mundane issues. They note that many institutions increased their
stocks of euro-denominated assets in the summers, convinced that
the euro had hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   But as the end of the year approaches, they said, investors are
shifting back to a neutral stance _ which means selling euros.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very uncertain about what the correct level of the
euro should be,'' said Jens Dallmeyer, an economist at Deutsche
Bank Research in Frankfurt. ``The boom in the United States is
still alive and kicking and everyone can feel it. But people are
still waiting for hard evidence of an economic upswing in Europe.''

 Groom Boom: Busy Bay Area pet lovers can't find
enough  professionals to cater to their critters 
 &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
``This is terrier week,'' announced instructor Michelle Higbee. The
five students gathered at Madeline's Institute of Pet Grooming in
Santa Clara exchanged looks of excitement.
<P>
   Higbee drew a diagram of a terrier on the whiteboard. She
sketched in little arrows to show how the fur should be trimmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a schnauzer,'' she told the class, ``you bring the
clipper down and airplane off.''
</P>
<P>
   The students took careful notes, already familiar with clipper
techniques such as ``airplaning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With an Airedale,'' Higbee continued, ``it's pretty much the
same. You want to blend. Like you did with the cocker.''
</P>
<P>
   Her students nodded their understanding. Terriers would be no
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   These are boom times in the pet grooming business. There just
aren't enough skilled groomers to go around as growing numbers of
busy, well-off pet owners seek out professional help in keeping
their pooches and kitties bathed, fluffed and coiffed.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Mart, a business consultant for groomers and operator of
the Petgroomer.com Web site, estimates that on any given day, there
are 500 job openings for skilled groomers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area, he said, has the country's highest average _ 29
openings at any one time. ``The Bay Area has a very high pet
population,'' Mart observed, adding that the region's on-the-go
lifestyles and surging economy also boost demand for groomers.
</P>
<P>
   Mart should know. His mother is Madeline Bright-Ogle, who sold
Madeline's Pet Grooming Salon to Higbee in 1987 and is herself a
prominent pet grooming industry consultant. Mart helped Higbee
launch her affiliated pet grooming school in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 50 licensed pet grooming academies throughout
the country. Most are small affairs, often no more than a sidelight
for a local pet salon. The only other Bay Area grooming school is
run by the San Francisco SPCA.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline's is one of the nation's biggest. Because the adjoining
salon has nearly 5,000 regular clients, students have a steady
stream of pets on which to practice _ a plus that has attracted
budding groomers from as far off as Singapore and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition for the 14-week program runs $3,600. Students also are
required to shell out an extra $1,000 for equipment. Higbee said
that the school typically sees six students per quarter and that
enrollment is rising by about 5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of jobs that don't give you emotional
rewards,'' she said prior to beginning the day's terrier lesson.
``This is big-time emotionally rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional pet grooming is not, however, all that financially
rewarding. Most groomers pull down about $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, most groomers will insist that they're not in it for
the money. A love of animals, naturally, is the main draw, plus a
sense that working with humans is just, well, too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Heather McLain, 24, graduated with top academic honors from
Santa Clara University a couple of years ago. She had expected at
the time to pursue post-graduate work in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Working with human subjects, however, just didn't have the same
appeal as working with animals. And so she ended up instead at the
Institute of Pet Grooming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the weirdest thing,'' McLain said while studying grooming
hints at her classroom workstation. ``I just finally came to terms
with what I wanted to do. This is what makes me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Higbee, 43, isn't surprised to hear her students talk like that.
She, too, followed a love of animals into grooming school, and then
turned that passion into a livelihood with her purchase of
Madeline's, which has been keeping up appearances among Peninsula
pets for nearly four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be an extremely patient person for this kind of
work,'' Higbee noted. ``You have to be the type who doesn't mind
hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reward is when a pet starts to recognize you and give you
kisses. That makes it all worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   It was enough for Pam Gillies-Heaney, 44, who walked away from a
high-paying career assisting with Silicon Valley startups, enrolled
at Madeline's and is now the school's customer service manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last startup I worked with got bought out,'' she said.
``All of a sudden it hit me that although I loved putting startups
together, I was getting burned out. It was giving me financial
returns but not emotional returns. I needed emotional returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillies-Heaney still gets calls from venture capitalists asking
if she has gotten this pet-grooming thing out of her system and is
ready to tackle another startup. She turns them all down.
</P>
<P>
   For her, it's simple: Technology is cold; terriers are warm.
</P>
<P>
   For Christina and Jeff Ekeland, pet grooming represents a chance
to launch their own business and build a career together. After
graduation, the Livermore couple plan to provide a mobile grooming
service for upscale clients in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just flipping through the TV one day and saw a lady on
the Maury Povitch show who did professional poop scooping,''
28-year-old Christina Ekeland recalled. ``That got my wheels
spinning.''
</P>
<P>
   She ended up talking her 30-year-old husband into quitting his
job with a construction company and enrolling at Madeline's. They
have already invested about $60,000 in a specially equipped van and
other gear.
</P>
<P>
   Pet-grooming school, they both agree, will give them a leg up in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to somebody's house and see that they have a poodle,
I want to know that I can do it,'' Jeff Ekeland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And do it right,'' his wife chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, mobile grooming is a growing trend on the West Coast,
said Karen Long MacLeod, editor in chief of Groom &AMP; Board magazine
in Chicago. East Coast pet owners apparently have enjoyed such
convenience for years.
</P>
<P>
   MacLeod also sees growth opportunities for fancy ``pet spas,''
where Rover and Whiskers can enjoy opulent surroundings while
having their hygiene needs attended to.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to pamper their pets,'' she observed with
considerable understatement.
</P>
<P>
   A survey published by Groom &AMP; Board in June found that 43
percent of pet groomers are seeing at least 10 percent more in
sales this year than in 1998 and that the average grooming charge
has increased nearly 13 percent to $28.74 from $25.21.
</P>
<P>
   At Madeline's, a bath and trim for a medium-size dog runs about
$35, while the same treatment for a cat will cost about
approximately  &LR; $40.
</P>
<P>
   Cats, needless to say, are a bit tougher to get into a tub of
water, blow dry and snip. All the students at the school said
scratches, and the occasional bite, are simply an occupational
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The class gathered around a work table as Higbee demonstrated
the day's lesson on a schnauzer named Amy. ``Poodles have more of a
round look,'' Higbee stressed. ``Terriers have more of a square
look.''
</P>
<P>
   And a new generation of pet groomers watched with attentive,
hopeful eyes as she proceeded to shear and airplane Amy's fur.

EXCLUSIVE: REGULATORS SET TO APPROVE EXXON-MOBIL MERGER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a year of review, antitrust officials at the
Federal Trade Commission have notified state officials that they
intend to recommend the approval of Exxon's $81 billion acquisition
of Mobil next week, state officials said Friday. The move came
after the companies agreed to the largest divestiture in the
commission's history.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, federal and some state officials have raised
serious antitrust questions about a second large oil merger, BP
Amoco's proposed $29 billion purchase of Atlantic Richfield, and
are threatening to go to court to block that deal. The federal
government, along with officials in California and other states on
the West Coast supplied by BP Amoco and Arco from the companies'
Alaskan oil reserves, have insisted on significant divestitures.
There are concerns that the merger could substantially reduce the
competition over the supply of crude oil to the region and sharply
increase prices at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon-Mobil and BP Amoco-Arco mergers, the largest energy
deals in history, propose to put back together two large chunks of
the old Rockefeller oil empire, a series of innovative trusts that
were smashed into 34 independent companies in 1911 after the
Supreme Court found it had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment last December when Exxon, the nation's largest
oil producer, announced its intention to buy Mobil, the No. 2 oil
company, and create the world's biggest company in revenues,
federal officials had promised a rigorous regulatory review. The
officials have also said that while they are concerned about
potentially anti-competitive aspects of the deals, the world has
changed significantly since 1911. Analysts have noted that there is
now considerable worldwide competition in the oil industry,
particularly for exploration of new reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the agreement reached with Exxon and Mobil,
which emerged this week, requires the sale of about 2,400 gas
stations, some 15 percent of the two companies' retailers around
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In documents that are circulating in the industry, Mobil has
said it plans to sell more than 1,200 stations in the mid-Atlantic
states and 300 in Texas. Exxon has been taking bids for more than
500 stations in the Northeast and 360 in California.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon is also preparing to sell a refinery in Benicia, Calif.,
and the companies are selling substantial interests in a number of
pipelines throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed divestitures were part of intensive negotiations
that were supervised from the government's side by Robert Pitofsky,
the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. He met this week with
Lee Raymond, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon, and Lucio
Noto, his counterpart at Mobil, in preparation for a final decision
by the commission. The states have been notified that the five
commissioners are expected to vote on the deal next week, and the
merger is expected to close soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon's stock slipped $1.125 Friday, to $78, while Mobil's
barely budged, rising 3.125 cents, to $102.9375. Under the deal,
investors will receive 1.32015 Exxon shares for each Mobil share;
the stock prices almost exactly reflect that formula.
</P>
<P>
   While the divestitures will be significantly greater in value
than the $1 billion sale of assets ordered by the commission before
it approved the British brewer Guinness' merger with Grand
Metropolitan, the sales represent only a small piece of the $138
billion in combined assets of Exxon and Mobil. Moreover, whatever
companies buy the gas stations will retain the right to use the
Exxon and Mobil names.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Pitofsky declined to comment on the merger
because the commission had not taken a vote. He has been described
by others as being particularly concerned about the strength of the
buyers of the Exxon and Mobil assets, and wanted assurances that
the marketplace would remain competitive after the gas stations and
other assets were sold. Judging by the early bidding, those
interested in the assets, according to industry executives, include
Amerada Hess, Chevron, Crown Central Petroleum, Getty, Tosco,
Tetco, Irving Oil and Sunoco.
</P>
<P>
   While many states, including Texas and California, have agreed
with the agreement reached between the companies and the Federal
Trade Commission, a few are still holding out and say they oppose
the deal. The states, by themselves, do not have the authority to
block the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general in Connecticut, said in
an interview Friday that he remained concerned about the ``overall
anti-competitive effects of so huge a merger and its potential
harms to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said he was concerned about not having sufficient
authority to review any proposed buyers of the Exxon and Mobil
stations in Connecticut and that the agreement did not adequately
protect gasoline dealers in his state from the effects of the
merger. Gas station dealers have sought the option to buy the
stations the Federal Trade Commission has ordered to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   An official at commission said in response to Blumenthal's
concerns that ``when the time comes, the commission will pay
attention to the way the acquirer will treat dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said that New Hampshire had notified the Federal
Trade Commission that it, too, was leaning against the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the BP Amoco-Arco merger, executives from the companies are
expected to reach a final agreement allaying the antitrust and
other concerns raised by the state of Alaska, according Bob King, a
spokesman for Gov. Tony Knowles. While the companies have been
hoping that deal would build momentum toward a final settlement
with the FTC, Alaska officials and lawyers involved in the
negotiations said the interests of the state and the federal
government were not the same, and that the arrangement that had
been reached does not sufficiently protect consumers in California
and other states that have witnessed a larger-than-average increase
in prices at the pump this year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, California Gov. Gray Davis expressed
satisfaction over pledges from the companies that they would not
raise prices of crude oil. But state Attorney General Bill Lockyer
is independent of the governor's office and has been working
closely with the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at BP Amoco said they were still confident that the
deal would be approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to continue discussions with the FTC and we are
confident of a fruitful outcome,'' said Roddy Kennedy, BP Amoco's
top spokesman in London.

IN THE GAME OF PLAYFUL POLITICS, BUSH BEATS HIS PEERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Texas, N.C., Iowa)  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRATHAM, N.H. _ As George W. Bush loped through the
headquarters of Timberland Co. here, he might have been any
candidate in the hunt for votes, any pol on the path toward the
presidency. He tirelessly shook hands, dutifully took questions and
let a multitude of promises bloom.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something different about Bush's approach,
something jazzier and jauntier. It came out in the way he praised a
20-year-old man for his ``articulate'' remarks, then appended the
high-minded compliment with a surprising term of endearment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dude,'' Bush called his new acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   It emerged again when Bush crossed paths with an elderly
employee, and she told him that he had her support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll seal it with a kiss!'' Bush proposed and, wearing a
vaguely naughty expression, swooped down on the captive seamstress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's arm curled tight around the shoulders of other voters; he
arched his eyebrows and threw coquettish grins and conspiratorial
glances their way. It was campaigning as facial calisthenics, and
Bush was its Jack LaLanne.
</P>
<P>
   He is frequently that way. When Bush is not reciting memorized
lines in an official speech or rendering careful answers in a
formal interview, he is physically expansive and verbally
irreverent, folksy and feisty, a politician more playful than most
of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   This disarming demeanor goes a long way toward explaining the
commitment and confidence of Bush's core Republican supporters.
They clearly see in the two-term Texas governor a warmth and
affability that provide a sharp, necessary contrast to the brooding
of a Bob Dole or the belligerence of a Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's lighter, nimbler style also contributes to the
questions that opponents and reporters have raised about his
intellectual maturity and the gravity of purpose he brings to his
presidential bid. To some people, Bush simply seems too buoyant to
let anything weigh him down.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, it is sometimes Bush's most mischievous moments
that demonstrate how astute he can be.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the publication of an article suggesting that Bush
was not too fervent a reader of books, Bush was riding in his
motorcade when he spotted the reporter who had written the story,
brought his sport utility vehicle to a halt, rolled down his window
and merrily asked the reporter how he was.
</P>
<P>
   Tired, the reporter responded, noting that Bush had scheduled
the first event of the day for 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up early,'' Bush said, ``because I was in the middle of
a really good book.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, seemingly reflecting on his remark, Bush added,
``Touche!'' Up went both his eyebrows and his window, and off he
drove.
</P>
<P>
   Bush loves to joke, even if he is the punch line. Ever since his
failing performance on a televised pop quiz about the heads of
foreign countries, Bush has folded into his standard stump speech a
few lines about leaving home and having his wife, Laura, tell him
not to try to impress his audiences by rattling off the names of
world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At a book fair in Austin, Texas, recently, he joked that he had
thought about dedicating his new autobiography, ``A Charge to
Keep,'' to the president of the breakaway Russian republic Chechnya
_ one of the people he had failed to identify on the unanticipated
test.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But this is a proclivity with apparent peril. During a recent
telephone interview with The Associated Press, Bush responded to a
question about whether Russians were still murdering women and
children in Chechnya by seeming to call out to his chief foreign
policy adviser for help in answering.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush's associates claimed that the adviser had not even
been within shouting distance and that Bush had simply been making
fun of his reputation as someone without any international bearings
of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The prankish glimmer in Bush's eye shines brightest whenever he
is assigning someone a nickname, which can happen rather quickly on
the heels of his introduction to the person.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign visit to an educational haven for poor children in
Raleigh, N.C., in August, one of the hefty male supervisors became
``Big Al'' in the span of a handshake and a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush toys with other people's names by translating them into
Spanish or giving them suffixes; Candy turns into Dolce and Kathy
into Katarina.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush angles constantly for the colloquial and the jocular.
</P>
<P>
   ``How ya' doin', buddy?'' is a stock greeting for any man who
happens to be in a bookstore, restaurant or town hall that Bush
sweeps through; more than a few women have gotten kisses on the
tops of their heads.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other politicians with a similar zest for contact,
Bush does not appear to be moved by any profound need for
affirmation. He seems to operate from utter confidence, a happy and
lucky man for happy-go-lucky times.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He very much wants the presidency; he could very easily live
without it, or so he says, in a manner that is pretty convincing.
In Davenport, Iowa, the subject arose when Bush let a gaggle of
elementary school children ask him questions, and one of them
wondered whether Bush had dreamed of the Oval Office when he was a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't want to be president when I was little,'' Bush
said, adding, with an impish smile, ``I'm not even sure I wanted to
be president when I was big _ until recently.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By the accounts of those who have observed Bush for more than
the last year, he has actually toned it down quite a bit _ cut down
on the goofy faces, diluted the acidic asides.
</P>
<P>
   He gives the impression of missing them. Standing outside the
Governor's Mansion in Austin last month, he pressed his
clownishness into the service of a commentary on the care he must
take not to be too spontaneous or relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush clamped his legs tight together, pressed his straightened
arms against his sides and stood with an exaggerated stiffness,
like a red-coated guard outside Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying nothing about anything,'' he squeezed out
through lips that he kept tightly and dramatically sealed.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush tries at times to temper his exuberance and spontaneity,
it may be because those qualities have been known to veer in
unflattering directions. In his days as as an adviser to his
father's presidential campaigns, he showed sparks of temper, and
even now, when he gets questions he deems unfair or untoward, his
jaw tightens and his voice gets a little squeaky.
</P>
<P>
   But more often, Bush seems to be having a ball, and why not? His
campaign treasury is ripe. His poll numbers are robust. And with
every wink, hug and bit of effortless banter, he projects a spirit
as mirthful as many voters would undoubtedly like their futures to
be.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After pulling me over at 1:30 a.m. on a recent
Thursday, Trooper Antone Wilson of the Massachusetts State Police
offered an enthusiastic, Bostonian ``How ah yah?'' followed by a
more pointed question: ``Is this car gas or electric?''
</P>
<P>
   The new-for-2000 Toyota Echo had caught the eye of Wilson as I
drove down Commonwealth Avenue. He had stopped me to discuss the
car's merits.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? Sure, police officers might flag down a
Plymouth Prowler for a closer look, but why would they even notice
an entry-level Toyota like this two-door Echo, a car that shares
subcompact status with nearly invisible appliances like the Hyundai
Accent and the Daewoo Lanos?
</P>
<P>
   Because the Echo stands out in the cluttered bargain basement of
the new-car market. The small Toyota is unusual in several ways,
but its unorthodox styling makes it impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably, the Echo makes a statement. But just what is it
saying?
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who appeared to be in his 30's, is a bit older than the
Echo's target market: 20-somethings like me and my friends. Toyota
expects the car to generate a buzz on campuses; to test this
premise, I, a 20-year-old Harvard University student, took the keys
for a week. I loaded an Echo with my friends and drove around
Boston, the higher-education capital of the world, seeking the
opinions of other students.
</P>
<P>
   Some liked it. Some didn't. But everybody _ and I mean everybody
_ had something to say about the Echo's design.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Amanda Gill, a Harvard junior from Atlanta, said
the car looked ``insectlike'' and ``buggish.'' Indeed, with its
stunted front end and awkwardly high roof, the Echo looks as if
someone had pushed it into a wall. Oddly enough, many spectators
found the quirky design charming.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Boyland, 19, a Boston native, called the car ``unapologetic
and fun'' _ a characteristic that may limit its appeal to
conservative car shoppers. ``No one will know what to make of
this,'' Boyland said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Chaffin, 21, an actor from Hammonton, N.J., was
flabbergasted, particularly by the pinched-looking front end. ``If
this car were a dog,'' he said, ``it would be a pug.''
</P>
<P>
   John D. Couriel, 21, from Miami who plans to attend law school,
was lukewarm, too, but gave the Echo a closer look when told of its
economic virtues.
</P>
<P>
   With a base price of $9,995 (plus a destination charge of $455),
territory usually reserved for somewhat unpolished Korean imports,
the Echo calls out to cost-conscious buyers. The car particularly
stands out because of the specificity with which Toyota has singled
out young consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Don Esmond, group vice president and general manager of the
Toyota Division, said the Echo was ``the first in a line of new
vehicles being developed by Toyota to appeal to the specific,
distinct demands of younger new-car buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The car is being heavily promoted on the World Wide Web, and the
percentage of its advertising budget that goes to network
television is unusually low _ just 30 percent, compared with 70
percent for other Toyota products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what, in particular, should put the Echo on the shopping
lists of students and other newly licensed drivers? Here are a few
compelling reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ Its price. At a range of $10,450 to $14,200, the car's low
cost of admission is its single defining characteristic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Its brand name. Toyota's sterling reputation for quality
should give the Echo an edge over low-priced rivals from the likes
of Kia, Daewoo, Hyundai and maybe even Chevrolet and Dodge. On the
quality front, only the Honda Civic _ and possibly, the Ford Focus,
though it's too soon to tell _ have as strong an image. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Its space. With a cabin that is exceptionally vertical, the
Echo is truly roomy for up to four people. With 39.9 inches of
headroom in front and 37.6 in the back, my 6-foot-2 frame fit
comfortably in every seat, a feat unequaled in two-door Cavaliers,
Civics, Saturns and Mitsubishi Mirages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Its performance. The Echo is solid in every way, easily
surpassing the low expectations raised by its price. The 16-valve
four-cylinder engine is small _ just 1.5 liters _ but it has a
sophisticated design unequaled at the price, with dual overhead
cams and variable valve timing for high efficiency and steady
delivery of power. It puts out a respectable 108 horsepower, and
with a five-speed manual transmission its pep should disappoint no
one shopping in this class. &QL;

 BOSTON: this class.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Its fuel economy. The mileage rating (34 city, 41 highway,
according to Environmental Protection Agency estimates) is among
the best for gasoline-powered cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Its ride and handling. The body is tight and very quiet, with
light, user-friendly steering. What the car may lack in world-class
manners _ its turning circle and suspension are adequate, at best _
it makes up for with its maneuverable size and enough zip to get
out of a jam.
</P>
<P>
   True, only a lapse in judgment would cause anyone to drive in
Boston, but the Echo was nimble enough to easily negotiate the
Hub's roads, which are straight out of the 17th century, and
compensate for its drivers, who are straight out of ``A Clockwork
Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Echo is certainly easier to parallel-park than those
sport-utility vehicles with which my generation is so preoccupied.
</P>
<P>
   The Echo makes another compelling case for itself from within,
with a cabin that is nearly as eccentric as the exterior design.
The interior has a clean, spartan feel. I don't know if the
minimalist interior design was determined by aesthetics or by
cost-cutting. (Is the center-mounted speedometer there for looks or
to reduce the expense of converting the car from right-hand drive?)
But the design works in a way that is appealing without feeling
bare.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is because the Echo makes substantial allowances
for a defining feature of my generation: our stuff. Toyota has
riddled the car with storage spaces, including large door pockets,
bins for tapes and CDs all around the audio system, dual cup
holders in front and back, and an especially neat clamshell
glovebox that opens in two parts to reveal two shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a $1,020 upgrade package on the model I tested _ with
options, the sticker price was $12,945 _ comforts like power
mirrors, windows and locks were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Small-car shoppers will, no doubt, stack the Echo up against the
Focus. Both represent new and unconventional efforts in a fairly
boring market; both are high and deceptively spacious inside, with
large windows that provide excellent visibility, and both ride and
drive better than the run of the small-car pack. The more expensive
Focus does have a slight performance edge, with its larger engine
and tighter handling, and it has more standard features _ some for
the young, like a CD player on the ZX3 and ZTS models, and some for
the grown-up, like a tachometer. Not only that, the Focus alone
offers side air bags for an extra $350.
</P>
<P>
   Although Toyota disappoints by offering only an AM-FM stereo on
the stripper model, buyers can toss in an extra $170 and get a
cassette deck and six quite decent speakers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Echo-Focus race is too close to call. But it is fair
to say that the Echo's ride and comfort are among the best in this
class. And the bottom line is that this is a solid car for a low
price. So the appeal of the Echo comes back to design, and a
subjective question: Does the look work for you?
</P>
<P>
   Young people here seemed willing to at least give the Echo a
chance. This would seem to be less a result of Toyota's explicit
marketing to them than of the price. Given the poverty levels of
most people my age, demand for the car will ultimately rest on its
value, which is considerable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it this way: I'm 20 years old, and my interest in the
Echo would be strictly economic. I wouldn't say the car looks or
feels particularly young, despite Toyota's concerted efforts to
present it as a car for the ``Net generation,'' and the company's
marketing reliance on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the styling of the Echo is unconventional for the
explicit purpose of appealing to a younger market. At some points,
Toyota goes a little over the top. One choice for exterior color is
Absolutely Red. As opposed to what? Somewhat Red?
</P>
<P>
   The opinions of friends and passersby confirm that although the
Echo is eye-catching, it's not necessarily hip. ``I've never seen a
car like that before,'' said David Joffe, 21, a Harvard student
from New York. ``And I hope I never do again.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Screwball or savvy? The Echo looks like a little
of both. &QL;

GOLDEN OLDIE

(DW) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At age 66 _ or a whispered 67 _ Clive Davis is a
music man who usually plays it by ear, sensing hits and nurturing
artists spanning from Janis Joplin and Barry Manilow to Whitney
Houston and Sarah McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   In all his decades running a record label, this was a gilded
year for him at Arista Records, with a 25th-anniversary television
special in the works, record profits of about $75 million and an
unlikely hit album, ``Supernatural,'' that brought the musical
resurrection of the '60s guitarist Carlos Santana.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis is also a man with an independent attitude and a
passion for the New York-based company he founded. That style has
drawn him into an epic Clash of the New Releases (and Leaks) with
Arista's corporate parents, BMG Entertainment and its German owner,
Bertelsmann, the world's third-largest media conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of the ``dean of damage control,'' the seasoned
public relations agent Howard J. Rubenstein, Davis' defiant
comments are fired in dramatic, well-timed bursts: ``With right on
one's side, the voice is eventually heard. Cheers for the reasoned
vigilantes in society who prevent those in power from overwhelming
the rights of the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   The underlying tensions reflect broader anxieties in the music
industry, which, as it is consolidated, is being transformed from a
freewheeling creative playground into a more businesslike
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   But that transformation is not always smooth, as the Arista
public- relations dispute demonstrates. In the Bertelsmann-BMG
camp, executives say that with Davis' contract expiring in June,
they decided to offer Davis a chairman's position and anoint a
younger successor, Antonio Reid, of LaFace Records. Despite his
age, they said, Davis resisted the notion of grooming a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Money was also a factor, they said, because Davis had signaled
that he expected a more lucrative contract because of his
successes. His previous five-year contract reportedly gave him as
much as $50 million over that period _ a figure that one BMG
employee with knowledge of the previous negotiations said was
actually understated.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' supporters, in turn, consider those arguments nothing
more than smoke and disco-ball mirrors. Money, they contend, never
even came up in negotiations, adding that Davis did have some
possible successors in mind, whom they did not identify. In their
view, Davis is being reined in by BMG's ambitious president,
Strauss Zelnick, 42, who wants to gain more control of the thriving
label.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this contretemps, Zelnick has to some extent been
portrayed as a bureaucratic corporate ``suit'' who lacks a musical
background. He holds degrees in business and law from Harvard
University and emerged from the movie industry, where he was
president and chief operating officer of 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But like Zelnick, the Brooklyn-born Davis also holds a law
degree from Harvard. He also had no formal musical training before
he got his start in the entertainment business as a lawyer whose
firm represented Columbia Records.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in the public relations clash, the two sides
cannot even agree on how old Davis is. His son Fred said Davis was
born on April 14, 1933, making him 66, but some BMG and Bertelsmann
executives say records indicate that he is really 67.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, neither Davis nor Zelnick is talking, although
they have both issued their share of public statements. Zelnick has
stressed his respect for Davis and the hope that he will remain at
Arista to ``continue building his legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   That could mean opportunities for Davis to stay on as chairman
of Arista or other options like starting a new media venture to
sell music over the Internet, according to both sides in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   At least partly with the support and encouragement of the Davis
camp, some artists in the Arista fold are trying to defend him,
giving the resulting flurry of news releases and performers'
statements an eerie populist ring.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney Houston and her lawyer have approached BMG officials and
Bertelsmann's chief executive, Thomas Middelhoff, to plead for
proper respect for Davis. Kenny G. has weighed in with concerned
conversations with BMG executives about Davis' future at Arista.
The rapper Q-Tip said he was considering countermoves, although he
would not specify what they might be.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that corporations are taking over a lot of the
decisions that were once made by individuals,'' said Barry Manilow,
one of the first artists signed by Davis 25 years ago. ``It may
make sense to them as a corporation, but when you have a talent
like Clive Davis, those rules should not apply. When you have
someone as brilliant as Clive, you push those corporate rules away
and you just let him do his thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carly Simon, who considers herself a friend of both Zelnick and
Davis, said she had been talking with other artists to develop a
strategy to lobby top executives at BMG and Bertelsmann. Two months
ago, she said, she signed another contract with Arista, after
considering other record companies, because she wanted to work with
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   He is perhaps the only music executive left, she said, who
actually sits in his office with his eyes closed listening to music
and making suggestions. Without Davis in charge, she said, it was
unlikely that she would have signed at Arista.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't fix something if it's not broken,'' she said. ``Not
only is it not broken, but it's one of the prides of the record
business. I feel so emotional about this. It feels like my home is
being destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There was bound to be a culture clash between Davis _ who some
colleagues in the industry fully expected would never retire on his
own accord _ and the corporate style of Bertelsmann, based in
Gutersloh, Germany, a privately held company with bylaws that
requires its chief executive and top board members to step down at
age 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought that Clive would die at his desk, because
Arista is his life,'' said Roy Lott, chief executive of Capitol
Records, who worked for Davis at Arista for almost 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Arista was on a big rebound, with revenue of $425
million and record profits. That success was a result in part of
the startling comeback of Santana, whose album ``Supernatural'' was
produced by Davis and topped Billboard's top 200 chart despite a
pop climate that ordinarily rewards youth.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was also a year in which Arista brought out a new album by
the Artist Formerly Known as Prince. The musician, who released his
music independently for several years, settled on Arista after
meeting with the heads of every major record label except Warner
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   While under contract with Warner, he considered the label such a
repressive regime that he painted the word ``slave'' on his face
until he was released from his contract. Last week Davis traveled
to Paris to promote the musician and his new album.
</P>
<P>
   Davis declined to talk about his situation when he returned to
New York this week. But in due course, his public relations agency
issued a news release describing the champagne reception given him
by Arista employees, a document that some wits on the other side of
the divide dubbed the ``Joan of Arc'' press announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He returned to his office today to be greeted like a hero by
every member of Arista management,'' the release stated, adding
that Davis ``indicated that he fully plans to run a major music and
entertainment company under any scenario, as the calls and very
attractive offers are flooding in.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, some of his supporters say, Davis could leave
Arista to start his own company with backing from investors. Within
Arista, other executives are saying privately that they would leave
or follow Davis.
</P>
<P>
   In recent statements, Davis made it clear that he wanted a role
in picking his successor, calling it ``gross disrespect'' that he
was not consulted before BMG decided on Reid. But BMG has also
hardened its resolve. A person with knowledge of the negotiations
said: ``I resist the notion that anyone who is an employee of a
company has the right to appoint a successor. Everyone understands
that after a certain age you have to think about succession.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Davis is scheduled to meet with Michael Dornemann,
the chairman of BMG Entertainment, to discuss ``the situation,''
the delicate shorthand for this business dispute. Middelhoff has
also signaled his willingness to meet with Davis.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   One ranking Bertelsmann executive insisted that the debate is
not about age but about the ``normal'' discussions that would take
place about a contract that is scheduled to end in June. He
observed rather ruefully that the current situation has evolved
into ``too much nervousness and a public overreaction.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   For Fred Davis, an entertainment lawyer involved in the
negotiations, the issue comes down to his father's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arista was the name of his high school honor society, and my
father has always treated Arista like his family and home,'' he
said. ``He wants to have the right to decide who will move into his
home.''

SCOTTISH BANK RAISES OFFER FOR NATWEST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Hoping to deter a rival offer, the Bank of Scotland PLC
increased its hostile bid for National Westminster Bank to $41.3
billion Friday as it tries to acquire an institution twice its size
to create Britain's second-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes amid speculation that the Bank of Scotland's
hometown rival in Edinburgh, the Royal Bank of Scotland, is also
preparing a bid for Natwest. The higher offer also puts pressure on
Natwest as it rushes to issue its final defense strategy within the
next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Scotland's new offer for Natwest is 13.5 percent
higher than its initial offer in late September of $36 billion. The
Bank of Scotland said it would offer 1.75 of its own shares and 190
pence in loan notes for each share of Natwest. It had originally
offered 1.6 of its own shares and 120 pence in loan notes. The Bank
of Scotland also pledged to pay a special dividend to shareholders
of up to 120 pence a share after it sells several Natwest units, if
the acquisition is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the Bank of Scotland ``realized they weren't going
to get it at that price,'' said Tom Rayner, an analyst at SG
Securities in London. ``Strategically, it was probably a good move
to try to spike the Royal Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Natwest immediately dismissed the new offer as too low and said
it did not answer how the Bank of Scotland would avoid potentially
large losses as it tries to integrate both banks' computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revised offer continues to undervalue Natwest, and it has
completely failed to address the risks,'' said Sir David Rowland,
chairman of Natwest. ``Shareholders should reject this revised
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The higher offer, which many analysts expected, happened Friday
just as the Royal Bank of Scotland announced a management
reshuffling that some analysts said indicated the Royal Bank would
be making a bid for Natwest. The Royal Bank's chairman, Lord
Younger, 68, who was opposed to a counterbid, according to
executives close to the company, will retire in January 2001. He
will be replaced by George Mathewson, 59, the current chief
executive, who is more likely to proceed with a bid, the executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Bank of Scotland fell 5.6 percent Friday to close
at 724 pence. Analysts said Friday's market action reflected a
concern that the new offer was too high and could dilute the
earnings of a combined company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market hasn't taken it well,'' Rayner said. ``The Royal
Bank of Scotland can actually trump their bid without the same
negative reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Natwest increased 3.2 percent, to 1,518 pence, and are
up a total of 45 percent since Bank of Scotland made its original
offer on Sept. 24. Shares of Royal Bank dropped 1 percent, to
1,328.
</P>
<P>
   According to Britain's Takeover Panel, the Royal Bank of
Scotland can make a competing offer until Dec. 8, though the panel
is still weighing whether a bid by the Royal Bank would need to be
referred to the Competition Committee. The panel will make a ruling
on that issue by Dec. 6. On Thursday, the panel said that the Bank
of Scotland's bid would not be referred to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the Royal Bank of Scotland said it was still
mulling a competing bid. The company will most likely wait until
after Dec. 6 to proceed with an offer, the executives said. Waiting
in the wings has been part of the Royal Bank strategy, the
executives said, because that has allowed it to have a clear view
of what it is competing against and to devise a compelling
competing offer.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burt, chief executive of the Bank of Scotland, said Friday
that its offer could be raised if a bidding war ensued, but that he
would not offer any more shares, explaining that he ``reserves the
right to increase other elements'' of the offer.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28)  
 (af)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When there is money to be made, memories can be especially short
on Wall Street. But that is not true this year when it comes to
emerging-markets debt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a rally that has pushed up the total return for J.P.
Morgan's emerging-markets debt index to 20.8 percent this year,
major players have been dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   Their unwillingness to buy the bonds of countries from Brazil to
Poland is evident in the trading volume data gathered by the
Emerging Markets Traders Association. Through the third quarter of
this year, the volume was $1.69 trillion, down 53.6 percent from
the corresponding period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At that pace, the 1999 volume will be the lowest since the $1.98
trillion of 1993 and about one-third that of the peak year, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo C. Porzecanski, chief economist for the Americas at ING
Barings, said two important types of investors were fleeing:
so-called crossover buyers, including pension funds, insurers and
big global mutual funds, which put small percentages of their big
pools of money into emerging-markets debt; and hedge funds, which
had been big speculators, especially in Russian debt.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Murno, research director for the Emerging Markets
Traders Association, said many investors ``have been burned by
Asia, Russia, Brazil and Ecuador,'' referring to the Asian
financial crisis, Russia's debt default, Brazil's currency
devaluation and Ecuador's first-ever default on Brady bonds, which
had been the emerging-markets debt of preference for years.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors have been as wary as the big players.
Outflows from emerging-markets bond funds were $251 million this
year through Nov. 23, according to AMG Data Services, compared with
inflows of $523 million for all of 1998 _ a year when the
emerging-markets bond index dropped 14.4 percent _ and $510 million
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The pain has been so severe that Porzecanski and Joyce Chang,
global head of international fixed-income research at Chase
Securities, think that traders' approach to this market is
changing.
</P>
<P>
   The easy sell for emerging-markets debt _ arguing that yields
are great, that the countries are restructuring economically and
that the International Monetary Fund is behind them _ no longer
seems to work. As one fund manager put it, he has to change the
slides he presents at his road shows to attract new investors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chang said, ``The broad-based approach to emerging markets
has not worked,'' and investors are not jumping into emerging
markets just because they see that the bonds are doing well.
Instead, she said, they compare the performance of those bonds with
that of other fixed-income markets.
</P>
<P>
   She said she saw this approach recently as some pension funds,
insurers and big mutual funds left the junk-bond market and began
to inch back into emerging-markets bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Porzecanski said the trading data showed a rising aversion to
risk. That fear indicates that investors will favor the
higher-rated credits, including South Korean and Polish bonds,
which are rated triple B and at the bottom of the investment grade
category, and those at the top of the junk-bond ladder, including
the double-B bonds of Mexico and Colombia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lower-rated, single-B bonds of Brazil and Venezuela will be
less attractive, he said, while countries like Ecuador will have
major problems attracting investors.
</P>
<P>
   Porzecanski attributed some of the pickiness to what he called
the push by the United States and its allies for ``burden sharing''
_ the notion that private investors should suffer losses when a
country has economic problems. He and other analysts argue that in
deference to that idea, Ecuador was encouraged to default on its
Brady bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get new money trickling into this market, it may not be
enough to lift all boats,'' he said. And that is why the single-B
countries, he added, ``are going to have to explain to investors
why they are not an Ecuador or Russia.''

 &HT;    In Georgia, Bulldogs and Yellow Jackets square off to prove many
points
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This summer, the football teams at Georgia and Georgia
Tech were convinced that at least a BCS bowl would be on the line
when they met on the Saturday after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, both schools were touting their quarterbacks for the
Heisman Trophy and figured this game would give one of them a
chance to nail down college football's most prestigious award.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the teams are 7-3 as they enter today's game at Bobby
Dodd Stadium (1 p.m., ABC) needing a win to salvage their seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton has had a brilliant senior
campaign (2,719 yards passing for 25 touchdowns) but appears
destined to finish second behind Wisconsin's Ron Dayne for the
Heisman. Georgia's Quincy Carter has been good, but was never able
to generate any momentum for the award.
</P>
<P>
   So, inquiring minds want to know: Given the disappointment of
the seasons at Tech and Georgia, is playing the state rival still
enough to excite them? What a silly question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?'' Georgia Tech linebacker Ross Mitchell
said. ``We've got guys who are banged up who are going to play in
this game no matter what. Even if we were going to the Orange Bowl,
it wouldn't matter. They would rather miss the bowl game than miss
playing against Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood is Athens is no less focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what happened last year (Tech's 21-19 win in Athens), we
had to listen to them talk,'' said Georgia linebacker Boss Bailey.
``I didn't like the way it felt then. I don't want to feel that way
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of the past two games have set the intensity meter
on a high level for today's 92nd game in the series. Two years ago,
Tech led and had a chance to snap Georgia's seven-game winning
streak inside the final minute. But the Bulldogs drove 65 yards and
scored with eight seconds left to win 27-24.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Athens, Georgia led 19-7 only to watch Tech rally
and win on Brad Chambers' 32-yard field goal with two seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   So while there is no championship or Heisman Trophy on the line,
the stakes are pretty clear.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia wants to prove to Tech that last year's win was an
aberration.
</P>
<P>
   Tech wants Georgia to know that after struggling for most of the
1990s, the Yellow Jackets are back and in their face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of guys think last year was a fluke,'' said
Georgia Tech cornerback Travares Tillman. ``It wasn't but it's up
to us to prove that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech also knows that a win will bring a return bid to the Gator
Bowl. It isn't a BCS bowl but it is played on New Year's Day, which
still means something.
</P>
<P>
   For Georgia, a victory keeps the Bulldogs' hopes alive for an
Outback Bowl slot. It also gives Georgia a chance for its third
straight season with nine or more wins, which the school has not
done since 1981-83.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said Georgia defensive end Dustin Luckie, ``This is my
last Tech-Georgia game. This is the one I'll always remember. I do
not want to remember losing to those guys again.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   RYE, N.H. _ Nona Philbrick, an 85-year-old retired
schoolteacher, could not bring herself at first to open the local
tax bill that was in her roadside mailbox Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to look at it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she finally did, she winced. A widow living on her school
pension and Social Security, Mrs. Philbrick found that she owed
nearly $900 more than last year's $2,400 bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked, I'm really shocked,'' she said. ``I'm shocked
thinking of everyone around.''
</P>
<P>
   So how did she feel about the audacious plan by the three
selectman who run Rye to withhold the town's payments to the state
while they challenge its new property tax law in court?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great idea,'' she declared. She is not a
lawyer, Mrs. Philbrick added; she does not know if it is illegal.
But she told Joe Mills, who was her mailman before he retired and
is now one of the insurrectionist selectmen, that if he is
arrested, ``I'll bail you out!''
</P>
<P>
   In Rye and in a handful of other seacoast communities, a tax
revolt is brewing in this state, which has a tax-hating history
that stretches back to before the Revolution, when New Hampshire
was known as a tax haven for smugglers and poachers trying to avoid
paying Great Britain its decreed due. These days it is purely
homegrown taxes that are causing the ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, New Hampshire lawmakers passed a new
statewide property tax meant to satisfy a 1997 state supreme court
ruling that the state's longtime practice of financing education
almost entirely through local taxes, with different rates in
different towns, was unfair and unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In the remedy that the legislature fashioned after months and
months of tax agony, the effort to equalize tax payments for
education meant that while residents in 80 percent of New
Hampshire's cities and towns would see their property taxes remain
the same or drop, residents in about 20 percent would end up facing
higher property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   So now New Hampshire is wading into the same turbulent
town-to-town redistribution that has so riled some residents of
neighboring Vermont over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont faced a similar court decision and enacted a somewhat
similar tax plan, and ugly social consequences ensued:
Property-rich towns became known as ``gold towns,'' and resentment
grew between the residents of such towns facing higher tax bills
and the residents of property-poor towns, whose unsympathetic
response sometimes amounted to a virtual ``nyaah, nyaah.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in New Hampshire the talk now is of ``donor towns''
that pay more under the new system, and ``receiver towns'' that
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But in New Hampshire, as might be expected in a state whose
fierce motto, ``Live free or die,'' is displayed on its license
plates, it looks likely that there will be more than talk. And the
talk is already fierce, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Rye, Melvin Low, a retired banker who is the chairman of
the Board of Selectmen, voted with his colleagues two weeks ago to
just say no. They have put officials in Concord, the state capital,
on notice that while they will collect all the state-set education
taxes from the town's residents, who must pay their bills by
Christmas, they do not intend to remit the money, about $2.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they intend to file a lawsuit challenging the new
system. And while the outcome is pending, they plan to ask the
court to hold the money in escrow. The towns are supposed to pay
the state the tax money by March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Similar plans are under way in the city of Portsmouth and in
Hampton Falls, Newington and several other towns, Low said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Evelyn Sirrell of Portsmouth said more than two dozen
towns ``have come in with us to take this to court,'' and ``we are
going to ask the court system to escrow the funds that we were
supposed to send to Concord.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they refuse us, we will just automatically escrow them
ourselves,'' Sirrell continued. ``Because we're mad. We're mad
because everyone thinks these seacoast towns are wealthy, and
Portsmouth is far from wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to come down and take us all away, that's just
fine, they can go right ahead,'' the mayor added. ``Because it's
not right, and this is not what the state constitution says.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeanne Shaheen and her administration do not sound as if
they are exactly shaking in their winter boots and running to
reconcile with the rebels. The governor, said her press secretary,
Pamela Walsh, ``believes this plan meets our shared responsibility
to make sure every child in New Hampshire has an opportunity for a
good education no matter where that child lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither do they sound as if they will let the tax revolt
slide.
</P>
<P>
   In a public letter dated on Wednesday, the state attorney
general, Philip T. McLaughlin, wrote that unhappy people in the 20
percent of communities where taxes will go up ``have a right to
criticize and complain about the new law.'' But he added, ``What
they don't have is the right to break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to warn ``local officials who say they will violate
the law'' to ``think again, consider the oath you took to obey the
laws of New Hampshire and the consequences of your actions, both in
the short and long term.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has no desire to go to court to compel local
officials to comply with the law,'' he continued. ``That should not
be required in a society governed by the rule of law. If, however,
local officials insist they do not have to comply with the law, the
state will act.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Low and Mills said they did not believe that they could be
arrested or personally fined, but that state officials had said
they could be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Mills did not sound cowed. ``All the calls I'm getting say,
`Hey, they take you, they've got to take me too, because I'm
standing in front of you,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Low sound cowed. ``We're protesting it,'' he said. ``We
say it's an unfair tax because it's got nothing to do with the
ability to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The property tax law does allow a ``hardship'' reprieve for the
poor, but it is so narrow that Mrs. Philbrick, for example, said
she could not qualify. Neither could Rye's representative in the
state legislature, Jane Langley, who discovered on Friday morning's
tax bill that she owed $1,259 more than last year, for a total of
$4,549, on a two-bedroom house valued at $272,000. New Hampshire's
property taxes are among the highest in the nation, mainly because
the state has no income or sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   She can draw on an annuity, Ms. Langley said, ``but I represent
a whole lot of people who don't have that luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, she added, ``Twenty percent of the people in this
state are ticked off.''

<P>
   For Internet investors, early-stage investment is the holy
grail. The goal is to buy into emerging companies that are poised
for runaway growth because of promising business plans or
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Few retail investors can get access to companies at that stage,
and even procuring shares of initial public offerings can be all
but impossible. But an alternative is evolving: the publicly traded
incubator company.
</P>
<P>
   Such businesses, the best known of which are CMGI Inc. of
Andover, Mass.; the Softbank Corp. of Tokyo; and the Internet
Capital Group of Wayne, Pa., offer the enticing growth potential
and some of the risk of early-stage investing, along with the
benefits of diversification.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new and very compelling business model, because what
these incubators are offering is something between a corporate
parent and a V.C. firm,'' said Henry Blodget, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch, referring to venture capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McNamee of Integral Capital Partners, which invests in
technology companies, added: ``They have been a great way to
turbocharge any portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, Softbank and Internet Capital buy positions in
Internet-related businesses, typically exerting varying degrees of
management control while developing partnerships and synergies
among the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The incubators offer investors broad exposure to the Internet.
While some of their investments are in public companies, many are
still private, which means that the incubator stands to benefit if
an IPO goes well.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the incubator business model has rewarded
shareholders lavishly, with CMGI and Softbank returning 450.7
percent and 1,023.5 percent, respectively, through Friday, versus
142.5 percent for TheStreet.com Net index. Internet Capital, which
went public on Aug. 5 at $12 a share, closed on Friday at $169.125.
</P>
<P>
   Valuing the stocks is tricky, since earnings are not
particularly meaningful and many of the holdings are private:
analysts tote up the estimated value of their holdings and ask
whether the stocks deserve a higher price. The answer almost always
seems to be yes, and the market has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the big three incubator companies has its own twist on
the business.
</P>
<P>
   Under David S. Wetherell, its chief executive, CMGI has long
been considered a blue chip. CMGI's portfolio has majority and
minority stakes in more than 50 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Benyola, a research associate at Raymond James Financial, a
brokerage firm, estimated that 10 to 15 of CMGI's companies would
go public over the next 12 months. One likely winner is Alta Vista,
the search engine company in which CMGI holds an 83 percent stake;
Benyola expects it to go public by the end of March at a price that
would put its value between $5 billion and $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Leigh, vice president at Raymond James, said that despite
its run-up, he thought CMGI was reasonably priced. ``It has always
looked like CMGI is overvalued, but when these companies engage in
IPOs, then everything seems to fall in place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, CMGI announced a new fund for investing in
business-to-business Internet start-ups, and its stock climbed 17.4
percent for the week, to $146.625. Raymond James's 12-month target
price on CMGI is $159.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Capital has always focused on business-to-business
e-commerce investments since its founding in 1996. Its companies
are mostly in far earlier stages of development than CMGI's: just 3
of the 40 or so in which it is invested are public, making it
riskier than CMGI.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Forrester Research in Boston expects business-to-business
e-commerce to grow from $43 billion in 1998 to $1.3 trillion in
2003, versus just $108 billion in e-commerce directed at consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our top pick,'' said Eric B. Upin, an analyst at
BancBoston Robertson Stephens referring to Internet Capital. He
declined to give a price target, but said ``there's a huge
upside.''
</P>
<P>
   Softbank, once primarily a computer distributor, has stakes in
more than 100 companies worldwide and plans to expand that number
to 780 in five years. It uses its global network to turn its United
States holdings into foreign businesses. Typically, it takes a
United States company's business model and clones it in a foreign
market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it leveraged its 31 percent stake in Yahoo by
starting Yahoo Japan, which began trading separately in 1997 and is
now that country's No. 1 portal.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank also has stakes in Buy.com, InterTrust and E-Loan,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Wanger, whose Acorn Fund held 235,000 Softbank shares as
of June 30, said, ``Anyone who is going to study the company will
conclude that Softbank is the premier growth company in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Juliette Chow, an analyst for Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong, said
the stock, which closed on Friday at 76,400 yen, should hit 100,000
yen in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some newer incubators are likely to go public soon. Analysts say
two examples are Idealab of Pasadena, Calif., and Divine
interVentures of Chicago; officials of both companies were not
available for comment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the current incubators, a cooling Internet sector could
punish them severely. ``They are really leverage plays on the
market for Internet stocks,'' McNamee said. ``If that market goes
down, these will get pounded all the way down.''

RWANDA TRIBUNAL DELAYS SUSPECT'S RELEASE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ A judicial appeals panel agreed Friday to a
one-week stay of its decision to release a leading suspect in the
1994 genocide in Rwanda in which half a million or more ethnic
Tutsi died.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's decision early this month to release the suspect,
Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, outraged the Rwandan government to the
point that it said it would stop cooperating with the war crimes
tribunal investigating the genocide. Rwanda then denied a visa to
the war crimes prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, who had planned a visit
to Rwanda, her first, this week.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision allows seven days for the appeals panel to
decide on a request by Mrs. Del Ponte that it review its decision
to release Barayagwiza. She has yet to disclose the legal reasons
for challenging the decision except to say that she had new facts.
She must file her brief by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased the appeals court is recognizing the importance
of this case and of our ability to make such a request,'' said Paul
Risley, a spokesman for the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Zephyr Mutanguha, the Rwandan representative to the tribunal,
which is based in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, called the
stay a ``welcome development.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that this should actually be followed by the case
being revisited completely,'' he said. ``We feel he is not a common
criminal. He is a special criminal. We pray that he does not get
released.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, the appeals court of the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda dismissed the case against Barayagwiza, saying
his rights had been violated because he was held in jail too long
without trial. It ordered him returned to Cameroon, where he was
arrested in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan government calls Barayagwiza, 49, a ``chief
architect'' of the campaign by extremists from the Hutu ethnic
group to eliminate the Tutsi minority from Rwanda in 1994. He was
the spokesman for the foreign minister and helped found Radio
Television Libre des Milles Collines, a radio station that preached
hatred against Tutsis at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being denied a visa to Rwanda, Mrs. Del Ponte _ also the
prosecutor for the war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia _
traveled to Arusha on Tuesday. At the start of what was planned to
be a two-week trip, she met with her prosecutors, judges and court
registrar, still hoping that the Rwandan government would relent
and grant her visa, Risley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is her assumption that she may cut her trip short in the
event that she has to,'' he said. ``But she remains hopeful that
this can be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Risley noted that this is the first time that the appeals judges
_ either in the Rwanda or Yugoslav tribunals _ have agreed to
reconsider one of their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fairly unique circumstances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Mrs. Del Ponte's request, the panel said it would
consider three other matters concerning Barayagwiza, including a
request by Rwanda that he be tried for genocide under Rwandan law.
That request was unusual because the Rwandan government promised
that Barayagwiza, if found guilty, would not face the death
penalty, which is normally the highest punishment for his suspected
crimes there. The tribunal can impose life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The other two requests came from Barayagwiza, who is still
jailed in Arusha: He first contested the judge's decision to send
him to Cameroon, then filed another motion to cancel that request.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal holds 38 prisoners charged with genocide but has
tried only five in the last five years.

   Envoys of the five major powers at the United Nations ended
several weeks of talks Friday without agreeing on how to restart
arms inspections in Iraq, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions will now go back to foreign ministers to resolve
differences, while the Russians prepare to discuss the issue with
the Iraqis next week. Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister and
the government official responsible for dealing with the United
Nations, is expected to arrive in Moscow early in the week for
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is now more isolated than it has been for months in the
Security Council, and while the Russians remain President Saddam
Hussein's strongest supporters, they are now actively engaged,
other diplomats say, in trying to find an agreement that would send
back arms inspectors despite Iraq's repeated demands that the
system be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Russians now differ from the Americans, British and
French is that Moscow wants to reduce the time it would take to
consider suspending sanctions, assuming Iraqi compliance, and
lengthen the time that suspensions would last. As for the Chinese,
their position is something of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Western nations have set up a timetable that could prolong the
entire process of restoring inspections and dropping the sanctions
by months, even if everything goes well. The Russians would also
like to curb the independence of a new disarmament commission being
proposed to monitor Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But all sides now agree that if a resolution is adopted in
coming weeks, Iraq will be free to sell as much oil as it wants as
the process of setting up a new inspection system begins. Financial
oversight and import controls would police where the money was
going under the resolution now being discussed. Iraq must be
independently certified to have no more prohibited weapons or the
means to make them before sanctions can be finally removed rather
than suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has now in effect linked the arms policy
with the next phase of the ``oil for food'' program, under which
Iraq is allowed to sell oil to buy food, medicine and an expanding
range of goods for urban public services and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   After the Council split over whether to enhance the program
earlier this month, it was extended for only two weeks instead of
the normal six months, prompting Iraq to stop exporting oil in
protest as contracts expired. U.N. officials said Friday that Iraq
had resumed pumping oil to fill depleted tanks, apparently in
preparation for resuming exports.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week extension runs out on Dec. 3, when the council will
again have to decide whether to extend it for six months, or
continue voting for short-term extensions while the arms inspection
policy is in crucial weeks of debate. If the council agrees on a
broad inspection plan leading to a possible suspension of sanctions
and an immediate end of controlled oil exports, there would no
longer be a need for the oil-sales program.
</P>
<P>
   If divisions in the council between Western nations and Russia
continue, some diplomats say, the American and British delegations
could force a vote, leaving the Russians with the choice of giving
ground to settle differences or casting a public veto. The United
States does not want the issue to languish inconclusively.

   MOSCOW _ After pummeling Chechnya's capital in an all-night
fusillade, Russian military commanders said Friday that their
troops would begin pursuing guerrilla forces directly into their
mountain hideouts.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far in the three-month war, government forces have fought
the rebels largely by bombarding them with rockets and shells. The
strategy has kept Russian casualties low, but has raised an
international outcry over the toll in civilian deaths and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesmen said their newest ploy would be to send
soldiers into the mountainous southern part of Chechnya to find
rebel strongholds and arms caches. Russia has repeatedly complained
that the Islamic militants are being resupplied from the south,
particularly though Chechnya's border with Georgia, and officials
charged Friday that a rebel hospital and communications center were
operating in Georgia near the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, a senior Russian officer said the forays into the
mountains could be completed by the end of the year, solidifying
Russian control over most of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny, the capital, so far remains a main exception to the
Russian advance. The Russians took heavy losses in 1996 by trying
to storm into the capital against well-placed guerrilla
sharpshooters. This time, the infantry has stayed outside the city,
leaving jets and artillery to carry on the bulk of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry said Friday that airplanes and cannons hit
Grozny and some 17 surrounding villages. The attack was said to be
the fiercest of the war and Reuters quoted one person leaving the
city Friday as saying that civilian casualties were high.
</P>
<P>
   After the dusk-to-dawn pounding, which left parts of the capital
in flames, hundreds of civilian refugees waving white flags
streamed out of town. The Russian military has repeatedly told
civilians to leave Grozny, which was all but leveled in the first
Chechen war, from 1994 to 1996, and has been bombed almost daily of
late.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are right to hold white flags,'' one Russian lieutenant,
an artilleryman identified only as Alexander, told Reuters Friday.
``If they didn't, they'd be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials have been relentlessly upbeat about
the the war, which they call an anti-terrorist action, and Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin has emphasized that there will be no peace
until the rebels have been basically wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's politicians have generally stuck to that line. A poll
released Friday by the Public Opinion Foundation indicated that
two-thirds of Russians support the war, with 55 per cent opposing
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow's outspoken mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, struck a sour note
Friday in Helsinki, Finland, where he warned that guerrilla attacks
against the military and other targets could easily continue for
years, even if Russian troops managed to seize control of all
Chechen territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troops could liberate Chechnya by the end of the year but by
no means will this solve the Chechen problem,'' he said at a news
conference. ``We have seen examples of other partisan wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement of a new tack in the Russian military
strategy followed a cabinet meeting on Sunday in which President
Boris Yeltsin and other officials reviewed operations in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, 68, went to a hospital after that session, complaining
of hoarseness, and was said to have a viral bronchial infection of
the sort that has repeatedly kept him away from the Kremlin and has
occasionally forced his hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   But aides said he had pursued a regimen of milk, honey and mild
medication and was feeling better. They did not indicate when he
might return to work.

   BEIJING _ Rescue workers said Friday that it was unlikely that
they would find any more survivors from a ferry carrying more than
300 people that burned and sank Wednesday night in rough, icy
waters near Yantai, in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday night, only 22 people from the boat were confirmed
as survivors, 118 were reported dead and the rest were missing,
according to the official New China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of passengers and crew members had been widely
reported as 312, and some official sources put it as high as 336,
but Friday's report from the news agency said the boat carried 262
passengers and 40 crew members, for a total of 302.
</P>
<P>
   Snowstorms, freezing temperatures, stiff winds and raging waves
continued to hamper rescue efforts as two helicopters, 10 ships and
thousands of soldiers and civilians along shore joined in the
search for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry was attempting to travel a busy commercial route from
Yantai to Dalian, 100 miles to the north. All the people aboard
were believed to be Chinese except for one Korean woman, who worked
in a garment factory near Yantai.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry started out from Yantai in rough seas at 1 p.m. on
Wednesday. According to differing official accounts, it soon turned
back either because of the weather conditions or because a fire had
broken out on a lower deck. At 4:30 p.m. it put out a distress
call, reporting a fire on board.
</P>
<P>
   Ships attempting to aid the ferry were unable to approach it
because of the extreme winds and 16-foot waves. Fire eventually
engulfed the ship and at 11:50 p.m., the New China News Agency
reported, it sank _ by various news accounts either a mile and a
half from shore or seven miles from an off-shore island.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the passengers tried to escape in lifeboats but these
were soon swamped. One man reportedly swam safely to shore. Many
jumped into the frigid sea wearing life vests and some were picked
up by other ships, but most drowned or died of exposure and dozens
of corpses in life vests reportedly washed up near Yantai.
</P>
<P>
   The State Council, the cabinet, will conduct an inquiry into the
causes of the accident, state news media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The company that operated the ship, Yanda Ferry Co., was shut
down Friday by the government pending safety improvements. In
October another ferry run by the company burned and sank near
Dalian, but that time all but two people were rescued.

<P>
   ASSISI, Italy _ Seconds after the earthquake of September 1997
rocked large parts of central Italy, the Rev. Vincenzo Fortunato
surveyed the nave of the upper church of the Basilica of St.
Francis in Assisi. The ground around him was strewn with chunks of
its vaulted ceiling and its frescoes attributed to Giotto and
Cimabue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid the entire ceiling had collapsed, there was so
much dust everywhere,'' he recalled. ``I thought things were a lot
worse, that it was all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that morning brought on a remarkable restoration, one
that used new construction techniques and materials and unearthed
secrets behind the basilica's more-than-700-year-old masterpieces.
The upper church is set to reopen on Sunday in a subdued ceremony,
even as the aftereffects of the quake continue to reverberate
through the Umbria and the Marches, where more than 10,000 people
are still living in temporary metal container homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for nothing that it's been called the construction
site of Utopia,'' said Fortunato, who was in the basilica with four
people who perished when the vaulted ceiling collapsed. At first no
one believed the basilica would be ready for the Roman Catholic
celebrations of the year 2000, when nearly 30 million tourists are
expected to visit Italy, with Assisi an important destination for
many.
</P>
<P>
   Architects, restorers, engineers, skilled laborers and
volunteers have been working around the clock for 26 months _ for a
total of about 40,000 individual working days _ on the project,
which has cost about $39 million.
</P>
<P>
   Structurally, the basilica, an early Renaissance jewel, is
probably in better shape today than it has been in nearly 700
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the vault of the nave still bares broad swatches of dull
beige that delineate sections that collapsed. Originally restorers
thought they would project a photographic image of the original
frescoes onto the bare plaster of the vault, but that plan was
abandoned. Two frescoes of St. Rufino and St. Vittorino, attributed
to Giotto, were returned to their positions on the entrance arch
this month. Their isolation increases the sensation that they are
floating in a sea of emptiness, solitary and sad.
</P>
<P>
   The two saints, composed of about 3,000 fragments, were manually
reconstructed. Restorers, however, located only about 80 percent of
the fragments. ``Yes, the clear signs of destruction are still
visible in the figures of these saints,'' said Giovanna Melandri,
the Italian culture minister. ``We wanted to put them up as a
symbol of a wound we want to heal but cannot forget.''
</P>
<P>
   All together, about 2,000 square feet of frescoes were destroyed
in the ceilings of the first, fourth and fifth bays of the vault,
or about a quarter of each bay.
</P>
<P>
   The church was begun after St. Francis died in 1226. The first
part to be built was the squat lower church in a northern Italian
Romanesque style. The upper church, built in a Gothic style, was
completed in 1236. The friars who oversaw construction viewed the
lower church, where St. Francis is buried, as a place of prayer and
meditation, whereas the upper church, brighter and more open, was a
place of exultation.
</P>
<P>
   The repairs to the basilica have mostly been structural,
including safeguarding it against future quakes, and cleaning the
13th- and 14th-century frescoes that cover nearly every inch of the
walls. Some repairs were straightforward, like securing the top of
the Romanesque bell tower and filling enormous cracks in the walls
of the cloister of Sixtus IV. During the work on the cloister,
restorers were surprised to uncover a fountain under its floor,
directly behind the apse of the church.
</P>
<P>
   For more delicate restorations, innovative techniques were used
for the first time. Probably the most precarious involved the
safeguarding of the badly damaged tympanum near the ceiling of the
left transept, which was in danger of falling. The partly rebuilt
structure was finally affixed to the roof with wires made of a
special material known as shape-memory alloy, which not only
reinforced it but also absorbs the force of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   The vaulted ceiling of the basilica required the most work.
After more than a thousand tons of debris was removed from under
the roof (the weight may have contributed to the collapse) the
fallen sections of the vault and the supporting entrance arch were
rebuilt using as many of the original bricks as possible.
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce and consolidate the vault, a giant rib cage made of
thin strips of flexible wood covered with a composite made of
aramidic fibers, the material used in bulletproof jackets, was
glued to the back of the Gothic arches and ribs that crisscross the
basilica's interior. The structure, both flexible and light, is
five times as strong as steel based on its weight. The vaults were
also attached to the roof with cables. Finally, many miles of
cracks in the vaults were filled with a nonsaline mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio Croci, the engineer who masterminded the structural
restoration of the basilica, is proud of the results. ``This was a
unique and exceptional project,'' he said. ``It gave us the chance
to experiment with a series of innovative measures that now can be
used in other situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Some work remains to be done. Repairs to the convent attached to
the basilica, most notably the refectory and the friars' cells, are
still under way, and the interior of the basilica also needs to be
completed. The remaining six saints of the entrance arch are to be
recomposed by Easter, but it is unlikely that they will join St.
Rufino and St. Vittorino until after 2000 because church officials
do not want the interior marred by bulky scaffolding. The vault
section at the entry of the church with the figure of St. Jerome,
also attributed to Giotto, will be put into place at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The two other vault sections, Cimabue's St. Matthew and a
section of starry sky _ about 120,000 pieces _ could be restored by
2001. Each fragment of these vaults has been photographed and the
engineering department of the University of Rome is completing a
computer program that will show restorers how each of the pieces
fits into the whole.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction and cleaning of the 50,000 square feet of
frescoes in the upper church shed new light on how some of the
artists worked. For example, restorers found that the artist known
only as the foreign master used oil paints in the frescoes of six
apostles in the right transept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previously it had been thought that the first artists to use
oil paints in wall decorations were British artists working in the
mid-14th century,'' explained Giuseppe Basile of the Central
Restoration Institute, ``but now we know that this was happening in
1270 in the Basilica of St. Francis, 100 years earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Basile explained that this discovery proved that Assisi was a
revolutionary workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that Assisi was not only the birthplace of painting
from a formal point of view,'' he said, ``it was also the
birthplace of modern art, with painters working in every known wall
painting technique.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains intact is the knowledge that the Basilica of St.
Francis attracted the greatest artists of the 13th and 14th
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Paola Passalaqua, who is responsible for the laboratory where
the reconstruction of the fresco fragments has been taking place,
says that she was amazed by the quality. ``The fragments were
preserved perfectly,'' she marveled. ``Notwithstanding what they
had gone through, they remained legible. It attests to the high
quality of the painters who worked in Assisi.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Getting advice for turning around the Rite Aid
Corp. was a top priority for its new chairman, Leonard I. Green,
when he recently called Kenneth Moelis, chief of corporate finance
at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. But so was talking about how
Moelis' three children spent most of a Los Angeles Lakers game at
the Staples Center watching TV in Green's box.
</P>
<P>
   With Green's unrushed, unruffled manner, ``you would never guess
that the man is in the middle of a very critical moment in Rite
Aid's future,'' Moelis said.
</P>
<P>
   If Green, who stepped in as chairman two weeks ago, is at all
stressed to discover that his investment firm sank $300 million
into a company whose accounting the Securities and Exchange
Commission is now investigating, he doesn't show it. People who
have talked with him in recent weeks say he is wearing the same
poker face as always _ calmly interviewing candidates for chief
executive and chief financial officer amid the SEC investigation
and the resignation of Rite Aid's auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is because Green, 66, a specialist in buying out
retailers, has faced corporate storms before. When his investment
fund bought the Thrifty drugstore chain in 1992 for $37.5 million,
it was losing about $2 million a week. Four years later, after the
acquisition of Payless Drug and a public offering, Green sold
Thrifty Payless to Rite Aid _ in which he then had no investment _
for $2.3 billion, at a more than $460 million profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought Thrifty was not fixable and that
Leonard had made a big mistake,'' Moelis said. ``I never saw him
blink.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a contrarian pattern Green has pursued throughout his
career _ one that illuminates why he's betting on Rite-Aid, the
worst-performing stock in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 this year, down
85 percent. Green has amassed a fortune by investing in just those
kinds of distressed companies, including a Long Island vitamin
concern and an Australian gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, his firm, Leonard Green &AMP; Partners, has cited
annualized returns of more than 80 percent between 1990 and 1998
for investors like the California Public Employees' Retirement
System, known as Calpers, and Wells Fargo. The firm says no figures
are available for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid, the nation's third-largest drugstore chain, based in
Camp Hill, Pa., could prove to be Green's greatest challenge. It
faces a credibility crisis after announcing, when Green had been
chairman for only three days, that it expected to lower its
reported earnings before taxes by $500 million for the last three
years. Green now must quickly find ways to reduce heavy debts, deal
with investor lawsuits and keep his pledge to find new top
executives by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``His success will be determined on the basis of what happens in
coming weeks,'' said John Ransom, an analyst with Raymond James
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The company says Green, who owns preferred shares representing
9.7 percent of the company and controls 2 of 11 board seats,
intends not to remain chairman after new management is in place,
though he will stay on the board.
</P>
<P>
   People who know Green describe him as an intensely private man
who makes final decisions alone and almost never second-guesses
himself. In a city of celebrities, he is practically unknown to
most Los Angelenos, operating from a West Los Angeles office
splashed with contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Soft-spoken and unimposing, he still can be biting in his
criticism and impatient with poorly prepared presentations,
according to people who have worked with him. He and Richard
Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles, did not speak for several years
after Green said the mayor did not provide enough incentives for
Thrifty to stay in Los Angeles following its acquisition of
Payless. (Thrifty Payless moved to Oregon.)
</P>
<P>
   Green declined to be interviewed, saying through a spokesman
that he was preoccupied with company business.
</P>
<P>
   Green saw the retail business up close during his childhood in
New Jersey; his father traveled the country selling dresses to
stores.
</P>
<P>
   With an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania and a law degree from Loyola Marymount, he and two
partners in 1969 started one of the first firms specializing in
friendly, management-led buyouts, Gibbons Green van Amerongen. It
participated in buyouts of 30 companies, including Budget
Rent-a-Car. He moved to California in 1980 and established his own
firm in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In private life, Green enjoys the rewards of his success, living
in a $6 million home in Bel Air and collecting Impressionist and
contemporary American paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Friends mention two passions: opera and golf. As chief executive
of the Los Angeles Opera, he led the effort to recruit Placido
Domingo as the company's new director. He also attends the soccer
games of his two stepchildren by his current, second wife, Jude.
</P>
<P>
   His business ventures haven't all succeeded. The Hechinger Co.,
the hardware store chain he bought for $500 million in 1997, filed
for bankruptcy-law protection last June (although a spokesman for
Green says the company's investors lost only $15 million).
</P>
<P>
   Investors say they are willing to overlook such glitches as long
as he keeps producing strong returns. Rite Aid ``is certainly not a
normal turnaround,'' said David Dreman of Dreman Value Management,
which holds several million shares. ``But if I had to put my money
on somebody, I'd put it on somebody like Green.''

BISHOPS' CATHOLIC COLLEGE EDICT BAFFLES EDUCATORS

<P>
   ``A leap in the dark'' is what one well-informed church official
called Roman Catholic bishops' approval on Nov. 17 of a document
intended to maintain the Catholic identity of Catholic colleges and
universities. Very few people question the legitimacy of the
bishops' goal, which is widely shared by Catholic educators. What
was controversial was the wisdom of the proposed means, which have
been widely opposed by many of the same educators.
</P>
<P>
   The document, which applies a 1990 papal statement on Catholic
higher education to the United States, calls on Catholic colleges
and universities to ensure that at least a majority of their
faculty members and trustees are ``Catholics committed to the
faith.'' Similarly, the document, being sent to Rome for final
approval, requires presidents of such institutions to take an oath
of fidelity and profession of faith and declares that Catholics
teaching theology on Catholic faculties should seek certification
from a local bishop indicating that they teach in harmony with the
church.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder words like ``tighter controls'' and ``stricter ties''
marked the Page 1 headlines and evening newscasts about the action.
Yet the document also strongly affirms academic freedom, the right
of Catholic universities to govern themselves and the contributions
of non-Catholic scholars to these institutions' work. Many of the
provisions that at first glance appear demanding are punctuated
with phrases like ``to the degree possible'' or ``as much as
possible'' or ``with due regard for the principles of religious
liberty.'' What does this all mean?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   Consider only one provision of the document: To maintain their
identity, Catholic universities should be committed ``to Catholic
ideals, principles and attitudes in carrying out research, teaching
and all other university activities, including activities of
officially recognized student and faculty organizations and
associations.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like a formula, at least potentially, for blanket
control and tight reins on intellectual inquiry and campus life.
But wait. The sentence continues: ``and with due regard for
academic freedom and the conscience of every individual.'' Again,
what does this mean?
</P>
<P>
   Again, nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   It seems incredible that responsible church leaders would take a
step affecting more than 200 colleges and universities, a panoply
of institutions that no other church in the United States and no
Catholic church elsewhere in the world can claim, without resolving
such ambiguities. But clearly the bishops were weary of a
discussion that has gone on for years and has left them battered
between Vatican demands and academic resistance. Thus the leap in
the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, in their public discussion before voting, the bishops
renounced any desire to intrude into the governance of Catholic
colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these institutions, after all, were founded not by the
bishops but by religious orders of priests, nuns and brothers, who
have increasingly turned over direction to lay trustees and lay
administrators. Almost none of these institutions receive church
funds. So the bishops' discussion featured more talk of
``consultation'' than was ever heard in a doctor's office and
enough mention of ``dialogue'' to sound like a scriptwriting
workshop.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a curious moment at the news conference after the
bishops' vote. Bishop John Leibrecht of the diocese of
Springfield-Cape Girardeau, Mo., who had loyally ushered the
document through many drafts, was insisting that the document gave
bishops no role in employment decisions or other matters of
internal university policy.
</P>
<P>
   So many times, in fact, did the bishop say ``it's up to the
university'' to decide how to meet the document's standards, that
reporters stopped focusing on how the document might be received in
the universities and began asking how it might be received in Rome.
Hadn't the Vatican rejected an earlier version, approved by the
bishops in 1996, precisely because it relied entirely on
consultation and dialogue between bishops and educators rather than
specific requirements binding under church law if not civil law?
Why should the Vatican approve this version if, as one reporter put
it after listening to Leibrecht, it had ``no teeth''?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the bishops' document contains plenty of
``teeth,'' although for the moment they are still buried in the
newborn's gums.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in several places and with the usual dash of
ambiguity, the document proposes that most Catholic colleges and
universities incorporate its norms into their statutes and other
governing documents under American civil law. To do this would have
real significance for contracts and other legal actions. The kind
of Vatican control that has been previously limited to special
institutions like the Catholic University of America _ and that
American courts recognized when the Rev. Charles Curran was
removed, at Rome's demand, from that faculty _ might now be
extended to other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the much more widely publicized question of
requiring Catholic theologians to seek a ``mandatum,'' or approval,
from a local bishop. In the one significant amendment to the
document, the bishops indicated their need for more time to develop
``a detailed procedure'' for handling the mandatum.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen when the teething process begins _ when these
sharp edges are felt? Most bishops clearly want to avoid pain, for
themselves or Catholic higher education. But there will be plenty
of critics of Catholic campuses, whether motivated by
traditionalism or secularism, who will force confrontations over
what remains unnoticed or unresolved in this document.
</P>
<P>
   A single controversy here, a protest or court fight there, will
ripple through the academic world raising fears and inflaming
attitudes. All the ambiguities now in the footnotes, warned one
Catholic educator, will quickly become the main text.
</P>
<P>
   Leibrecht said that the document was neither an imposition on
Catholic higher education nor mere exhortation but ``an agenda for
further dialogue.'' That is the hope. But have the bishops
unwittingly created an agenda for endless, self-destructive
squabbles? That is the danger.

WITH LEADER   INCAPACITATED,   POWER   IS TRANSFERRED IN CROATIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ Croatia's Constitutional Court declared Friday
that President Franjo Tudjman, on his deathbed in a suburban
hospital, was temporarily incapacitated, a decision that transfers
his powers for now to the speaker of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, Vlatko Pavletic, immediately promised that
Croatia's parliamentary elections, which the opposition is
expecting to win, would be free and fair. Pavletic, a 69-year-old
academic, himself has had multiple bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Tudjman's governing party, the Croatian Democratic
Union, also met Friday, declaring their preference for
parliamentary elections on Jan. 3. It is expected that Pavletic, a
member of the party, will take his cue from them.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the election matters, because the governing party
wants to limit its losses and believes that it will get a boost
from both holiday good feelings and the aura around Tudjman, the
founder of the Croatian state that emerged from the wreckage of
Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatian Democratic Union has been controlling the procedure
around the death watch for Tudjman, who is dying from complications
of stomach cancer. He is reported to be attached to numerous
machines that support his life and heavily sedated, incapable of
communication with others.
</P>
<P>
   His death will cause a political crisis for the party, which
must pick a new party leader and presidential candidate as well as
try to beat a strong challenge from a center-left coalition of
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman, who ran an autocratic state under a constitution that
he approved and that has no post of vice president, never allowed a
successor to be chosen, despite his long illness.
</P>
<P>
   Only on Wednesday, the party engineered the passing of a
constitutional amendment that outlined the procedure followed in
the last two days: an emergency government meeting asking the
Constitutional Court to declare a temporary incapacity of the
president, while keeping him formally in the post.
</P>
<P>
   Pavletic, however, gave signs Friday that he would like to keep
the job, saying he would ensure the democratic running of the state
according to the constitution, a nicety not always followed under
Tudjman. Tudjman ran the country through an extensive presidential
office of advisers led by Ivic Pasalic, 38, who controls internal
security and media matters.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Pavletic told journalists that he would keep his office
in Parliament, rather than move to the presidential complex on a
hill above Zagreb. ``I want to stay here,'' he told Reuters in an
interview, ``and signal that all the decisions will be made here,
in St. Mark's Square.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavletic may be trying to distance himself from Pasalic, who is
unpopular with the public.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Pasalic said it was too early to discuss
a successor to Tudjman, as well as unseemly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one who can be Tudjman after Tudjman,'' Pasalic
said. ``But regardless of the president's state of health, the
party will remain united.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that the party would win at least half the seats in
the next Parliament, despite the country's deep economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary elections could mean the end of the Tudjman
party's nearly exclusive control over Croatia. Separate
presidential elections mean that the party could also lose the
powerful post of head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Pavletic is a writer and professor at Zagreb's Academy of Art
who has generally kept a low political profile. While judged to be
relatively moderate, he is considered an ally of his powerful
deputy, Vladimir Seks, who is one of the governing party's most
important figures.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Ed and Kathy Blasco kicked off their holiday shopping
Friday the same way they have for the last 15 years _ they headed
for Country Club Plaza mall outside of Kansas City. The Blascos
were set to enjoy the balmy weather and the Christmas songs being
played by a live band, but they did not plan to make many
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get ideas today, we may very well do online shopping,''
Blasco said. They planned to take advantage of an online retailer's
free shipping offer on a playground set for their 1-year-old
granddaughter and said they had already purchased a specialty doll
on Ebay.com.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment at record lows and the stock market flying
high, economists and retail analysts have been predicting that
Christmas 1999 will be very strong indeed. Sales of merchandise,
excluding autos, will reach $184 billion for November and December,
up 6 percent from last year, predicts the National Retail
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   So the real issue is not whether Americans will shop, but where
will they shop. The Internet is growing rapidly, and estimates vary
on just how big a chunk the virtual vendors will extract from
stores. Estimates of holiday sales on the Web run from $6 billion
by Forrester Research up to $12 billion by Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday because
merchants historically relied on sales leading up to Christmas to
move them from the red into the black, is no longer the busiest
shopping day of the year. (That honor is now reserved for the days
nearest Christmas Eve, as Americans conditioned to sale shopping
delay purchasing as long as possible.) Still, the post-Turkey Day
recess does send millions of American families to the mall and
provides a snapshot of how the all-important season will shape up.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports indicate that e-shopping is fast becoming as much
a holiday tradition as strolling the concourse to eat chestnuts and
gawking at decorated store windows. And at least on the first day,
there were sporadic reports of service trouble on the Web
(KBkids.com was down much of the day and offering $5 off coupons to
appease consumers), while merchants on the ground were doing a
better-than-expected job of making visitors comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   At Crate &AMP; Barrel's flagship store on Michigan Avenue in
Chicago, there were more clerks than people at 10 a.m., including a
full-time janitorial staff that was meticulously polishing
escalators and handrails almost the minute they were marred by
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Barker, of Carmel, Calif., who was visiting Manhattan and
had stocked up on perfume and sweaters at Bloomingdale's and was
waiting while her son tried on clothes at Banana Republic, was like
many other shoppers in offering praise to New York sales clerks.
``The personnel have been very patient with all the crowds,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a heightened attention to customer service and warm
weather that encouraged shopping outdoors, many Americans still
chose to stay home and bathe in the light of their computer
screens, much to the delight of cybermerchants. ``From what we can
tell by traffic to our Web site as of noon, today will be the
number one day for our Web site all year,'' said Mike Goldstein,
chief executive of Toys ``R'' Us. Amazon.com, the giant Internet
retailer that sells books, music and toys, reported a sales
increase of 267 percent over Black Friday last year. ``This is our
biggest day of the year so far,'' said Yahoo!'s Richard Rogowski.
``We are getting almost 5 times as many orders on Yahoo! Stores as
we got last year on Black Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   At Outpost.com, a supplier of high-end high technology gifts,
big sellers included DVD players and flat-screen computer monitors.
``It is very darn good this week,'' said Bob Bowman, Outpost's
chief executive. ``We already have orders exceeding last year. We
will do north of a million today.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers were drawn, he said, by the offer of free overnight
shipping and a promotion, which rewarded a shopper every 15 minutes
with a gift appropriate for cyber-surfing, like a bathrobe and a
pretzel-popcorn snack.
</P>
<P>
   But the increased traffic did not come without a price. In the
week leading up to Black Friday, many Web shoppers complained that
sites were responding slowly and that some did not take orders at
all. Among the most troubled were the toy sites, with Toys ``R'' Us
and Etoys having down time during the week, and KBKids.com
suffering badly on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Because Internet retailers must ship goods, they tend to hit
their Christmas peak a little earlier than real world merchants,
who can provide cash-and-carry gratification. Perhaps this explains
why reports from stores were mostly positive but a bit mixed. ``It
was a slow start, to tell you the truth, because there was not one
big toy this season,'' John Konarski, president of the
International Council of Shopping Centers, said early in the
morning. ``There was no reason to get up at 4:30 in the morning and
wait online.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, consumers strolling the avenues in the big urban
centers reported that they had every intention of spending lots of
money and plenty of it in plain old stores. And there were signs
everywhere that brick-and-mortar retailers were not going to cede
sales readily. As in previous years, many retailers were already
promoting big markdowns and, in what may be a service emphasis
inspired by a fear of the Internet, most had sales staff clamoring
to help browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Sue and Brad Briddell, who traveled from Toledo, Ohio, to shop
in Chicago, had only praise for the service they had found on tony
Michigan Avenue. The two had been out of their hotel and on the
hunt as early as 7:30 am, and by midmorning had already visited
Marshall Fields and Old Navy, and had fingered the parachute-flight
pants at Express. Contrary to stereotypes of absent or at best
gruff sales help, both said they had been served well. ``Oh, it has
been fantastic,'' Ms. Briddell said. ``Everyone's been very up and
very friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether stores can maintain that first-day polish will be the
question as the shopping season gathers steam.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's popularity may have turned the idea of customer
convenience on its head, but certain things remain constant on the
Web or off. Discounted merchandise or anything Pokemon was a good
thing on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tauber, chairman and chief executive of Cybershop, an
online merchant specializing in brand-name toys, apparel and
housewares for value prices, bragged, ``We are definitely exceeding
last year's numbers, and this day last year was one of our top
three or four days of the entire year. People are always looking
for a good deal.'' Among Cybershop's specials was a $99 bundle of
Pokemon stuff, including trading cards, the coveted Pikachu plush
animal, a pencil set and a key chain.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 shoppers rushed to the electronics department to
buy Pokemon items when Target, the chic low-price division of
Dayton Hudson, opened its doors at 7 a.m. in Atlanta. Target
shoppers Starla Littleton and her niece Shelly Park used
walkie-talkies to make their trip more efficient. ``She goes to get
one thing, and I go to get another,'' said Ms. Littleton. They kept
in touch as one checked out the Pokemon display and the other
headed to the Furbie babies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the department stores, which offer midrange prices
and few toys, were rather empty before midday. Having heard ``that
today was Black Friday,'' said Diana Brown, who was shopping at
Barney's in New York with a couple of girlfriends, ``We thought,
`Oh, no.' But it's not bad at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Joiner, of Nashville, Tenn., who was fingering Pashmina
shawls at Bloomingdale's flagship on 59th Street while her husband,
Don, looked on, said, ``I was here last year, and it was a whole
lot worse than this.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the fashionable clothiers were worried, they did not
admit it. In sales, ``We are up double digit above last year,''
said Judy Collinson, Barney's general merchandise manager for
women's wear, ``and we don't even expect this to be one of our
biggest days.'' She said high-end luxury items selling well
included Fendi purses, hip-length shearling jackets and Pashmina
shawls, which run up to $3,000 for the hand-embroidered variety.
``Our customers purchase things on the Internet,'' Ms. Collinson
said firmly, ``but not the things they buy from us.''

THIS GEM IS NO DIAMANTE IN THE ROUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mitsubishi, the Japanese automaker that was partners with
Chrysler Corp. for years, hasn't followed the lead of Toyota, Honda
and Nissan to establish a separate luxury brand the likes of Lexus,
Acura and Infiniti.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like another of its Japanese brethren, Mazda,
Mitsubishi chose in the early '90s to introduce a luxury sedan as
its flagship model without creating a separate brand.
</P>
<P>
   That sedan, called the Diamante (from the Middle Latin
diamantis, or diamond), hasn't been a big seller, but it has been a
source of pride for the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   As with Mazda's premium sedan, the Millennia, the Diamante is
too little-known and too underrated. What we have here is an
outstanding midsize luxury sedan that has enough zip and
road-handling ability to make driving a family car a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, the Diamante returns with a two-model lineup: the base
ES and the top-of-the-line LS. For those who want the performance
of a sporty sedan without all the extra luxury amenities such as
leather seats, woodgrain trim and sun roof, the lower-priced ES is
a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   With a base price of $24,997 (plus $470 transportation), the
Diamante ES offers the same zippy 3.5-liter V-6 engine and
four-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission that
comes in the LS model. This engine, with 24 valves and sequential
fuel injection, produces a respectable 210 horsepower and 231
foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   The automatic transmission is the new adaptive type with fuzzy
logic, a cute name for a computer system that almost thinks on its
own. The transmission senses whether it's on a hill or flat ground,
and alters the shift points accordingly. It will hold in a lower
gear when going down a hill or while cornering, and will not
repeatedly up- and down-shift when climbing a hill.
</P>
<P>
   With the ES, you get the equivalent of what you would find in a
high-end Toyota Camry or Honda Accord, for about the same money.
Standard features include four-wheel antilock disc brakes,
automatic climate control, power windows and door locks, four-wheel
independent suspension, automatic-off headlights, stainless steel
exhaust and more.
</P>
<P>
   Ugrade to the LS, and the extra amenities put the Diamante into
the same class as the Lexus ES 300, Acura 3.2 TL and Infiniti I30 _
but with a lower price tag.
</P>
<P>
   For the base price of $27,897 (plus transportation), the very
comfy Diamante LS comes with leather seats, woodgrain interior
trim, leather-wrapped steering wheel, 16-inch alloy wheels,
color-keyed body side molding, the HomeLink universal
garage-door/gate opener, premium AM/FM/compact-disc stereo with
eight speakers, power seats with driver lumbar support, power sun
roof, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, and really cool
illuminated analog gauges (including a large speedometer dial).
</P>
<P>
   This car is surprisingly fun to drive. There is good power at
all speeds, but particularly when you need it to merge onto the
freeway from an uphill ramp, or to pass an 18-wheeler on a two-lane
country road. The power rack-and-pinion steering gets tighter at
highway speeds for firm control.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's not a sports sedan, its handling is rather sporty.
The car hugs the road in tight turns better than the average sedan,
and the suspension is firm enough for good driver input _ without
affecting the rather comfy ride.
</P>
<P>
   The front bucket seats are quite comfortable, and it's easy to
get into and out of the Diamante, front or back. There is ample
room in the back seat for two adults; three can fit if necessary.
The trunk is roomy enough, with 14.2 cubic feet of cargo space. The
lid lifts high for easy loading and unloading.
</P>
<P>
   Craftsmanship appears to be better than average for Mitsubishi,
which has had a reputation for marginal quality like its longtime
partner Chrysler. But just like Chrysler, Mitsubishi has made great
strides in quality control during the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Our only complaint with the Diamante LS we tested was that the
remote-control door-locking and unlocking system worked only
occasionally during our weeklong test drive. Most of the time it
didn't work, so we had to resort to putting the key into the door
lock. This kind of problem shouldn't occur on any brand-new car,
let alone one that costs this much (and is given to an automotive
journalist for testing).
</P>
<P>
   Total price of our test car was $29,207, which included the $840
all-weather package. The package added traction control, heated
seats, fog lights and heated side-view mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is about average for a premium sedan. EPA ratings
are 17 miles per gallon in the city and 25 mpg on the highway. The
tank holds 19 gallons of fuel.  &QL;

   2000 Mitsubishi Diamante LS sedan
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Midsize, four-door, front-wheel drive, V-6 powered

</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: Mitsubishi's flagship sedan offers good performance
and sporty handling in a luxury package worthy of an entry-level
Lexus, but at a lower price.

CALIFORNIA GASOLINE PRICES ARE A FOCUS FOR REGULATORS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii, Nev., Ga., Alaska, Ore., Ariz.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Californians paid an average of about 26 cents
more for a gallon of gasoline than other Americans in the first
eight months of this year, according to a report released this week
by the state's attorney general. And those high prices have become
a focal point as federal and most state regulators prepare to
approve the merger of Exxon and Mobil &UR;  &LR; and continue to debate the
acquisition of the Atlantic Richfield Co. by BP Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   Californians paid nearly $1.32 a gallon for regular gasoline
from January through August, according to the attorney general's
report. That was the third-highest price in the nation behind
isolated Hawaii and Nevada, which gets much of its gasoline from
California. Other western states also have relatively high pricing.
The national average excluding California was a little over $1.05
while in Georgia, which had the lowest prices, it was less than 89
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Higher taxes accounted for about 5 cents of the difference and
California's requirements for cleaner gasoline accounted for
another 4 cents, the report said. But the main difference, it
maintained, stems from concentration in the market, with more than
90 percent of the state's refinery capacity and the vast majority
of its gasoline sales controlled by six big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, independent refiners and independent marketers
tend to play a larger role in the market. And because of its need
for special gasoline, California is basically cut off from sources
of supply in the rest of the country. When the state's own
refineries have problems _ such as occurred earlier this year _
gasoline prices can quickly spike upward.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not find any wrongdoing by the oil companies,
though it was not likely to since it looked only at publicly
available information. But the issue of market concentration has
become a key one in the pending oil mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is expected next week to approve
the merger of Exxon and Mobil, subject to the condition that they
divest more than 2,000 gasoline stations, mainly on the East Coast,
according to officials in Washington and elsewhere. In California,
where the two companies together control 14 percent of refining
capacity and nearly 19 percent of gasoline sales, about 360 gas
stations are to be divested, along with Exxon's refinery in
Benicia.
</P>
<P>
   California is expected to go along with this decision but will
have a veto over the purchasers of those stations and the refinery.
That would ensure that the assets would not go to one of the
existing participants in the California market.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of BP Amoco and ARCO is still problematical because
the two companies together would have formidable control over oil
from Alaska's North Slope, which accounts for nearly half the oil
refined in California.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has reached its own tentative agreement with BP Amoco and
ARCO, calling for the divestiture of some North Slope production
and leases. But that agreement does not satisfy California and
other western states, which are consumers of the oil, while
Alaska's interests are partly to maximize its revenues from that
oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``That only took care of Alaska's problems,'' Bill Lockyer, the
California attorney general, said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier this month, John Browne, the chief executive of BP
Amoco, met with California Gov. Gray Davis and promised that ARCO,
which is based in Los Angeles, would retain its low-price gasoline
sales strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockyer, the attorney general, said that did not go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and some politicians in California have long
made an issue of the gasoline prices, particularly in San Diego and
San Francisco, where prices are 6 cents to more than 20 cents a
gallon higher than in Los Angeles. The Utility Consumers' Action
Network, a San Diego consumer group, posts on its Web site a
``gouge gap,'' the difference between San Diego and Los Angeles
prices. The attorney general's report said the reasons for the
price differences were unclear; oil companies say the prices simply
reflect market forces.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and some gasoline dealers have backed
legislation in San Diego, San Francisco and in the California
legislature that would either forbid oil companies from owning gas
stations or take other measures to give gas stations more supply
options. But so far, none of these efforts have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Libbey, a spokesman for Chevron, &UR;  &LR; the largest refiner in
the state, said the issue of gasoline prices ``is all a red herring
in terms of what most motorists are concerned with.'' He said
Chevron had been gaining market share despite having relatively
high prices and that consumers continued to buy gas-guzzling sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Libbey said that California environmental rules were chiefly
responsible for the higher prices here.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies are fighting any proposed legislation. Chevron
this month sent a letter to dealers saying it would have to double
their rents if legislation such as that proposed in California, or
in other states like Oregon and Arizona, became law. Chevron said
this reflected economic realities, but some dealers said it was a
heavy-handed attempt to silence them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this basically says is, `We'll put you out of business if
you exercise your rights,''' said Dennis C. DeCota, executive
director of the California Service Station and Automotive Repair
Association.

ARIEL STOCK ZOOMS ON NEWS ITS MODEM CARDS WILL COMPETE WITH CISCO
AND LUCENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ariel Corp., a technology company that was forced only last
month to renegotiate its debts, rose more than tenfold this week
after it announced that it would begin selling a product to compete
with offerings from the much larger Cisco Systems and Lucent
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Ariel, which closed Tuesday at $3.56 a share, began to
rise on Wednesday after the company put out a statement saying its
modem cards had been approved for use in the United States and
other countries and would go on sale next month. It said the cards
would enable smaller Internet service providers to provide dial-in
connections at a lower cost than those who use competing products.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the stock more than tripled, to $10.75, on volume
of 46.8 million shares. Then after the Thanksgiving holiday, it
zoomed again Friday, rising $26.25, to $37, on volume of 50.6
million shares. During the hectic day, the price rose as high as
$57.
</P>
<P>
   The trading volume was all the more remarkable in that the
company has only 9.76 million shares outstanding. During the last
two trading sessions, 10 times that many shares were traded, most
of them in relatively small lots. Internet chat rooms were filled
with talk of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the enthusiasm was fueled by a comment from Anthony
Stoss, an analyst for EarlyBird Capital, an affiliate of GKN
Securities, which underwrote Ariel when it went public in 1995 in
an offering of one share and one warrant for $4. Stoss was quoted
by Bloomberg News as saying Ariel's product ``will set the market
on fire in terms of price.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoss did not return a telephone call Friday. Nor did Dennis
Schneider, Ariel's senior vice president for worldwide marketing,
who issued the Ariel news release on Wednesday. After trading ended
Friday, Ariel released a statement saying there were ``no pending
announcements that explain this level of activity'' in the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The activity was wild in the holiday-shortened trading session.
At one point, as orders poured in to buy and sell the stock, the
highest bid by an investor or broker trying to buy the stock was
more than $2 above the lowest offer price by someone trying to sell
the stock. Normally, of course, the bid is always lower than the
offer price, and such prices can cross by that much only in the
most hectic of markets.
</P>
<P>
   The performance was all the more amazing because there was
little new in the Wednesday announcement. Ariel had announced on
Oct. 18 that the product would go on sale in early December, and
had made the same pricing claims. But that announcement did not
attract much investor attention, and the stock price remained in
the $3-to-$4 range. The principal new thing in Wednesday's news
release was the statement that the product had won approval for
connection to telephone lines in a number of countries. The earlier
release had not indicated there was any question regarding the
ability of the product to connect to such lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel's shareholders have had a long and often unpleasant ride
since the company went public. The share price rose as high as $18
in May 1996, enabling the company to force the exercise of the
warrants that were issued at the original offering in January 1995,
which allowed the purchase of shares for $3.50 each.
</P>
<P>
   But results soon proved disappointing, and by summer of this
year the share price had fallen below $2. At the end of last year,
Ariel was not in compliance with covenants in a loan agreement. As
a result, that agreement was renegotiated in May, and then again in
October. In May, it committed itself to have working capital of at
least $8 million at the end of this year, a figure that was cut to
$2 million in the October renegotiation.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of 1999, Ariel reported a loss of $9.3
million on revenue of $8.7 million.

FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By David Warsh 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has Microsoft hurt consumers? One way to answer this question is
to study Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's vigorous condemnation of
Microsoft's competitive practices ``within'' the personal computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Another is personal experience. Compare your own involvement
with personal computers over the years with your experience of a
rival product.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, of course, the Internet. Too little attention has been
paid to the parallel rise of these once distinct but now
inextricably linked technologies. Each possesses a technical and
commercial culture of its own.
</P>
<P>
   And if the symbol of the PC culture is Bill Gates, the world's
richest man, Scott Bradner is as good a symbol of the Internet
culture as might be found.
</P>
<P>
   Bradner, 55, is neither rich nor famous, at least outside the
the Internet community. His two-family house in Cambridge belonged
long ago to a chief of police. His day job is as a consultant on
data networks to the Office of the Provost at Harvard University.
He writes a weekly column for Network World as well.
</P>
<P>
   But as co-director of the Transport Area of the Internet
Engineering Task Force and vice president for standards of the
Internet Society, he and the handful of others overseeing the
evolution of the Internet have been almost unbelievably powerful
over the last decade, in terms of empowering individuals and
bringing, among others, Bill Gates to his knees (insofar as anybody
worth $100 billion can be considered kneeling). Judge Jackson must
play a role as well.
</P>
<P>
   Which system of development _ Gates'? or Bradner's? _ has been
more advantageous to consumers? The question is far beyond the
ability of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to answer. Nevertheless, it
is PC culture that should be on trial in your daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Which technology do you use more easily? Which technology has
benefited you more?
</P>
<P>
   Peter H. Lewis of the New York Times put it succinctly the other
day, ``After nearly a quarter-century of intense research by many
of the greatest technical and marketing minds on the planet,
personal computers still force the average consumer to decipher an
eyeball-glazing catalog of technical mumbo-jumbo like this from a
recent newspaper advertisment:
</P>
<P>
   ``ATX w/300 Watt PS, 48x CD Rom, 9.1 GIG LVD U2W 2MB Buffer,
128MB PC100 ECC RAM, Intel P3 500 w/Fan, 8 MEG ATI Expert 98 AGP,
3Com 905tX 10/100 NIC . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Lewis, once you have decided on kinds of tasks
you want your new hardware to perform _ play music? view movies?
make phone calls? crunch numbers? process words? send e-mail? roam
the Web? _ you've got to choose between systems with which to give
instructions to your machines, Windows or Macintosh as a rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice between these operating systems is almost religious
in nature,'' says Lewis. ``Mac users are in the minority but
believe they are a click closer to heaven. Windows could be
described as a digital code version of a Hieronymous Bosch
painting. ... Both systems are more complicated and unstable than
they ought to be,'' though once you get on line, Lewis says, ``It
matters less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should that be the case? Consider the history of the
Internet. It had its rude beginnings in the 1960s as a system of
``packet switching'' _ conceived nearly simultaneously in
California and England with very different purposes in mind. The
Defense Deparment financed the development of the pioneering
ARPANET in the '70s; in the '80s in the hands of its government
contractors it unexpectedly mutated into a network of networks.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only in the '90s that its use exploded, thanks to the
ultimate user-friendly invention of the World Wide Web, a piece of
software and attendant protocols that made it easy to prowl around
the Internet simply by pointing and clicking with a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The long-sought ``killer ap,'' an application so popular that it
soon would create a demand for a computer in nearly every home,
emerged not from PC manufacturers nor software companies, but
instead all but unbidden from a couple of government labs, one in
Switzerland and the other in farm-belt Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   (Dependable histories of these events have finally begun to
appear. Thomas Hughes' chapter on the Internet in ``Rescuing
Prometheus'' remains the most readable, but now his doctoral
student Janet Abbate has gone far beyond the master to delineate
the separate strands in ``Inventing the Internet,'' published by
MIT Press earlier this year. It is an appropriately matter-of-fact
but thoroughly wonderful account _ it is a reworked dissertation,
after all.)
</P>
<P>
   So how is it that a program written by a young man in
Switzerland (Tim Berners-Lee), given away in 1990, and enhanced
dramatically three years later by a ``browser'' developed by some
other young men halfway around the world (Marc Andreessen and his
colleagues) could become the dominant techology in computing, in a
remarkably short period of time, with the permission of no one at
all?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of the Internet Enginering Task Force,
which creates the routing, management, and transport standards
without which the Internet would not exist. ``For something that
does not exist, the IETF has had quite an impact,'' says Scott
Bradner.
</P>
<P>
   In its own description, the IETF is ``a loosely self-organized
group of people who make technical and other contributions to the
engineering and evolution of the Internet and of new Internet
standards.
</P>
<P>
   It met for the first time in January 1986 in San Diego _ 15
persons attended, all of them government contractors who advised
the Pentagon on its spending stream. Eighteen months later, more
than 100 computer scientists and engineers attended the seventh
meeting, many of them vendors with no link to government.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Society was formed in January 1992 in Kobe, Japan,
and the present-day structure emerged. The next year the IETF met
in Europe for the first time (the history and much else of interest
can be found in the entry on The Tao of the IETF, posted at
www.ietf.org). When the task force met earlier this month in
Washington, some 2,400 persons showed up and quickly sorted
themselves into the 115 or so working groups or birds-of-a-feather
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   There is no membership in the IETF; anybody who wants can show
up. There is, however, a definite hierarchy, with a decision-making
steering group composed of the directors and co-directors of the
eight functional groups (applications, Internet, next generation,
network management, operational requirements, routing, security,
transport, and user service) _ fewer than 15 people in all.
</P>
<P>
   The IETF, in others words, is a users' group _ the biggest and
most powerful in the world. No government underwrites its
standards; no company manipulates its decisions: indeed, attendees
represent only themselves. ``If someone got up and said, `Nortel
thinks ...,' they would be booed,'' says Bradner. A tiny staff
office in Virginia runs its meetings and offers limited staff
support. Its meeting are strictly pay-as-you go.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Linux operating system for personal computers _ a
rising alternative to Windows and Macintosh _ has gotten the lion's
share of the attention for ``open source'' software, whose
underlying code many be modified by any and all, the IETF also is a
case study in the open-source movement, Bradner says. In fact, it
existed long before there was such a convenient label to describe
the process by which software is written that nobody owns. The Task
Force has no proprietary secrets; its documents are freely
available over the Internet and can be reproduced at will.
</P>
<P>
   The IETF also differs from other standard-setting organizations
such as the International Telecommunications Union and the
International Standards Organization in that its motto is ``rough
consensus and running code.'' ``Running code'' means that it
undertakes only projects demonstrated to be practical; ``rough
consensus'' means that, since absolute unanimity is not required
among its executive committee, its proposals have fewer features
added to quiet noisy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Simpler standards mean greater success. And it was the elegant
standards of the IETF, simply written and speedily established,
that have made possible the rapid dissemination of innovations like
the World Wide Web and its browsers which loosened the grip of
Microsoft on a key part of the market. That doesn't mean Judge
Jackson needn't play a role in restraining the abuse of Microsoft's
awsome market power; it just means it is only one part of an epic
contest. The next target for the Internet model: the telephone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Kids of a certain sort in my generation grew up on Isaac
Asimov's ``Foundation'' novels of the far-off future, in which a
struggle unfolds between a galactic empire and a mysterious
nonprofit foundation. (A watered-down version of the story provides
the underpinnings of the ``Star Wars'' films.)
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, a band of self-effacing wise men, is shielded
from the wrath of the emperor by the superiority of their wisdom
and the ordinariness of their surroundings. How astonishing to find
the plot at the heart of the main developments in industrial
organization of our time!

REP. SANDERS WON'T LEAVE HOUSE SEAT, DEMOCRATS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Ohio, N.J., Mo., Mich., Minn.)   (jw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending a fierce tug-of-war between House and Senate
Democrats, Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont plans to announce Monday
that he will seek re-election and forgo a race for the Senate in
2000, Democratic congressional officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, an independent who aligns himself with Democrats in
Congress, had been considered the most formidable potential
challenger to Sen. James Jeffords, a moderate Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who describes himself as a Democratic socialist,
already has a statewide presence as Vermont's only representative
in Congress, so he has been at the center of a competition between
Democratic leaders who have been jockeying to recruit the best
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Sanders, Sanders' wife and political adviser, declined
Friday to reveal what her husband would say on Monday, when he has
scheduled a formal announcement. ``There's a handful of people only
who know exactly what Bernie has decided,'' she said. ``He wants to
tell Vermont first.''
</P>
<P>
   But other congressional Democrats, who spoke on condition that
they not be identified, said Sanders had told party leaders that he
would run again for the House. He won easily in 1998 and is
considered a sure prospect for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' decision is a victory for Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
the House minority leader, who has been imploring Democratic
incumbents to run for re-election in a year in which Democrats
believe that control of the House is within their grasp. The
Republicans have one of the tightest House majorities this century,
and a shift of just five seats in 2000 would restore Democrats to
power.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanders said party leaders in both the House and Senate had
assured her husband that despite his independent status, he would
have the same seniority rights as any Democrat when it came to
committee assignments.
</P>
<P>
   In his courtship of Sanders, Gephardt also promised him a seat
on the powerful House Appropriations Committee if the Democrats
regained the majority. Ms. Sanders acknowledged that the promise
weighed heavily with her husband as he considered his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is that a senator is more powerful
than a congressman,'' she said, ``but if you're an appropriator it
kind of even things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is not the only House Democrat at the center of frenzied
lobbying. While most analysts believe the House is far more likely
to change hands than the Senate, Senate Democrats might well pick
up seats next year. They have only 14 Senate seats on the ballot
compared with 19 Republican seats.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Debbie Stabenow decided to challenge Republican Senate
incumbent Spencer Abraham in Michigan. But Rep. Sherrod Brown of
Ohio bitterly disappointed Senate Democrats when he chose not to
take on Sen. Mike DeWine, who is seeking his second term.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leaders prevailed on Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. and
Robert Menendez of New Jersey not to seek the Senate seat of Frank
Lautenberg, who is retiring. And they persuaded Rep. David Minge of
Minnesota not to give up his seat to take on Sen. Rod Grams.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that House Democrats will be defending only five
open seats from which the incumbent is retiring, compared with 19
open House seats that the Republicans will be fighting to retain.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has put off his announcement several times. His wife
said his timing had been influenced by the effort of the Vermont
delegation to work together to secure extension of the Northeast
Interstate Dairy Compact, which allows the New England states to
set somewhat higher prices for milk than elsewhere. The compact was
added into Congress' spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democrats still plan to seek Jeffords' Vermont seat: Jan
Backus, a state senator who lost to Jeffords in 1994, and Edward
Flanagan, the state auditor.

KURDS SENSE A SHIFT TOWARD PEACE AFTER 15-YEAR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Sitting at his sewing machine by a ground-floor window,
a tailor named Ahmet Tuzun senses something he never expected.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Turks who live in Germany, Tuzun keeps in close touch
with political developments back home. He is especially concerned
about the Kurdish war that has been racking Turkey for 15 years.
Until now, he has seen little prospect of peace. Suddenly, however,
he has changed his mind. The Kurdish nationalist movement, he said,
now seems genuinely interested in reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all began with Ocalan,'' said Tuzun, referring to the
leader of the Kurdish rebellion, Abdullah Ocalan, who was captured
by Turkish agents this year and has been calling for peace from his
prison cell. ``Since his statements, the Kurdish movement has gone
through a big change. They want to stop being a military movement.
They seem much more open to compromise and discussion than they
were before.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with Kurds in Berlin and other European cities
suggest that what Tuzun has seen reflects a profound change of
direction for the cause of Kurdish nationalism. With remarkable
unanimity, Kurds say they are tired of war and no longer want to
form their own state.
</P>
<P>
   These views reflect what many Kurds in Turkey also believe. But
those abroad may reflect Kurdish opinion even more completely,
because they are free to express any opinions they like. In Turkey,
statements favoring Kurdish nationalism are punishable by law.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, which ended in a death sentence that few believe
will be carried out, Ocalan said he wanted to ``serve the Turkish
state.'' (An appeals court upheld the death sentence on Nov. 25,
but it is unclear whether it will be carried out.)
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan asked fighters from his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK,
to withdraw from Turkey ``to pave the way for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Later the party's central committee wrote to President Suleyman
Demirel saying it had abandoned its ``Cold War-inspired political
strategy'' and declaring: ``The Kurdish and Turkish people are as
inseparable as flesh and blood.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, two groups of guerrillas ceremoniously surrendered
to the Turkish army. They were ordered to do so by their commanders
as a sign of their sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   When Ocalan (pronounced OH-jah-lahn) asserted during his trial
that it was time to end the rebellion in Turkey, many Kurds were
shocked. But since then, most have come to embrace his position.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this change is undoubtedly due to the prestige of
Ocalan, by far the most popular figure among Kurds. But Kurds also
say that upon reflection, they believe the new course makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took some time for us to adjust to it,'' said Songul
Karabulut, 29, who came to Germany with her family when she was a
child. ``But in the last couple of months, just about everyone has
come to accept the need for a new orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders say they will not change their policy toward the
10 million or more of their citizens who are Kurds. They say the
Kurds have the same rights as other citizens, but to allow them to
establish Kurdish-language schools or television stations is
impossible because that would weaken the unity of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Turkish military commanders rejected Ocalan's
calls for peace as ``false and deceiving,'' and asserted, ``It is
out of the question that the general staff accept the PKK terror
organization as an interlocutor, discuss its suggestions or make
any concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Demirel dismissed the PKK's declared intention to give up its
war as a ``routine, seasonal tactical retreat before winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Demirel, in a move that would have been unthinkable even a
few months ago, recently received the leaders of Turkey's legal
Kurdish political party, which maintains informal links to the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs of a political thaw in Turkey. The
country's two leading judges have made unprecedented calls for
sweeping political reform, including an end to the ban on teaching
the Kurdish language.
</P>
<P>
   Five leading cultural figures issued a statement calling current
policy toward Kurds ``a huge mistake'' and urging that Kurds ``be
given their rights and dignity.'' And since the earthquake that
devastated Turkey in August, many citizens who criticized the
government's response have begun demanding a loosening of the
political system.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   At the Kurdistan Information Center in London, posters depicting
Turkish soldiers as bloodthirsty killers are being taken down.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the center, Mendo Balci, said the posters no
longer reflect Kurdish opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a revolutionary phase, looking for revolutionary
change,'' Balci said. ``Now we're taking a different approach. Our
goals aren't territorial anymore, they're political. It's not in
the interest of the Kurdish people to be in confrontation with the
whole world by conducting an armed struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some Kurds still resist this new approach. They cannot accept
what seems to be Ocalan's embrace of Kemalism, the doctrine of a
strong centralized state that has guided the Turkish Republic since
it was founded 76 years ago by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kemalist concept, Turkey's vision of the state, and the
concept of a pan-Turkish empire that denies the existence of other
peoples, all of which were previously rejected, are now accepted by
the PKK,'' said Selahattin Celik, a Kurdish journalist who lives in
Cologne, Germany. ``In the past, Kemalism was described as
fascistic, but now it's presented as something good and admirable.
Most Kurds simply cannot understand this, but no one is allowed to
raise their voice in opposition to this new line.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A considerable majority of Kurds seems to have embraced Ocalan's
new position. They see it as a wise reaction to a changed world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I always believed that there should be an
independent Kurdistan,'' said Kamal Mirawdeli, a Kurdish poet who
has lived in London for nearly 20 years. ``My concept has changed.
National borders don't concern me anymore. I agree with Ocalan that
our job now is to help Turkey evolve into a democratic and
multicultural state. That isn't going to happen overnight, but
maybe slow change is actually more lasting and stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish intellectuals have begun saying that Ocalan's call for
an end to guerrilla warfare should be seen not as a surrender, but
rather as a logical progression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally this change is very painful to a lot of people,
especially those who have lost sons or brothers in the struggle,''
said Selim Ferat, who heads a Kurdish research center in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we achieved something over these 15 years. When this war
began, no one knew what a Kurd was. Even many Kurds had no idea
that they were Kurds. Now we are aware of our identity and our
potential, and the whole world knows our situation. It's time to
move on to a new phase.''

SEGA LOOKS TO NETWORKING AND SUBIDIARIES TO TURN AROUND LOSSES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Sega Enterprises, the beleaguered video game company,
Friday committed itself to a radical reorientation of its business
aimed at harnessing the power of the Internet. Sega also said its
losses in the first half of the fiscal year were larger than had
been expected.
</P>
<P>
   The company blamed a 50 percent increase in marketing and other
costs associated with the introduction of its Dreamcast video
console for losses at the parent company of 19.1 billion yen, or
$183.8 million at current exchange rates, in the six months that
ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of 1.2 billion yen in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 25 percent to 126.4 billion yen, or $1.21 billion, 6
percent less than what the company forecast in May.
</P>
<P>
   But at a news conference Friday evening, the president of Sega,
Shoichiro Irimajiri, said barely a word about the company's bleak
financial performance, choosing to focus instead on plans to
overhaul its business. Those plans include creating several
wholly-owned subsidiaries in an effort to increase accountability
and profitability as well as to transform Sega into a network
services provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will focus on entertainment and networking,'' he said.
``When we include the networking business into our own business, it
changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega has plans to connect 20 game centers in the areas around
Tokyo and Osaka via large computers that will allow players to
participate in continuing games. Irimajiri spoke animatedly about a
massive war game in cyberspace; players could choose to be tank
drivers or fighter pilots and take part in a battle on a distant
planet or between Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can expand the borders of the game to unlimited
space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For those couch potatoes who prefer to stay home, Sega plans to
replicate the experience in their living rooms using the Dreamcast
machine and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When Sega makes its games available over cellular telephones,
which are soon to get bigger displays capable of producing color,
game enthusiasts need never quit.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans to create 10 subsidiaries out of its software
research and development business and its faltering arcade
business, and although these changes seem mundane by comparison,
they are far more important to the company's short-term prospects.
Analysts said the creation of wholly-owned subsidiaries would
greatly enhance accountability and thus profitability; Sega will be
able to see precisely where it is losing money and where it will
get the most return for capital invested.
</P>
<P>
   Irimajiri said Sega would sell 10 million Dreamcast consoles in
the next fiscal year, which starts April 1. Dreamcast has so far
failed to capture the hearts of Japanese consumers, in part because
of supply problems and a dearth of software titles, but it has far
exceeded the company's expectations in the United States, where it
has sold 1 million consoles since September.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Dreamcast outside Japan led the company to revise
its forecast for the fiscal year that will end March 31 to a loss
of 10.9 billion yen, rather than the 11.4 billion yen loss it
predicted earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Irimajiri brushed aside questions about how Dreamcast will fare
when it is forced to compete with Sony's next generation
PlayStation, which will go on sale in Japan in March and in the
United States and Europe later next year. The new PlayStation is
designed to be a complete home entertainment center, with links to
the Internet, DVD capabilities, some computer features and many of
the same kinds of online group entertainment that Sega is planning.
Nintendo is also coming out with a more sophisticated console.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are safe because PlayStation 2 is very expensive, too
expensive for the mass market,'' Irimajiri said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought it would take two or three years for the Sony
machine's price to fall to $200, the high end of the range for the
consumer game market.

WHAT ARE THE CANDIDATES REALLY THINKING ...?

<P>
   ``Can you believe those rats?
</P>
<P>
   ``My own colleagues, guys from my side of the aisle, sneaking
around town whispering that I'm crackers? All because I spent 5 1/2
years in a stinking commie prison? My own side is fragging me while
I'm trying to run for president? And I'm supposed to take this
lying down? No way!
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this thing was going to get rough. But this is dirty!
These blind-side leaks that I'm some kind of mental case, they are
the lowest sort of blow. I remember when the Bush crowd did it to
Dukakis in '88. They got Reagan to make wisecracks about Dukakis's
mental health, and their pals in the media fanned the flames. But
at least that sneak attack was from the other party! What really
steams me is that these bozos are the same four or five who come
into the Senate Cloakroom and give me the big wave, and say, `Hey,
John, how's the campaign going?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Those weasels are all denying they were anywhere near the
planting of those rumors. What else would you expect? They're going
to come right out and say, `Yeah, I admit I told three reporters
Senator McCain was liable to go nuts?' No way. Those mealy-mouthed
so-and-sos can't stand the thought I might just win this thing and
tip over their money machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those back-stabbing SOBs are dipping as low as you can go
in the old sheep dip. I'm lying in a cell in Hanoi getting the crap
kicked out of me and these slime buckets are back here practicing
law and plotting their runs for high office? What's wrong with this
picture? Plenty! And these are the same creeps who are raping the
political process by grabbing all the soft money they can lay their
money-grubbing paws on. They're petrified that campaign finance
reform will eliminate their shakedown racket. They'd do anything to
keep the greenbacks flowing. They got their lobbyist pals to run
around the country last summer, saying my reforms would wipe out
the NRA and the antiabortion lobby. Anything to scare the hell out
of Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they got the governor back home to knock me and endorse
Bush, figuring that would pin me down in Arizona and make me spend
money to win my own primary. Next the Phoenix newspaper starts
attacking me for my temper; those people never could stand the fact
that I refused to kiss their butt. Now it's the don't-quote-me
rumors from my Republican colleagues. It just proves I'm getting to
be more of a threat to the status quo. Thank God for the vets.
They're sticking by me. These vets are unbelievable!
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 49 million veterans in this country. And most are with
me. OK, so Al Gore served in Vietnam in a noncombat job, but
nothing like the tour I did. I guess you could say I got extended
involuntarily, huh? And none of these other guys went anywhere near
Vietnam. Pat Buchanan got out of the draft because of a bad knee!
That's a hoot. Old Gimpy limped to victory in New Hampshire four
years ago. He's history now. Even if he gets the Reform Party
endorsement, and their $13 million in matching funds, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every vote Buchanan takes from Democrats, he takes two
from us. That's another reason I have to win this Republican
nomination. I just know in my bones I can do a better job of
cutting Buchanan down to size than Bush can. These Yale guys don't
know how to deal with a mug like Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also know I can't count too much on this veteran thing
to win me New Hampshire. Bush Senior and Bob Dole got licked up
here, Bob Kerrey, too. You can't just wave your medals and expect
to win New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit I'm astounded by how well it's going for us so
far. I shouldn't even be in this race, with Bush and Forbes able to
spend 50, 60, even 70 millionbucks. But these New Hampshire people
are unbelievable. They want to see you, meet you, shake hands, look
you in the eye. And they listen! I'd become so depressed by the
Washington scene, I was afraid voters were never going to listen to
any of us, again, they were so disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these folks up here actually think they can make a
difference! I love it! They're willing to say no to the party
establishment, and all those bigshots around Bush, and they're
willing to say `no way!' to a rich guy like Forbes, for all the
dough he spends.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guys, the World War II vets and the Korean guys, too,
they're dying off now at the rate of a thousand a day.
Unbelievable. All those good men. I look at that Sunday Globe obit
page every weekend I'm in New Hampshire, and you see dozens of
those American flags for the guys who served. And the gals, too. I
can't deny it, I get choked up a little when I think of everything
these old-timers went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``And these lard-asses in the Senate, these fakers from my own
party, who hid out at home while other people were getting shot at,
these same lying so-and-sos are bad-mouthing me from the safety of
the Cloakroom. `You can't trust McCain,' they whisper, `He's liable
to go bonkers from being a prisoner of war.' This is something
right out of `The Manchurian Candidate.' They can't take the heat
over dirty money, so they're trying to destroy me this way. What a
crock!
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend the better part of six years getting the tar whaled
out of me, and I'm supposed to come back here and roll over because
these frauds in the Senate don't want to give up their soft money
habit? And they whine that I'm not the real Republican? Well, to
hell with them. As I told my North Vietnamese guards on more than
one occasion, `Give it your best shot, baby, because if I get a
chance to come back at you, you're mine.' I know I have a big
mouth, can't help it. I still catch flak for that time I was
talking about retirees in Arizona's Leisure World and I called it
`Seizure World.' I can't help those kinds of wisecracks. Still
makes me laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if the voters of New Hampshire don't like my attitude,
well, I'm a big boy. Losing an election will not be the worst thing
that ever happened to John McCain. But I didn't sweat and bleed and
cry through 5 1/2 years in Hanoi to come back here and roll over
for a bunch of ambushers addicted to backdoor political money.
There's plenty of things worth taking heat for. And this cause is
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do nothing more than go down in flames trying to change
this corrupt system, it's still a fight worth fighting. It's no
different than strapping on a US government-issue Navy fighter and
flying off a carrier deck: There's no guarantees anybody gets home
safely. `You pays your money and you takes your choice.' That's OK
by me. Let 'er rip!''

BE CAREFUL WHERE ASHER DRAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 28, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The lower level of my condo has a concrete floor on ground.
Whenever the washing machine is used, water comes up in the floor
drain. What is wrong and how can it be fixed?
</P>
<P>
   WORRIED, in Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. What is wrong is that the washing machine may be draining
into a storm drain, which is illegal, and the storm drain is
blocked or partially blocked, allowing the backup. The washing
machine must drain into a sanitary sewer. So, get a plumber or have
the condo gurus, committee, or whatever they call the pople who
maintain the condos, do the work. Sincethe washing machine drains
under pressure, it may be overloading the drain.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rare possibility that the drain in the floor is a
sanitary sewer. If so, it should be not be open like that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I know I have to refinish the front of a dresser where nail
polish remover ruined the finish. But will a professional
refinisher be able to match the undamaged finish?
</P>
<P>
   REGINA HICKEY, Hingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, pretty well. Refinishers have a ton of stains, finishes,
and all kinds of other goodies in their workrooms to assure a
match, and remember, he has the dresser right there, where it will
be easy to check out various stains and finishes. Go for it. With
any craftsman worthy of the trade, you will get a match _ or one
that is so close you will not know it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have small birds in the attic. They come in at the open
rafters where they overhang the wall. How can I get rid of them?
</P>
<P>
   PETER LaGRASSA, Revere, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First you have to shoo out all the birds; that might be
possible with a broom and gentle persuasion. It is doubtful there
are any babies there now, so the birds should be able to manage
outdoors. Once they are out, plug the spaces between the rafters. I
suggest building a vent in each board that plugs the opening
between rafters. That way you will seal the attic against critters
and birds, and provide plenty of ventilation, which most attics
should have.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My poured kitchen floor is made of an epoxy type urethane,
and is in good shape. A 3/4-inch quarter-round is on the floor all
around the border of this room. The floor is shrinking and pulling
away from the quarter-round. How can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   MARION LICHENSTEIN, Randolph, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If there is a gap between quarter-round and floor, it is more
likely that the baseboard and quarter-round are drying out and
shrinking, and pulling up from the floor. To fix it, pull off the
quarter round and set it snug against the baseboard and floor, then
nail it to the baseboard, not the floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A large section of my kitchen ceiling, 12 by 3 feet, came
tumbling down. Just the horsehair plaster came down, leaving the
wood lath in place. I got three bids to fix it. Two bidders said
they would take down all the plaster and screw 1/2-inch Blueboard
on the wood lath, and finish with a skimcoat. The third bidder said
he'd have to take down the lath, too, before putting up the
Blueboard. Is that really necessary, seeing that the high bid was
$2,700 and the low bids were $900?
</P>
<P>
   CEILINGLESS in Massachusetts
</P>
<P>
   A. The gap between high and low bids is huge, especially for
what is going to be done. I agree that redoing the whole ceiling is
better than patching. Who knows when the rest of the ceiling might
come down? Generally there is no need to take down the lath,
especially if it is intact; even if it is not intact it can be
nailed back in place, ready to receive the Blueboard, which should
be screwed to strapping or joists behind the lath; the lath itself
would not hold Blueboard very well.
</P>
<P>
   It boils down to this: Accept one of the low bids and you will
get a serviceable ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a nice telephone table that is well worn and nicked
and scratched, but only the top. Is there a way to refinish just
the top?
</P>
<P>
   PETER RIVOIRA, Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There sure is, and it is not uncommon to refinish just the
top because many times the base and other parts of the table are in
great shape.
</P>
<P>
   It is a matter of removing the old finish and putting on a new
one. Sand the top to the bare wood, sanding deeply enough to remove
scratches (easy) and nicks and gouges (more difficult). In fact,
those gouges and nicks may not ever be sanded out because they are
too deep; in that case do the best you can and you will have a
``distressed'' finish, something some people pay good money for.
After sanding, clean with paint thinner and apply a stain to match
the old finish. You will have to experiment with the stain, but you
can get a reasonably close match. Even if the match is not perfect,
it won't matter that much. Finish with two coats of a semigloss
polyurethane varnish.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sanding, you can remove the finish with chemical
paint remover, but sanding still is needed to reduce those
scratches and nicks.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was talking about the woeful 1962 Mets, but Casey Stengel's
plaintive query fits sporting goods retailers in the late 1990's
just as well: Can't (italics)anybody(end italics) here play this
game?
</P>
<P>
   Among the full-line retailers in this $46 billion industry, the
four biggest publicly held companies are all losing money. No. 4,
Jumbo Sports, the Tampa, Fla., chain once known as Sports and
Recreation, is going out of business, and began liquidating its
last 42 stores earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Among more specialized chains, a large athletic shoe retailer,
Just for Feet of Birmingham, Ala., said in late October that it
would close more than a quarter of its 236 stores and reorganize
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Among privately held companies, Dick's, a full-line chain in
Pittsburgh with $580 million in annual sales, shelved an initial
public offering in May.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Authority, by far the biggest full-line player in this
fragmented industry, has seen its stock price plunge and its credit
rating follow as it bled cash and struggled for much longer than
expected to turn itself around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Authority and its competitors are feeling the brunt of
the intense competition in a market that really hasn't gone
anywhere,'' said Gerald Hirschberg, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's
who follows the company.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic retailing has been in a slump for two years because of
a sharp decline in demand for athletic shoes and apparel, which
account for at least half the stores' profits, analysts said. And
the demand that remains can find satisfaction in more ways than
ever: at mass merchandisers (Kmart and Wal-Mart Stores among them),
which together account for 35 percent of all sporting goods sales;
at specialty shops like Foot Locker, a unit of Venator; or at a
flock of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is struggling, and there's overcapacity in the
market, particularly in the metro areas,'' said Richard Nelson, an
analyst with Stephens &AMP; Co. ``Business has been tough for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports Authority's difficulties are emblematic. Its sales have
been eroding steadily: except for the first quarter of 1999, sales
at stores open at least 12 months have fallen from the year-earlier
period in every quarter since the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The company lost $64 million on sales of $1.6 billion for the
year ended Jan. 24, and it expects to finish the current year with
another loss, its third in a row, on sales of just $1.4 billion.
Some analysts expect a sliver of black ink in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, Sports Authority's stock has fallen by
92 percent, closing at $2.1875 on Friday; it went public in 1994, a
spinoff from Kmart, at $12 a share, adjusted for stock splits, and
peaked at $28.375 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 26, Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered its rating on Sports
Authority's subordinated debt to a dismal CCC(plus) from B(minus),
and knocked its corporate credit and bank loan ratings down from
B(plus) to B(minus), deep in speculative territory with a negative
outlook. Moody's also downgraded it last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a dicey environment, to say the least,'' said Martin
E. Hanaka, who has been chief executive of Sports Authority since
September 1998 and added the title of chairman on Nov. 9. ``We have
disappointed ourselves and our stakeholders by not performing the
way we should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanaka was brought in from Staples, where he had been president
and chief operating officer, to turn the flailing company around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's outstanding and brings a great perspective to the
business,'' said Nelson of Stephens. ``But these macroeconomic
issues will be difficult to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Central to the company's troubles, Hanaka said, are an uneven
product strategy and helter-skelter expansion. ``We became very
enamored with growth for growth's sake,'' he said. ``We grew in too
many geographic areas simultaneously. It was shotgun, not
strategic, growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's new stores, opened at a pace of one every 12 days
in 1996 and 1997, stuck to a ``one size fits all'' model that took
no account of regional or even seasonal variations. Hunting and
fishing departments, for example, were given the same amounts of
floor space year-round, even though one made money only in the fall
and the other only in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one assortment, one price model, one advertising
model, and one payroll model,'' Hanaka said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also did not look beyond full-line sporting goods
stores to address its far more powerful competitors: the mass
merchandisers. ``They underestimated how hard it would be to
compete against tough players like Wal-Mart and Kmart,'' said
Thomas B. Doyle, vice president for information and research of the
National Sporting Goods Association.
</P>
<P>
   Hanaka has not been idle. In the last year, Sports Authority has
moved to cut overhead and reorganize operations, renegotiate
contracts with suppliers, revamp its computer system and find ways
to trim freight bills. It sold most of its controlling stake in a
Japanese retail chain, Mega Sports, to concentrate on the United
States, and shuttered 15 American stores for poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than go it alone on the Internet, it joined with a
partner, Global Sports, in September to develop a sporting goods
auction Web site that opened for business earlier this month, and
struck a deal two weeks ago with Alliance Data Systems to introduce
a private-label credit card.

<P>
   The management reshuffling that brought Hanaka to the top is
still incomplete. William Cappiello, hired last December as
president and chief merchandiser from Saks Fifth Avenue, was
dismissed after just seven months. The post has been vacant since
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say that even a perfectly run Sports Authority
may not be able to thrive for long, just as past leaders like
Herman's have come to grief, because of the inherent limitations of
the sporting goods category.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in this world has woken up in the morning and said, `I
want to go buy (italics)sporting goods(end italics),''' said Aram
Rubinson, an analyst at PaineWebber. There is very little
cross-participation in sports: a recent survey found that only 14
percent of golfers hunt, only 7 percent of campers play tennis and
only 5 percent of basketball players play racquetball.
</P>
<P>
   So ``the synergy of carrying all these products under one roof
is not great,'' Rubinson said. ``It's not as if you walk in for a
tennis racquet and walk out with a bowling ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanaka says traffic in Sports Authority stores will rise if the
shopping experience becomes more appealing. He wants to tone down
its emphasis on men and to aim more at women and children, the
sector's strongest growth categories. ``We're trying to be a family
sports store,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has rolled out a new store design, introduced in
Clifton, N.J., in March, with brighter lighting, more attractive
displays and a more flexible merchandise mix. Shoes are displayed
in the center, and ``pie slices'' radiate outward for each sport so
that customers can readily find appropriate apparel and equipment
without having to hunt all over the store.
</P>
<P>
   Hanaka said the company would commit up to $30 million to
renovating old stores and building a few new ones on the Clifton
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to build the company while we're trying to fix the
store,'' he said. ``We're building this company for the long
haul.''
</P>
<P>
   The unraveling of companies like Just for Feet and Jumbo Sports
has dumped a lot of merchandise on the market at liquidation prices
and cast a pall across the industry. But the contraction may work
to Sports Authority's longer-term advantage by eliminating excess
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is ripe for consolidation,'' said Nelson of
Stephens. ``There are too many stores and too much square footage.
Until we see some rationalization, it's going to be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Deals were in the air a year and a half ago, when Venator made
an offer for Sports Authority. Two months later, in July 1998, Gart
Sports/Sportmart, the No. 2 independent full-line chain, also made
a bid. Both deals foundered because stock prices slid in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   If size is paramount, Sports Authority has the critical mass to
survive a shakeout. For all its difficulties, it remains by far the
leader in the field, with 201 stores in 32 states and more sales
than the next three publicly traded sporting goods retailers
combined: Gart Sports/Sportmart, Jumbo Sports and Oshman's.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to securing a profitable future, anything the
retailers do may matter less than a fickle factor beyond their
control: the marketing budgets of the big manufacturers, especially
the sneaker makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers are the only ones with the resources to change
the environment through promotion, advertising and new products,''
said Doyle of the National Sporting Goods Association. And there
are signs that they are coming off the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years of concentrating on corporate brand building,
Nike has told its customers that it will increase marketing and
advertising spending by 30 percent next spring, Hanaka said. Reebok
has told retailers that it will increase media spending by 60
percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to sell to the retailer and let them fend for
themselves,'' said Peter Roby, Reebok's vice president for United
States marketing. ``In this market, we have to help them attract
consumers.'' The top shoe brands are not sold in discount chains,
so stepped-up marketing by Nike and Reebok promises to help Sports
Authority compete with the Kmarts and Wal-Marts.
</P>
<P>
   Hanaka said he was guardedly optimistic about the coming year,
which will include the Summer Olympics and, presumably, an
undisrupted NBA season, both good for sales: ``2000,'' he said,
``will be a telling year for the industry.''

-- FARMS, 11-26 -- Vince Faivre, a midwestern grain farmer, on his
700 acre farm 60 miles west of Chicago. For the second consecutive
year, Faivre expects to lose money, as much as $60 an acre.
``There's just no profit in farming anymore,'' says Faivre, 39. ``A
year ago, I would have said we've been through these valleys
before, but it's a much gloomier picture right now.'' (Todd

The main street of Osgood, whose nonprofit organizations were left
$23 million by Gilmore and Golda Reynolds, two industrious locals.
In an age of multibillion-dollar buyouts and nine-digit lottery
jackpots, $23 million might not seem like a fortune. But to this
one-stoplight southern Indiana town, whose annual operating budget
hovers around $300,000, it's enough to make a huge difference.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A private plane carrying a Maryland family home after
Thanksgiving in New York crashed in Newark Friday, killing all
three on board and injuring 25 others as it plowed along a street,
struck buildings and cars and broke into flaming debris that set
off fires, explosions and chaos in a largely residential
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash was not immediately determined,
investigators said, although weather may have been a factor. Two
employees at Linden Airport, eight miles south of Newark, had
advised the plane's owner-pilot, Itzhak Jacoby, an experienced
flier, against taking off in rain and dense fog.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby, 56, and his wife, Gail, 50, both senior officials of
federal health facilities near Washington, and their 13-year-old
daughter, Atira, were killed. On the ground, a 59-year-old man in a
car hit in the crash suffered critical burns, a 29-year-old woman
was severely burned and 16 others were hospitalized with burns,
cuts and other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after takeoff from Linden Airport into a gray,
late-morning rain that had cut visibility to about 100 feet, the
single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza disappeared from radar screens,
went into a tailspin and plunged down in Newark's Central Ward,
about a mile west of the downtown area of New Jersey's largest
city.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the aircraft struck the parapet of a three-story
factory, whose roof was set ablaze. Then, as a wing flew off, the
plane dived down on a street lined with multiple-family houses, hit
and set fire to nine cars, and at the end of a block hit a closed
restaurant. The impact sheared off the side of the plane, hurling
bodies out, and sent debris flying across a commercial avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told of a neighborhood suddenly plunged into chaos,
with the roar of the crashing plane, with car explosions that blew
in the windows and doors of houses, with power lines down and
zapping, and with flying glass and flaming debris that hit
bystanders and nearly decapitated a man sitting in a car whose roof
was torn away. Sixty residents were evacuated from damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a pretty holiday picture,'' Mayor Sharpe James
said as police officers cordoned off what seemed like a war zone in
the area of Kent Street and Springfield Avenue, while firefighters
battled flames, ambulances rushed burned and bleeding victims away
and federal and state investigators began an inquiry into the cause
of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Itzhak Jacoby was director of the Health Services Administration
at the Uniformed Services University, the medical school of the
Department of Defense, and had been a member of its faculty since
1989. His wife was director of planning at the National Institute
on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who immigrated from Israel years ago and lived in
Bethesda, Md., with the younger of their two daughters, had flown
to Linden earlier in the week to spend the holiday with family
members in New York, acquaintances said. They were to fly Friday to
Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Va., and took off at
10:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man, his wife and daughter took off after being advised by
two linemen not to do so,'' Linden's Mayor John Gregorio said,
referring to two airport employees and recounting a conversation he
had with the airport manager, Paul Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes after takeoff, the plane vanished from
controllers' radar screens, James Peters, a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration, said. It was unclear what went
wrong, although James said in a briefing that the aircraft had
apparently experienced engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 1964 Beechcraft Bonanza with four seats, a V-shaped
tail and a cruising speed of about 200 mph, is regarded in aviation
circles as highly reliable. There are about 190,000 small planes in
the nation; last year there were 361 crashes involving such small
planes, with 621 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby's plane, white with red trim, took off in a northerly
direction and was to circle west and then south to travel the 220
air miles to Dulles. But it had flown only eight miles and had
gained little altitude when a Newark police officer, Wayne
Reynolds, saw it wobbling, its engine irregular.
</P>
<P>
   The plane then began spinning down out of control. Newark's
deputy police director, Rocco Malanga, said it came down over
Woodland Cemetery and hit the roof of an old factory at Kent and
Brenner Streets. One wing came off, and the factory roof caught
fire. Three workmen on the ground floor escaped uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft then skipped over the building's parapet and down
into Kent Street, where it struck several parked cars, setting them
afire and spewing flaming debris over the street, Malanga said. At
the end of Kent Street, the fuselage of the plane sideswiped a KFC
restaurant at Springfield and 18th Avenues.

LOCAL COUPLE LEAVES $23 MILLION ESTATE TO HELP INDIANA TOWN

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSGOOD, Ind. _ In an age of multibillion-dollar buyouts and
nine-digit lottery jackpots, $23 million might not seem like a
fortune anymore. But to this one-stoplight southern Indiana town,
whose annual operating budget hovers around $300,000, it's enough
to make a huge difference.
</P>
<P>
   That is the difference that was made by Gilmore and Golda
Reynolds, a pair of lifelong locals, when they decided to bequeath
all their wealth, most of it earned through the stock market, to
their beloved Osgood, population 1,688.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents had been aware that the couple were well off. But
few had known the extent of their wealth until just last week, when
the estate of Mrs. Reynolds, who was widowed in 1990 and died in
March of last year, announced that the Gilmore and Golda Reynolds
Foundation, which she had established soon after her husband's
death, would be funded with everything the couple had amassed: $23
million after taxes. The foundation, which will serve as a conduit
for the largess to Osgood, is an endeavor which the Reynoldses long
planned together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew they had money, they just didn't know how
much,'' said Kenny White, who has lived in Osgood all his 53 years.
``We all thought they maybe wanted to give a million dollars or so.
It's amazing they made that kind of money in such a small town.''
</P>
<P>
   Made it, and saved it. The Reynoldses, who had no children,
lived modestly and very privately on the town's main street in a
white stucco house where, friends say, the worn carpet bunched up
in spots and the furniture lasted decades. Perhaps the only hints
of their affluence were vacations to far-off places and the new
Cadillac they bought every two years. They also liked to eat out,
but they usually ventured only as far as the nearby town of
Versailles, for nothing more fancy than fried chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget when Goldie came back from a trip _ I think
it was a cruise _ and Gilmore had convinced her to go first
class,'' said Donna Hooton, a close friend of the couple. ``She
said to me, `Donna, don't waste your money, it's not worth it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore's death in 1990, at the age of 91, brought an end not
only to a 62-year marriage that sprang from a checkers game at a
local barbershop but also to an extremely lucrative business
partnership. During their years in Osgood, the couple owned a
variety of businesses: an appliance store, a car dealership, a
candy and tobacco wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   If their furnishings at home often seemed dated, the same could
never be said of their wares. White recalled that as a boy, he
watched a World Series game on a color television set in the
Reynoldses' appliance shop, at a time before most people in Osgood
had black-and-white sets.
</P>
<P>
   After selling their last business, a propane distributorship, in
the 1960s, the couple spent daylight to dusk poring over The Wall
Street Journal in the dingy basement furnace room where they honed
their investing skills. Gilmore was the one with the grand ideas;
Golda made the meticulous stock charts that lined the walls.
</P>
<P>
   The Reynoldses intended that the money they left benefit
schools, libraries, churches and the like, said their lawyer, Neil
Comer. So their bequest will flow not to the coffers of the
municipal government but instead to the area's nonprofit
organizations, which will apply for grants from the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Golda, through the foundation, began doling out relatively small
grants to nonprofit organizations soon after Gilmore's death. Some
of that money enabled the volunteer fire department to buy a new
engine last year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the six trustees who will now be charged with
distributing grants from the couple's fortune is Michael Black, a
detective with the Indiana state police, an Osgood resident and a
grand-nephew of Mrs. Reynolds. He shrugs off a question surely
obvious to any of the couple's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it be nice for all of us to have $23 million?'' he said.
``Sure. I'm sure some thought about what it would be like to be an
heir. But this way, the money will go to the good use of a lot of
people.''

   Holiday Shopping Season Begins in Malls and on Web
</P>
<P>
   As the holiday shopping season began the big question was not
whether Americans would spend a lot of money _ sales of merchandise
are expected to reach $184 billion for November and December _ but
where they would spend it: online or at the mall. Estimates for Web
sales run as high as $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Early spot reports indicated that e-shopping is fast becoming as
much a holiday tradition as strolling the concourse. And at least
on the day after Thanksgiving, there were also sporadic reports of
service trouble on the Web , while traditional merchants were doing
a better-than-expected job of making visitors comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon-Mobil Approval Expected
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust officials at the Federal Trade Commission have
notified the states that they intend to recommend the approval of
Exxon's $81 billion acquisition of Mobil next week. The move came
after the companies agreed to the largest divestiture in the
commission's history. At the same time, federal and state officials
have raised serious antitrust questions about BP Amoco's proposed
$29 billion purchase of Atlantic Richfield.
</P>
<P>
   Californians paid an average of about 26 cents more for a gallon
of gas than other Americans in the first eight months of this year,
according to a report released this week by the state's attorney
general. And those high prices have become a focal point as federal
and state regulators consider whether to approve the mergers
between Exxon and Mobil and between BP Amoco and Atlantic
Richfield.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Shares Have Strong Week
</P>
<P>
   Ariel, a technology company that was forced only last month to
renegotiate its debts, rose more than 800 percent this week after
it announced that it would begin selling a product to compete with
offerings from the much larger Cisco Systems and Lucent
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Personal Incomes Jump 1.3 Percent
</P>
<P>
   Personal incomes in October rose at the fastest pace in five and
a half years, 1.3 percent, and personal spending grew 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sega Losses More Than Expected
</P>
<P>
   Sega Enterprises, the beleaguered videogame company, said its
losses in the first half of the fiscal year were larger than had
been expected. The company blamed a 50 percent increase in
marketing and other costs associated with the introduction of its
Dreamcast video console for the losses at the parent company of
19.1 billion yen, or $183.8 million, in the six months that ended
Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Bond Yield Soars to 6.23 Percent
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.23 percent from 6.20
percent on Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite index set its 16th
record in the last four weeks, jumping 27.31 points, to 3,447.81.
But the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 0.46 points, to
1,416.62, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.26 points,
to 10,988.91.

   Some Transitions Of the Tumultuous Kind &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the terminal at the new Northwest Arkansas Regional
Airport near Fayetteville was formally named for Alice Walton, the
only daughter of the late Sam Walton. She had been a prime backer
of the airport, and her investment firm, the Llama Co., underwrote
the $80 million in bonds that financed it. When President Clinton
flew in a year ago to dedicate the airport, he singled her out for
credit. Passenger boardings there continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Walton's hopes to become a major regional financier have
faltered. Llama, based in Fayetteville, has struggled to find its
identity _ and retain executive talent _ since she founded it in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   This year has seen more tumult. In the spring, it withdrew a
$300 million junk bond offering, citing market conditions, after
which five employees left. It sold its $300 million investment
management unit to its staff. It saw the departure of its managing
director as it withdrew from public finance. It got into
compensation disputes with three former executives.
</P>
<P>
   The Llama Holding Co., Ms. Walton's umbrella corporation, is
left with a rapidly growing jet maintenance and finishing
operation, a greatly reduced brokerage division, a unit that deals
in retailers' receivables, and some other investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, we continue to be more and more focused on our
aerospace activity,'' said Lynn DeVault, chief executive of Llama
Holding.
</P>
<P>
   That shift does little to quell questions among some of the
state's business leaders over whether Ms. Walton, having scaled
back some Llama operations, prefers to simply enjoy the dividends
from her roughly $19 billion in Wal-Mart stock. The speculation
began in earnest last year when Ms. Walton moved from Arkansas to
Mineral Wells, Texas, west of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Not even that transition was painless: in July, United Van Lines
sued Ms. Walton for $14,000, contending that she had refused to pay
for moving belongings from an East Side Manhattan apartment to
Texas. Ms. Walton argued that her possessions had been damaged, and
the case was settled several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walton could not be reached for comment on Friday, but Ms.
DeVault said she remains dedicated to Llama and to the region's
development. ``Alice remains in the business. Absolutely,'' Ms.
DeVault said.

   Applauding the Life of the Party &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Committee to Protect Journalists held its annual dinner at
the Waldorf-Astoria last Tuesday, raising more than $1 million and
handing out awards to five who had been beaten, jailed, or
threatened for their lives. Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of
Time Inc. and a former editor of The Wall Street Journal, served as
dinner chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were rather dignified. But then Tom Brokaw stood
to introduce Pearlstine, saying he was so effective overseeing the
Time Inc. magazines that Walter Isaacson, the managing editor of
Time magazine, ``can go to all the Manhattan cocktail parties he
likes.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson was too busy chatting with Massimo Calabresi, a
correspondent for Time magazine in Washington, to notice.

   One Degree of Separation &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week's career advice: To become a Pulitzer Prize-winning
editorial cartoonist, judging from the careers of Jeff MacNelly of
the Chicago Tribune and Doug Marlette, of Newsday, follow these
easy steps: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Go to college. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Leave before graduating.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go to work as editorial cartoonist.
</P>
<P>
   _ Collect a Pulitzer.
</P>
<P>
   All that comes from thumbnail biographies in the current issue
of Brill's Content. But Marlette's comments in an interview last
week suggest another point:
</P>
<P>
   _ Once your alma mater needs you more than you need it, collect
a degree.
</P>
<P>
   Marlette said his senior-year decision to combine a philosophy
major with his art major left him six hours short of having enough
Spanish to meet the Florida State University language requirement
for budding philosophers. Marlette left, going directly to The
Charlotte Observer in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the school announced the discovery of a loophole,
through which he picked up his degree in March. He returned in
September to have the Golden Key National Honor Society declare him
a ``Graduate Made Good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months,'' Marlette said. ``This is the fastest a graduate
had made good.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange, says he has convinced the members of his 207-year-old
institution that the best way to cope with the change rocking Wall
Street is to create it.
</P>
<P>
   His persuasiveness, he believes, will be in evidence on
Thursday, when the NYSE board convenes. At that time, Grasso
expects that it will vote to kill a venerable regulation that some
consider to be archaic and monopolistic: Rule 390, which forbids
member firms from trading stocks that were listed on the exchange
before 1979 anywhere but on the floor of a traditional stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   By voting the rule into history, the exchange will essentially
open trading in all of its listed shares to competition for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Although this may not sound like a big deal, it is a major
turnabout from two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, in a major speech in New York, the chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt, asked the Big
Board to spike the rule in the spirit of free and unfettered
markets. ``One way or another,'' Levitt said, ``Rule 390 should not
be in our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Grasso responded with a shrug, saying he had no plans to kill
the rule. That reinforced the view that the exchange seemed unable
to embrace the change that has been remaking the financial markets
of late.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as a storm has tossed Wall Street, replacing many
traditional players with racy upstarts, the NYSE has steamed calmly
and regally on. Most of the upheaval has been felt instead on the
NASDAQ stock market, home to America's favorite technology and
Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Here, youthful entrepreneurs have taken big transaction volume
away from traditional brokerage firms by creating upstart trading
networks where investors can meet to buy and sell NASDAQ stocks.
Almost a third of NASDAQ trades are now executed on an electronic
communications network.
</P>
<P>
   It was business as usual, meanwhile, at the Big Board. Its share
of trading in NYSE-listed stocks has remained remarkably steady, at
around 83 percent, for the past two years, according to Gregory
Smith, research analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco.
Inroads by regional exchanges or so-called third-market firms were
tiny.
</P>
<P>
   That will likely change with Rule 390 out the window. So what
brought the NYSE around?
</P>
<P>
   Grasso said he was able to persuade his membership that the
rule, meant to keep trades in the arena where they would be exposed
to the greatest number of investors, had come to reflect badly on
the institution. ``It was intended to protect the customer,''
Grasso said. ``Now, people believe the rule is there to protect the
exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the rule now applies to only 30 percent of the
companies listed on the exchange, which account for 48 percent of
total volume. For this reason, ``I frankly don't think there will
be much of a difference when it's repealed,'' Grasso said.
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so sure. Smith, for example, believes that some of
the NYSE's market share in big, heavily traded companies will
migrate to electronic communications networks now trading NASDAQ
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But even if its share of trading in its own listings declines,
the Big Board may pick up volume from elsewhere. Earlier this
month, Grasso announced plans to create an ECN at the exchange that
would handle trades of NASDAQ and other stocks. The network,
expected to be up and running by July, will display investors'
orders for all to see, something that Levitt also favors.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting times. And now, let the competition for the best
trading venue begin.

BE CAREFUL WHERE WASHER DRAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 28, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The lower level of my condo has a concrete floor on ground.
Whenever the washing machine is used, water comes up in the floor
drain. What is wrong and how can it be fixed?
</P>
<P>
   WORRIED, in Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. What is wrong is that the washing machine may be draining
into a storm drain, which is illegal, and the storm drain is
blocked or partially blocked, allowing the backup. The washing
machine must drain into a sanitary sewer. So, get a plumber or have
the condo gurus, committee, or whatever they call the pople who
maintain the condos, do the work. Sincethe washing machine drains
under pressure, it may be overloading the drain.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rare possibility that the drain in the floor is a
sanitary sewer. If so, it should be not be open like that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I know I have to refinish the front of a dresser where nail
polish remover ruined the finish. But will a professional
refinisher be able to match the undamaged finish?
</P>
<P>
   REGINA HICKEY, Hingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, pretty well. Refinishers have a ton of stains, finishes,
and all kinds of other goodies in their workrooms to assure a
match, and remember, he has the dresser right there, where it will
be easy to check out various stains and finishes. Go for it. With
any craftsman worthy of the trade, you will get a match _ or one
that is so close you will not know it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have small birds in the attic. They come in at the open
rafters where they overhang the wall. How can I get rid of them?
</P>
<P>
   PETER LaGRASSA, Revere, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First you have to shoo out all the birds; that might be
possible with a broom and gentle persuasion. It is doubtful there
are any babies there now, so the birds should be able to manage
outdoors. Once they are out, plug the spaces between the rafters. I
suggest building a vent in each board that plugs the opening
between rafters. That way you will seal the attic against critters
and birds, and provide plenty of ventilation, which most attics
should have.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My poured kitchen floor is made of an epoxy type urethane,
and is in good shape. A 3/4-inch quarter-round is on the floor all
around the border of this room. The floor is shrinking and pulling
away from the quarter-round. How can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   MARION LICHENSTEIN, Randolph, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If there is a gap between quarter-round and floor, it is more
likely that the baseboard and quarter-round are drying out and
shrinking, and pulling up from the floor. To fix it, pull off the
quarter round and set it snug against the baseboard and floor, then
nail it to the baseboard, not the floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A large section of my kitchen ceiling, 12 by 3 feet, came
tumbling down. Just the horsehair plaster came down, leaving the
wood lath in place. I got three bids to fix it. Two bidders said
they would take down all the plaster and screw 1/2-inch Blueboard
on the wood lath, and finish with a skimcoat. The third bidder said
he'd have to take down the lath, too, before putting up the
Blueboard. Is that really necessary, seeing that the high bid was
$2,700 and the low bids were $900?
</P>
<P>
   CEILINGLESS in Massachusetts
</P>
<P>
   A. The gap between high and low bids is huge, especially for
what is going to be done. I agree that redoing the whole ceiling is
better than patching. Who knows when the rest of the ceiling might
come down? Generally there is no need to take down the lath,
especially if it is intact; even if it is not intact it can be
nailed back in place, ready to receive the Blueboard, which should
be screwed to strapping or joists behind the lath; the lath itself
would not hold Blueboard very well.
</P>
<P>
   It boils down to this: Accept one of the low bids and you will
get a serviceable ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a nice telephone table that is well worn and nicked
and scratched, but only the top. Is there a way to refinish just
the top?
</P>
<P>
   PETER RIVOIRA, Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There sure is, and it is not uncommon to refinish just the
top because many times the base and other parts of the table are in
great shape.
</P>
<P>
   It is a matter of removing the old finish and putting on a new
one. Sand the top to the bare wood, sanding deeply enough to remove
scratches (easy) and nicks and gouges (more difficult). In fact,
those gouges and nicks may not ever be sanded out because they are
too deep; in that case do the best you can and you will have a
``distressed'' finish, something some people pay good money for.
After sanding, clean with paint thinner and apply a stain to match
the old finish. You will have to experiment with the stain, but you
can get a reasonably close match. Even if the match is not perfect,
it won't matter that much. Finish with two coats of a semigloss
polyurethane varnish.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sanding, you can remove the finish with chemical
paint remover, but sanding still is needed to reduce those
scratches and nicks.

DUVAL NOT SURPRISED BY WOODS' BRILLIANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIO, Calif. _ David Duval, who was passed by Tiger Woods for
the top spot in this year's world golf rankings, said he is amazed
at Woods' brilliant season.
</P>
<P>
   But not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with him at the Ryder Cup, and even before that I
could see it coming,'' he said. ``He has been playing so very well.
I don't know what else to say but that it is amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that I will have to improve to play
with Tiger now. I have always strived to improve to become a better
player. It's a nice challenge, and I look forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fred Couples said it is unfair to compare another young
phenom, Sergio Garcia, with Woods simply because Woods is so much
better than everyone else at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anyone being compared to Tiger right now,'' he
said. ``Sergio is a young, young player. He's got the world ahead
of him. In a few years, once Sergio plays over here, you'll get
some better comparisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Garcia, ``We are both very aggressive players, but we also
are very different players. We have our own ways to play the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said the comparisons don't bother him, nor does the
talkback home that his countrymen expect him to do as well as Seve
Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal, who have major championships
to their credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the comparisons,'' he said, ``but I'm Sergio Garcia,
and people can't expect me to do the things they (Ballesteros and
Olazabal) have done. People are going to have to give me some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't approach a year thinking I have to win a certain
number of tournaments. I am just trying to do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara said Garcia not only can do it all, but adds a
lotto the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has power, a lot of creativity, he has a short game and
he's a great putter,'' he said, ``but to be honest, I was surprised
he took off as fast as he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a breath of fresh air. He has a lot of charisma, and
he's excited to be playing. He's young and puts flair back into
golf, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Landmark Golf Club, the new home of the Skins Game, figures
to be a challenging test.
</P>
<P>
   The Skins Game will be played on parts of the North and South
courses. The South will be used on the front nine, with the
exception of the second hole. That will be the No. 2 hole on the
North, and the back nine will be played on the North.
</P>
<P>
   Holes will play as long as 570 yards (No. 8) to 183 yards (No.
15). The par-three sixth and 13th holes will play to an imposing
231 and 232 yards, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a good test,'' Landmark Golf senior vice
president Johnny Pott said, ``but David Duval shot 59 on what I
think is one of the hardest courses in the world (the Arnold Palmer
Course at PGA West last January), so we'll have to see.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: VIOLENCE DURING PLAY, NOT AFTER IT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this week the National Football League, which oversees
the most violent sport in America, placed throat slashing on its
list of banned gestures. So players can't shimmy, can't rip their
helmets off and can't otherwise indulge in extended celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is treading on freedom of expression as it delves into
image management, controlling the flow of human emotion in a game
that is defined by emotion and mayhem. Fans are bombarded by
graphic images virtually jumping out of giant TV screens. The
fantastic stage of sports is like a cartoon, only real: Crunching
tackles. Thunder dunks. Hockey players beating each other to bloody
pulps, sometimes climbing over the glass to get at fans.
</P>
<P>
   Fans curse players, players curse back. I'm not a fan of the
slash, but I am a fan of freedom of expression, especially in the
context of the game.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to the movies for months and not see the improvised
drama that mainstream sports present on a daily basis. The leagues
and owners walk a thin line, stoking the emotional and competitive
fires, whipping up fans and trying to confine players' passions to
neat, acceptable boxes of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player in every locker room understands that gesture,''
Jets receiver Keyshawn Johnson said of the throat-slashing motion.
``It's like you're saying, `You can't stop me' or `In your face.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Johnnie Morton of the Detroit Lions made the
game-clinching catch in a hard-fought game against the Chicago
Bears. To underscore the dramatic moment, he jumped up and started
to make the slashing motion across his neck. Before the 190-pound
receiver could make the first incision, Barrett Brooks, a
6-foot-4-inch, 326-pound tackle, grabbed him and delivered a short
lecture, effectively saving his teammate a hefty fine.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later the receiver, the quarterback and another player
appeared on the sideline for a post-game interview in front of a
table with a turkey. On cue, the players grabbed the legs and
ripped them off the carcass, then held up their trophy drumsticks.
</P>
<P>
   There is butchery and acceptable butchery.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami's game at Dallas on Thursday, after Deion Sanders made
a leaping interception of a Dan Marino pass, a Dallas coach,
inspired by the moment, ran over to Sanders and planted a kiss on
his helmet. Next week the NFL, perhaps moved by protest from
conservatives, will ban such public displays of intimacy lest they
trigger a spate of helmet kissing by the youth of America.
</P>
<P>
   The more difficult task for the NFL is balancing symbolic
gestures, which mean nothing, with conflicting images, which mean
everything. This is a job the league is not equipped to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Image: Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth in a jail uniform.
Friday a judge set bond at $1.5 million for Carruth, one of three
men charged in the drive-by shooting of the player's pregnant
girlfriend. Carruth was arrested Thursday and charged with
conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, attempted murder and
shooting into an occupied vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Image: Andre Patterson, the Minnesota Vikings' defensive line
coach, and his wife, Donna, snuggling with their 15-month-old
adopted daughter. Nicole was born to a 14-year-old Minneapolis girl
who was involved in prostitution. The baby's mother used crack
cocaine and abused alcohol. There was also evidence that Nicole was
abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been through more in a year than I've been through in
39,'' Patterson said Thursday. ``When she wakes up in the middle of
the night with the nightmares, and she's sleeping but still crying
and still screaming, all curled up in a little ball, we talk to her
and rub her back. Then she wakes up finally and sees it's us, and
she relaxes and goes back to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month the Pattersons will appear before a judge who is
expected to grant them final custody of Nicole.
</P>
<P>
   Image: Indianapolis defensive back Steve Muhammad returning to
practice. Next month, Muhammad is scheduled for a hearing on three
counts of misdemeanor battery in connection with an Oct. 28
incident with his wife at their apartment in Indianapolis. His
wife, Nichole, died of labor complications stemming from a minor
automobile accident on Nov. 7, seven hours after the couple's child
was stillborn.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad is free on $30,000 bond and, if convicted on all
counts, he could be sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
   What's it going to be: image or gesture? The kiss or the slash?
The league encourages players to pound each other's brains into
jelly. Just don't act as if you enjoy it.

STUDY DOCUMENTS HIGH COST OF CARING FOR ELDERLY RELATIVES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A small study that surveyed the economic cost to people who
provide informal care for elderly relatives has found that working
people who provide the care sacrifice substantial wages and
benefits by passing up promotions, training and transfers, and
taking extended time off from their jobs to fulfill their family
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 55 people surveyed, nearly two-thirds reported that
taking care of an elderly relative or friend had cut into their
earnings, and the cost to 30 of those who were able to provide
enough information to quantify the financial effect was estimated
at an average of $659,139 in lost wages, Social Security and
pension benefits over their lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted for Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. by the
National Alliance for Caregivers and the National Center for Women
and Aging at Brandeis University, was intended as a follow-up to a
larger study in 1997 by the alliance and AARP.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 study, which surveyed 1,509 people, found that one in
four families had at least one adult who had provided care for an
elderly relative or friend in the past 12 months in which they had
been interviewed. The 55 people who were surveyed recently were
selected from the 1997 study.
</P>
<P>
   In honoring their obligations to elderly relatives, those who
provide care may endanger their own long-term financial health,
said Phyllis Mutschler, executive director of the National Center
for Women and Aging at Brandeis.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the costs of long-term care are rising along with
the skyrocketing numbers of elderly Americans; the National
Alliance for Caregivers estimates that the number of employed
people who provide such family care will grow 11 million to 15.6
million over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elder care is to the 21st century what child care has been for
the last few decades,'' said Joyce Ruddock, a gerontologist who
heads the Long-Term Care Group at Metropolitan Life.
</P>
<P>
   The caregivers first surveyed were 45 or older at the time, and
they provided, on average, about eight years of care.
</P>
<P>
   Of those interviewed, 29 percent said they passed up job
promotions or training, 25 percent passed up job transfers and 22
percent were not able to acquire new job skills.
</P>
<P>
   Among those providing financial information, the average total
loss in wage wealth, which the survey defined as the current value
of lifetime wages calculated as of the date of the retirement, was
$566,443. In addition to current income, they also lost retirement
savings.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of their taking care of the elderly, those surveyed
estimated that their Social Security benefits decreased an average
of $2,160 annually. Over their retirement years, their lost Social
Security wealth averages $25,494.
</P>
<P>
   Among those surveyed who are eligible for pensions and able to
provide information about them, their estimated average pension
benefits fell by $5,339 annually as a result of their elder care,
or $67,202 in pension wealth, on average, over their retirement
years.
</P>
<P>
   Providing care at home is expensive, with those surveyed
reporting that they spent an average $364 a month for assistance
with rent or mortgages for the elderly relative they were helping,
and $322 a month for home care professionals. On average,
caregivers helped with these expenses for two to six years,
spending a total of $19,525 in out-of-pocket expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Being responsible for an elderly relative can strain the health
of those who work and provide such care, and result in missed days
of work, early retirement and decreased effectiveness on the job.
Almost three-fourths of those surveyed said that elder care had
affected their health.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-two percent of those surveyed reporting asking
supervisors, co-workers or management for some kind of support or
help with their responsibilities at home. The support received was
primarily informal, the survey said. Few companies provide formal
support for employees who provide care for elderly relatives; only
23 percent of companies with 100 or more employees have programs in
place to support elder care, the Families and Work Institute said.

CREATURE COMFORTS: BEST ANIMAL BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all know by now that giving animals as presents is not a good
idea. (Well, everyone knows except those TV advertisers who insist
on showing commercials with beribbonned puppies under the Christmas
tree.) But giving animal books? It's safe, it's humane, and, even
more important, the box won't leak.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the picks of the litter:
</P>
<P>
   --What do you get when you cross an elephant with a coffee table
book? Books you can't lift, but will never forget. And this year,
there are two such volumes: ``African Elephants,'' by wildlife
photographer Reinhard Kunkel (Abrams, $49.50), and ``Elephants: A
Cultural and Natural History,'' by Karl Groning and Martin Saller
(Konemann, $39.95). Kunkel's is a significantly revised version of
the book originally published in 1982. Thirty years of elephant
watching are captured in prose printed on thick paper up front,
followed by page upon page of striking images. Groning and Saller's
``Elephants'' is a stunning overview, containing everything you
always wanted to know about elephants. From fossil evidence of
Mediterranean elephants the size of Shetland ponies (please, Mom,
can I have one?) to elephants in mythology, art, zoos, and
conservation, it's a packed pachyderm primer.
</P>
<P>
   --He is charged by Cape buffalo, stalked by jaguars, and beset
by strange parasites. In his adrenaline-inducing book ``Appointment
at the Ends of the World'' (Warner Books, $27), wildlife
veterinarian William Karesh takes readers on a wild, globe-trotting
ride. This memoir is filled with enough heart-pounding action,
excruciating medical description, and near-constant danger to
catapult us armchair adventurers past the edge of our seats, and
maybe even clear over the hassock. From his base at the Bronx Zoo,
Karesh spends two-thirds of the year traveling for the Wildlife
Conservation Society. We get to follow him as he searches out
forest elephants in Cameroon, okapis (odd giraffe cousins) and
rhinos in Zaire, orangutans in Borneo, and peccaries in Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   --``There are other windows through which we humans can look out
into the world around us, windows through which the mystics and the
holy men of the East, and the founders of the great world
religions, have gazed. . . . That afternoon, it had been as though
an unseen hand had drawn back a curtain and, for the briefest
moment, I had seen through such a window.'' Would you believe this
is a passage from renowned primatologist Jane Goodall's latest
book? The transforming moment she describes comes while she sits
with a group of her now-famous Gombe chimpanzees during a tropical
downpour and shortly after the death of her husband, Derek.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey,'' with Phillip
Berman (Warner Books, $26.95), is a remarkable surprise from the
woman who has spent 30 years reporting scientific discoveries from
the realm of the chimps. But Goodall does not think that science
and spirituality are mutually exclusive. And she writes of her
life's work and loves and of her own philosophical journey in her
trademark no-nonsense, yet often lyrical, style.
</P>

   --You could stuff a million stockings with the little artsy pet
picture books that come out every year. But one stands tall among
the others: ``Pug Shots,'' by Jim Dratfield (Viking, $19.95). Here,
pugs give dachshunds a run for the funny-in-pictures money, and
that is played for all they've got in this book, which has
hysterical photos matched with clever captions. A dog yawning with
a fright wig on its head is ``Pug in a Rug,'' and two pugs sitting
on a car's motor are ``Pugz 'N the Hood.''

<P>
   --Notables: ``The ASPCA Complete Guide to Cats'' and ``The ASPCA
Complete Guide to Dogs'' (Chronicle, $24.95) are both good-looking

   --Also for your consideration:
</P>
<P>
   Informative: ``Birds for Dummies,'' by Gina Spadafori (IDG

the plight of Washoe and other captive chimps had on Fouts. It is
bursting with intellectual firepower and insights into the behavior
of chimpanzees. This is a work with more than just a heart and mind
_ it has soul.

CLOSE CALLS AND CHAOS ON THE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NJ-PLANE-CRASH) 
(mk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In a flash, a Friday morning's routine became a
terror of fire, whizzing pieces of airplane, flying shards of
glass, falling chunks of ceiling plaster and dangling electrical
wires shooting sparks.
</P>
<P>
   For scores of people walking, driving, visiting or just sleeping
in their homes on and around Kent Street on Friday, the crash of a
small, single-engine plane produced moments of fear and visions of
chaos and carnage in a busy residential and commercial
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the world was coming to an end,'' said Theresa
Gates, 28, who lived on the third floor at 23 Kent St. Like many
others who experienced the morning's events, Ms. Gates heard an
ear-piercing boom as the plane plunged into an old factory a few
doors away, killing all three people aboard and injuring 25 people
on the ground. ``The explosion came right through my windows,'' she
said. ``And then all I saw was flames _ red flames _ coming through
my windows.''
</P>
<P>
   As the flames filled her apartment, Ms. Gates grabbed her
12-year-old niece, Roniqua Austin, and fled down a rear stairway
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   For Henry Perry, a 53-year-old father of four, the crash was a
harrowing brush with death. He was sitting in his brother's parked
car at 18th Avenue and Kent Street when the plane crashed in full
view, about a block away. ``It came straight down, like an arrow,''
Perry recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He remembered seeing a burst of flame ahead of the car and then
instinctively flinching and ducking in the front seat. As he did, a
piece of the plane's wing glanced off the hood of the car and
sheared away much of the windshield and the roof. As it ripped
through the car, the piece of wing nicked Perry's black baseball
cap inches above his forehead, leaving a slash about an inch and a
half long in the cloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just lucky it didn't get me,'' Perry, who installs glass,
said at University Hospital after emergency room doctors treated
him for a scrape on the left side of his face and deep bruises on
his left forearm and left calf. ``Hey _ God is on my side,'' he
said. ``I'm blessed. It just wasn't time.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry's brother, Donald, found the torn baseball cap behind the
car after he emerged from a friend's apartment and pulled Perry
from the roofless car. Donald Perry said the scene in the street
was chaotic, and he experienced a flashback of the combat he saw as
an infantryman in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was chunks of metal all over the place,'' he said. The
street, he said, was filled with parts of bodies, smoke and blood,
and people yelling and screaming as they ran.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell Anderson, 26, was visiting at the home of a
sister-in-law, Ronda Shabazz, at 12 Kent St. when he heard the
crash. He said the force blew in the apartment's windows and
knocked him off a sofa. He said he gathered Ms. Shabazz's four
young children and helped them outside, where cars were burning. He
said he found Ms. Shabazz on the street, her face burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids were all crying, and I was just trying not to let
them see their mother,'' Anderson said as he waited outside the
hospital's emergency room while doctors treated Ms. Shabazz.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the debris rained from the sky. Two Newark men, John
Anderson, 36, and Reginald Muse, 49, were walking separately to the
KFC restaurant when the plane hit the factory and parts of it fell
into the restaurant's parking lot. Both said they heard a boom,
then were struck in the head and knocked off their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess bricks and glass hit me. I don't know,'' Anderson said
after he was treated at the hospital for cuts on a cheek and above
both eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Muse remembered hearing only a ``whirring and whining noise''
and then strangers lifting him from the pavement and taking him to
an ambulance. He was treated for facial bruises. ``From what I'm
hearing, I'm lucky to be alive,'' he said.

<P>
   A private plane carrying a Maryland family home after
Thanksgiving in New York crashed in Newark Friday, killing all
three on board and injuring 25 others as it plowed along a street,
struck buildings and cars and broke into flaming debris that set
off fires, explosions and chaos in a largely residential
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash was not immediately determined,
investigators said, although weather may have been a factor. Two
employees at Linden Airport, eight miles south of Newark, had
advised the plane's owner-pilot, Itzhak Jacoby, an experienced
flier, against taking off in rain and dense fog.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby, 56, and his wife, Gail, 50, both senior officials of
federal health facilities near Washington, and their 13-year-old
daughter, Atira, were killed. On the ground, a 59-year-old man in a
car hit in the crash suffered critical burns, a 29-year-old woman
was severely burned and 16 others were hospitalized with burns,
cuts and other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after takeoff from Linden Airport into a gray,
late-morning rain that had cut visibility to about 100 feet, the
single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza disappeared from radar screens,
went into a tailspin and plunged down in Newark's Central Ward,
about a mile west of the downtown area of New Jersey's largest
city.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the aircraft struck the parapet of a three-story
factory, whose roof was set ablaze. Then, as a wing flew off, the
plane dived down on a street lined with multiple-family houses, hit
and set fire to nine cars, and at the end of a block hit a closed
restaurant. The impact sheared off the side of the plane, hurling
bodies out, and sent debris flying across a commercial avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told of a neighborhood suddenly plunged into chaos,
with the roar of the crashing plane, with car explosions that blew
in the windows and doors of houses, with power lines down and
zapping, and with flying glass and flaming debris that hit
bystanders and nearly decapitated a man sitting in a car whose roof
was torn away. Sixty residents were evacuated from damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a pretty holiday picture,'' Mayor Sharpe James
said as police officers cordoned off what seemed like a war zone in
the area of Kent Street and Springfield Avenue, while firefighters
battled flames, ambulances rushed burned and bleeding victims away
and federal and state investigators began an inquiry into the cause
of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Itzhak Jacoby was director of the Health Services Administration
at the Uniformed Services University, the medical school of the
Department of Defense, and had been a member of its faculty since
1989. His wife was director of planning at the National Institute
on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who immigrated from Israel years ago and lived in
Bethesda, Md., with the younger of their two daughters, had flown
to Linden earlier in the week to spend the holiday with family
members in New York, acquaintances said. They were to fly Friday to
Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Va., and took off at
10:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man, his wife and daughter took off after being advised by
two linemen not to do so,'' Linden's Mayor John Gregorio said,
referring to two airport employees and recounting a conversation he
had with the airport manager, Paul Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes after takeoff, the plane vanished from
controllers' radar screens, James Peters, a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration, said. It was unclear what went
wrong, although James said in a briefing that the aircraft had
apparently experienced engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 1964 Beechcraft Bonanza with four seats, a V-shaped
tail and a cruising speed of about 200 mph, is regarded in aviation
circles as highly reliable. There are about 190,000 small planes in
the nation; last year there were 361 crashes involving such small
planes, with 621 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby's plane, white with red trim, took off in a northerly
direction and was to circle west and then south to travel the 220
air miles to Dulles. But it had flown only eight miles and had
gained little altitude when a Newark police officer, Wayne
Reynolds, saw it wobbling, its engine irregular.
</P>
<P>
   The plane then began spinning down out of control. Newark's
deputy police director, Rocco Malanga, said it came down over
Woodland Cemetery and hit the roof of an old factory at Kent and
Brenner Streets. One wing came off, and the factory roof caught
fire. Three workmen on the ground floor escaped uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft then skipped over the building's parapet and down
into Kent Street, where it struck several parked cars, setting them
afire and spewing flaming debris over the street, Malanga said. At
the end of Kent Street, the fuselage of the plane sideswiped a KFC
restaurant at Springfield and 18th Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant had not yet opened for business for the day, but
several patrons were waiting nearby, and they saw the side of the
aircraft shear open and the bodies of at least two occupants hurtle
out and fall in the restaurant parking lot. As the plane broke
open, debris shot across Springfield Avenue and scattered over a
wide area of sidewalks, yards and vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Perry, 53, was sitting in a parked car at 18th and Kent
when the plane zoomed down a block in front of him and began
closing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came straight down like an arrow,'' Perry said of the
plane. He ducked just in time, he said. A piece of the wing slammed
into his car, sheared away its hood, windshield and roof _ and cut
into the baseball cap Perry was wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Back down Kent Street, eight other cars were on fire _ five were
destroyed _ and a series of explosions ensued as flames reached the
gas tanks. The blasts blew in windows and doors of houses on both
sides of the street, sent plaster falling from ceilings and walls
and sent shards of glass flying.
</P>
<P>
   As firefighters fought the blazes, ambulances took 25 people to
University Hospital in Newark. A hospital spokesman, Rogers Ramsey,
said one Kent Street resident, Albert Walker, was in critical
condition with first- and second-degree burns over 15 percent of
his body and head and chest traumas. He said Rhonda Acey was in
fair condition with second- and third-degree burns and an ankle
fracture. Sixteen others were admitted with various injuries, he
said, while seven were treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 residents of the stricken area were evacuated to a
Salvation Army center where food and temporary shelter were
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Several agencies, including the National Transportation Safety
Board and the New Jersey State Police, were investigating the
crash.

EX-GIANT MAY FACE NASDAQ OFFICIAL IN COURT OVER CAREER DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Ill., Md.)   (jw) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former New York Giants football star is contending in a
lawsuit that Frank Zarb, the chairman of the organization that runs
the Nasdaq stock market, cut short his career in the insurance
industry by deceiving him about a $1.23 billion corporate buyout.
The case is scheduled for trial on Monday in the Superior Court of
New Jersey in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Philip McConkey, who helped the Giants win the 1987 Super Bowl,
is seeking more than $10 million from Zarb and the Aon Corp., an
insurance company that bought Alexander &AMP; Alexander Services in
1997. As chairman and chief executive of Alexander &AMP; Alexander, an
insurance brokerage firm, Zarb was McConkey's boss from May 1996
through January 1997. Zarb left the insurer then to become chairman
of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Zarb nor Patrick Ryan, the chairman and chief executive
of Chicago-based Aon, could be reached for comment. McConkey's
lawyers plan to call both executives to testify in the trial,
possibly next week.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen and a lawyer for Zarb and Aon declined to comment on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The trial comes as Zarb is trying to convert the Nasdaq market
into a private company, as a possible prelude to taking the market
public. He has been trying to convince the securities firms that
comprise the NASD to allow him to raise capital by privately
selling equity in the Nasdaq market to brokerage firms and
companies whose stocks trade on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The case centers on what Zarb told McConkey when Alexander &AMP;
Alexander was recruiting him for a management job in 1996.
McConkey, a former wide receiver, says in court documents that he
would not have taken the job if he had known that Zarb was
negotiating to sell the company to Aon.
</P>
<P>
   McConkey said he visited Zarb at his New York office in April
1996 and Zarb assured him that rumors about an imminent sale of
Alexander &AMP; Alexander were unfounded. In that meeting, McConkey
contends, Zarb told him that Alexander &AMP; Alexander was ``the
predator, not the prey'' and added, ``We are going to grow this
business and become No. 1 in the world again.''
</P>
<P>
   But a proxy statement Alexander &AMP; Alexander filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in February 1997 says that
``from January to May of 1996,'' Zarb and Ryan ``discussed a
possible business combination.'' The possibilities included an
outright acquisition by Aon, the proxy says.
</P>
<P>
   In December, seven months after McConkey started working for
Alexander &AMP; Alexander as a regional director, Aon announced it
would buy the company for $1.23 billion. McConkey's employment was
terminated three months later, said Neil Mullin, a lawyer in
Montclair, N.J., who is representing McConkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Aon took over the business, they booted him out of his
corner office, demoted him, cut his pay and ultimately fired him,''
Mullin said. McConkey, 43, has not worked in the insurance business
since then. He is a football broadcaster and has a job with a
computer company, Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   McConkey is asking for $9.6 million in compensatory damages plus
punitive damages. If McConkey wins, Zarb could be personally liable
for some of the damages because he is being accused of acting
fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
   McConkey, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy who once ran for
Congress in New Jersey, said in court documents that he accepted
the job at Alexander &AMP; Alexander because he trusted Zarb, who had
been President Gerald Ford's ``energy czar.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarb also had been chief executive of the Smith Barney brokerage
firm, which is now owned by Citigroup. For several months before
and after he joined the NASD, Zarb was chairman of the Long Island
Power Authority, a position he was appointed to by Gov. George E.
Pataki of New York.
</P>
<P>
   McConkey contends that after the buyout by Aon, he lost a job
that paid at least $210,000 a year and promised millions more if
Alexander &AMP; Alexander's business continued to grow. In taking that
job, he had passed up ownership of 15 percent of his previous
employer, W.M. Ross &AMP; Co., an insurance broker in Fairfield, N.J.,
as well as residual income from business he had brought in to that
company, he contends.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Princeton-based Summit Bancorp bought W.M. Ross for
an undisclosed amount of stock.

DUVAL PREPARES TO STORM THE DESERT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIO, Calif. _ The last time David Duval was in these parts, he
was blitzing the Arnold Palmer Course at PGA West with an
astounding, final-round 59 and winning the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   That was almost a year ago, and Duval hopes the desert brings
out the best in him again when the front nine of the 17th annual
Skins Game begins today at the 7,288-yard, par-72 Landmark Golf
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being there,'' he said. ``The weather is always nice
and the golf courses are always in good shape. There is something
about seeing just the sun and sky and the desert landscape. I just
love that open desert area.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 59 itself was something that ... well, I had been playing
well for a while. I think it was a great thing for me and it was
something that I never will forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, however, didn't play anywhere near that level later in
the year, when he was passed by Tiger Woods in the world rankings.
Duval said he noticed a deficiency in his swing at the
season-ending Tour Championship and never could correct it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was just getting tired,'' he said. ``I don't know if
it was because the year was winding down. But now I'm in my
preparation mode for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who said winning all four majors is a goal for next year,
will face defending Skins Game champion Mark O'Meara, Fred Couples
and Sergio Garcia in the $1 million competition. Holes 1-6 today
will be worth $25,000 each, and $50,000 will be awarded for holes
7-9. There also will be carryovers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's back nine will be climaxed by a $200,000 Super Skin on
the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, like Duval, also has been plagued by swing problems,
although he did team with Woods to win the recent World Cup in
Malaysia. But O'Meara's final-round 77 indicated he isn't close to
his play of 1998, when he won the British Open and Masters.
Nevertheless, he is looking forward to the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am excited to get back to the desert,'' he said.
``Hopefully, some of the flare will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the young Spanish phenom, said he rarely watched the
Skins Game growing up because it never was televised back home. But
he said he watched a few of the competitions when he was stateside
and is eager to try his luck at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be nice to play one of these tournaments where you can
have a little bit of fun,'' he said. ``It can be a very nice
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples, who is tied with Tom Lehman for most money won on one
hole ($270,000), normally would be thrilled to play this weekend,
but he is doing so with a heavy heart. He was asked to take the
place of good friend Payne Stewart, who died in a plane crash in
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many days go by when I don't think of my parents, and
they passed away a few years ago,'' he said. ``It's really a
privilege for me to be a part of this, and I think anyone who was
picked would say the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne was a huge competitor and a great guy and so much fun to
be with off the course.''

HONG KONG ECONOMY REBOUNDS AHEAD OF EXPECTATIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a report that made the Asian crisis seem like a
distant memory, Hong Kong said Friday that its economy grew 4.5
percent in the third quarter of this year. The government also
upgraded its forecast of growth for the full year to 1.8 percent
from 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, which were well above estimates, attest to Hong
Kong's remarkable recovery from its worst recession since World War
II. Like other Asian economies, Hong Kong has shrugged off the
calamitous events of two years ago and is regaining its strength
far faster than analysts had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong is poised for a dramatic rebound,'' said Victor
Fung, the chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council.
``The conditions were there, but we needed a strong confirmation
and a boost to confidence. We've now had a whole series of such
events.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new data, Hong Kong has been buoyed in recent
weeks by Walt Disney Co.'s announcement that it would build a theme
park here, by the successful debut of a government-linked
investment fund, and by the landmark trade deal between the United
States and China.
</P>
<P>
   That last milestone, however, could prove to be a distinctly
mixed blessing. As China opens up its economy in an effort to enter
the World Trade Organization, analysts said, this former British
colony could lose its prized role as the middleman between China
and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is that the only cloud looming over Hong Kong. Friday's
numbers also reveal that the territory is caught in a deflationary
spiral unique among the recovering economies of Asia. The consumer
price index declined 3.9 percent in the first 10 months of 1999,
and the government increased its projection of the full-year
decline in the index to 4 percent from an earlier forecast of 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of everything from office space and imported wine to
designer clothes and cars are plunging here. Although people are
spending more in stores _ retail sales rose 2 percent in the third
quarter _ they are lured by deep discounts. The number of tourists
visiting Hong Kong is up 11 percent so far this year, but they are
spending much less per person, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this deflation is viewed as necessary. Hong Kong's
prices were among the highest in the world, and made the territory
a forbidding place to do business. But the falling prices are
cutting profits at local companies, a trend that discourages them
from resuming investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I call a profitless recovery,'' said Dong Tao, an
economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Tao said the recovery would remain tenuous as long as companies
did not have the confidence to take out fresh loans and begin
spending. Also, even though commercial rents have fallen by more
than 40 percent, Hong Kong is still more expensive than New York or
London, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ian K. Perkin, the chief economist of the Hong Kong General
Chamber of Commerce, said the government had masked the effect of
weak corporate investment by starting several costly projects,
including the $3.6 billion Disneyland, which will be built largely
with public money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to persuade domestic companies to begin investing
again _ and real investments, not just the stock market,'' Perkin
said. ``I don't know how we do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The new trade agreement between the United States and China is a
more long-term challenge for Hong Kong. The government's economist,
K.Y. Tang, said that it was premature to estimate what impact the
deal would have on economic output. ``In general terms, I agree
with those who say that it must be a very positive development for
both the mainland and Hong Kong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fung, of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, and others
contend that Hong Kong will benefit from the agreement because it
will generate vast new trading opportunities for China. As the
world's largest container port and the main clearinghouse for
Chinese exports, Hong Kong will get a share of that increased
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of experts are questioning whether Hong
Kong will miss out on most of the new wealth. As China opens its
markets to foreign companies and products, American and other
foreign companies could start dealing directly with the mainland
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong has been very successful in exploiting the gray
areas of doing business in China,'' said Jason Felton, the chairman
of the American Chamber of Commerce here. ``But the WTO is going to
force the Chinese to be more transparent. Hong Kong companies will
lose that niche, and they are clearly worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fung said the trade agreement would encourage hundreds of small
and midsize American companies to try to crack the China market.
Lacking the resources or connections of major corporations, these
companies would need the advice of people in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about the Fortune 100, it's probably true
that these companies will put increased emphasis on dealing
directly with China,'' he said. ``What I think we'll get is a rush
of medium-size multinationals, who have heretofore not dealt with
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Fung acknowledged that Hong Kong would be forced to change. But
he predicted that the territory would remake itself _ much as it
did in 1979, when Deng Xiaoping opened the Chinese economy. At that
time, Hong Kong was a center for low-cost manufacturing. But
companies here recognized that China would usurp that role, so they
moved their factories to neighboring Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fung said, Hong Kong needs to retool its economy to provide
information-age services to the growing Chinese market. The
territory has become a hothouse for Internet companies that are
focusing on the mainland. On Thursday, in an effort to create a
Nasdaq exchange for Asia, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange opened a
second board for technology-related stocks.

EDITORIAL: SPENDING THE TOBACCO MONEY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 27:
</P>
<P>
   Sometime next month, the state of New York should be getting its
first installment of a $25 billion legal settlement from the
tobacco industry. After passing along almost half of the money to
local governments, the state Legislature must decide how to use the
rest. Since the payments amount to compensation for the sickness
and health costs caused by tobacco products, this windfall should
be used to combat smoking and to improve the health care of New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts, including those at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta, agree that New York should spend at
least $95 million annually to create an anti-tobacco program that
helps people quit smoking and stems the flood of newly addicted
smokers, especially teenagers. The Legislature and governor should
make such an antismoking program a priority. That would then leave
about $400 million from the state's annual share to be used for
other health needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, has sent word
that he wants to use the tobacco money almost entirely for health
matters, focusing on health coverage for the uninsured. He has all
but abandoned a plan to use some of the money for school
construction. The Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, a
Republican, told Richard Perez-Pena of The Times that he has
discarded an earlier plan to use only one-third of the tobacco
money on health care. Now he favors spending virtually all the
money on health needs, suggesting he would focus on subsidizing
prescription costs for the elderly and boosting health coverage for
the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Those are worthy uses for the money, but another suggestion from
Bruno _ to pay the surcharges that are tacked on to patients' bills
to help subsidize indigent patients and doctors' training _ should
be quickly scuttled. Those surcharges are covered by health
insurance policies. Instead, the Legislature should use the tobacco
money on coverage for the uninsured as a way to pump money into
hospitals that take indigent patients. The need for state support
is expected to grow more dire at teaching hospitals as federal
support has declined over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the missing voice is Gov. George Pataki's. Pataki
has yet to make detailed recommendations for the tobacco money, but
he has sent signals that he is interested in using a significant
amount for antismoking programs and health insurance for the
uninsured. However, the governor has also talked about putting away
some of the money to pay for the ballooning costs of tax reductions
over the next few years. That would be a mistake. Tobacco money is
a payback for the ills caused by tobacco. It should be used in that
spirit to combat illness, curb tobacco use and provide health care
for the uninsured in New York state.

 CALVIN DODD MacCRACKEN, 79, INVENTOR WHO HELD 80 PATENTS   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calvin Dodd MacCracken, an inventor and founder of his own
creative engineering firm in Englewood, N.J., died Nov. 10 at
Kendall at Hanover, a retirement community in New Hampshire. A
former resident of Englewood, he was 79 and lived in Hanover and
West Cornwall, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Mary Burnham MacCracken.
</P>
<P>
   He founded the company, Jet Heat Inc., now Calmac Inc., just
after World War II and served as its president for 50 years. During
the war he had worked at General Electric to help reduce the size
of a British design for a jet engine, work that earned him the
first of his more than 80 patents.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to Henry Noble MacCracken,
the president of Vassar College, and Marjorie Dodd MacCracken. He
graduated in 1940 from Princeton University, earned a degree in
mechanical engineering at MIT in 1941 and entered GE's program in
creative engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Jet Heat's first product was a residential forced-air furnace,
thousands of which found their way into American homes.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, MacCracken was involved in developing several
hundred products, ranging from an electric hot-dog cooker to the
temperature distribution system used in the Apollo astronauts'
space suits.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of ``A Handbook for Inventors'' (Scribner,
1983), a guide for entrepreneurial lone wolves, whom he advised to
be ready ``to fail repeatedly, to risk scorn and bankruptcy.'' He
explained how to patent, finance, develop, manufacture and market
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife of 30 years, Mary, MacCracken is survived by
two sons and two daughters from an earlier marriage, Michael of
Bethesda, Md., Dr. Joan MacCracken Holmberg of Orono, Maine, Karen
MacCahill of Melbourne, Fla., and Mark of New York City; two
sisters, Maisry MacCracken and Joy Dawson, both of Poughkeepsie; a
brother, James, of Brewster, Mass.; two stepdaughters, Susan
Thistle of Evanston, Ill., and Nan Livingston of Cazadero, Calif.;
a stepson, Stephen Thistle, also of Cazadero; and 13 grandchildren.

   NEW YORK _ New York hospitals are being suffocated, according to
one viewpoint, by the government and by insurance companies that
place profits perilously above patients' needs. Or, from another
vantage point, the hospitals are hopelessly inefficient
spendthrifts whose practices have not kept pace with cost-cutting
trends in health care.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators running the hospitals say they are reeling from
federal and state budgets cuts, barely able to eke out a profit.
They are places where nurses frantically toil to take care of wards
crowded with patients, and where doctors waste precious time
fighting with managed-care companies. To make matters worse,
administrators argue, state business leaders want to abandon their
critical role of paying high medical-insurance premiums to help
these hospitals absorb the costs of caring for the poorest and
sickest, and Congress is taking away precious teaching dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance companies and business groups counter that
health care costs in New York state are nearly 20 percent higher
than in the rest of the country, fueled in large part by hospitals
in the city that they see as temples of medical arrogance and
fiscal indifference. Too many specialists, eager to try out their
latest costly toys, hospitalize people for problems that could be
solved in a doctor's office, and labor leaders, loath to lose a
single job, resist the closing of the most under-used hospitals,
the business argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have been at the heart of protracted debates over
how to fix the ailing financial picture of New York hospitals. And
their characterizations of the health care system and its troubles
and expenses, however contradictory they seem, are both accurate.
New York hospitals ended 1998 with operating losses of $115
million, according to figures released this week. Yet their
traditions are deeply embedded, so much so that long-term solutions
to stem those losses have eluded experts.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the people who provide health care and those who pay
for it are finding themselves at a crucial juncture as they prepare
to do battle with the Legislature over the future of state health
care financing, because the state's Health Care Reform Act expires
at the end of next month. Further, teaching hospitals stand to lose
tens of millions of dollars in Medicare money under a new
congressional budget bill.
</P>
<P>
   If the Health Care Reform Act is not renewed, hospitals will
lose a large portion of their state funds. So parties on all sides
are scrambling to devise ways to deal legislatively with two
significant and incendiary parts of the law: paying to educate
medical students, which in New York is a huge and prestigious
business, and covering the hospital bills of the state's poor
uninsured patients, which is a huge burden.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital and labor organizations have spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars on an advertising campaign expressing outrage
at plans to cut the amount of money devoted to health care. And
business leaders have raced around the state in recent months
trying to convince anyone who will listen that it is time for
someone else _ they have not specified whom _ to start footing the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides hope to influence any plan that Gov. George Pataki
may have.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons why the city's hospitals and the health care
industry arrived at this point are many and varied, and to a great
extent, are rooted in some obvious economic realities. Almost
everything in New York, from electricity to labor to peanut butter,
costs more than it does in the rest of the country. Thousands of
people in the state are uninsured, and the health care system in
New York City reinforces the outmoded practice of placing teaching
hospitals front and center for even the most basic care.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Medicare and charity pools that
historically combined to allow the state to build top-notch medical
centers while also serving its poorest residents have either dried
up or been threatened, while managed care companies have tightened
the reimbursement screws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospitals' story about being broke is fundamentally
accurate,'' said James R. Tallon, the president of the United
Hospital Fund, a health care research and philanthropic
organization. Insurers' arguments that hospitals could be more
efficient are ``also legitimate,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is room for more efficient use of resources across the
board,'' Tallon said. ``But the question is, are you going to
achieve that in a fair fashion?''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Christmas season began not on a sour note
exactly, but on a recorded one, when labor negotiations between the
New York City Ballet and the musicians who play in its orchestra
stumbled Friday night just before the curtain went up on the first
holiday performance of ``The Nutcracker.'' The result was that the
strike declared by the musicians on Tuesday continued and `The
Nutcracker' had to be performed to taped music.
</P>
<P>
   The City Ballet has performed the Tchaikovsky classic,
choreographed by George Balanchine, every year at this time since
1954. Friday night's performance was its first ever without live
orchestra accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet fans, many of them little girls and their mothers,
arrived at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, expecting
the annual glitter and dazzle of the occasion. But on the sidewalk
on Columbus Avenue they were greeted by the disappointing news that
they would be listening to a tape. A picket line of some 20
musicians, members of Local 802 of the American Federation of
Musicians, carried signs reading ``Musicians on Strike'' and ``City
Ballet Unfair to Musicians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been pretty exciting that when you're in certain
seats you can see the orchestra play,'' said Jessica Agee, an
8-year-old from New Rochelle, who arrived with her mother and
younger sister, wearing a new black velvet dress and patent leather
shoes. ``But the ballet is the most important part. We were
absolutely going to come no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues on the negotiating table include wages and benefits,
but the sticking point, both sides agree, is the tradition of
elective attendance that musicians have enjoyed for decades. It has
long been the case that musicians are free to skip a rehearsal or a
performance, forfeiting their pay, if a substitute is available.
The policy allows musicians, who are under contract for only a
23-week season, to supplement their income with other jobs. The
ballet company says, however, that in recent years, enough
orchestra members have abused the privilege that the continuity of
rehearsal and performance that is necessary to sustain a top flight
orchestra has been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between the union and the ballet company began at
10 a..m. Friday and continued all day, breaking off less than an
hour before the 8 p.m. curtain. A spokesman for the union, Bill
Dennison, said the union had agreed to a final proposal on the part
of the company, that the musicians play through the holiday season
as negotiations continued, but that the ballet company then added
the proviso that if negotiations were not concluded in time, the
musicians would play through the spring as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider ourselves locked out,'' Dennison said. ``What else
can we think when we offer to play and management won't let us?''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ramsey, a spokesman for the City Ballet, said that the
union had declined the company's final offer. He said the company
decided to go ahead with the performance with taped music because
too many people would be disappointed otherwise. He said all other
unions, including those for stagehands and dancers, had allowed
their members to cross the picket line and that everyone but the
orchestra members had reported for work.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations continued during the performance.
</P>
<P>
   The previous contract expired on Labor Day. Without any ballet
business between then and this week, the orchestra voted to strike
on Tuesday, just before rehearsal for the season-opening gala
benefit that night. The scheduled program, created by the City
Ballet director, Peter Martins, was to have included excerpts from
eight ballets, but it was canceled. The only dancing that night was
an impromptu performance by a handful of dancers on the promenade
of the New York State Theater, during the gala dinner, which went
on as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the gala managed to raise over $1 million for the
company, even though it lacked the high spirits generally
associated with such events
</P>
<P>
   Basic pay for orchestra musicians, according to the union, is
$35,000, though with addenda to individual contracts, most members
earn more. The company says the average pay for the 70 members of
the orchestra is $66,000.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet company has rejected a proposal by the musicians that
the current contract be extended for another six months _ with the
stipulation that wages be increased by 4.5 percent _ and the
musicians have, in turn, rejected the company's proposal for a new
contract that calls for a 3.7 percent wage increase the first year,
plus financial incentives for musicians who agree to adhere to
attendance standards. According to the ballet company proposal, any
musician who wants to maintain current privileges may elect to do
so, but newly hired musicians must agree to the new attendance
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that, the musicians say, is that it would
create a two-tier system of compensation _ one wage scale for those
who agree to minimum attendance standards and another for those who
do not _ and that is unacceptable.

TEXAS A&AMP;M CAPS WEEK OF TURMOIL WITH EMOTIONAL VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ To the suffering went the comfort
Friday in Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas A&AMP;M football team and fan base that spent the past week
in mourning found cause to celebrate as the final seconds ticked
off the clock during a 20-16 upset of archrival Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M linebacker Jason Glenn sprinted behind the Aggies' sideline,
leaping and exhorting the largest crowd ever to witness a football
game in Texas (86,128). Cannons fired. Players dropped to their
knees, shedding tears and accepting hugs from well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   As he surveyed the unbridled joy unfolding around him, Texas A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum said he felt a sense of closure to an emotional
week that began with the deaths of 12 people at the A&AMP;M bonfire
site on Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was so right that we won,'' Slocum said. ``With
all the A&AMP;M family has gone through in the last week, I just
thought it just needed to turn out that way. I'm so thankful it
did. This is something positive they can cling to after a week of
sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   The fates seemed to agree with Slocum, whose team arrived at the
stadium to the news that Texas quarterback Major Applewhite would
not start _ and might not play _ because of a stomach virus. Under
freshman quarterback Chris Simms, Texas' first drive covered 65
yards, but proved fruitless when Kris Stockton banged a 32-yard
field-goal attempt off the left upright.
</P>
<P>
   A bouncing, third-quarter punt glanced off Texas return man
Courtnee Garcia as he tried to scamper out of the way, creating a
turnover and a shift of momentum that Texas coach Mack Brown cited
as the turning point in the Aggies' comeback from a 16-6 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Divine intervention? A&AMP;M linebacker Brian Gamble wonders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know God and those 12 Aggies were looking down on us
today,'' Gamble said. ``They helped us play to the best of our
ability to win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 24 A&AMP;M (8-3, 5-3) secured this upset with suffocating
defense down the stretch. Texas' final 11 drives covered 68 yards
and produced nothing but punts and turnovers. The seventh-ranked
Longhorns (9-3, 6-2) averaged 1.9 yards per snap during that
stretch and never crossed midfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies, meanwhile, turned superior field position into two
game-turning touchdown drives of 46 and 48 yards. A&AMP;M loosened up
the Texas defense with steady doses of 260-pound fullback Ja'Mar
Toombs (37 carries, 126 yards), who scored two touchdowns, and kept
the Longhorns backed up with the booming punts of Shane Lechler
(43.6-yard average).
</P>
<P>
   But the telling blows came on three fade routes, all of which
burned Ahmad Brooks, Texas' 5-foot-8 cornerback. The first went to
Bethel Johnson and covered 30 yards, moving the ball to the
Longhorns' 17-yard line. Three plays later, Toombs barreled in from
the 9 to cut the deficit to 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   On the Aggies' winning drive, quarterback Randy McCown lofted a
24-yard strike over Brooks to wide receiver Chris Cole, moving the
ball to the Texas 13. Two plays later, McCown connected with Matt
Bumgardner for the game winner with 5:02 remaining. Of the three
A&AMP;M receivers who grabbed passes over Brooks, Johnson (5-foot-11)
was the shortest and Bumgardner (6-2) was the tallest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy threw some great balls, and they just beat me,'' said
Brooks, who was in man-to-man coverage in all three situations.
``They were better athletes than I was today.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the athletes who made the most telling plays were
the ones on the A&AMP;M defense. The Aggies limited Texas' high-powered
offense to season-lows of 272 yards and 16 points while recording
five sacks.
</P>
<P>
   After the Simms-led offense produced only one first down in a
stretch of seven consecutive possessions, Texas coaches turned the
game over to Applewhite in the fourth quarter. Applewhite, who
threw for 3,132 yards in Texas' first 11 games, did not fare much
better than his freshman predecessor down the stretch. He completed
5 of 11 passes for 53 yards and lost a fumble with 23 seconds
remaining when he was sacked by A&AMP;M cornerback Jay Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt terrible before the game,'' said Applewhite, who threw
up twice on the Texas sideline. ``I still feel terrible. But I told
(Texas coaches) I'd be ready if they called my name.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M proved to be more prepared, physically and emotionally.
Especially emotionally, said offensive guard Chris Valletta, whose
game undershirt bore the names of the 12 students who died in the
bonfire-site accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into the game knowing there was a lot more to play for
than just this game,'' Valletta said. ``Those people who died were
in our minds and hearts. We thought about them every single play.
We send this victory out to every one of their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas players recognized the Aggies for their emotional effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played their hearts out,'' said Texas defensive end
Cedric Woodard. ``I take my hat off to them.''

TALK OF COURT MOVE TO WATERBURY, CONN., DRAWS COMPLAINTS OF
FAVORITISM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD _ Good things have been happening lately in Waterbury,
population 108,000, the hometown of Gov. John G. Rowland and the
place he often calls ``the center of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   During Rowland's tenure, for instance, Waterbury has become the
site of a new office complex called the Rowland Government Center.
A few weeks ago, the governor announced a plan to move the offices
of the state's Department of Motor Vehicles there. Since 1995, when
Rowland took office, moreover, a number of local judges have also
reached influential positions in the state judiciary. All a part,
perhaps, of being at the center of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   But when rumors surfaced this week about a possible plan to move
Connecticut's Appellate Court from its cramped offices in Hartford
to Waterbury, some state legislators said they had detected too
much of a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outrageous,'' said Richard D. Tulisano, a
Democrat state representative whose district includes part of
Hartford. ``This is the capital. You need a courthouse? We have a
lot of buildings in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we can do legislatively to stop it,'' he went on,
``we will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Court now resides on the fourth floor of the state
Superior Court building. According to Francis M. McDonald Jr., the
chief justice of the state Supreme Court, the Appellate Court has
run out of space. The decisions on whether to move the court and
where it will go ultimately rest with McDonald, who is also a
native of Waterbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a dire problem,'' McDonald said in an interview
Friday, citing the 200 murder cases and some 22,000 civil cases now
waiting to be heard by the nine-member Appellate Court, the state's
second-highest court. ``Something's got to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he said he planned to study the issue more closely,
McDonald added that a move to Waterbury would seem natural enough,
considering the city's former Superior Court building has been
standing empty since the court moved elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the predecessor to the Appellate Court was
in Meriden, 18 miles south, and the Supreme Court was once in New
Haven, which in the 1800s alternated annually with Hartford as the
state's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when asked whether he would prefer to move the
Appellate Court to his hometown, where he spent 16 years as a
state's attorney, the judge laughed heartily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Waterbury,'' he said finally.
</P>
<P>
   State Democrats are not persuaded by what they see as an
all-too-convenient argument for Waterbury, a city of strip malls
and superstores 32 miles east of here. The legislators, reached by
telephone Friday, said they were not even sure that the court
should move at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of any problems with the Appellate Court in
Hartford,'' said State Sen. Donald E. Williams, a Democrat who is
co-chairman of the General Assembly's judiciary committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford, he noted, still seemed to be good enough for the
state's Supreme Court and the administrative services that it and
the Appellate Court share here. Though not conceding the move to be
an inevitability, he acknowledged the appearance of a trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many other entities seem to be moving to Waterbury or are
being talked about being moved to Waterbury,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tulisano was more blunt: ``The governor,'' he said, ``is trying
to load up the state government in the town he came from.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not true, the governor's office said. Rowland has
maintained he had nothing to do with the idea to move the Appellate
Court. ``The governor has no control over judicial branch
operations,'' Dean Pagani, Rowland's spokesman, told The Hartford
Courant on Thursday. Pagani could not be reached for comment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said he was not close to making a decision. But if the
court eventually does move to Waterbury, legislators said, what
will be next?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to say when the state library runs out of space
that we'll move them over to the Supreme Court and push the Supreme
Court to Waterbury?'' Tulisano asked. ``I hear the Banking
Department is moving, too. Is that true?''

CORNHUSKERS SHUCK BUFFALOES' UPSET BID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ The first hint that a bizarre afternoon was
about to unfold came when Ralphie, the 700-pound mascot who
normally leads the Colorado Buffaloes onto the field in a
thunderous charge, refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   For three periods, the Buffs' offense behaved in similar
fashion. Then, in the final 10 minutes, it nearly swept
third-ranked Nebraska out of jam-packed Folsom Field (52,946) and
crashed a long list of postseason dreams of glory harbored by the
stunned guests.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers (10-1, 7-1 Big 12) hung on to win, 33-30, on a
1-yard sneak by quarterback Eric Crouch in overtime, capturing the
meaningful half of the North Division title and a berth opposite
Texas in the league championship game Saturday in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of regulation, having misplaced a 24-point lead,
the Cornhuskers were in near-shock _ beseeching a higher power for
deliverance as Colorado's Jeremy Aldrich lined up for a 34-yard
field goal attempt in a 27-27 game with one second left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was praying to God, saying `Oh, please, make him miss it,''
nose tackle Steve Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on our knees on the sideline praying,'' said tight end
Tracy Wistrom, ``and along came God to save us.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment was particularly excruciating for Dan Alexander, who
had trampled the Buffs relentlessly in the first half and wound up
rushing for 180 yards and three touchdowns _ but who had seemingly
taken a sure win away from the Cornhuskers moments earlier by
losing fumbling a pitchout at the Colorado 15-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was over _ that I had ruined it for us,'' he
said. ``I figured we were beaten. I thought of Samson in the Bible,
and I prayed to God for one last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Aldrich, who had kicked a 49-yarder earlier, booted it wide
right _ barely _ sending the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Relief was not assured, since Buffs quarterback Mike Moschetti _
woeful for three periods _ had just torched the Nebraska defense
with 13 completions in 18 attempts for 188 yards and three
touchdowns in nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cornhuskers stiffened, and Colorado (6-5, 5-3) settled
for a field goal on its overtime possession.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch (19 carries, 123 yards) then drove Nebraska for the
winning score, with the key play delivered by Alexander. Making
good on his second chance, he slammed through the Buffs for 11
yards to the 1, and Crouch scored on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first half, when Nebraska built a 24-3 lead, the
frantic finish seemed a remote possibility. Alexander rumbled 50
yards on Nebraska's first play for a 7-0 lead, and Crouch set up
another score with a 46-yard sprint on a quarterback draw.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Alexander rammed into the center of the
line, stepped on a couple of defenders, and ran 80 yards for
another. Eventually, the Cornhuskers led 27-3, after a third
quarter field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that we relaxed,'' he said. ``We thought we were in a
cakewalk. We figured it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Nebraska leading, 27-6, a fumble recovery at the
Cornhuskers' 47 ignited the Buffs _ and on three possessions
Moschetti threw touchdown passes of 14 yards to John Minardi, 3
yards to Daniel Graham and 21 to Javon Green.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum turned again when Mike Brown ripped the ball away
from Colorado's Cortlen Johnson with 1:49 left at the Buffs' 16.
But Alexander handed it back with the fumbled pitchout on the next
play. Moschetti swept Colorado downfield, halting at the Nebraska
17 for Aldrich's seemingly sure field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stunned us when they came back,'' Warren said. ``But you
have to give it to them, they played a great game at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska coach Frank Solich said he felt the turnaround was due
more ``to them playing well than us having a letdown. But this team
came back to fight through adversity and they've done that all
year.'' SIDELINES
</P>
<P>
   _ Although happy with their 33-30 overtime victory Friday,
Nebraska players and coaches realize they did little to erode
Virginia Tech's position as the second-ranked team in the BCS
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I know we needed to win by a lot more than this,''
running back Dan Alexander said. ``But we've played a tough
schedule and things don't always work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Frank Solich declined to jump into the
national-championship debate or criticize the Hokies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to go out there every week and play the teams on
their schedule,'' he said, ``and so did we.''
</P>
<P>
   At least, said nose tackle Steve Warren, the Cornhuskers will
get another crack at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for it,'' he said. ``I felt after they beat
us that we would win the rest of our games.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed Colorado coach Gary Barnett said he was nonetheless
proud of the Buffs' effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've seen more heart, resolve and fight in a
team than I saw out there the last 35 minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The victory marked the 20th time since 1963 that Nebraska has
won 10 games in a season, including six times in the 1990s. It was
also the Cornhuskers' eighth consecutive victory over Colorado.
Nebraska finished the season sharing the North Division title at
7-1, but captured the spot in the Big 12 title game because of a
41-15 victory over the Wildcats. nn

VIRGINIA TECH HOKIES COMPLETE THEIR CIRCUIT WITH NO GLITCHES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. _ They had done their part by capping a perfect
regular season with a 38-14 victory Friday over Boston College,
capturing a third Big East championship. But here were the Virginia
Tech players and their coaches, frozen in place at midfield,
watching the green lights on small scoreboard narrate in code the
final seconds of a football game half the country away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colo 27, Neb 27,'' the lights in the south end zone flashed.
``Colo on Neb 20,'' they flashed next. ``:20 left. FG try.''
</P>
<P>
   The students who had toppled the north goalpost halted their
triumphant conga. The 53,130 people, who moments earlier were in a
full-throated celebration of the Hokies' victory, stilled.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech's freshman quarterback, Michael Vick, stopped
taking questions from a television reporter about his growing
legend. About how he was 11 of 13 for 290 yards and three
touchdowns. About how he rushed for 76 yards and a touchdown on a
soaked field.
</P>
<P>
   Vick, too, watched the board. There was a roar of approval from
the stands. Vick jumped into a fan's arms. It was premature.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard broke the bad news: ``FG No Good.'' The
quarterback grimaced and hopped in disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Then he smiled and said to no one in particular: ``It's all
right. We showed we belong in the Sugar Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska wound up beating Colorado, 33-30, in overtime, but
Friday the Hokies (11-0), who are second in the Bowl Championship
Series ranking and in the Associated Press poll, appeared to
deserve the slot opposite top-ranked Florida State in the national
title game. They dominated the Eagles (8-3), a team that had
climbed to No. 22 in the AP poll just three years after being
nearly destroyed by a gambling scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers? Five hundred fifty-five yards to 319. The Hokies
sacked Boston College quarterback Tim Hasselbeck five times and
forced the Eagles to punt six times.
</P>
<P>
   But as the interrupted post-game demonstrated, nothing is quite
certain in the volatile world of computers quantifying opponents
and opponents' schedules. Virginia Tech came into the game
63-hundredths of a point ahead of Nebraska in the BCS ranking.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers (10-1 and No. 3 in the rankings) survived their
scare at Colorado. Was it enough of a stumble to give their
computer ranking a virus? Or can they regain fractions next week in
the Big 12 championship game against Texas?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of talk for a couple of weeks,'' said
Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer, who led the Hokies to their first
perfect regular season since a 7-0 finish in 1918. ``But our team
has never quit playing. There's something right about that. There's
something right about them playing in New Orleans. I believe the
best two teams will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it took Virginia Tech just 21 minutes to wrap up the
Big East championship and show a national television audience that
it could challenge Florida State. It was long enough for Vick to
conjure images of Fred Astaire on a puddle-splashing 34-yard run.
He also launched touchdown passes _ 69 and 59 yards _ to Andre
Davis, who had five catches for 172 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a long time to think about catching that ball,'' Davis
said of Vick's first touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   It was time enough for Virginia Tech's 1,000-yard rusher,
Shyrone Stith, to score a touchdown. Time enough for the nation's
No. 4-ranked defense to sack Hasselbeck three times.
</P>
<P>
   Once ahead by 21-0, the Hokies spent the rest of the game trying
to hack the eight computer rankings that may or may not keep them
out of the national title game in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had their moments. In the third quarter, they stopped
the Hokies on the goal line on fourth down and followed it with a
long pass of their own _ a 97-yard touchdown from Hasselbeck to
Dedrick Dewalt to narrow the margin to 24-7. But Vick, who has
totaled 671 yards in his last two games, was too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a difference maker; he plays at a level that Charlie Ward
and Donovan McNabb made in their third and fourth years,'' said
Boston College coach Tom O'Brien, comparing him to a Heisman Trophy
winner from Florida State and a record-breaking star at Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   On the day 23 Virginia Tech seniors were playing their final
regular-season game, one of them, Corey Moore, walked into the
interview room blowing on a big cigar. He is an all-American
defensive end, though he is barely 6 feet and weighs 225 pounds. He
has graduated and is taking courses toward a master's degree. He
wants to be a lawyer and sports agent, and as persuasive an
advocate with a microphone off the field as his four tackles and
two sacks were on it.
</P>
<P>
   Moore refused to get caught up in the post-game scoreboard
watching. He was intent on relishing the Hokies' perfect season.
``We are 11-0,'' he said. ``What else do you want us to do?''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com has ordered 181 acres of holiday wrapping paper and
2,494 miles of red satin ribbon _ just in case. It has stocked its
shelves with 10,000 copies of the Pack the Pig game and a few extra
table saws. And it has built four new automated warehouses that
give it the capacity to pack, wrap and ship nearly a million boxes
a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fastest expansion of distribution capacity in
peacetime history,'' gloated Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com,
the most popular store on the Internet. This holiday season, Bezos
said, Amazon will send more packages _ perhaps in excess of 15
million _ to more people than any mail order company in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But this holiday season _ in which millions of people will do
their first online shopping _ Amazon will also have far more
competition than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com has become the No. 2 online store, based on sales of
$397 million so far this year, selling computers, books,
electronics and more, at prices generally far lower than Amazon's.
And in every category, Amazon faces specialized competitors that
have become smarter and stronger: Barnesandnoble.com in books,
Amazon's original product line; eToys, Toys ``R'' Us and KB Toys in
toys; 800.com and Circuit City in electronics; and Sears, Roebuck
in tools.
</P>
<P>
   Those and hundreds of other companies are spending so much money
on advertising this Christmas that the true winners on the Internet
so far have been the television networks.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, many traditional retailers have overcome their
fear of cannibalizing in-store sales to promote their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do things that Internet-only companies can't,'' said
Srikant Srinivasan, chief executive of KBkids.com, an Internet toy
store controlled by KB Toys. ``Our name is plastered over all of
the stores. We have access to exclusive merchandise the store
carries. And if you don't like a toy, you can just walk into your
nearby mall to return it.''
</P>
<P>
   KB and many other big companies are now willing to lose money to
build their online units _ just as most Internet companies do. KB
will spend $43 million to promote its online store this Christmas,
compared with $30 million for its bricks-and-mortar store chain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts expect Amazon to post fourth-quarter sales of
$450 million to $600 million, enough to remain the No. 1 online
store, as it has been since it began four years ago. Indeed,
despite the competition, Amazon has actually increased its share of
online retail sales every year, according to Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   But the stakes for Amazon this Christmas are not simply whether
it will survive or even stay on top. Rather, Amazon must validate a
strategy that is the biggest gamble on the Internet: aiming to be
the store that sells most anything to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, Amazon sold only books, music, videos and a
handful of gift items, but it still nearly imploded trying to keep
up with the volume. So far this year, Amazon's sales have nearly
tripled, and the site now offers toys, electronics, tools and
building supplies. It also runs auctions of everything from rare
books to attic junk, operates a mall of other stores called zShops
and owns big chunks of other online retailers like Drugstore.com
and Pets.com, which are linked to its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon ruled the last two Christmases,'' said Chip Austin,
former president of the online bookstore at Bertelsmann, the German
publishing group, which merged its Internet efforts in the United
States with Barnesandnoble.com last year. ``But I'm not sure they
will be able to broaden themselves as much as they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the company risks spreading itself so thin that it will
be trumped by companies that specialize in each of the product
lines it sells. ``If I buy a buzz saw at Amazon and don't get the
same kind of service I got on books, I'll say, `That's it, they've
stretched too far, and I'll buy my dog food and buzz saws somewhere
else,''' said Austin, now a venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos has four weeks to show the world that he can do for buzz
saws what he has done for books. His tactics are the same as his
long-term strategy: Think big and control everything.
</P>
<P>
   That is why he ordered far more inventory _ and far more paper
in which to wrap it _ than even his most optimistic forecasts would
suggest. That is why he built his own warehouses, when most online
stores farm out the packing, wrapping and shipping. And that is why
he decided at the last minute to triple his advertising and
marketing budget to $90 million, making sure he isn't drowned out
by the competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Amazon has more than doubled its staff, to
5,000, and quadrupled the computer power that runs its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, thinking big means spending big, and Amazon is
burning through the $1.5 billion it raised on Wall Street at an
ever faster pace. In 1999, Amazon is expected to lose $550 million
on sales of $1.5 billion. But Bezos is clear: if the choice is
between ordering enough ribbon to be sure he won't run out, or
being conservative to avoid costly overstock, he will always choose
the extra ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say we will disappoint some small fraction of people
but we will make a lot more money,'' Bezos said. ``But if you
disappoint people, you lose brand reputation, and that's worth a
lot more to us right now than money.''
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Amazon wants to expand even more than it has this year.
It is aiming at many more merchandise categories, though it may
lose more money on the new initiatives just as the bookstore starts
to turn a profit. Wall Street will keep financing Jeff Bezos' dream
store, analysts say, so long as Amazon continues to astound
investors with growth. And that is why there is so much pressure
for the company to decisively exceed Wall Street's fourth-quarter
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The question for Amazon is whether they can hit the ball out
of the park again this Christmas,'' said Nicole Vanderbilt, an
analyst with Jupiter Communications, a research firm in New York.
``The danger for them is that they aren't No. 1 in all of the new
categories they have entered. And they have been heavily rewarded
up to now for seeking growth opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapid growth, of course, is a blessing and a curse. In each of
Amazon's four holiday seasons so far, it has nearly buckled under
the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were woefully unprepared when we started in 1995,'' Bezos
acknowledged. ``We were so dumb we didn't have any packing tables
and wrapped packages on the concrete floor.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, so many buyers swarmed to Amazon's Web site that the
company had to turn away customers, posting a notice to try the
site later. ``We would rather lock people out of the store than
have the gifts show up December 26th,'' Bezos said.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the near-death experience emboldened the company.
Early in 1998, Bezos decided that Amazon should not be just a
bookstore, but an everything store.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most frustrating part of shopping is not being able to
find what you are looking for,'' Bezos said. ``Two years ago, we
realized that if we could solve that problem and provide truly
universal selection, we could build an important and lasting
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, however, almost didn't last through Christmas 1998. It
was so unprepared for the holiday volume that executives and office
workers were ordered to work second shifts every day for three
weeks, packing boxes or answering customers' e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the number of orders starting to increase and then
everyone gasped,'' recalled Andrew N. Westlund, Amazon's vice
president for warehouse, transportation and engineering. ``We were
starting to run out of gift wrap, and finding additional wrapping
paper right before Christmas is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon squeaked by, processing most of the orders on time. It
found some substitute wrapping paper, if not in the best designs.
But even before that experience, the company decided that things
had to change in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``On December 22, I pulled back and started to think about
Christmas for this year,'' Westlund said. Within a week, the
company decided to build five modern warehouses, one each in
Nevada, Kansas and Georgia and two in Kentucky, at a total cost of
$300 million. With more than three million square feet of space _
including two older, low-technology warehouses in Seattle and
Delaware _ Amazon will have the capacity to handle more than $10
billion in sales, analysts estimate.
</P>
<P>
   But by operating its own warehouses, Amazon forfeits the
leverage that allows companies like Yahoo and eBay to run Web sites
that serve millions of people without ever having to stock anything
with three dimensions. Most online stores find other companies to
hold and ship their goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hire designers and database specialists and people
who are high productivity,'' said David Friedensohn, chief
executive of BigStar Entertainment, an online video store. ``I
don't want 1,000 hourly workers sitting in a warehouse wrapping
presents. There are plenty of people bidding for that business.''
</P>
<P>
   But at Amazon, Westlund said that if it hired another company to
handle distribution, it would risk losing the advantages of
innovations aimed at serving customers better and more efficiently.
``We would be the teacher and then they would offer those services
to our competitors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Building five automated warehouses is difficult enough, but the
company decided that four of them had to be operating by Christmas
1999. Typically, building one such warehouse takes 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Making the job much worse, the warehouses needed to handle a
wide range of merchandise _ so wide, in fact, that Amazon didn't
know what it would be. ``My job was to leap ahead of the marketing
people by building a facility that was so broad that when the
company's visionaries say `take a sharp turn,' we can do it,''
Westlund said. ``I joked that we might sell log splitters. Now,
with table saws, we're pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   As the warehouses were being built, the company was deciding
which products to add next. The likely prospects were toys and
consumer electronics, as both had been good sellers among Amazon's
gift selections the previous Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The initial plan was to introduce these ``stores'' on the Web
site in the fall. By March, however, the company decided to open
them in July, so it could work out the bugs before Christmas. (The
home improvement section was added to the planned Christmas lineup
in early fall, mainly to take advantage of the experience of Joe
Galli, Amazon's new president, a veteran of Black &AMP; Decker.
Tellingly, Amazon got it up and running in just 60 days.)
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the toy and electronics stores opened, planning for
how the holidays would be handled on the Amazon site began in
earnest. To David Risher, Amazon's senior vice president for
merchandising, that was quite an accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997, we started thinking about Christmas in November,''
Risher said. ``In 1998, it was October. We started thinking about
Christmas this year in June.''
</P>
<P>
   A team was deployed to create new features for the site to
encourage gift-giving. One is a system that lets shoppers put
together a big order, for example, then send each item, tagged with
an individual message, to a different address. Amazon also built a
wish list _ much like a wedding registry _ that lets people tell
the world what gifts they want to receive.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, Amazon's innovative features _ like the
ability to order a book with one mouse click _ put it far ahead of
the competition. This year, however, other sites now offer most of
these features, so Amazon must ensure that its engineering
experience makes its versions better, or at least that its
reputation makes customers think they are better.
</P>
<P>
   The quirky personality of Bezos, who has taken to granting some
wish-list wishes himself, may also win the hearts of some
customers. ``I like to type in a random name, say `Smith' in New
York, and buy them a little thing off their list,'' said . Bezos,
who owns about $10 billion of Amazon stock. ``It's more fun than
feeding parking meters.''
</P>
<P>
   There are now weekly Christmas war-room meetings, devoted to
making contingency plans for any breaks in Amazon's elaborate
chain. If the Delaware warehouse runs out of a given book, for
example, Amazon will send it by air express from Nevada, even if
the customer paid for surface freight. Amazon would not say how
much that plan would cost, but it warned Wall Street that such
extra shipping expenses would contribute to its wider-than-expected
losses this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years from now, no one will remember whether Amazon.com
spent an extra $100,000 upgrading shipping from the West Coast to
the East Coast,'' Risher said. ``All that will matter is whether
electronic commerce gave people a good or bad experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Amazon figures that it has enough people this year
that executives won't have to work the graveyard shift packing
boxes. But just in case, everyone at headquarters has signed up for
the equivalent of the Army Reserves at one or another of Amazon's
facilities, to be called in if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Each online store, meanwhile, has been adding merchandise and
preparing holiday promotions. About two weeks before Thanksgiving,
a dozen top managers of the toy department, all in their 20s and
30s, assembled in a conference room at Amazon's new headquarters, a
retrofitted Art Deco hospital that looms over a hill on the edge of
downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The conference table, like all the company's desks, is made of a
door bolted to two-by-fours, a deliberate message of frugality to
employees of a company that is losing hundreds of millions of
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   First there was a status report. ``Video games are rockin',''
said Harrison Miller, 38, general manager of the toy store. Just a
week earlier, Amazon added a selection of 3,500 video games, three
times the selection of a typical electronics store.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the discussion centered on how to fit links to all of
the company's special features and promotions onto its already
crowded pages. They found space for a big promotion for a catalog
that features classic wooden trains and blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ended with the reading of a top 10 list _ actually,
two of them: the top 10 things that people search for in Amazon's
toy section and, more important, the top 10 search terms that bring
a customer no results.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the first list, to no one's surprise, is Pokemon, the
Japanese characters that delight children and perplex anyone over
15. Next are dolls, Nintendo and other video games and Furby.
</P>
<P>
   The group spends more time on the other list: No.1 on it is
``Pokedex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone know what that is?'' Miller asks. Someone replies that
it is an electronic organizer listing the attributes of the
hundreds of Pokemon characters. An executive is assigned an
``action item'' to find a supply as soon as possible. No.2 is
``Pokeman,'' a misspelling. The site will be reprogrammed to send
searchers to the Pokemon page.
</P>
<P>
   Search lists are among the most powerful ways in which online
retailers can outpace traditional stores in responding to
customers. There is no easy way for Toys ``R'' Us, for example, to
keep track of toys its customers can't find in its stores. But
Amazon can log each one and work to get it in stock.
</P>
<P>
   That helps to explain one of the stranger aspects of Amazon's
strategy: zShops, the new listing of the products for sale by 3,500
small merchants. Many analysts worry that Amazon risks sullying its
reputation if some of the shopkeepers to which it refers customers
do not offer top-notch service.
</P>
<P>
   But Bezos says Amazon wants people to see the company as the
place to start searching for anything they want to buy, and the
auctions and zShops bring to the site thousands of items that it
doesn't yet stock.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon earns a commission on each sale and collects rental fees
from vendors. Perhaps more important, it gets to compile a list of
exactly what all its customers want, and that will help it choose
the categories to enter next.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in Fernley, Nev., next to nothing but scrub grass and a
small flat casino, Amazon's warehouse is a vast beige building with
two dozen loading docks.
</P>
<P>
   It looks so big that if Amazon ever decided to sell jet planes
through its Web site, they could be stored and shipped from this
facility. For now, the warehouse holds more than a million types of
items _ towering piles of toys, stacks of big-screen televisions
and shelves with enough books to fill a university research
library.
</P>
<P>
   Every item has a bar code that is scanned 17 times from the
moment it arrives on the loading dock to the time it is shipped
away, so that special computer software (written by Amazon) can
always keep track of where it is.
</P>
<P>
   That is more scanning than necessary, but, as always, the
company is willing to overdo it just to make sure orders don't get
lost. ``Efficiency and productivity lie in our future,'' said
Galli, Amazon's president.
</P>
<P>
   The warehouse is already a wonder of automation. On the third
level, for example, is a box of about a dozen Raggedy Ann dolls
with a red light in front of it. When the light goes on, it means
that someone, somewhere in the world, has gone to Amazon's Web site
and ordered the doll.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, a worker comes by, picks out a doll, puts it into a
green cart and deposits it on a conveyor belt that rushes through
the vast warehouse. The doll moves from belt to belt until it drops
into a long chute-like bin, one of 2,000 used to assemble orders.
As the conveyer moves, other items for the same customer also fall
into the bin.
</P>
<P>
   When the order is complete, another light flashes below the bin,
and a worker puts all the binned items into a box, which then
travels down another series of belts through machines that pack it,
tape it, weigh it and affix a mailing label. Yet more conveyers
carry it directly into a truck at one of the loading docks.
</P>
<P>
   But the warehouse is still working out some problems. One
morning about two weeks ago, the shrink wrapper, which encloses
books in plastic to protect them during shipping, wasn't quite
getting the wrap to shrink. And one of the devices that affixes
shipping labels onto boxes as they flow past was malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   But, in general, the place was humming. Boxes flowed off the
assembly line, this one headed for California, the next to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And the holiday rush was under way: Amazon had started mailing
out discount coupons to its better customers, and orders were up 60
percent from a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next month, I'll really know what Santa Claus feels
like,'' said Michael Perkins, the warehouse manager. ``I can't
disappoint those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the automation, one crucial step must be completed
by hand: gift-wrapping. Alongside the conveyor belts, the company
is busily building more than 150 tables equipped with rolls of
wrapping paper, piles of boxes and spools of the red ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard for our deluxe gift wrap is that it has to be
better than your mom would do for you,'' Bezos said. ``That's just
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The task of teaching hundreds of workers how to wrap 30 gifts an
hour falls to Kathy Van Woert, known back at headquarters as ``the
gift-wrap goddess of Fernley.''
</P>
<P>
   She left her longtime job in an office supply company last March
to join Amazon. Until then, she had never bought anything online.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after volunteering to be the gift wrap trainer, she spends
two hours with each new wrapper, explaining how to use the wrap
sleeve and tie the satin bows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like tying your shoe,'' Ms. Van Woert says
helpfully. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if people don't order their presents, especially
toys, from Amazon, there will be enough extra paper to make this
part of the Nevada desert look like an installation by the artist
Christo. And toy sales may be difficult to build, given the name
recognition of Toys ``R'' Us and the early lead in online selling
taken last year by eToys.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Amazon's research shows that even though the company has
been adding new product types for more than a year, consumers
stubbornly associate it only with books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a huge challenge,'' Bezos said. ``Do we have the best
toy store? Yes. Do people know it? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is sending $10 gift certificates for toys to many of its
past book buyers. And two of its quirky new television commercials
_ featuring a chorus of balding lounge singers _ focus on toys.
</P>
<P>
   To drive the point home, Bezos concocted a publicity-grabbing
contest called ``Toy Quest,'' which invites children to design
their own toys. The winning toy will be manufactured and sold next
year by Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't contain myself,'' Bezos said, with his trademark belly
laugh. ``It's just amazing how creative some of these little kids
are. We might have the best-selling toy ever.''
</P>
<P>
   In a funny way, Bezos has won a very similar contest. Wall
Street has put up the money to realize his dream for the most
``amazing'' and ``creative'' store that sells everything. Now the
warehouses have been built and the ribbon has been bought. There's
only this Christmas, and maybe a few more, to find out just how big
Amazon.com can be.

   MOROCCO: EXILES TO RETURN
</P>
<P>
   The family of Mehdi Ben Barka, the opposition leader who
disappeared in France in 1965, is to return to Morocco Saturday
after decades of banishment, his son, Bachir Ben Barka, said on
French television. The family's return follows the death this year
of King Hassan II, whose son Muhammad VI has taken steps to allow
prominent exiles to return. The elder Ben Barka, an outspoken
opponent of King Hassan II, disappeared after being picked up by
the French police on Oct. 29, 1965. His body was never found.

   Ethiopia called on South Africa to extradite the former

   Mount Kilimanjaro is 10 feet shorter than previously thought,
scientists said. Tanzanian and German scientists scaled the
mountain earlier this year and, with the aid of the Global
Positioning System, set the peak's height at 19,442.8 feet. Rising
sea levels, compression of the mountain over the years and previous
errors account for the 10-foot difference, they said. In May,
American mountaineers measured Mount Everest's height at 29,035
feet _ 6.6 feet higher than officially recognized for 45 years.

indictment on corruption charges this week. Since leaving office in
1994, he has been convicted of bribing tax inspectors and false
accounting. Now he is charged with trying to bribe judges over a

TRIP TO A BANK MACHINE   BECOMES AN ALL NIGHT STAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RARITAN TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ As automated teller machine vestibules
go, the one at the Commerce Bank on Royal Road here is awfully
nice, measuring a spacious 14 feet by 16 feet, with gleaming black
tiles surrounding a rectangle of carpet and a view onto a
colonnaded porch.
</P>
<P>
   As a hotel room, however, Jim Kahlke found it wholly inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:10 p.m. Thursday, after Thanksgiving dinner, Kahlke, a
36-year-old medical supply technician, stopped at the ATM to
withdraw some money to a buy a Christmas present for his 8-year-old
daughter. As he completed the transaction, he heard the door make
an ominous electronic click. He was locked in.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Kahlke said, he figured another customer would soon
visit the bank, just off a suburban highway on the outskirts of
Flemington, 50 miles southwest of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after about an hour,'' he said, ``I came to realize it was
late on Thanksgiving night. Bars were closed so people didn't need
money for a couple of drinks. Family gatherings were going on or
had already broken up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahlke, who lives with his parents about five miles away, was
expected home. But there was nothing he could do. He did not have a
cellular telephone and the ATM did not have emergency phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked for release buttons, panic buttons, resets,
anything,'' he said. Kahlke, a bearded, solidly built six-footer,
tried to shoulder the heavy double doors open, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a watch, he made transactions on the cash machine to
keep track of time, checking his balance or withdrawing $20 at a
clip.
</P>
<P>
   He looked into the half-lit bank, where a tray of cookies lay
tantalizingly on a counter. He looked out the doors at the cars
going by on Highway 202, impossibly distant.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, he stared at the blue screen on the cash
machine's blue screen, which said: ``Welcome to Commerce Bank,
America's most convenient bank. Open seven days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 10 minutes to 6 Friday morning, Kahlke said, the
assistant branch manager, Peter Crane, arrived to open the bank
early.
</P>
<P>
   Crane could not get the door open either, Kahlke said, and had
to go around the back to let himself in. Crane seemed rather
embarrassed, Kahlke said, ``sympathetic but not apologetic.''
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Bank spokesman, David Flaherty, said, ``It was a very
unusual incident _ it never happened before.'' He said the bank was
looking into the problem to find out what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kahlke got into his car and drove home, he stopped at
Crane's desk. ``I told him I wanted to withdraw every cent from my
account and close it out,'' Kahlke said. ``I think he said, `I
don't blame you,' but I'm not sure.''

   WAR-ZONE-FILM (New York) _ Tim Roth sits at a table in a sleek
SoHo hotel looking oddly battle-ready. ``I'm prepared for
anything,'' he says after a sip of bottled water. Actually, he's an
actor preparing for the opening, on Dec. 10, of his directorial
debut, ``The War Zone.'' And he has reason to be wary. Based on the
British writer Alexander Stuart's novel about a family destroyed by
incest, the film is an unflinching adaptation of a disturbing story
that has already provoked sharply divided reactions. By David Bahr.

   FIENNES-FILMS (New York) _ Ralph Fiennes, a very private actor,
who turns 37 this month, has earned a reputation for being somewhat
insular and aloof since his astonishing debut in 1983 as the brutal
Nazi concentration camp director in Steven Spielberg's
``Schindler's List,'' for which he was nominated for best
supporting actor. His new movie, ``The End of the Affair,'' which
opens on Friday, takes place in crowded cafes that it is impossible
not to be reminded of Maurice Bendrix, the brooding, disaffected
1940s intellectual he plays in the film. ``The End of The Affair''
is based on the Graham Greene novel of the same name and was
arguably the author's most autobiographical work, drawing on his
illicit love affair with a married American named Catherine
Walston. By Jennet Conant. (Moved). Photo.

   RUSSIAN-FILMS (New York) _ At last year's New York Film
Festival, the director Aleksei Guerman, a bear of a man with a
disarming wit and a typically Russian sense of irony, introduced
his latest work, ``Khroustaliov, My Car!'' to the press. It was the
first time in his 40-year career, he said, that he had completed a
film that had not been immediately shelved by the authorities. His
previous work, ``My Friend Ivan Lapshin,'' spent four years in
limbo before its release in 1985, when it became a celebrated film
of the perestroika era. ``Khroustaliov, My Car!'' which on Friday
opens FilmFest, a series of recent films from Russia and the former
Soviet republics at the Museum of Modern Art, is set in 1953,
during the last days of Stalin's reign of terror. By Nancy Ramsey.

</P>
<P>
   ALVIN-AILEY-DANCE (Undated) _ It's hard to believe that Judith
Jamison is already celebrating her 10th anniversary as artistic
director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Next month, she
will receive a Kennedy Center Honor for her contribution to
20th-century dance. As arguably the most popular modern-dance
company in the world prepares for its monthlong season, Wednesday
(the 10th anniversary of Ailey's death) through Jan. 2 at City
Center in Manhattan, Ailey's mission to keep modern dance alive
through an eclectic repertory by a variety of choreographers has
been largely accomplished. By Robert Tracy. (Moved). Photo.

   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JOHN-ADAMS-MUSIC (Undated) _ John Adams, 52, an innovator in
Minimalist style music, has a 10-CD retrospective on the Nonsuch
record label, ``The John Adams Earbox,'' which invites even
listeners who know his work to hear it afresh in a career-wide
context. By Allan Kozinn. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE-PERLE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Generations of music students
have gained admission to 20th-century music theory through the
imposing but welcoming portal of George Perle's book ``Serial
Composition and Atonality.'' But a lot of its readers may not have
known that Perle is himself a fine composer, or that paradoxically,
his creative work stands distinctly aside from many of the
practices detailed in his book. Opportunities to hear his music
arrive in anticipation of his 85th birthday, next May. On Tuesday
evening at Cooper Union in New York City, the Da Capo Chamber
Players will present a concert of songs as well as chamber works.
By Paul Griffiths. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   BACH-RECITALS (subslug) (New York) _ With a fascinating concert
season well underway in New York, as one institution after another
tries intently if belatedly to come to terms with music of the 20th
century, it is easy for the moment to forget dreary, predictable
seasons of a year or two ago. It is also easy to assume that all is
well under the surface. But two recent Bach recitals suggest
otherwise, showing devastating anomalies in the way young
performers are fed into the system, or are not. By James R.
Oestreich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KEITH-JARRETT-ALBUM (Undated) _ Keith Jarrett's new solo album,
``The Melody at Night, With You,'' begs a listener to think about
the relationship between music and mortality. Jarrett, the Proust
of jazz, had chronic fatigue syndrome recently; for a while the
Internet was bubbling with rumors of his imminent demise that
gained credence after he canceled several concerts. The album is
dedicated to his wife, Rose Anne, and if one reads the song titles
_ ``I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,'' ``Somebody to Watch Over
Me,'' ``Don't Ever Leave Me'' _ it can be surmised that she has
been an integral part of making Jarrett healthy again. By Peter
Watrous. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CARDBOARD-ARCHITECT (Undated) _ Shigeru Ban, an architect who
lives in Tokyo, in the last five years has responded to the news of
earthquakes and other disasters as if to a call of conscience.
After the Kobe quake in 1994, Ban designed units of cardboard and
plastic housing for the thousands who had been driven from their
homes. The following year, he established the Volunteer Architects
Network, a nongovernmental agency of the United Nations. This year,
under the aegis of that agency, he has coordinated the production
and shipment of cardboard housing units for refugees in Turkey. By
Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FACES-CENTURY-PHOTOGS (London) _ Photography in this century has
brought contemporary history, national and international, as close
as coffee spoons while at the same time keeping it at the safe
distance of reduced and isolated representations. ``Faces of the
Century: A Sainsbury's Photographic Exhibition,'' currently at the
National Portrait Gallery in London (through Jan. 30), points this
up quite cleverly. (Sainsbury's is a private arts sponsorship
program set up by grocery chain money in 1981 to deliver, as the
accompanying catalogue explains, ``high quality, imaginative and
dynamic arts sponsorships involving as many people as possible in
the communities where we trade.'') In restricting the century to
faces, and British faces at that _ you had best look elsewhere for
anyone important, like Stalin and Mao. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HUMAN-BODY-PHOTOGS (Lisbon, Portugal) _ In strictly Darwinian
terms, the evolution of the human body may be slow, yet in this
century perception of the body has changed beyond recognition.
Photography is a major reason for this. More democratic, accessible
and unforgiving than painting or drawing, it has shaped how we look
at each other _ and ourselves. It has also redefined our notion of
the body in everything from entertainment, sports and fashion to
wars, famine and medicine. This, at least, is the premise behind
``The Century of the Body: Photoworks 1900 to 1999,'' an ambitious
photographic exhibition that runs through Dec. 19 at a cultural
center in Lisbon. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JULIE-TAYMOR-ART (Columbus, Ohio) _ Can dramas that have been
stripped of their actors and actions, stripped of everything but
their props, costumes and sets, still be dramatic? The exhibition
``Playing with Fire,'' a survey of the artifacts of Julie Taymor's
25-year career as a director and designer of operas, musicals,
movies and plays, is a perfect test case. The exhibition is being
held at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio. It will
be at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York in March. By Sarah
Boxer. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-AMERICAN-HOLLOW (Undated) _ Rory Kennedy's glowing face and
great smile stand out in the family photograph. Next to her is the
matriarch, who has 13 children and grandchildren galore. Most live
near her and all return regularly en masse for holidays and other
family gatherings. There are the young men, some of whom have had
problems with drinking, drugs or romance. The mentally retarded
sister is not there; she lives elsewhere. Not long ago, one of the
sons was arrested and jailed. The whole family united to support
him but couldn't come up with the $2,500 bail. That's right, it's
the Bowling family of Mudlick Hollow, Ky., the subjects of Ms.
Kennedy's HBO documentary ``American Hollow,'' which has its
television premiere Monday night. If many things about the Bowlings
seem similar to the huge Irish-American clan that Ms. Kennedy comes
from _ and she acknowledges that she found it easy to identify with
them, despite the obvious differences _ that just makes her point
about the value of documentary filmmaking. By Anita Gates. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BOOKWORM-RADIO (Santa Monica, Calif.) _ In the world of serious
poetry and fiction, where text and technique are more important
than conventional book tour prattle or even plot, ``Bookworm'' is
considered something of a national resource, a sanctuary from
lightweight pop fiction and/or the canonization of well-known
authors. Although run on a shoestring and distributed free to a
shaky network of 50 or so public radio stations, the program has
run for 10 years and attracted heavyweights like Tom Wolfe, Scott
Turow, E.L. Doctorow, John Irving, Norman Mailer, Richard Ford,
Joan Didion, Toni Morrison, Paul Theroux, Joyce Carol Oates, Salman
Rushdie, Amy Tan, Gore Vidal, Ann Beattie and Nicholson Baker. The
creator, producer and host, Michael Silverblatt, a tall, roundfaced
man in his 40s, welcomed them all in a tiny basement recording
studio at KCRW, a local public radio station. By Andy Meisler.

WOODEN CLASSIC BEGINS TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ John Wooden listened for 20 minutes as Mike
Krzyzewski, Mike Montgomery, Cliff Ellis and Henry Bibby showered
him with praise Friday before talking about today's sixth annual
John Wooden Classic at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski, whose 16th-ranked Duke Blue Devils play Bibby's USC
Trojans at 2:30 p.m., thanked Wooden for giving back to basketball
more than anyone in history. Montgomery, who leads No. 9 Stanford
against No. 2 Auburn at noon, called Wooden a role model and
legend.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was Wooden's turn to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if I believed all this stuff these coaches were
saying about me, I'd be a pretty bad person,'' Wooden said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he wasn't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess some things don't change much,'' Wooden said. ``If you
listen to these coaches, they'll tell you their opponent is the
better team and that they'll have a tough time getting by. That
sort of stuff happened in my day; I did some of that. I always
thought all the good players went to other schools and that (UCLA)
got the players that (were left over).''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the old coach is on to something. The way Krzyzewski and
Co. talked up their respective opponents today, you'd think these
guys were playing the 1969 UCLA Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, though, the two matchups offer some intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   USC, coming off a last-second 52-50 loss to Utah State at the
Maui Invitational, plays Duke, an uncharacteristic 2-2, in a game
that should define where the Trojans are as a team, and what work
remains.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time in seven days that USC faces an Atlantic
Coast Conference power with North Carolina dealing the Trojans an
82-65 loss in Maui last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils lost four impact players from last year's
national runner-ups, three of whom left school early for the NBA _
freshman Corey Maggette, William Avery and Elton Brand. Also gone
from that team is Trajan Langdon.
</P>
<P>
   Duke opened with losses to Stanford and Connecticut before
beating Army and Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, good players continue to roll through Durham, so nobody
feels too sorry for Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably the best 2-2 team in the nation,'' Bibby
said. ``Hopefully we can come through and make this a basketball
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's best player is Shane Battier, who averages 15 points and
draws the other team's best offensive player. He's also the only
player with experience in a starting lineup featuring two freshmen
_ 6-foot-9 forward Carlos Boozer and point guard Jason Williams,
who is averaging 13 points and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Blue Devils have seven freshmen and just one senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the youngest team I've ever coached,'' Krzyzewski said.
``We have a chance to be really good, but are we ready (right now)
to play a polished basketball game? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   USC goes without forward Jarvis Turner, who is out with a foot
injury. The Trojans have been up and down, routing Memphis 92-65,
then following up with the loss to Utah State a day later.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are just as young as Duke. Three starters _ Brandon
Granville (point guard), Sam Clancy and David Bluthenthal _ are
sophomores, and the other two are juniors.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy leads the team in scoring (17) and is third in rebounding
(7.0). Jeff Trepagnier (15.0), Brian Scalabrine (14.2) and
Bluthenthal (10.5) are the other top scorers.
</P>
<P>
   While Duke and USC are still searching for identities, Stanford
and Auburn have established themselves as national-championship
material.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal, which features former Harvard-Westlake stars Jason
and Jarron Collins, opened the year by winning the four-team
Coaches for Cancer tournament at Madison Square Garden, beating
Duke 80-79 and Iowa 72-58.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is without power forward Mark Madsen, who will be out
until mid-December with an injured hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinal still has the Collins twins, who are playing
together for the first time in two years, plus impact freshman
Casey Jacobsen from Glendora High, who is averaging 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be a solid team for a long time,'' Auburn
coach Cliff Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Collins (9 ppg, 8.5 rpg) has played only 104 minutes since
getting to Stanford, suffering various injuries. He's reasonably
healthy now, although sore knees keep him from practicing every
day. But his impact, along with that of Jason (13 ppg, 7.8 rpg), is
crucial in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play extremely well together,'' Montgomery said. ``and
you can tell that they were well-coached. They're legitimate,
quality big people and they've been a very effective combination.''
</P>
<P>
   They need to play strong inside today. Auburn (2-0) is deep and
athletic, boasting one of the top players in the country in Chris
Porter, an explosive 6-7 forward who's averaging 15.5 points and
9.5 rebounds. He leads a physical frontline that also features
7-footer Mamadou N'diaye, who averages 16 points and 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers return four starters from a team that won the
Southeastern Conference championship last year and reached the
Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they invited us to play in this event we accepted right
away, but when I found out we'd be playing Auburn I wished we'd
just gone to the beach or to Disneyland,'' Montgomery said. ``It's
not about what they're doing, it's how they're doing it. We'll have
our hands full, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford hasn't shot particularly well, just 40 percent, which
could hurt them against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their physical toughness on the boards will be a challenge,''
Montgomery said. ``And the advantage a team like Auburn has, if
they get in trouble (offensively), they'll just pitch it off the
glass and let four guys go get it.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ How should New Yorkers get ready for possible
disruptions from the year 2000 problem? The city is distributing
2.5 million brochures suggesting steps that would help in coping
with any emergency, like a storm or a blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Basic items to have on hand include nonperishable food, baby
food, diapers, water, battery-operated radios or televisions, spare
batteries, a nonelectric can opener, flashlights, extra blankets
and a first aid kit.
</P>
<P>
   The city does not advise taking extra money out of the bank but
suggests that anyone who wants extra cash for the holiday weekend
should make their withdrawal before Dec. 31. It also recommends
keeping paper copies of financial records, developing plans that
allow family members to stay in touch with each other, and having
plans for alternate shelter should a home become uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   If heat is lost, New Yorkers should allow water to trickle from
faucets to prevent pipes from freezing but refrain from using any
heating or cooking devices not designed for indoor use. If
possible, home heating fuel tanks should be topped off before Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
   The city provides links to organizations with more extensive
advice, including the Red Cross, on its year 2000 Internet site:
www.ci.nyc.ny.us/y2kinfo. The city has also set up what it calls a
year 2000 hot line, with recorded information, at (888) 469-2925
(that is, 4-NYC-Y2K).

   DE KALB, Ill. _ Before the fall harvest was over, Vince Faivre
was surveying row after row of soybeans and counting his losses.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the best technology nor the promise of a bumper crop
seemed to matter. For the second consecutive year, he expected to
lose money, as much as $60 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   And his thoughts ran to three things that are hardly good for
the independent farmer: the growing public concern about
bio-engineered crops, a spate of huge agricultural mergers and
commodity prices that had plummeted to their lowest levels in
nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no profit in farming anymore,'' said Faivre,
(pronounced FAY-ver) 39, as he stepped out of the cab of his
combine on his 700-acre spread about 60 miles west of Chicago. ``A
year ago, I would have said we've been through these valleys
before, but it's a much gloomier picture right now.''
</P>
<P>
   While the government has kept many farmers afloat with emergency
aid, which the Agriculture Department says could reach $22 billion
this year, net farm income has fallen more than 38 percent since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, agricultural experts say these are hard times for
farmers. ``Prices are as low as they have been in decades,'' said
Keith Collins, chief economist at the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   With a new array of scientific and technological processes
lifting crop yields and tailoring food products to individual
companies and specific markets, farmers are producing more food on
fewer acres in less time. And therein lies both the promise and the
perils for the independent farmer.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest farms _ those with more than $250,000 in
sales _ now account for more than 72 percent of all agricultural
sales, up from 53 percent a decade ago. And after the elimination
last year of many government regulations on production, farmers are
being subjected to market forces they have not faced since before
the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers are worried about being squeezed by giant
agricultural companies. ``There's a fear this will turn into
14th-century feudalism,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said.
``Those farmers will become serfs. We're not there yet, but it may
be coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Among farmers' worries is whether to plant seeds that have been
bio-engineered to ward off pests. Bio-engineering has been hailed
as a godsend to farmers looking for higher crop yields, but it also
faces growing opposition. Although genetically modified seeds have
been approved by federal regulators and were planted on more than
70 million acres of farmland in the United States in 1999, critics
have repeatedly and volubly questioned whether genetically modified
crops are safe for consumption and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for many farmers is not just about the current
financial situation and their income,'' said Michael Boehlje, a
professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University in West
Lafayette, Ind. ``In the back of their minds, there's a set of
concerns about the long term. They want to know how they are going
to participate in the new agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new agriculture involves far more than bio-engineering.
Farmers have complained periodically that big corporations have
gained dominance and unfair bargaining power, and now a host of
economists, regulators and lawmakers are taking up the farmers'
cause, arguing that the Darwinian pace has quickened.
</P>
<P>
   Though some economists caution that the downturn may be causing
American farmers to search for scapegoats, a growing number of
economists, regulators and lawmakers are worried about the shifting
balance of power that favors a handful of agricultural giants over
a shrinking number of independent farmers, confused and bedeviled
by all the changes.
</P>
<P>
   On the Iowa plains, the new economics of agriculture is a
hardship on farmers like John Whitaker, 43, who is struggling to
make his mortgage payments. To support their three children, his
wife, Lorrie, has taken a job, and he also works in county
government and as president of the Iowa Farmers Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for anything out there that will make money,''
said Whitaker, who has a 500-acre farm in Hillsboro, where he
raises cattle and sheep and grows corn, wheat and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   Here in De Kalb, the declining prospects mean that Faivre is
relying more heavily on what his wife, Jerilyn, earns as a cook at
a local university. There will not be a new John Deere combine for
next year's harvest. And the Faivres will not be replacing their
1989 Dodge Caravan, which has already logged 186,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 20 years of farming on his own, Faivre is having
new doubts about how the independent farmer can survive. ``Not many
people are coming into this business,'' Faivre said. ``I can only
think of a handful of farmers who are younger than myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, agricultural experts say, Faivre represents a
dying breed, as many small farmers are trading in the gloom and
doom down on the farm for the booming economy that has sprouted
just beyond its borders.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reliable data on the number of people who have left
farming in the last few years, but agricultural officials see a
growing body of anecdotal evidence suggesting that many are
retiring early, cashing in what equity they have or simply selling
their farmland into a booming housing market and looking elsewhere
for work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, agriculture has been undergoing big changes for
decades. Farms have grown bigger and bigger, swallowing many small
operations, and huge agricultural business conglomerates have
emerged. In the last two years, however, mergers in the
agricultural industry have resulted in such huge companies that the
nation's largest farm groups are warning that the dwindling
competition among suppliers will doom the family farm.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation's seed supply has been consolidated into two
giant camps, one controlled by Monsanto and the other by DuPont,
which recently acquired Pioneer Hi-Bred International, the nation's
largest seed company. Together, they control 80 percent of the
nation's corn seeds and are planning to alter more of their
products genetically.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the world's largest grain handlers, Cargill and
Continental Grain, merged their grain operations this year. The hog
industry has also consolidated. Smithfield Foods, the nation's
largest pork producer, agreed last September to acquire Murphy
Family Farms, the second-biggest producer, and the pork unit of
Tyson Foods, the No. 5 producer.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration is staggering. More than a fifth of the
nation's pork is now slaughtered at one company. Four big companies
now control about 70 percent of all cattle slaughter, up from 39
percent in 1985, according to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is alarmed. George L. Priest, who specializes in
antitrust issues as a law professor at Yale University, says the
mergers are creating greater efficiencies in the market. ``There
have been tremendous concentrations in agriculture since World War
II,'' Priest said. ``But it's a sign there are economies of scale.
The basic consumer will benefit, but it will be tough on farmers
who may have to go into a different line of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry giants also dispute the notion that big agriculture
translates into bad agriculture or the end of the family farm.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill says a desire for efficiency is behind its own deal.
``In the grain business there is enormous pressure for
efficiency,'' said Lori Johnson, a spokeswoman for the company in
Minneapolis. ``In Continental, we knew we could reduce our costs,
which would lower the cost to the final consumer and put some money
in the hands of the farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, farmers complain that whether they are buying seeds,
shopping for new farm machinery or moving grain to market, they are
being forced to bargain with just a handful of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman of the Agriculture Department said a ``giant shadow''
looms over the family farm, making it more difficult for the
independent farmer to get a fair shake.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers like Faivre face the most difficult period since the
1980s, when American agriculture went into a long, steep decline.
Although farmers now benefit from low interest rates, grain prices
are disastrously low. Corn prices, for example, are $1.85 a bushel
now, down from $2.40 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even farmers awaiting relief from an $8.7 billion emergency aid
package approved last month by Congress and President Clinton say
they are considering new occupations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are also taking notice. The Agriculture and
Justice departments say they are looking into whether the
agriculture market is too heavily concentrated, and therefore
anti &UR; - &LR; competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, has asked the Justice
Department to give the ``most stringent scrutiny'' to Smithfield's
proposed acquisition of Tyson's pork division.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening with our pork farmers is that they have fewer
and fewer places to go with their hogs,'' Harkin said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to genetically modified seeds, Faivre, for one,
says he has new doubts about whether he should be planting them.
Because of growing opposition to modified crops in Europe and Asia,
and rising domestic concerns, he is already trimming back his
acreage for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although genetically modified plants have been approved as safe
by the government, some scientists and environmental groups say
they can harm certain species like monarch butterflies or create
superweeds that could not be killed easily.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Rissler, a scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists
in Washington, said: ``This is a very powerful technology that is
able to produce combinations of genes that have never been produced
before. And it's far from clear what the impact will be on the
environment and on humans who consume them. There have been studies
that indicate their potential environmental problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading makers of bio-engineered foods have vigorously
defended their safety, deriding as ``hysteria'' the campaign
against them, which has labeled bio-engineered crops as
``Frankenstein food.'' But with the public's confidence waning,
biotechnology companies are being put on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a concerted attack on the entire industry,'' said
Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, a trade group based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers who have been planting genetically modified seeds,
meanwhile, have begun wondering whether they are worth the trouble.
Because some modified foods have not been approved for export and
may be unwelcome in Europe and even at home, many farmers say they
may cut back their acreage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers just can't take the risk that the crops they plant in
the spring won't be marketable in the fall,'' said Gary Goldberg,
head of the American Corn Growers Association. He is not against
modified foods, he said, ``but our concern is that as long as
there's uncertainty, we have to protect our members.''
</P>
<P>
   Faivre is reducing his modified-soybean acreage to 50 percent
from 70 percent and is dropping modified corn. ``I've totally ruled
out going with genetically modified corn,'' he said. ``I'm not
going to separate it and go through all the hoops and hassles. It's
just too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Faivre, who has four young children, says his situation is dire.
He just sold 15,000 bushels of corn for $1.80 a bushel; he is
holding the rest in storage, hoping that prices rally.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone in his region is suffering. Average net farm
income in Illinois in 1998 slumped to about $11,074 from $62,000 in
1996, according to the Illinois Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of farming, meanwhile, has risen 12 percent in four
years. In Iowa, Whitaker says he spends about $35 an acre on seed,
$116 on fertilizers, herbicides and other chemicals and fuels and
$50 on interest, depreciation and repair on his farm equipment _ a
total of more than $200 an acre. He is losing $60 to $70 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping that the market will take a turn for the better, Faivre
is holding on to his 1979 John Deere combine that broke down
repeatedly during the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only tighten your belt so much,'' he said. ``You can
only live off your depreciation so long.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Faivre's neighbors, Joseph White, 44, says his chief
worry is prices. He is also cutting back on modified crops and
worrying about consolidation. ``What we fear is the inability of
farmers to make management decisions,'' says White, who grows corn
and soybeans on about 950 acres in Kaneville, Ill., about 10 miles
east of De Kalb. ``You worry about companies telling you if you're
going to put in ABC seedcorn, you're going to use DEF herbicide.''
</P>
<P>
   The more immediate concern for farmers, however, is depressed
prices, even in the face of vastly improved efficiency. More
precise farm machinery, pest-resistant crops and generally
favorable weather patterns have helped triple many crop yields in
the last quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a record 2.8 billion bushels of soybeans were
harvested in this country, more than triple the level of the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mapping our fields with satellites, we're harvesting
four and five times as many acres per day without much more fuel,''
said Lynn Jensen, president of the National Corn Growers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, farmers are losing ground on prices. They have
complained about the Freedom to Farm Act, which went into effect in
1996, and ended production restraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some believe it's the reason for the low prices,'' said John
Lawrence, a professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State
University in Ames. ``Under the old system, the government would
set aside land, but now farmers can plant whatever they want. So
there are now 12 million new acres of soybeans.''
</P>
<P>
   But with grain prices in a slump, Faivre says that to some
extent, he has given in to big agriculture. He is becoming a
contract farmer for a corporation, getting additional income from a
hog operation he built a few years ago. He contracted to house and
feed the hogs, not own them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's a pig motel for me,'' he says, wiping his
brow. ``We get them at 50 pounds and they leave at 250 pounds. The
pigs are in an automated system that feeds them. That's the way
things operate nowadays.''

SUMMER WORK PREPARES BRUINS' KNIGHT FOR HOT START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was no time to waste, no time to wallow.
After sitting out last season, UCLA guard Billy Knight had no
margin for error. He had to be in top shape, in top form, on the
first day of practice _ or risk a speedy slide down the depth
chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be ready to go on the first day, so I put everything
into my summer,'' said Knight, who had a groin injury last season.
``I couldn't waste a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Knight attended summer school each morning, then spent every
afternoon and evening on his game. He trained at a performance
clinic in Santa Monica that specializes in developing fast-twitch
muscles. (Knight has always been a half-step slow, and he doesn't
jump well.) He played pickup games at the Men's Gym, often against
NBA players. After dinner, he shot jumpers in the backyard of his
Westchester home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad's a gadget man,'' Knight said. ``He set up baskets at
different heights and with different rim sizes, and he made fake,
cutout men for me to shoot over. He rebounded while I shot for two
or three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   When practice began Oct. 16, Knight was ready. Always a superb
shooter, he had the conditioning to match and did not miss a
practice. He started and scored 10 points Tuesday against
Fairfield. As the wounded Bruins get healthy, Knight's minutes may
drop. But for now, he's entrenched in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new offense is tailor-made for him,'' coach Steve Lavin
said. ``He'll open things up for Dan (Gadzuric) and Jerome (Moiso)
because he can stretch defenses to the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our most-improved player from the end of last season to
the beginning of this. He spent time in the gym, lifting weights,
working on his strength and conditioning, and it has paid big
dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand: Knight's shooting touch does no good if his
man scores at will. Defense was Knight's problem before his groin
injury, and it remains so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Lavin has confidence in me on offense, but defensively,
I have to get better,'' Knight said. ``(Assistant Steve) Spencer
really gets into me about my defense. He's helped a lot. I'm still
struggling, but every day I see myself getting a little better.
Sometimes, I'm a step slow or I come out of my stance.''
</P>
<P>
   The club: Guard Ray Young played Tuesday with tape protecting
the partially torn ligaments in his right (shooting) thumb. Young
had difficulty holding the ball and was 0 of 6 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, his touch won't return until the tape disappears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a critical part (of the shooting stroke),'' Lavin
said. ``It's not like football, where you can wrap it up like a
club and beat guys with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Noise reduction: Baron Davis not only took his game to the NBA,
he took his mouth _ and love of practical jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locker room has totally changed,'' guard Earl Watson said.
``There's no jokester. With Baron gone, a lot of things have
changed. The locker room is kind of quiet. We miss him a lot.''

(ATTN: N.J.)  
 BISHOP GEORGE PAPAIOANNOU, 66, OF GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bishop George Papaioannou of New Jersey, who became the first
married priest to be elevated to the rank of bishop in the Greek
Orthodox Archdiocese of America, died on Monday at a hospital in
Bethesda, Md. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, the archdiocese said. Papaioannou
collapsed on Sunday while speaking at a stewardship dinner at St.
George Greek Orthodox Church in Bethesda, which he had served as
pastor for 27 years, until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Papaioannou was a widower; his wife, Maria, died in 1993.
Nonetheless, his elevation as bishop last year was highly unusual,
as that ecclesiastical rank has traditionally been reserved for
unmarried, celibate priests.
</P>
<P>
   Papaioannou was enthroned as head of the Diocese of New Jersey
on April 17, 1999, with responsibility for 52 parishes in New
Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia. For four
weeks last August and September, after the resignation of
Archbishop Spyridon, Papaioannou served as the archdiocese's
archepiscopal vicar. In that capacity, he was responsible for
making arrangements for the enthronement of the archdiocese's new
spiritual leader, Archbishop Demetrios.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Prodomos, Greece, George Papaioannou graduated from the
Patriarchal Theological School of Halki in Turkey in 1957. He
subsequently served Greek Orthodox churches in Istanbul, Turkey;
Hamilton, Ontario, and Manchester, N.H. In 1976, he received a
doctoral degree in theology from Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote three histories of Greek Orthodox life in the United
States, one of them on the archdiocese's 75th anniversary in 1997.
For 12 years, he wrote a column, ``Tell Me, Father,'' in the
archdiocese's newspaper, Orthodox Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Papaioannou is survived by a brother, Elias Papaioannou; three
daughters, Alexandra Mosko, Eleni Spirou and Vasiliki Szczesny; and
six grandchildren.

CONGRESSIONAL TRAFFIC OUTLOOK: POSSIBLE GRIDLOCK IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers) (lh) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 NYT Regional Newspapers  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers concede that Congress and the Clinton
White House didn't close many big deals this year, leaving undone
Medicare reform, Social Security changes, tax relief and managed
health care improvements among others.
</P>
<P>
   But some are already suggesting that 1999 and its second
consecutive crazy quilt budget package could be remembered as a
banner year when compared with 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that 2000 is setting itself up to be a
not-very-productive year as people are looking towards the 2000
presidential elections and will use that as an excuse to defer,''
predicted Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, major election years are used by the battling
parties to draw distinctions between their agendas, resulting in
more posturing than productivity. Political leaders prefer to raise
issues and then cast the election as an opportunity for voters to
decide which direction the nation should go on weighty matters.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates do much the same, hence Graham's
observation that Congress will be inclined to delay any substantive
action on the grounds that the new occupant of the White House
should get a crack at enacting his platform.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone views it that way. House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., is promising a meaningful second session when Congress
returns in January. Others see opportunities as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a lot of American citizens are fed up with the
partisan wrangling,'' said Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-N.C. ``This is a
time they would like to see some solid accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that doesn't come to pass, expect this spin: Republicans
will portray themselves as protecting the Social Security surplus
and reducing the role of the federal government, while Democrats
will trumpet their push for Medicare drug coverage and help for
working families.
</P>
<P>
   LISTEN TO THE MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   Who better than someone representing the South, the birthplace
of many of America's unique musical forms, to push for preservation
of rare recordings?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., is sponsoring a measure that would
establish a National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress
to make certain that historically important, perishable sound
recordings are not lost. His partner in the House is Rep. Steny
Hoyer, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it be jazz from New Orleans, Motown from Detroit,
country music from Nashville or the rock 'n' roll sound created by
Elvis Presley, American music has had a profound effect on popular
culture worldwide,'' said Hoyer.
</P>
<P>
   Patterned after an existing registry for film, the legislation
would establish a board to select recordings deemed to be
culturally, aesthetically or historically significant.
</P>
<P>
   CLEAN-UP HITTERS
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from South Carolina teamed up in an effort to clear
the name of Shoeless Joe Jackson, the legendary player for the
Chicago White Sox who was banished from baseball because of the
1919 World Series scandal.
</P>
<P>
   They believe that Jackson was unfairly implicated in the fixed
series, pointing out that he was acquitted in court of the gambling
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Jim DeMint sponsored a resolution passed by the
House that called on the baseball commissioner to review the
evidence and give Jackson ``his rightful place of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Fritz Hollings, a Democrat, and Strom Thurmond, a
Republican, successfully sponsored a similar resolution in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball and his detractors have been unfair to Mr. Jackson,''
said Thurmond, who at 96 might have his own personal memories of
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Why the South Carolina interest in Jackson? He was a native of
Greenville and once worked in the textile mills there.
</P>
<P>
   STORMY POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd managed to cause a bit of a ruckus on Capitol
Hill as North Carolina lawmakers scrambled to secure federal aid
for their state in the waning days of the session.
</P>
<P>
   While the final budget bill included millions of dollars in
Tarheel aid, another $81 million in agricultural aid passed by the
Senate failed to secure House approval.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans suggested that anti-tobacco Democrats wouldn't
agree to the aid, but Rep. David Price, D-N.C., said that was
wrong, and he called on House Speaker Dennis Hastert to consider
additional money next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eastern North Carolina continues to suffer in the aftermath of
the worst disaster our state has ever faced,'' Price wrote in a
letter to Hastert.

 EDITORIAL: FEDERAL BUDGETS, BOTH WAYS  (mk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 27:
</P>
<P>
   With tempers still sore from their recent federal budget
battles, Congress and the White House are quietly preparing for the
next fight. Both Republicans and Democrats are offering a split
personality to voters, proclaiming a love for fiscal discipline and
also for calculated spending increases in defense, education,
health programs and financing for research. The latest economic
projections suggest that both parties will be able to continue
avoiding hard choices. If the year finishes up in robust economic
health, federal revenues ought to be plentiful enough for Congress
and the White House to save some money and pay for targeted
programs at the same time. The election may also prove that voters
like having it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   With the last completed budget of the Clinton era now in place,
it is possible to take stock of just what President Clinton has
accomplished in budgetary terms. Since 1992, he has brought the
discretionary domestic spending portion of the budget down from
about 3.5 percent of the domestic economy to roughly 3.2 percent,
about the level that it was in 1969, according to Robert Reischauer
of the Brookings Institution. That figure will no doubt disappoint
the liberals and progressives who had hoped that the first Democrat
elected since the 1970s would reorder the nation's political
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, since Clinton has presided over what could
turn out to be the longest economic boom in American history, there
has been room to increase domestic spending in real terms even
though it is now less of a percentage of the economy than before.
Reischauer calculates that domestic discretionary spending _ the
core of what the battles with Congress have been about _ has gone
up 13.5 percent since Clinton took office, after inflation. That is
less than 2 percent a year, a modest increase but one that has had
a significant impact in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   The administration can rightly claim to have achieved some
targeted increases that go beyond these modest numbers, most
notably in education. Head Start is now financed at nearly twice
the level it was in 1993. The administration was able to win much
more support for after-school programs, job training and
acquisition of green spaces than many would have thought possible
after the Republicans took over Congress in 1995. On top of these
efforts has been the expansion of three major entitlement programs
_ the tax credit for the working poor, a health insurance program
for children in working-poor families and expanded health care for
disabled workers. These are all steps that, while incremental in
nature, have advanced the social welfare agenda under Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the next election, it seems safe to say that the
paradigm defined by Clinton in the 1990s may well prove
irresistible to his successor. The attraction of fiscal discipline
and balanced budgets has been used successfully by the Democrats to
blunt Republican efforts to enact big tax cuts. But the same tactic
has meant that the Democrats themselves cannot advocate big new
spending initiatives without opening themselves up to the same
charge of fiscal recklessness. Stringent budgets that allow
increased spending on the margins may be the hallmark of this era
of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   For all their sparring over fiscal issues, the major
presidential candidates in both parties have said little to
indicate that they would change this cautious approach to federal
budgets. Indeed, it is hard to imagine the model being reversed
until and unless there is an economic collapse. Having it both ways
is what politicians and many voters like best.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were young, earnest and itching for action, but
most of the 90 recruits who gathered in the Police Academy gym last
week did not have even a passing acquaintance with the boiling of
water, the clamping of umbilical cords or the other skills of
midwifery.
</P>
<P>
   And yet in an hourlong class, they were supposed to learn how to
become some facsimile of Marcus Welby, all calming gesture and
bedside manner, for a woman about to give birth in a token booth,
or on the Triborough Bridge, or some other spot several miles from
people with real medical degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the one wearing the shield,'' Sgt. Manuel Rodriguez,
an academy instructor, told the class. ``You can't look over your
shoulder for the other guy. Today you are the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era when being a police officer has come to mean much more
than simply patrolling, New York has expanded its recruit training
in a variety of areas outside the core of crime-fighting, like
first aid, domestic violence intervention and, yes, baby delivery.
Although there has long been a course to assist officers in
delivering the handful of babies who arrive impromptu each year,
instructors said the new class is much more sophisticated and
ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, there was just a short lesson,'' said Sgt.
George Jackman, an operations coordinator at the academy, on East
20th Street in Manhattan. ``We were just the `catchers.' Then you
called the ambulance. Now you have to take a more proactive
stance.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's class of 1,300 recruits is getting the full law
enforcement version of Lamaze, in which the instructors do
demonstrations, show a graphic film and lead discussions. The
recruits learn the anatomy of the birth canal, how to raise a
woman's hips to aid the delivery, how to use a bulb syringe to
suction out the newborn's mouth and, perhaps most importantly for
officers, how to determine how long you can wait for the ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   One tip: if the head is crowning, it's your show.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Kerry DeBellis, an instructor who delivered an infant on
the street five years ago, told the class that it is absolutely
normal to feel nervous when the baby begins coming out, especially
if it is an arm or a buttock that shows up first. ``Don't try to
push the baby back in,'' she advised.
</P>
<P>
   Later Officer Anthony Biscuti, another instructor, quizzed the
class. ``What is it called when the buttocks come out first?'' he
asked. ``Breech,'' the recruits yelled in boot-camp unison.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recruits, a buff bunch of men and women in
regulation sport shirts and shorts, looked ready for almost
anything, more than a few seemed squeamish about the prospect of
having to handle a gooey ball of precious life and the awkward
intimacy of the birthing situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather go into a bank during a holdup than deliver a
baby,'' said Luis Ortiz, 30, who seemed to be growing thumbs as he
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the training, of course, is to make the recruits
feel more capable, and after an hour of talking about fontanel
safety (watching out for the soft spots) and the mechanics of
muscle contraction, many said they felt better equipped. ``I have
sat in on two childbirths,'' said Yu Zee, a father of two, ``and I
was never told about how to raise the hips and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's training regimen is not universally praised.
Critics say there is too little follow-up after the academy to keep
aging officers up-to-date. But few question whether the academy
portion of the training has improved over the years. The academy
semester runs seven months now, instead of six, with one month
spent in field training. Recruits say three hours of homework a
night is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using more technology now,'' said Capt. Vincent Gaudio,
commander of recruit training, ``and we are using more role
playing, so that they get to use the skills they learn so it is not
just paper examinations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the baby delivery class, there were a few giggles and a
general widening of the eyes during the most graphic portions of
the birthing film. But overall the recruits remained dead serious
as the instructors outlined the medical hazards that childbirth can
present for the mother, the baby and even the officer, through the
risk of infection.
</P>
<P>
   DeBellis told the class about the very cold night in February
1994 when she was patrolling West 38th Street near the end of her
tour and heard a man yelling, ``Hey, over here!'' Down the street,
a woman was about to give birth on the sidewalk. ``You have to make
do with what you've got,'' DeBellis said. In her case, a primary
concern was protecting the newborn, who was losing heat rapidly,
from the frigid temperatures. ``So what did I do? I said to the
guy, `Hey, give me your jacket,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers who have delivered babies say the mother of invention
often arrives with the child. Token booths become birthing rooms.
Newspapers, which have smudged many a tan raincoat, become unlikely
sheets to spread beneath the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are sterilized as they go through the presses,'' said
Arthur Runnions, a retired officer who delivered two babies and
used to be a member of the Stork Club, a group formed by officers
who had delivered babies in the subway. Runnions, who used to wear
a little stork pin on his uniform, delivered his first baby on duty
in Grand Central Terminal as the evening rush hour began.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started undressing,'' Runnions recalled, ``and I said,
`Whoa. Let's wait for the ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the baby had no patience, and so Runnions and his partner,
Officer Tony Romano, had to get busy. When the woman's water broke
a few minutes later, it ruined Romano's new tie, Runnions
remembered. Everything else came out fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do a lot of crazy stuff on the job,'' Runnions said. ``See
a lot of bad stuff. But things like that really make it all
worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the recruits have heard this sort of heartfelt
testimonial before and know it will only go so far toward settling
their stomachs when labor begins. In fact, Ortiz, who prefers bank
robberies to baby deliveries, confessed that a few years ago while
working for a sheriff's department in Georgia he went on three
``baby runs,'' although he never had to perform the delivery. In
each case, he said, his reaction upon arrival had been the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like, Wow, I can't wait for that ambulance to get
here,'' he said.

TCU LINE PLOWED PATH FOR TOMLINSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ There will be one name listed in NCAA record
books as the Division I-A leading rusher for 1999. This is about
the names that made that historic entry possible.
</P>
<P>
   TCU junior running back LaDainian Tomlinson, with 1,850 yards
and 168.2 yards per game, is the unofficial I-A rushing champion
(to pass Tomlinson, Utah State's Demario Brown needs 474 yards
today against North Texas). Tomlinson's offensive linemen, though,
won't be listed for posterity anywhere but in the back of the TCU
media guide in the ``lettermen'' section.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he started piling up these yards, we wanted to get (the
rushing title) for him,'' said David Bobo, a 6-5, 291-pound junior
tackle. ``We knew he just needed 100 yards. Fifteen, 20 years from
now, I can show my family his name, that he's at the top of the
list. I can tell them I played with him, I was there, he's my
running back. He's there, he did it. And we we're a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tackles Bobo and Michael Keathley, guards Victor Paye and Jeff
Millican, center Jeff Garner and reserves Jamal Powell and Shane
Ladewig are the shadow blockers. A week ago, they plowed the way
for Tomlinson's single-game record of 406 yards. Friday against
SMU, they helped Tomlinson accomplish what the Swinks, the Berrys,
the O'Briens and the Davises never could.
</P>
<P>
   TCU has never had a rushing champion; Tomlinson is just the
sixth Frog to gain at least 1,000 yards in a season. And TCU is
bucking the national trend. Rushing statistics have steadily
declined. The pass, spread formations, the shotgun and 50 passes a
game are in. The Wishbone, the Veer, three-yards-and-cloud of dust
are passe.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wacker used to preach Smash Mouth Football, but it was never
like this. TCU's starting offensive line averages nearly 295 pounds
per man. That's approaching Wisconsin's gargantuan standards. For
the Frogs, size and strength equals dominance. In their past two
games, TCU has put away victories with a ground-pounding offense
that has reduced UT-El Paso and SMU to dust.
</P>
<P>
   For the Frogs' linemen, the winning lottery numbers in each game
come when the opposing defensive linemen take on that
deer-in-the-semi's-headlights look.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we come alive,'' Garner said with a chuckle. ``We
know we've got 'em down, and we really try to pour it on.''
</P>
<P>
   After home games, TCU's players meet the media in the team's
weight room. That was an appropriate setting for quizzing the
offensive linemen. Last summer, their grunts and groans, their
sweat and the tons of iron they pushed around turned into
Tomlinson's records, a 7-4 record, a share of the Western Athletic
Conference title and a bowl trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a credit to their work in the off-season. They've put
themselves in a position physically to make this happen,'' said TCU
offensive line coach Jim Bob Helduser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team we inherited had to get stronger and bigger,'' said
TCU coach Dennis Franchione, whose team has won six of its past
seven games. ``Last year, we had a few strong players, but we
didn't have a strong team. We're a much stronger team now. We've
been able to be the physical team in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione is starting to campaign for Tomlinson, calling him
one of the nation's best running backs. No debate on that point.
But Tomlinson is doing some savvy public relations work of his own.
Not an interview goes by where Tomlinson fails to give credit to
his Big Uglies.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the O-line, we're the men in the trenches; nobody really
gives us our props,'' said Payne, a 6-1, 294-pound sophomore.
``When he praises us, that's great for us. We play as a whole;
we're not individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tommerdahl, TCU's special teams/tight ends coach, has a
favorite saying: ``Blood in the water.'' The Frogs' offensive
linemen have taken that as their mantra, their touchstone, their
inner strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fourth quarter, when we're rollin', we just chant
`blood in the water,' '' Payne said. ``We just go out like sharks.
We take over and dominate. By that time, hopefully we have the
other team whipped.''
</P>
<P>
   In two seasons, TCU's offensive line has gone from being guppies
to being Great Whites. Cue the theme from ``Jaws''.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If anyone can upstage TCU's record-setting
running back LaDainian Tomlinson, it's LaDainian Tomlinson.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after smashing the major college single-game
rushing record with 406 yards, Tomlinson nailed down the Division
I-A rushing title in Friday afternoon's 21-0 shutout of rival SMU
at Amon Carter Stadium. The victory also gave the Horned Frogs
their first Western Athletic Conference championship _ they're
sharing it with Fresno State and Hawaii _ and a 7-4 record heading
into the Mobile Alabama Bowl against East Carolina Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson gained 125 yards on 32 carries to finish the regular
season with a school-record 1,850 yards and become the first Horned
Frog running back to win the national rushing crown. Wisconsin's
Ron Dayne, the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy, finished second
with 1,834 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson's heroics had Frogs' fans, for the second consecutive
week, staying long after the final gun chanting ``L. T., L. T. ''
and bask in another historic day of TCU football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two weeks have been unbelievable for this whole
team,'' Tomlinson said. ``It's brought a lot of attention to TCU
and a lot of people around the nation know we're doing something
special in Forth Worth. Hopefully there'll be more of these days to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Needing 110 yards to win the rushing crown, Tomlinson started
slow. SMU held him to 37 yards on 14 first-half carries. He got to
110 yards with a three-yard run early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson's two third-quarter touchdowns secured the victory. In
the process, he set a school record with 32 career touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Dennis Franchione, the architect of a turnaround
that's produced consecutive bowl teams for the first time in 40
years at TCU, couldn't help but get choked up afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do,'' Franchione said when asked to put into
words his thoughts on Friday's events. ``When we came here two
years ago, we inherited a 1-10 team and to be conference
co-champions and going to our second consecutive bowl game, that'll
take a little time for that to soak in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get so focused on preparing your team to win a single
game, that this is pretty sweet. I'm very happy and proud for our
kids. You had to be here in January two years ago to fully
appreciate what the self-esteem was when we started and how far
it's come to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson was obviously proud of his accomplishment, but in
typical fashion, he passed on credit to teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione, however, didn't mince words about Tomlinson's place
among the nation's elite college football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the rushing title and do what he did last Saturday, he
deserves to be mentioned with the best backs in the nation,''
Franchione said. ``There's no doubt about that. And he deserves to
be considered for any award that is available for a running back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson, who had about 30 friends and family members at the
game, is a finalist for the Doak Walker Award, given each year to
the country's top running back. He figures to be one of the leading
contenders for the Heisman Trophy next season. The junior from Waco
promised after the game he would return for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy for the university,'' Tomlinson said. ``They
say there's a first time for everything, so now is the time for TCU
to have a rushing leader.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 27:
</P>
<P>
   The federal court decision that struck down raced-based
admissions at the University of Texas in 1996 was promptly decried
as a barrier that would not only exclude black and Hispanic
students from university life but also diminish their professional
prospects and their role in the next generation of Texas state
leadership. But three years after affirmative action was decreed
dead, the flagship university at Austin is admitting as many
minority students as it did under affirmative action _ thanks to a
state law guaranteeing college admission to all students who
graduate in the top 10 percent of any public high school.
</P>
<P>
   The new law has also opened the door to rural whites for whom
the Austin campus was once an impossible dream. At the same time,
however, the influx of ambitious but underprepared students has
increased demand for tutorial help and review classes for incoming
freshmen. But tutorials are just a stopgap. The only lasting
solution to the preparation gap, officials have concluded, is to
ensure all public school students in the state a kindergarten
through 12th grade education that prepares them for college.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Hispanic enrollment at the Austin campus dropped after
affirmative action was ended in 1996. But the numbers began to rise
again in 1998, when the university began to admit the top 10
percent of the state's high school students without regard to their
scores on standardized admission tests. The 1999 figures show black
enrollment at 4.1 percent _ identical to what it was under
affirmative action _ and Hispanic enrollment at 13.8 percent, just
under the affirmative action mark of 14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new admission rules have dramatically increased overall
enrollment and broadened access. But the rule has also captured
first-generation college students from schools in isolated areas
that lack the course offerings and instructional heft found in the
affluent suburbs around Houston and Dallas. These rural students
are encountering material for the first time that their more
affluent classmates have already seen in high school.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for the preparation gap, the university is
instituting smaller classes as well as a mentoring system.
University administrators who once thought themselves above the
public education debate have realized that, to a great extent, the
fates of the public schools and the universities are closely
intertwined. This realization has helped organize administrators
behind a school reform effort that has already made a good bit of
headway in Texas, though not enough to erase the inequalities that
the 10 percent rule has now exposed.
</P>
<P>
   California and Florida could learn something from the Texas
experience. Both have also abolished affirmative action in their
public universities, and both have adopted procedures under which
top students are automatically admitted. California has adopted a 4
percent rule, but fears going any higher because so many public
schools lack the course offerings to prepare students for the elite
state schools. Florida announced a 20 percent rule earlier this
month, but was shocked to find that the vast majority of minority
students covered by the rule were graduating from high school
without enough credits and, whatever their grades, would be
excluded from college for that reason.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is working at capacity to keep up with demands placed on
it by the 10 percenters. But state officials can take comfort in
the fact that the situation would be far worse without a reform
effort that has at least made a dent in the inequality problem at
the secondary school level. Texas still has a great deal to do. But
so do other states like Florida and California, where the gaps are
great and the reform effort has yet to begin in earnest.

MAN CHARGED WITH MURDER IN DEATH OF 3-YEAR-OLD CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 STACY DOWNS and MARK WIEBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 27-year-old Kansas
City, Kan., man was charged Friday with first-degree murder in the
death of his girlfriend's 3-year-old son, Luke A. Taylor.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rodney Woods also was charged with two counts of child abuse. An
autopsy determined that Luke died of blunt trauma to his head and
body.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' sister, Ra-Shaun Woods, found Luke's body Thursday
morning in the white, two-bedroom bungalow where she, her brother
and their family live in northeast Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Ra-Shaun Woods, 17, said she returned from a date about 12:30
a.m., walked into her room and found Luke lying on a mattress. He
seemed to be looking at the ceiling, she said. ``I moved him and he
didn't move,'' she said Friday afternoon as she sat on a mattress
in the front room of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Terra Morehead, an assistant Wyandotte County, Kan., district
attorney, said Rodney Woods was charged with ``cruelly beating or
inflicting cruel and inhuman corporal punishment by striking the
head, chest, stomach, back and buttocks'' of Luke between Oct. 1
and Nov. 24. Morehead said Luke's body, which weighed between 25
and 30 pounds, suffered dozens of injuries, including a lacerated
liver.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Woods, who weighs 230 pounds and is 6 feet 3 inches tall,
also was charged with abusing Luke's 5-year-old sister. Morehead
said police took action to ensure the safety of the sister and an
infant sibling. Woods had been dating the children's mother,
Qurmaque Houston, 23, of Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was being held on $250,000 bond at the Wyandotte County
Jail. His first appearance is scheduled Monday in Wyandotte County
District Court. A murder conviction carries a life sentence in
prison with the possibility of parole in 15 years. The maximum
penalty for each count of child abuse is 11 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ra-Shaun Woods said she had baby-sat Luke often in the last
several months, since her brother and Houston started seeing each
other. Her contact with Luke increased when Rodney and Houston
moved into the house about two to three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Luke) was quiet,'' she said. ``Didn't like to eat that much.
He loved to play with my nephew (Rodney's son). They'd wrestle a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Dixon lives across the street from Woods' house, amid
several condemned houses on a dead-end street in the 2700 block of
North Seventh Street. He rents the house to Woods' mother, Rita
Johnson. She moved into the house about three months ago with her
younger son, her boyfriend and Ra-Shaun Woods after the family's
previous home was damaged in a fire, Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Dixon said, 11 persons were living in the house he
rented, but several moved out after he told the family the house
was too small for that many residents.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not noticed anything unusual at the home when he
helped the family hook up a stove Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just normally quiet people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's really hard to know people like that when they hardly
come out of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Morehead said she did not recall any first-degree murder cases
stemming from child abuse in recent years in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of any cases (similar to) Luke's,'' she said.

SHOPPERS, EXPERTS LAMENT LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Recipe for holiday
shopping trauma: Start with scarce parking spots and packed stores.
Throw in barely-trained temporary workers. Next, add crashing cash
registers and, last, throw in a crush of pressured shoppers. Stir
vigorously and stand back.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brace yourself, O brave holiday shoppers. The true test of your
devotion to Christmastime consumerism dawned Friday: Dealing with
the strained state of retail customer service, here, there and
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, people lament the decline of effective customer
service, defined by the experts as retailers having what you want,
when you want it, where you want it, delivered _ and this is key _
in a pleasingly professional manner, all at a reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
   Is customer service really waning?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, most definitely,'' said Wendy Liebmann, president of
WSL Strategic Retail. ``The tremendous shortage of good labor has
certainly exacerbated the situation, but even before the labor
shortage, this was a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   When the United States went into a recession that stretched from
the late 1980s through the early 1990s, merchants responded to the
changing retail equation by taking money out of service so they
could offer lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Once the recession waned, retailers tried to nudge prices up,
but consumers would have none of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wouldn't give up price, recession or not,'' Liebmann
said. ``Meanwhile, retailers seem to be taking a long time to build
back the service element, the human element, of their businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the challenge even greater is the ever-tightening
employment situation. Since the 1992 peak of the recession,
unemployment nationally dropped from 7.5 percent to 4.1 percent _
and retail sales went up by more than one-third. Excuse me?
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone has a tale of terrible customer service _ from
fouled-up airline flights and endless waits on the telephone for
computer ``support,'' to mixed-up food orders and costly car
repairs that do not fix the problem. The retail-related
frustrations come into sharp focus at holiday shopping time.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that floor help and sales clerks are on the front
lines of retailing. But, really, they are almost last in line as a
point of contact in a shopping experience.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone has done a good job up to the time when a customer
is ready to pick something out _ or check out _ the customer and
the clerk could exchange pleasantries about family, holidays and
happiness while the transaction is concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, by the time someone is ready to actually make a
purchase, the customer has endured perhaps some level of road rage,
parking lot looniness, crowded corridors, hard-to-squeeze-through
aisles, missing price tags and out-of-stock shelves.
</P>
<P>
   By then they are almost out of their minds. And unfortunately,
how the clerk on the floor or behind the register responds is how
the customer remembers the experience.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of blaming the clerk for everything, think about all
the people leading up to that moment.
</P>
<P>
   It begins at the top. The men and women in the wood-paneled
offices are the ones who set the tone for all the elements that
make for a successful customer service equation.
</P>
<P>
   Do the top executives understand their business? Do they know
their customer? Do they understand their customer? Do they have the
systems in place to train their employees? Do they order the goods
in the right quantities to be delivered in the right place at the
right time and at a competitive price?
</P>
<P>
   If so, the person standing on the other side of the cash
register would have a cushy job. But that seldom happens.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many employers have set their service providers up for
failure, for an excuse to be rude, by not having the systems in
place to make for a rewarding, fulfilling shopping experience.
Rudeness, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, no matter how well-prepared a store is otherwise,
there are brusque salespeople to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers, however, have come to expect as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hear is, `I've just sort of given up,' '' Liebmann
said. ``They say, `My expectation is really low, so if I get great
customer service, I'm just thrilled.' It's the icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Davidson of Overland Park recently was waiting for his
wife on a bench outside Victoria's Secret at Crown Center. Davidson
said that he did not like to complain, but that he sometimes found
himself biting his tongue in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``And sometimes I don't do that too well,'' Davidson said. ``But
sometimes these (people) drive me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that so many retailers, in an employment
crunch, hire people who simply know how to run the cash register.
Instead, experts said, retailers should hire happy, pleasant people
and then train them to use the cash register and other systems, not
the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Berry, director of the Center for Retailing Studies at
Texas A&AMP;M University and author of the recently published
Discovering the Soul of Service, said another part of the problem
was just a general lack of good manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't seem that teaching good manners, whether in
the home, school or elsewhere, is as important as it once was,''
Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other retail experts say part of the reason is the
``instantness'' of our society. E-mail, Internet, cell phones,
pagers, fax machines _ all these devices have added a sense of
impatience and urgency to people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to the point that people can barely contain themselves
waiting five minutes for a fax,'' said Jeffrey Gitomer, a customer
service lecturer.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Fromm, co-author of The Real Heroes of Business and Not a
CEO Among Them, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not civil,'' Fromm said. ``Our society is changing;
it's less personal. We know fewer of our neighbors, human
interaction is on the decline, which all leads to strained
relations when people are put face-to-face.''
</P>
<P>
   Gitomer said another factor in the bad-customer-service blame
game was the way Americans viewed such jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents told us to grow up and be doctors and lawyers, not
sales clerks,'' Gitomer said. ``What a lot of young people and kids
today don't understand is that this job will lead them to a career
if they want to master it, or it will lead to the next crummy job
if they leave for 25 cents an hour more.''

CROWDS MOB MALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Suzie St. John  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A collective groan traveled through the 300-plus people lined up
outside Kay Bee Toys in the Glendale Galleria early Friday morning.
District sales manager Jim Chandler had just announced there were
only 63 Pocket Game Boys left in stock.
</P>
<P>
   It was a groan heard _ and repeated _ across the region.
Thousands of people waited for hours with some arriving as early as
4 a.m. outside dozens of stores to snag ``door buster'' bargains
and freebies. Most of the big lines were for Pokemon-related
promotions, but there were other giveaways and sales that drew
early crowds as well.
</P>
<P>
   Many more thousands braved the region's malls and shopping
centers at more reasonable hours of the day _ say, 8 or 9 a.m. _ to
kick off what is unofficially known as the first official day of
the holiday shopping season and one of the busiest shopping days of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds at the Valencia Town Center gathered hours before the
doors opened, sitting in lawn chairs, wrapping themselves in
blankets and merrily exchanging shopping tips with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never gotten up this early,'' said Don Billow of Saugus,
who seemed to have surprised even himself. ``I think the last time
I got up this early was to get in line for the original `Stars
Wars.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Sanchez arrived at the Glendale Galleria at 5 a.m. to cash
in on the savings. By the time she left, she had accumulated 15
bags stuffed with toys ranging from talking Barneys to ``Toy Story
2'' dolls to all things Pokemon. It was the first time the Los
Angeles resident had braved the malls on the day after Thanksgiving
and she wasn't sure how many trips it was going to take to get all
of her purchases home.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 that Sanchez spent in toys is indicative of current
spending trends, according to Brent Schoenbaum, senior manager at
Deloitte and Touche LLP.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very confident about their jobs, the unemployment
rate is low and we have a very positive economy right now,''
Schoenbaum said while surveying the hordes at the Galleria. ``We've
had an overall economy growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Beulke woke up at the bleary hour of 3:30 a.m. By 5 a.m.,
Beulke, a mechanic and antique store owner, was at a Kay Bee Toy
Store at Tampa and Victory boulevards in Northridge to check out
some Hot Wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was on to Toys `R' Us where he bought 15 Johnny Lighting
toy cars, which made the early-morning mission a success. The
popular cars typically sell for $40 but were on sale for $14.95, so
Beulke saved $375 on his shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later at the Northridge Fashion Center Sears, the
Chatsworth resident's luck ran out. The mall was jammed, with long
lines at some cash registers and the parking lots near Nordhoff
Street nearly full.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I came came here for were tools. They had a 50 percent-off
sale and everything I wanted was gone,'' he said before heading to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Eisen finished her holiday shopping early, but she was at
Westfield Shoppingtown Topanga Plaza anyway on Friday, taking
daughter Hannah to see Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   After a helpful hint from Mom, Santa's helper ordered
3{-year-old Hannah not to smile. She responded with a huge grin,
and the camera captured it.
</P>
<P>
   Eisen said she planned just to shop around for little things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like to go around and get in the spirit of things,''
she said. ``I'm shopping, baby. I'm going to shop 'till I drop _
actually, I'll probably shop 'till she drops.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Ventura, general manager of La Curacao in the Panorama
Mall, said that with the good economy he expects a very profitable
holiday shopping season, with toys and computers doing the majority
of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expecting 2,500 to 3,000 people to shop at our store
today,'' Ventura said early Friday. That number is expected to
increase to around 4,400 shoppers a day within the next couple of
weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby at the Sports Town store, a number of post-Thanksgiving
shoppers were buying everything from Lakers jerseys to San
Francisco 49ers hats to Nike shoes to fill their Christmas lists.
</P>
<P>
   At the two-story Wal-Mart that anchors the Panorama Mall, people
were waiting in check-out lines for 15 minutes or longer to buy
toys, clothes and wrapping paper. To handle the large crowds,
manager Jennifer Antolin said the store will be open for 17 hours a
day for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherman Oaks Fashion Square was bustling but not
uncomfortable in the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was quiet enough at the upscale mall for Ken Green
of Encino to relax in a stuffed chair and read a morning newspaper
at around 10 a.m., after two hours of shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who manned the first shift of his family's three-shift
shopping day, said he walked into Fashion Square at around 7:45
a.m., when only the mall's Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores were
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place was like a bowling alley,'' he said. ``It was
empty.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 10:30 a.m., as more shoppers streamed in, traffic began
to grow at the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely picks up in the afternoon,'' said mall marketing
director Shana Yao. ``Typically, in this area the shoppers don't
show up too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Friday's crowds at malls across the Southland were
plentiful, that doesn't necessarily translate into higher sales for
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the day after Thanksgiving was both a high-traffic
and high-sales day, Schoenbaum said. But that trend stopped five to
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoppers today feel like if they find something, great, but if
not they still have plenty of time. The highest spending is usually
done the last weekend before Christmas.''

 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Liebmann, who
recently returned from a six-week retailing tour through Western
Europe and Japan, agrees with Gitomer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The retailers who were with me were astounded at the level of
service, particularly in Japan,'' Liebmann said. ``But even in
Western Europe it was clear the difference between service here and
service there _ to them, there is still a real pride in working in
retail.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally there are customers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Customers have a responsibility to treat sales clerks with
dignity and respect. More often than not, if they do, they will get
it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become pretty rude ourselves,'' Liebmann said. ``Think
about that as you're dealing with shopping rage.''
</P>
<P>
   About a half-dozen retail workers contacted for this story
declined to talk about customers, particularly irate ones. Sean
Hill, a cashier team leader at the Target in Kansas City, North,
said he always tried his hardest to help people out, even those who
raised their voices in threatening tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always those, no matter what, who insist on talking
to a manager,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   As a team manager, Hill said he would spot a stressed-out
cashier and often suggest a 10-minute break to cool down. He agreed
that some people were better cut out to work in retailing than
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, that's true. We have some people who work here, who
fortunately work in the back, who just can't seem to handle the
pressure,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the level of frustration on both sides of the
retail transaction, at least a half-dozen Web sites give both
employees and customers a means to vent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both Fromm and Gitomer said the sad reality was that
many retailers did not realize what a golden opportunity this time
of year presented. Many of them think only in terms of ``what were
our sales today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But now is the time when shoppers will visit a store for the
first time, and they'll either go home with stories of good cheer
or bah humbug,'' Gitomer said. ``Retailers should be gathering as
many nuts as they can now, so they'll have something to feast on
later.''

WORLDWIDE SPORTS TO BUY BOLLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Worldwide Sports &AMP;
Recreation in Overland Park has agreed to buy Bolle Inc., which
makes and sells premium sunglasses, ski goggles and safety eyewear.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The purchase comes less than three months after Worldwide
executives said they planned to buy other companies to supplement
their Bushnell and Bausch &AMP; Lomb binoculars and telescopes, and
Voit brand of sports equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Bolle fits perfectly with our business,'' said Joe
Messner, president and chief executive of Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The tender offer for Bolle's stock is $5.25 a share in cash. In
addition, Worldwide would assume Bolle debt to make the total deal
worth $85 million. The deal is expected to close in January.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Franklin, Bolle's chairman, said Friday that the offer
brought substantial value to shareholders and would enable the
company to continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Bolle, which is based in Denver and has facilities worldwide,
was founded 100 years ago. It is known for its premium sunglasses,
goggles and safety eyewear. It is also the exclusive North American
distributor of the Reusch line of winter gloves for sports.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Worldwide Sports of Tulsa, Okla., bought
Bushnell Sports Optics Worldwide in Overland Park, Kan. The company
has a long history in the Kansas City area, back to 1948 with the
founding of the Jason Empire company, which Bushnell acquired in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell continued to maintain operations under its new owners.
Wind Point Partners, a private investment firm, in August bought
Worldwide Sports _ which at that time had annual sales of more than
$150 million and made Overland Park its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Wind Point said there would be cash for additional
acquisition. Messner, Worldwide's chief executive, said Friday that
Worldwide continued to look for other purchases.
</P>
<P>
   He said Worldwide would have a record year for sales and
earnings in 1999. Bolle would give it further growth, including
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of Bolle is very exciting,'' Messner said.

EFFECT OF MOVIE IS OVERBLOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and DAVID HAYES   
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo. _ It got clobbered by
reviewers and it got clobbered in the ratings.
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to the folks at Nielsen Media Research, NBC's ``Y2K:
The Movie'' came in a lackluster 27th for the ratings period ending
Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   About 10.5 million households watched the Sunday night
made-for-TV disaster movie. That compares with the 13.8 million
that tuned in at the same time to CBS's Hallmark presentation of
``Sarah: Plain and Tall,'' which came in ninth.
</P>
<P>
   It seems viewers prefer a warm-and-fuzzy drama on the prairie to
a techno thriller.
</P>
<P>
   And like all the other Y2K ``doom dates'' before it _ Jan. 1,
Sept. 9, the August GPS rollover _ the potential for movie-induced
panic has turned out to be much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Of 300 calls to the White House's Y2K hotline after the movie
aired, only three came from viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't appear there are a lot of people out there who seem
to be convinced the movie is the reality,'' said Jack Gribben, a
spokesman with the President's Year 2000 Conversion Council. All
along, the White House has said it believes the American people can
separate fact from fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   But before the movie aired, others across the country braced for
a Y2K panic reaction.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, a state agency bought air time during a break
in the movie to calm viewers' concerns. Some local NBC affiliates
set up telephone banks to answer viewers' questions during the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, KUSA-TV set up a phone line for viewers and assembled
a panel of 15 experts to answer them. In Columbus, Ohio, the local
Y2K Council ran a call line at WCMH-TV.
</P>
<P>
   And in Kansas City, the Mid-America Regional Council asked for
and received a Y2K preparedness spot on KSHB-TV's 10 p.m. news
following the two-hour movie.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, troubleshooter Nick Cromwell races the clock to
save a Seattle nuclear power plant from a Y2K meltdown by using
enough duct tape and pyrotechnics to blast open the reactor core
cooling valves at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, there is no federal Y2K lone ranger who can fire
a technological silver bullet and save the day, said the White
House's Gribben, who would have preferred to watch ESPN that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a supersonic jet and a particular gentleman
prepared to fly across the country taking care of difficult
scenarios,'' he said. ``And there is no sophisticated button we can
push to see if the power grid has held.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were just some of the many flaws that prompted our
assembled panel of movie critics to write off ``Y2K'' as
``Must-Not-See-TV.'' Here's what they had to say:
</P>
<P>
   - Peter de Jager, the Canadian computer expert who first raised
the Y2K alarm, said the movie pandered to stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any good coming out of it,'' he said. ``If it had
been done better it could have had an impact on the general
population,'' he said. ``Shots of global supply disruptions or
manufacturing plant problems could have been more realistic.'' But
probably not good TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be gracious and give it a C-plus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   - New York economist Ed Yardeni, a movie buff who still predicts
a 70 percent chance of Y2K triggering a recession, called the movie
``thin stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any credible researcher who has said planes would
fall out of the sky or who worries too much about the lights going
out,'' he said. Halfway through the movie, Yardeni tuned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They actually picked on the issues that got the most hype two
years ago that nobody is concerned about anymore,'' Yardeni said.
``In the universe of disaster movies it's not quite an F, but a
D-minus.''
</P>
<P>
   - Dean Katerndahl of the Mid-America Regional Council watched
the movie with his son. Katerndahl, who has a degree in nuclear
engineering, found the movie's reactor scene implausible.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thought to manually open valves until 10 minutes before
meltdown? The tank of water thinks it's 1900 so it thinks it's
empty? Please,'' he scoffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself explaining to my son why each thing wouldn't
happen that way. But I wonder who was explaining to all of the
people who watched it without any other knowledge?''
</P>
<P>
   - The movie goes beyond bad, says Steve Hewitt of Raytown,
editor of Christian Computing magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie was irresponsible, blatant commercialism and an
attempt to profit from the fears of others,'' said Hewitt, who has
spent the past year telling fellow evangelicals to mellow out on
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only be thankful that the same people running NBC today
were not around in the past. Otherwise, we might have had a
`fictional' movie showing the Japanese occupation of our nation a
few months after Pearl Harbor, or a wonderful entertaining flick
about nuclear attacks during the Cuban missile crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   - Reader Gene Bettinger of Kansas City, Kan., was just curious
about how a movie with so many holes ever made it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's Duh TV.
</P>
<P>
   At least one company was profiting from Y2K panic.
</P>
<P>
   Y2kmart, a Dexter, Maine-based purveyor of gas masks, dehydrated
food and other millennium supplies, said its sales tripled in the
days after NBC began broadcasting promotional spots for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are saying, `I want to get my order in before
it gets real busy,'+'' said company president Mark Miclette.
</P>
<P>
   One of the federal government's biggest Y2K critics says the
government has made a lot of progress getting ready for the
computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few problem areas remain in the federal government's
efforts to get ready for Jan. 1, U.S. Rep. Stephen Horn said this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Horn, a California Republican who has been grading the
government on its Y2K progress since 1996, gave the government an
overall B-plus in his last Y2K report card. He said there are still
concerns about foreign airports, food stamp programs and a handful
of federal agencies _ including air traffic control systems and the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Of 24 major federal agencies he has been studying, 12 have
completed preparations and eight have fixed their computers but
still lack testing, Horn said. Four departments _ Defense, Health
and Human Services, Justice and Treasury _ still need to convert
some crucial systems.
</P>
<P>
   Horn's report also found that there are concerns about 18 of 43
federal programs important to Americans. Among those are child
nutrition, food safety inspection, food stamps, low-income energy
assistance, Medicaid and public housing.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Willemssen, the chief Y2K expert for the General Accounting
Office, said the Federal Aviation Administration is still testing
some air traffic control integration systems. He also said U.S.
experts are not certain about Y2K preparations of some foreign
governments, but that safety is not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Paul Takemo said all aviation systems, including
air traffic control, have been fixed and tested. ``Frankly, we are
ready,'' Takemo said.
</P>
<P>
   Horn said he was impressed with the government's efforts
overall, and said his study shows that it will be safe to fly Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come a long way since we began examining this enormous
technological challenge four years ago,'' he said.

READERS, NOW IT'S YOUR TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo. _ If this is a long
holiday weekend, it must be time to let the readers do the writing.
First up is a Kansas City investment adviser with some timely words
of wisdom:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Enjoyed your (column) on Microsoft's plight. There is no
better example of why Social Security should NOT invest in stocks.
Aside from the fact there is no $ in the Social Security kitty, can
you imagine the scenario of a federal judge, (Federal Reserve
Chairman) Alan Greenspan and the president all involved in the
outcome of the largest cap stock? (It) would be a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Astute: Amen. It would be more than a mess. It would be a
markets-destroying mess as whimsical abuse of government power
undermined investor confidence in U.S. financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of bad ideas, another reader inquired about a better
way to reform the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of discussion about implementing a
national sales or value-added tax. Why would implementing one of
these taxes be better than simply raising the corporate income tax
levels?''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Wondering: Assuming you're talking about making business
the sole national tax collector, this wouldn't solve the basic
problem. It would only lead to more of the mischief that made the
tax code a disgrace to the human race. The power struggle to win
favors and avoid punitive tax measures would continue and the game
of using legislative initiatives to promote campaign contributions
would escalate. Meantime, corporations wouldn't pay more taxes than
they do now, which is zero. Only people can pay taxes, and all
corporate taxes are simply passed on to those doing business with
the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're about to celebrate the season of good will toward
men, here's a voice of altruism from the small-business community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take exception to your (criticism) of the (proposal to
raise) the minimum wage. I have a small business and am willing to
pay what it takes to get a qualified person. I prefer not to use
the option of paying the minimum wage just because I can. ... I
don't understand why you would want to have a bigger gap between
those who have and those who don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Charitable: Fine. Pay your help as much as you want. That
is your prerogative. My objection has always been government
pricing some marginal workers out of the job market by arbitrarily
assigning an excessively inflated value to their work output. If
altruistic employers want to pay their help more than their work is
worth, that is their business. Power to them. Government, on the
other hand, shouldn't force private enterprise to overpay
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Last but not least, an objection to a national sales tax as the
centerpiece of reform:
</P>
<P>
   ``It will generate a huge black market. Then what? Hire more
cops? Jail more citizens? Raise the tax rate? I prefer the flat
tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Flat-Taxer: Certainly there would be problems with a
national sales tax, but it's not as though the current tax system
is perfect. Anticipating a huge black market assumes most Americans
are dishonest. They're not, as the success of the income tax system
testifies. For what it's worth, my favorite is the flat-rate income
tax, too.
</P>
<P>
   Keep them cards and letters comin', hear?

THANKSGIVING STUFFS THE NATION'S MOVIE THEATERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Dave McNary  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moviegoers mobbed multiplexes over the first two days of the
Thanksgiving holiday, with ``Toy Story 2'' attracting an
overwhelming $23 million in gross receipts at 3,235 theaters during
the Wednesday-Thursday period, studio sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The sequel's impressive performance, well above forecasts,
should drive the overall five-day holiday box office well past last
year's $182.3 million record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' topped the combine total of the next two biggest
draws _ $11.2 million for Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``End of Days''
and $10.7 million for the 20th James Bond movie, ``The World Is Not
Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' finished a close fourth with $8.6 million at
3,064 theaters to give it nearly $45 million in its first seven
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wanted to see these four movies,'' Robert Bucksbaum,
president of the Reel Source tracking service, said Friday, noting
that overall business was up 25 percent over the same two days last
year. ``The weather was perfect both days.''
</P>
<P>
   The top 12 films grossed $34.4 million on Thanksgiving after
taking in $27 million Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With movie going expected to be at its busiest of the year
Friday and today, ``Toy Story 2'' should smash the five-day
Thanksgiving holiday record set last year by ``A Bug's Life'' with
$45.7 million. Bucksbaum predicted the total could hit $60 million
by the end of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has launched ``Toy Story 2,'' co-produced by Pixar
Animation, amid rave reviews and a massive marketing campaign
taking advantage of the residual good will from the unexpected
success of the 1995 original. It marks the fifth consecutive
Thanksgiving box office led by a Disney film, starting with the
$39.1 million for ``Toy Story,'' followed by $45.1 million for
``101 Dalmatians,'' $35.9 million for ``Flubber'' and ``A Bug's
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thanksgiving Day performance also pulled Disney past the $1
billion mark in domestic grosses for 1999, marking the fifth time
in the past six years that the studio has topped the 10-figure
mark. It recently hit the $1 billion figure in 1999 foreign
receipts and leads Hollywood studios in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   The performance by Universal's ``End of Days,'' which opened
Wednesday at 2,592 theaters and backed by a marketing campaign
stressing Schwarzenegger, special effects and action, marks a
potentially solid return for the star to the big screen for the
first time since 1997's somewhat disappointing ``Batman &AMP; Robin.''
Besides Schwarzenegger's marquee power, the apocalyptic thriller
also benefited from the continuing strong market for suspense and
horror films.
</P>
<P>
   The showing by MGM's ``The World Is Not Enough'' indicates it
may have enough staying power to remain a solid draw for the rest
of the year. It's screening at 3,163 sites this weekend, and the
Wednesday-Thursday results pushed it past $50 million in its first
week.
</P>
<P>
   It could wind up the weekend ahead of ``End of Days'' since it
carries a PG-13 rating as opposed to the R designation of its
rival. Both could top the $30 million mark for the five-day period.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's Sleepy Hollow,'' which opened with $30.1 million
last weekend, should also continue to generate strong business and
could finish the five days with well over $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Business for the remaining movies was less impressive, with a
pair of holdovers battling for fifth with $2 million each during
Wednesday and Thursday _ Warner Bros. ``Pokemon: The First Movie''
at 3,043 theaters and Universal's ``The Bone Collector'' at 2,448
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Lion's Gate's ``Dogma'' came in seventh with $1.5 million at
1,292 locations, followed by 20th Century Fox's ``Anywhere But
Here'' with $1.1 million at 1,666 sites, Disney's ``Insider'' with
$875,000 at 1,689 theaters and USA Films' ``Being John Malkovich''
with $645,000 at 589 screens.

WOMAN PROMOTES TEACHING OF CREATIONISM IN KANSAS PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Someone created every
thing in the universe, Celtie Johnson believes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone made the pen she writes with. Someone made the keyboard
she types on. All complex systems are designed by someone, so it
follows that life, the most complex system of all, has a designer,
too, said Johnson, of Prairie Village, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's saying who that intelligent designer is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To Johnson, evolution simply makes no sense. She rejects the
evidence most scientists say supports the theory that all living
things share common ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   She firmly believes in the biblical account of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year she mounted a campaign to turn the Kansas
science community on its ear. Judging from the agitation in the
state over evolution, there is evidence she has succeeded:
</P>
<P>
   - In the beginning, the Kansas Board of Education and the state
education commissioner appointed a 27-member committee of science
teachers and professors to write new science standards for public
schools. The committee's version described the theory of evolution
as a ``unifying concept'' for all science disciplines. It drew
objections from those who do not believe in evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Late last winter, Johnson pulled together a loosely knit group
of creationists from Kansas and Missouri who drafted an alternate
version of the standards. The alternate draft, presented to the
state board, defined both evolution and creation in its glossary.
It also defined the battle that would occupy the state board for
months.
</P>
<P>
   - Johnson visited the Kansas board again and again, urging
members to reject the committee's science standards in favor of her
group's standards.
</P>
<P>
   - She also formed the National Committee for Excellence in
Science Education, which helps people in other states who want to
question evolution. The group intends to offer the alternate
science standards written by Johnson and others to people in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Abrams, a conservative Kansas Board of Education member
from Arkansas City, Kan., presented the alternate standards Johnson
helped write.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very dedicated and wants to see good science in
Kansas,'' said Abrams, a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Val DeFever, a moderate board member from Independence, Kan.,
said Johnson was determined to sway board members to her point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just explained to her we weren't on the same wavelength,''
said DeFever, who supported the standards written by the science
teachers. ``We were both committed to our viewpoints, and it really
would be a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says she wanted scientists to explain why, as she sees
it, evolution is immune from question and why other explanations
for the origins of life cannot be considered in science classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire her dedication,'' said Ken Ham, executive director of
the creationist organization Answers in Genesis, based in Kentucky.
``I admire her trying to do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's critics say that, under the guise of science, she is
trying to inject into the public schools her religious belief that
God created the universe.
</P>
<P>
   John van Keppel of Leawood, Kan., an evolution supporter, says
Johnson does not understand science well enough to dispute the
facts of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against evolution that Johnson and other
creationists say is being censored by mainstream science is a
cut-and-paste job, said Charlotte McDonald, the Blue Valley School
District's science coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not presenting the whole scientific information,''
McDonald said. ``If you're going to take things out of context, you
can refute anything you want to refute.''  &LR; brk:Fliers at malls
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a 43-year-old mother of four, shares her beliefs with
most people she meets. She begins many conversations with creation
naysayers by asking, ``What do you know about evolution to be
true?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 she and her brother asked the Shawnee Mission School
District to use Of Pandas and People, a science textbook that puts
forth intelligent design _ the idea that an intelligent being
created Earth and everything in it. District officials said they
considered the text but rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and her husband began visiting shopping malls on
weekends to place homemade creationist fliers on cars. The fliers
contained passages such as this: ``The theory of evolution is just
a theory, yet our public school's texts do not mention the
significant amount of scientific evidence against it. Why the
censorship?''
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson and her husband, Eric, 37, the truth about how the
universe came to be is readily available and has been for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe the Bible is true,'' said Eric Johnson, a
stockbroker. ``If it's not true, it's just a paperweight.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtie Johnson said she was not completely against evolution
being taught. She said she just wanted teachers to feel comfortable
presenting the pros and cons of Charles Darwin's theory. Many feel
pressured to teach evolution as a fact, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has been told, subtly and not, to sit down and shut up. She
has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident that most humans have common sense, that they
can critically think,'' Johnson said. ``I don't want them to be
plagued with believing evolution, because it's not true.''
 &LR; brk:Macro vs. micro
</P>
<P>
   Some on the 10-member Kansas Board of Education agreed with
Johnson, and in August the board approved science standards that
contained references to microevolution, or adaptation, but no
mention of macroevolution, or change from one species to another.
The revised version no longer lists evolution as one of science's
unifying concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The revised standards also omit many references to the age of
Earth. There is no longer any mention of the big-bang theory _ the
idea that the universe was born in an explosion of matter and
radiation between 12 billion and 20 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those deletions are significant to ``young Earth creationists''
such as Johnson who believe that the Earth was created in six
24-hour days sometime in the last 7,000 years. Creationists say
they have evidence that supports this belief:
</P>
<P>
   - It takes about 300 to 1,000 years to form an inch of topsoil,
but the worldwide average depth is about 7 to 8 inches, which means
the Earth is only a few thousand years old, creationists say.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists respond that that argument does not take erosion
into account.
</P>
<P>
   - The eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 produced 25 feet of
finely layered sediment and gouged canyons in one afternoon, which
shows that millions of years are not required to form rock layers.
This lends credence to the global flood and other catastrophic
events in the Bible, creationists say.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists say erosion happens at variable rates all over the
world. Catastrophes explain some geologic formations but not all.
</P>
<P>
   - Earth's magnetic field has been decaying rapidly, which
creationists say points to an age younger than 10,000 years.

that overall business was up 25 percent over the same two days last
year. ``The weather was perfect both days.''
</P>
<P>
   The top 12 films grossed $34.4 million on Thanksgiving after
taking in $27 million Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With movie going expected to be at its busiest of the year
Friday and today, ``Toy Story 2'' should smash the five-day
Thanksgiving holiday record set last year by ``A Bug's Life'' with
$45.7 million. Bucksbaum predicted the total could hit $60 million
by the end of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has launched ``Toy Story 2,'' co-produced by Pixar
Animation, amid rave reviews and a massive marketing campaign
taking advantage of the residual good will from the unexpected
success of the 1995 original. It marks the fifth consecutive
Thanksgiving box office led by a Disney film, starting with the
$39.1 million for ``Toy Story,'' followed by $45.1 million for
``101 Dalmatians,'' $35.9 million for ``Flubber'' and ``A Bug's
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thanksgiving Day performance also pulled Disney past the $1
billion mark in domestic grosses for 1999, marking the fifth time
in the past six years that the studio has topped the 10-figure
mark. It recently hit the $1 billion figure in 1999 foreign
receipts and leads Hollywood studios in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   The performance by Universal's ``End of Days,'' which opened
Wednesday at 2,592 theaters and backed by a marketing campaign
stressing Schwarzenegger, special effects and action, marks a
potentially solid return for the star to the big screen for the
first time since 1997's somewhat disappointing ``Batman &AMP; Robin.''
Besides Schwarzenegger's marquee power, the apocalyptic thriller
also benefited from the continuing strong market for suspense and
horror films.
</P>
<P>
   The showing by MGM's ``The World Is Not Enough'' indicates it
may have enough staying power to remain a solid draw for the rest
of the year. It's screening at 3,163 sites this weekend, and the
Wednesday-Thursday results pushed it past $50 million in its first
week.
</P>
<P>
   It could wind up the weekend ahead of ``End of Days'' since it
carries a PG-13 rating as opposed to the R designation of its
rival. Both could top the $30 million mark for the five-day period.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's Sleepy Hollow,'' which opened with $30.1 million
last weekend, should also continue to generate strong business and
could finish the five days with well over $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Business for the remaining movies was less impressive, with a
pair of holdovers battling for fifth with $2 million each during
Wednesday and Thursday _ Warner Bros. ``Pokemon: The First Movie''
at 3,043 theaters and Universal's ``The Bone Collector'' at 2,448
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Lion's Gate's ``Dogma'' came in seventh with $1.5 million at
1,292 locations, followed by 20th Century Fox's ``Anywhere But
Here'' with $1.1 million at 1,666 sites, Disney's ``Insider'' with
$875,000 at 1,689 theaters and USA Films' ``Being John Malkovich''
with $645,000 at 589 screens.

LOUIS MENK, RAILROAD EXECUTIVE, DIES AT 81
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Colo., Texas)  (rk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louis Wilson Menk, a railroad entrepreneur who wove three
medium-size companies into the much larger Burlington Northern,
then went to the rescue of a faltering industrial giant,
International Harvester, died Tuesday at his home in Carefree,
Ariz., a suburb of Phoenix. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Englewood, Colo., Menk was the son of a trainman. He
said he could never remember a time in his youth when he ever
wanted to be anything but a railroadman, too.
</P>
<P>
   But first, to help his family financially during the Great
Depression, he delivered The Denver Post, cut lawns, pumped
gasoline and caddied on a golf course. He also became a champion
golfer at Denver High School.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing high school in 1936, he studied at Denver
University for two years, carrying a full schedule of courses while
learning Morse code on the side as a messenger for the Union
Pacific Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year his skill as a telegrapher took him to a
dispatcher's job with the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway.
</P>
<P>
   His work as a dispatcher earned him a promotion to assistant
trainmaster two years later.
</P>
<P>
   By 1950 he was a division superintendent at Fort Smith, Ark.,
and in 1953 he graduated from an advanced management program
offered by Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Menk, a lean, angular figure standing 6 feet 5{ inches tall,
continued his rapid rise at the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad.
He became president in 1962 and added the title of chairman in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   The following year the Chicago, Burlington &AMP; Quincy Railroad
drew him away to take over as president of the Burlington Lines.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after that he played a key role as the industry
reinvented itself by shifting the emphasis from passenger
transportation to hauling freight.
</P>
<P>
   He led the merger of the Great Northern, Northern Pacific and
Burlington railroads into Burlington Northern, of which he served
as president, chairman and chief executive. He retired in 1981 as
chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern later merged with the Atchison, Topeka &AMP;
Santa Fe Railroad to form the present Burlington Northern Santa Fe,
one of North America's largest railroad networks. It stretches
34,000 route miles from the Pacific Northwest and Southern
California to the Midwest and employs nearly 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Its headquarters are on Lou Menk Drive in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, International Harvester, a big maker of trucks and farm
equipment, was on the brink of bankruptcy and bankers and creditors
had lost faith in the company's management. Menk was asked to take
over the company.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 months, he led a reorganization, oversaw cutbacks and
installed a new management team. He served as chairman and chief
executive of the company, now known as Navistar International
Corp., and returned to Carefree in 1983 for his second retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Menk is survived by his wife of 15 years, Mary Louise White
Menk; a son, David of Canon City, Colo.; a daughter, Barbara Menk
of Cancun, Mexico; two stepdaughters, Patti Townsend of Billings,
Mont., and Peggy Irwin of Seattle; two brothers, Donald of Boulder,
Colo., and Robert of Denver; and four grandchildren. His first
wife, Barbara Swan Menk, died in 1983.

WOMAN PROMOTES TEACHING OF CREATIONISM IN KANSAS PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Evolutionists counter
that the decay is not steady and that much evidence exists for
several reversals of the decay rate.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most creationists say that scientific theories must be
observable. Although it is true that monkey blood and human blood
are similar, that is not evidence the two species are related, said
Glen Kailer of Perry, Kan., a researcher with the Creation Science
Association for Mid-America. Creationists view that similarity as
more proof of design, Kailer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Chevy and a Ford are not descended from a common ancestor,''
Kailer said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither evolution nor creation can be tested or has been
observed, but creationists say their theory has a witness: the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists, on the other hand, believe that some science
works in the comparative mode, said Ed Wiley, a University of
Kansas evolutionary biologist. Something that is true for one life
form will be true for another.
</P>
<P>
   One particular point of contention is transitional life forms.
</P>
<P>
   Creationists say that scientists have not found any fossils of
transitional animals and that no transitional animals exist today.
They do not believe that animals such as the archaeopteryx, a bird
with reptile characteristics that some scientists think links birds
and dinosaurs, are transitional.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the archaeopteryx is not a true intermediate form
between birds and reptiles, Wiley said. But it had transitional
characteristics between the two species, such as wings and
reptilian attributes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley said creationists would not ever accept the archaeopteryx
as a transitional animal, because it was too dangerous to their
faith in a God so powerful he could create everything just as it is
today.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, believing that Earth is older than described
in the first chapter of Genesis threatens some creationists'
understanding of the basis of their faith, said Keith Miller, an
evangelical Christian and a geologist at Kansas State University.
</P>
<P>
   Most Christians, Miller said, find no conflict with believing
that God could have used evolution to create the universe. Biblical
literalists cannot accept that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the days in Genesis actually were millions or billions of
years, dinosaurs would have lived and died long before humans. That
would mean death and dying came long before Adam and Eve were cast
out of the Garden of Eden in what Christians know as the Fall of
Man, Miller said. That is in direct conflict with a literal reading
of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They view their interpretation of Scripture as being
primary,'' Miller said. ``They don't accept the validity of
nonbiblical sources of truth. Everything comes through a scriptural
lens.''
</P>
<P>
   For Miller and Wiley, evolution is a fact of nature with many
theories of how it works.
</P>
<P>
   But for people such as Johnson and Ham, evolution is a
philosophical belief system just like creation. Ham said both
groups agreed on observable facts such as natural selection and
mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Those things are ``what we observe in the present,'' Ham said.
``In trying to connect to the past, you have to use faith.''
 &LR; brk:`Days in shock'
</P>
<P>
   Celtie and Eric Johnson think many scientists overlook
evolution's missing details, such as transitional fossils, and
teach the scientific theory as proven fact to unsuspecting science
students.
</P>
<P>
   Celtie Johnson said she spent decades believing that humans
evolved from lower forms and that species could change into other
species over millions of years. A former premedicine major, she
faults a belief in evolution for leading her to make bad decisions
as she struggled through more than one divorce and a life she saw
as purposeless and random.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dog eat dog,'' Johnson said. ``That's what I was living.
It was survival of the fittest.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day about five years ago she was talking to her
brother, a mechanical engineer, and he brought up intelligent
design. Johnson said she did not have a clue as to what he was
talking about. She knew only about evolution. But her brother told
her there was overwhelming evidence against evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Something clicked. Johnson began to research creation. Soon Eric
Johnson joined in. They began to feel more and more duped by their
science classes, Celtie Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent days in shock,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the shock wore off, Johnson said, she decided she had to
spread the word. She joined the Creation Science Association,
seeking more information.
</P>
<P>
   It was Johnson's insistence that the Kansas science standards
were flawed that drew together the band of writers who drafted the
alternate standards, said Kailer, one of the writers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's motivation was good science, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celtie is not at all alone,'' he said. ``Celtie is one of the
thousands who recognize the absurdity of evolution as science.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is one of the few willing to speak out, said Linda
Highland of Olathe, who first met Johnson at a legislative forum
some years back. Highland said the state board made the right
decision in August, and she credited Johnson for helping board
members find the strength to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that maybe she builds courage in others by showing
that she isn't afraid to take this issue on,'' Highland said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said she was motivated by the search for truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is. Maybe some people have the ability to
see the proof,'' she said. ``I think the majority of people believe
in evolution because they don't have the facts.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Christmas season began not on a sour note
exactly, but on a recorded one, when labor negotiations between the
New York City Ballet and the musicians who play in its orchestra
stumbled Friday night just before the curtain went up on the first
holiday performance of ``The Nutcracker.'' The result was that the
strike declared by the musicians on Tuesday continued and `The
Nutcracker' had to be performed to taped music.
</P>
<P>
   The City Ballet has performed the Tchaikovsky classic,
choreographed by George Balanchine, every year at this time since
1954. Friday night's performance was its first ever without live
orchestra accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet fans, many of them little girls and their mothers,
arrived at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, expecting
the annual glitter and dazzle of the occasion. But on the sidewalk
on Columbus Avenue they were greeted by the disappointing news that
they would be listening to a tape. A picket line of some 20
musicians, members of Local 802 of the American Federation of
Musicians, carried signs reading ``Musicians on Strike'' and ``City
Ballet Unfair to Musicians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been pretty exciting that when you're in certain
seats you can see the orchestra play,'' said Julia Agee, an
8-year-old from New Rochelle, who arrived with her mother and
younger sister, wearing a new black velvet dress and patent leather
shoes. ``But the ballet is the most important part. We were
absolutely going to come no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues on the negotiating table include wages and benefits,
but the sticking point, both sides agree, is the tradition of
elective attendance that musicians have enjoyed for decades. It has
long been the case that musicians are free to skip a rehearsal or a
performance, forfeiting their pay, if a substitute is available.
The policy allows musicians, who are under contract for only a
23-week season, to supplement their income with other jobs. The
ballet company says, however, that in recent years, enough
orchestra members have abused the privilege that the continuity of
rehearsal and performance that is necessary to sustain a top flight
orchestra has been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between the union and the ballet company began at
10 a..m. Friday and continued all day, breaking off less than an
hour before the 8 p.m. curtain. A spokesman for the union, Bill
Dennison, said the union had agreed to a final proposal on the part
of the company, that the musicians play through the holiday season
as negotiations continued, but that the ballet company then added
the proviso that if negotiations were not concluded in time, the
musicians would play through the spring as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider ourselves locked out,'' Dennison said. ``What else
can we think when we offer to play and management won't let us?''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ramsey, a spokesman for the City Ballet, said that the
union had declined the company's final offer. He said the company
decided to go ahead with the performance with taped music because
too many people would be disappointed otherwise. He said all other
unions, including those for stagehands and dancers, had allowed
their members to cross the picket line and that everyone but the
orchestra members had reported for work.
</P>
<P>
   There are two performances scheduled for Saturday and two for
Sunday, which will be performed with taped music if there is no
agreement. Negotiations broke off during Friday night's
performance, with no clear schedule for a resumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unhappy situation for us,'' said Ramsey. ``We are
committed to live performance. But there are people who come to see
`The Nutcracker' not only from New York City but from New Jersey,
Connecticut, Long Island and well beyond that. To disappoint so
many families and so many children is, to us, unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous contract expired on Labor Day. Without any ballet
business between then and this week, the orchestra voted to strike
on Tuesday, just before rehearsal for the season-opening gala
benefit that night. The scheduled program, created by the City
Ballet director, Peter Martins, was to have included excerpts from
eight ballets, but it was canceled. The only dancing that night was
an impromptu performance by a handful of dancers on the promenade
of the New York State Theater, during the gala dinner, which went
on as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the gala managed to raise over $1 million for the
company, even though it lacked the high spirits generally
associated with such events
</P>
<P>
   Basic pay for orchestra musicians, according to the union, is
$35,000, though with addenda to individual contracts, most members
earn more. The company says the average pay for the 70 members of
the orchestra is $66,000.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet company has rejected a proposal by the musicians that
the current contract be extended for another six months _ with the
stipulation that wages be increased by 4.5 percent _ and the
musicians have, in turn, rejected the company's proposal for a new
contract that calls for a 3.7 percent wage increase the first year,
plus financial incentives for musicians who agree to adhere to
attendance standards. According to the ballet company proposal, any
musician who wants to maintain current privileges may elect to do
so, but newly hired musicians must agree to the new attendance
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that, the musicians say, is that it would
create a two-tier system of compensation _ one wage scale for those
who agree to minimum attendance standards and another for those who
do not _ and that is unacceptable.
