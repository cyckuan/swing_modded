Hun Sen calls rivals ``cowards'' for refusing to accept defeat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen on
Saturday accused opposition parties of using security concerns as a
pretext to maintain Cambodia's political stalemate.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 Assembly
seats in July elections, but Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy, whose combined seats total 58, say their opponent's victory
was achieved through widespread fraud.
	   Fearing arrest and violence, both opposition leaders have left
the country, leaving behind a deadlocked political situation. Hun
Sen does not have the needed two-thirds majority to form a new
government.
	   ``Any political parties that complain about the formula (to
allocate Assembly seats) are cowards,'' Hun Sen said in a televised
speech.
	   Cambodia's highest appeals organ, the CPP-packed Constitutional
Council, has brushed aside complaints about the formula which the
two-opposition bloc claims was illegally changed in favor of Hun
Sen.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have demanded a review of the formula
as one of several preconditions for the start of negotiations on a
coalition government.
	   The two, along with many newly elected members of Parliament,
left the country soon after the ceremonial assembly opening on
Sept. 24. The opening was marred by a rocket attack which Hun Sen
and his security chiefs claimed was an assassination attempt by the
opposition.
	   The opposition bloc has recently demanded from Hun Sen a written
guarantee of safety and freedom from arrest as a condition for
their return to resume the stalled talks.
	   In a statement Friday, the opposition labeled as an empty
promise a government guarantee that it was safe for opposition
members to conduct political activities inside Cambodia.
	   Hun Sen described security problems for opposition members as
``unimportant'' and ``a political pretext'' to prolong the current
stalemate.
	   Although he acknowledged that the return of opposition
legislators would help pull Cambodia out of its political and
economic stagnation, Hun Sen added that ``Cambodia will not die
either, if they don't return.''

Hearns begins comeback with win at age 40
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Thomas Hearns called it the best punch he's ever
thrown. Jay Snyder didn't dispute the claim.
	   Hearns, starting a comeback at the age of 40, looked like the
Hit Man of old Friday night, taking just 88 seconds to knock out
Snyder in a cruiserweight bout at Joe Louis Arena.
	   ``The impact was so powerful. I've never hit anybody like that
before,'' Hearns said. ``I've hit people hard before, but that just
felt like something exploded.''
	   Hearns (58-4-1), fighting for the first time in two years,
unleashed a three-punch combination that rocked Snyder before a
crowd of about 7,000. He finished him off with a looping overhand
right that caused Hearns to slip _ leaving both boxers on the
canvas for a moment.
	   The difference was that Hearns bounced right back up.
	   ``Once I started to fall off balance, the punch had already
landed,'' Hearns said. ``I tried, but I just couldn't stop myself.
But I was up fast, wasn't I? I've got springs in my butt.''
	   Snyder, who earned $10,000 for his trouble, was flat on his back
for about two minutes. Handlers finally got him up on a stool in
the middle of the ring, where he sat for over five minutes in the
middle of a mob of Hearns well-wishers who rushed the ring to
celebrate.
	   ``I'm really disappointed because I really thought I had a
chance to take him out,'' Snyder said. ``That was no slip. I hit
him with a left hand on the chin, and the left isn't even my power.
I knew I had to jump right on him, because if I stayed outside,
he'd kill me with his reach.
	   ``But, as it is, he broke my nose. And then he knocked me out.''
	   It was the third time this year the 37-year-old Snyder (19-6)
has been knocked out in the first round. The bout had been
scheduled for 10 rounds.
	   ``I knew we weren't going to have to look for each other,''
Snyder said. ``We both came to fight.''
	   It was the first fight for Hearns since Nov. 29, 1996, when he
TKO'd Karl Willis in five rounds.
	   Snyder, who picked up the nickname ``Swamp Man'' during a
Toughman contest about 10 years ago, was at a decided height and
reach disadvantage to the 6-foot-1 Hearns. At 5-8, Snyder only came
up to the Hit Man's chin.
	   Hearns, who weighed 147 points when he made his professional
debut in 1977, carried close to 195 pounds into the ring against
Snyder, who works as a maintenance supervisor at a manufacturing
plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina.
	   His goal during this comeback is to fight four times and
eventually earn the cruiserweight championship. If he succeeds, it
would be the eighth world title for Hearns in welterweight,
middleweight, light heavyweight and upper-middleweight divisions.
	   Hearns said he expects to fight Danny Lalonde in January.
	   Hearns won his last crown in 1995 with a first-round knockout of
Lenny Lapaglia for the World Boxing Union cruiserweight
championship. This time, he would like to win either the WBA or WBC
cruiserweight titles.

Adopted brother of jailed finance minister denied appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Malaysian High Court on
Saturday rejected an appeal for release from prison by the adopted
brother of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Sukma Dermawan, a potential key government witness in the
sensational corruption and sodomy trial against Anwar, was
sentenced to six months in jail Sept. 19 after confessing to
allowing himself to be sodomized by Anwar.
	   Last week, Sukma's attorneys filed an appeal saying he should be
released from jail because, as a Muslim, he should have been tried
by an Islamic court.
	   Justice Abdul Wahab Patail rejected Sukma's habeas corpus appeal
Saturday, saying the lower Sessions Court had the jurisdiction to
decide on the sodomy case against Sukma.
	   Munawar Aness, Anwar's former speech writer who was jailed along
with Sukma, also has appealed his conviction. He said he was
coerced by police into confessing to sex with Anwar.
	   The first week of the dramatic case against Anwar, which has
attracted international attention and observers, ended Friday with
the defense having made significant gains.
	   The first prosecution witness, police intelligence chief Mohamed
Said Awang, testified during cross-examination that he might lie
under oath if asked to by superiors. He also said that a 1997
police document indicated there was a high-level conspiracy to
unseat Anwar and coerce people into saying they had engaged in sex
with him.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacked Anwar as his deputy and
finance minister Sept. 2, saying he was morally unfit to lead, then
had him expelled from the ruling party.
	   Anwar is standing trial on 10 counts of corruption and sexual
misconduct. He denies the charges and says they were fabricated
because Mahathir considered Anwar's popularity a threat to his
17-year rule.
	   The trial will resume Monday for one week. It will then adjourn
for a week as Malaysia hosts 21 Pacific-Rim leaders for the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   Though the trial will be in recess, it likely will cast a shadow
over the summit. The presidents of neighboring Indonesia and Manila
threatened to boycott the trade forum and U.S. President Bill
Clinton said he would not meet privately with Mahathir in protest
of Anwar's apparent beating in jail.

Hurricane Mitch sows death and destruction across Central America
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY392-396 of Nov. 6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   EDITOR's NOTE _ Born as a hurricane in the wee hours of Oct. 24,
Mitch grew into one of the biggest _ and deadliest _ tropical
cyclones of this century. By the time it broke up off the Florida
coast Thursday, the damage wrought by Mitch had reached biblical
proportions: an estimated 10,000 dead, thousands more missing,
billions of dollars in damage. Associated Press correspondents
throughout Central America contributed to this picture of the
storm's wrath.
	   ___
 &UR; By ANITA SNOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   The terror that would be Mitch veered onto the forecasters'
video monitors as a huge, threatening swirl in the middle of the
western Caribbean.
	   ``Satellite images suggest that the hurricane is
strengthening,'' the National Hurricane Center in Miami warned Oct.
24. But that Saturday morning, and for many hours afterward,
Mitch's path was far from clear.
	   That afternoon, it was 215 miles (346 kilometers)
south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, and moving north at 7 mph (11
kph). Officials there prepared for a hit. Cuba feared it would be
next.
	   But both nations were largely spared as the slow-moving storm
meandered through the Caribbean. Three days later Mitch's target
finally became clear: the isthmus of Central America, a land mass
of poor nations, fragile houses, vulnerable crops.
	   Mitch, now the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane this
century, moved in for the kill.
	   ___
	   Vacationers at the Posada del Sol resort on the island of
Guanaja, 75 miles (120 kph) off the Honduran coast, remember the
shrieking wind _ a sound like a freight train or a 747 jet taking
off.
	   Secure inside the concrete compound, they waited a hellish 36
hours, listening to the crashing tree limbs, roof tiles and big
concrete blocks _ and the infernal wind.
	   Many of Guanaja's 5,000 residents, meanwhile, waited out the
storm in a protected canyon extending across the island.
	   For more than a day, the hurricane's eye hovered over Guanaja,
ripping apart wooden houses on stilts, tearing boats from their
docks, knocking out power and telephones.
	   The storm wiped out the brightly colored flowers and greenery
that once covered the island, leaving behind a barren landscape.
	   ``I've never seen anything like it before,'' recalled Marvin
Stahl of Waskom, Texas, who was on a diving vacation with his wife.
``There is no foliage on the island _ every tree, all the limbs are
gone, all the leaves are gone.''
	   ___
	   Soon, the storm's fury moved to Honduras itself, and its Central
American neighbors. It dumped as much as 25 inches (63 centimeters)
of rain in a single day. Rivers swelled to several times their
normal size, and the turgid brown rapids snatched up houses, cows _
even people _ and carried them downstream, sometimes to the ocean.
	   The heavy rains soaked the hill country of Honduras and
Nicaragua until the soil in some places became so wet it finally
slipped loose, sending mud, rocks and trees spilling down onto
homes _ entire towns.
	   ___
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse went on national
television to declare his country's Caribbean coast a disaster
zone.
	   The rain _ up to 25 inches (63 inches) in mountain areas _ had
begun to take a huge toll. Tens of thousands were evacuated from
low-lying areas. The floodwaters in the Honduran capital of
Teguicgalpa rose to stunning levels: the third floor of a hospital
was evacuated as the Choluteca River poured into the second floor.
	   At a noisy shelter in a trade school, mothers wept silently as
they cradled their children on mattresses slapped on the floor.
Barefoot kids hollered as they scrambled after an errant soccer
ball.
	   Edwin Israel, 14, waited patiently behind a small group of
adults while they listed all their needs: food, medicine, clothing,
hope.
	   After the grownups left, Edwin admitted what he wanted most.
	   ``Shoes,'' he said softly, glancing at his bare feet.
``Hurricane Mitch took mine away.''
	   ___
	   The first official reports from northwestern Nicaragua the night
of Oct. 31 were almost too fantastic to believe: several thousands
buried when a mammoth mudslide plunged down the side of the Casitas
volcano.
	   ``It is like a desert littered with buried bodies,'' said
Felicita Zeledon, mayor of Posoltega, about 20 miles south of the
mudslide area.
	   The mayor's reports were not confirmed until the next day, when
the skies cleared and military helicopters could fly over. In
subsequent days, rescue workers pulled hundreds upon hundreds of
mud-caked corpses from the muck.
	   Many bodies were buried where they lay because of concerns about
disease. Others were burned.
	   ___
	   Almost a week after the Casitas mudslide, four bodies still lay
outside two thatched-roof houses barely standing after a river of
muck and rocks spilled onto Rolando Rodriguez's village in
northwestern Nicaragua. There was a man, his arms outstretched as
if swimming, a woman and two small children. Nearby, a dead boy lay
next to a dead dog.
	   Standing in the pouring rain, survivor Jose Mercedes, 26, said
he and his family were lucky to escape.
	   ``It was a ball of earth and trees,'' he said. ``And suddenly I
couldn't see the houses anymore.''

UNDATED: houses anymore.''

	   Mercedes said he and his family returned two days after the Oct.
30 mudslide to find a flat field of mud where their house once
stood. Most of their neighbors were dead, but they were able to 10
find who survived.
	   Miles (kilometers) away on the Pan American Highway, several
dozen refugees pushed a wheelbarrow with a 4-foot (1.2-meter)-tall
statue of the Virgin of Rosario.
	   ``We're doing this for those who have died and for those in
difficulty,'' said Felicita Calderon, 70.
	   ___
	   After the Saopin Bridge across the Cangrejal River was crushed,
cutting La Ceiba in two, families were separated. Those living on
the east side couldn't get to the grocery stores or pharmacies on
the west side.
	   The solution: a steel cable stretching across the span.
	   Using pulleys, locals suspended a metal basket from the cable,
creating ``the basket passage'' _ part thrill ride, part lifeline.
	   Volunteers used ropes to pull the basket, with five or six
passengers aboard, across the 65-foot (19-meter) gap in the bridge.
About 100 passengers crossed every hour, 13 hours a day.
	   Some passengers covered their eyes while the basket, just 3 feet
(0.9 meters) wide, 3 feet (0.9 meters) long and 3 feet (0.9 meters)
deep, swayed above the river.
	   Fredislindie Urbina, 64, shook when she stepped out of the
basket after crossing the river to visit her daughters, whom she
hadn't heard from since the storm.
	   ``It's good,'' she said, clapping her hand over her heart. ``But
it hurts.''
	   ___
	   Amid the smoke flowing from their newly erected lean-tos, about
500 people left homeless in El Salvador started reconstructing
their lives after everything they owned was snatched away by
surging floodwaters.
	   ``We got out with our children as we could,'' when the Lempa
River overflowed, said Francisca Iraheta. ``And were helped by some
horses that appeared from nowhere.''
	   ``Few people died, but a lot of animals were lost,'' said her
husband, Santos. ``And our agricultural crops are destroyed.''
	   ___
	   Although the floodwaters have receded, life is growing difficult
in the communities of northern Honduras.
	   ``There's no water or anything,'' said Ramon Martute, of La Paz,
a village of about 500 people.
	   No water. No food. No electricity. No phones. Few houses remain;
many people sleep in a fruit packing plant.
	   No roads. No bridges. The only access is by helicopter, but
flights are rare _ usually to evacuate sick or injured.
	   There is plenty of mud _ as far as the eye can see.
	   La Paz is in the Aguan River Valley, a major banana growing
region for Dole, known here as Standard Fruit of Honduras.
	   The river is muddy brown, still strong but far from the monster
it was during the storm. The banana plants are also muddy brown,
tens of thousands of them buckled over in the fields.
	   ___
	   Amid fear about outbreaks of disease, an American relief group
of paramedics and rescue workers trekked into northern Honduras.
	   In Flores de Oriente, the 14-member team from the Air-Land
Emergency Resource Team set up in the local clinic, still flooded
after the storm.
	   ``It's a mess,'' team leader John Tanner said as volunteers with
the nonprofit Christian group from Watersmeet, Michigan, began
attending to people with diarrhea, foot ailments, conjunctivitis.
	   Clementina Calles held her 19-month-old daughter, Cheryl Diana,
who squirmed while paramedics gave her antibiotics for tonsillitis.
	   ``She hasn't stop crying since yesterday,'' the mother said.
``It's a miracle we finally got aid.''
	   ___
	   Appealing for international help, Honduras' president announced
that his country's development had been set back 50 years.
	   In a televised speech Wednesday night, Flores urged the more
than 1.5 million Hondurans who lost loved ones, homes and property
to help in the recovery.
	   ``The county is semi-destroyed,'' he said. ``And awaits the
maximum effort, and most fervent and constant work of every one of
its children.''

<TEXT>
	   In Phoenix, Keith Tkachuk scored his sixth goal and Jim Cummins
had his first in 90 games as the Phoenix Coyotes beat the slumping
Detroit Red Wings for their fourth straight.
	   It was the fourth consecutive defeat for the two-time defending
Stanley Cup champions, who are 2-5-0 since starting the season
4-1-0. Detroit last lost four games in a row in October 1993 _
coach Scotty Bowman's first month on the job.
	   Bob Corkum added an empty-net goal with 37 seconds remaining for
the Coyotes, who are undefeated in their last five games at 4-0-1
and matched the best start in franchise history (6-2-1) set in
1982-83 when the team was in Winnipeg. Niklas Lidstrom scored for
Detroit.
 &UR; Predators 2, Flames 1
	   In Calgary, Alberta, Patrik Kjellberg's power-play goal late in
the second period lifted Nashville over the Calgary Flames _ the
expansion Predators' first road victory in five tries.
	   Calgary remained winless in five games at home (0-3-2).
	   Jan Vopat also scored for Nashville. Jarome Iginla scored for
the Flames, who had a three-game unbeaten streak (2-0-1) stopped.
	   Nashville goaltender Mike Dunham made 31 saves. Tyler Moss made
25 for the Flames in his first start of the season. Moss replaced
Ken Wregget, who is out with back spasms.
 &UR; Avalanche 5, Oilers 2
	   In Edmonton, Alberta, Valeri Kamensky scored three goals to lift
the Colorado Avalanche over the Edmonton Oilers.
	   Peter Forsberg, Kamensky's linemate, added a goal and three
assists and Claude Lemieux scored the game-winner as the struggling
Avalanche improved their record to 4-7-1.
	   Boris Morinov and Andrei Kovalenko scored for the Oilers.
	   It was Colorado's second victory in two games with the Oilers,
who upset the Avalanche in last season's playoffs.

Defense secretary returns after looking for support for air

strikes &QL;

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen returned
from an 11-nation visit to the Middle East, saying he felt
satisfied that the United States would have adequate support from
Arab allies to ``carry out the military action that would have to
be necessary'' against Iraq.
	   Cohen landed late Friday at Andrew Air Force Base outside of
Washington after a flight from Turkey.
	   He told reporters that his trip was not only to consult with
allies but also to convey ``how seriously we view the situation
(with) ... Iraq once again failing to live up to its obligations.''
	   U.S. officials for days have hinted that the United States was
prepared to take military action because of Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's failure to cooperate with United Nations weapons
inspectors. Cohen did not elaborate on possible military action,
but said ``time is short'' for the Iraqi leader to comply with U.N.
resolutions.
	   ``Each time (Saddam) has provoked a crisis he has sought to
acquire carrots and compromises, to relieve the crisis,'' Cohen
said. ``As far as we are concerned, no more carrots, no more
compromises. There must be full compliance.''
	   Cohen said he planned to brief President Bill Clinton on the
trip over the weekend.
	   During a stopover in Turkey, visits with President Suleyman
Demirel and Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin brought no announcement
of support. Turkey has suffered financially and politically as a
result of the 1991 Gulf war and sanctions placed on Iraq,
especially the shutoff of Iraqi oil exports which historically have
gone through a Turkish port.
	   Turkey was a staunch ally of the U.S.-led coalition during the
war with Iraq.
	   Cohen said Turkey shared the view that Hussein must comply with
U.N. resolutions.
	   Although the U.N. Security Council said Iraq's decision last
weekend to halt cooperation with inspectors was a ``flagrant
violation'' of U.N. resolutions, it was divided on whether a
military response was warranted.
	   During Cohen's stop in Jordan, Crown Prince Hassan indicated his
country was not keen on a military strike.
	   It ``is imperative to find a way out of the current crisis and
to find the appropriate conditions to resume cooperation between
the United Nations and Iraq,'' Hassan said. ``It is important to
avert in the region another confrontation and to settle the crisis
diplomatically.''
	   Officials in Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates
made similar statements. Cohen also visited Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait
and Egypt. No statements were made by officials in those countries,
but newspaper editorials were sympathetic to Iraq's plight under
U.N. sanctions.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990,
sparking the Persian Gulf War, cannot be lifted until weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq has gotten rid of all weapons of mass
destruction.
	   In a statement Thursday, Cohen's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said
the meetings were ``successful'' and that the secretary ``is
confident that the United States will have the support it needs to
take appropriate action to uphold the United Nations Security
Council resolutions.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook also was planning a tour of
the Gulf states in the next two weeks to lobby for international
condemnation of Iraq's decision to stop cooperating with U.N.
weapons inspectors.

	   TUCSON, Arizona (AP) _ Felecity Willis racked up a game-high 21
points and Lisa Griffith added 18 as Arizona defeated Slovan
Bratislava 83-54 Friday in a women's basketball exhibition.
	   Willis, who scored 15 of her points in the first half, added
seven rebounds and five assists. Willis provided a game-high seven
steals and added five assists.
	   Elizabeth Pickner has 16 points for the Wildcats, and Angela

second half,'' coach Joan Bonvicini said. ``We were making poor
decisions and not playing smart.''
	   Arizona led 47-28, but the Slovakians rallied in the second half
with a 21-12 run. The Wildcats then ran off 11 unanswered points.
	   Bratislava, which gave up 30 turnovers, hit only 33 percent from
the field to 51 percent for Arizona.

Greek forecast: Skies are sunny, mood is gloomy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Zorba is dead. But what did him in?
	   Was he suffocated by bureaucracy? Did he perish in a traffic
jam? Some people believe they last saw him grumbling something
about crime and corruption. Or maybe time just sapped the
life-embracing pathos of the 1964 film ``Zorba the Greek'' and its
dancer-philosopher-philanderer hero.
	   For a generation, many Greeks scoffed at the movie's take on the
national psyche. But almost all took pride in its optimistic
message: No worry is too big. Now, it seems the trick is how to
make room for all the concerns.
	   The media are feasting on the dour mood, giving every gripe
ample attention. Police, bureaucrats and even once-accepted customs
such as the ``little envelopes'' _ a euphemism for bribes _ have
been roundly bashed in print.
	   ``There's something rotten in the state of Hellas,'' headlined
the daily Kathimerini in an entire page dedicated to Greek woes.
	   A parade of polls testify to the general gloomy outlook. One
survey concluded that chronic traffic jams and uncontrolled
construction have turned Athens into a ``depressed and
disorganized'' place.
	   ``I wouldn't say this is the best of times for Greeks... .The
light at the end of the tunnel is dim,'' said lawmaker Nitsa Loule.
	   Much of the glumness stems from head-spinning change.
	   Recent years have witnessed a sharp rise in immigration _ most
of it illegal. Immigrants take many of the domestic and
agricultural jobs the Greeks snub, but their growing presence is
seen as a threat the country's homogeneous religion and culture.
	   An anti-foreigner group, the Front for Athens, plastered red
posters around the city demanding the expulsion of undocumented
immigrants. The head of the Greek Orthodox Church repeatedly has
spoken of ``enemies'' seeking to dilute Greece's identity.
	   The newcomers have become convenient scapegoats for rising
crime, although statistics show Greeks are responsible for the vast
majority of illegal acts. Still, a vigilante mentality is
spreading.
	   A 17-year-old boy who killed two alleged Albanian burglars with
his father's shotgun last week was being lionized by some residents
of his hometown near Corinth, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west
of Athens.
	   At the same time, the police are being bombarded by accusations
of corruption and incompetence.
	   Last month, a Yugoslav student was mistakenly identified as a
purse snatcher and was shot and killed during a struggle with
police.
	   ``Perhaps the police are not the best examples,'' said a
Kathimerini editorial. ``But are the tax offices, hospitals,
schools, universities, public transport or airlines any better?''
	   The salt in the wound for many Greeks is the perception that
they are paying more to get less.
	   The government has staked everything on meeting fiscal
guidelines to qualify for the European Union's single currency.
That means shrinking services, raising taxes and privatizing state
holdings, where employees once enjoyed virtual jobs-for-life
security.
	   Nearly every labor union has held some sort of protest against
the austerity plans. Last week, the foreign minister had enough.
	   He stormed into the office for document translators and demanded
police remove workers accused of harassing colleagues as part of
their protest for a full-time contract. The workers claim the
minister, Theodoros Pangalos, tried to drag them from the office.
Pangalos denied it. The case is going to court.
	   ``We're not happy,'' grumbled Pangalos.

Architect of Hong Kong currency peg critical of market
</HEADLINE>
intervention &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Hong Kong government should sell the
massive shareholdings it acquired during its controversial market
foray or risk a loss of confidence in the territory's currency, the
currency board's architect told legislators on Saturday.
	   John Greenwood, president of Invesco Asia Ltd. and one of the
key economists who drew up Hong Kong currency's fixed exchange rate
system, said it was ``neither appropriate nor desirable'' for the
government to hold so many shares of privately-held companies.
	   ``It is highly desirable that the government should distance
itself from the day-to-day management of the portfolio,'' Greenwood
told the legislature's financial panel.
	   In August, the Hong Kong government spent U.S. dlrs 4.4 billion
in foreign exchange reserves, scooping up shares and futures
contracts in an effort to drive up stock prices to levels at which
speculators _ who bet the market would fall _ would be stuck with
huge losses.
	   Hong Kong officials have argued that investors were selling the
Hong Kong dollar, forcing monetary authorities to raise interest
rates and buttress the fixed exchange rate to the U.S. dollar.
	   Speculators were selling shares on the stock market, then
cashing in when higher interest rates pushed shares lower.
	   Greenwood said the intervention was a departure from the usually
sound management of Hong Kong's currency board. Without divesting
the shares, the government could face conflicts of interests that
would inevitably damage Hong Kong's 15-year old currency peg.
	   ``I am not going to defend the purchase of equities stocks and
Hang Seng index futures contracts,'' Greenwood said.
	   Greenwood however praised the Hong Kong Monetary Authority _ the
territory's de facto central bank _ for abiding by the basic
principles behind the adoption of Hong Kong's fixed exchange rate.
	   Greenwood said the HKMA has rigorously backed Hong Kong's
monetary base with a solid reserve currency, and that any U.S.
dollar movement in and out of the banking system was immediately
countered by an adjustment in Hong Kong dollar liquidity.
	   Greenwood said the peg itself has adapted from the more
traditional arrangement envisioned in 1983 _ a reflection of the
growing sophistication of global market activity.
	   In September, the HKMA adopted seven measures to strengthen the
peg, a move which Greenwood said was consistent with the
disciplines of a currency board and ``should enhance Hong Kong's
ability to handle future speculative attacks.''
	   Speculators thought Hong Kong's currency board was similar to
others that toppled throughout the region in 1997, but they were
wrong, Greenwood said. The peg held because Hong Kong's banks and
other financial institutions ``proved resistant'' to external
shocks.
	   Despite the harsh criticism, Greenwood assured legislators that
Hong Kong's institutions remained flexible and adaptable, but
warned the rest of the economy had to follow if the peg was to hold
under inevitable external shocks.
	   ``If other countries had been able to show the same financial
discipline (as Hong Kong), it seems likely the crisis would not
have been so severe,'' Greenwood said.

Cambodian government ready to cooperate on Khmer Rouge trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian government is ready to
cooperate with U.N. experts on bringing the Khmer Rouge to justice
for the mass murder of as many as 2 million Cambodians between 1975
and 1979, a senior government official said Saturday.
	   Three international experts appointed by U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan are due to arrive in Phnom Penh on Nov. 14 to evaluate
evidence collected against the Khmer Rouge and their reign of
terror.
	   ``We are prepared to cooperate with those experts,'' said
spokesman Khieu Kanharith.
	   The government would like to see an international court of
justice similar to the one trying crimes stemming from the war in
the former Yugoslavia at the Hague in the Netherlands, Khieu
Kanharith said.
	   At the United Nations on Friday, Thomas Hammarberg, Annan's
special representative to Cambodia for human rights, said he hoped
the outcome of the mission would be a report on how the
international community could move forward on the Khmer Rouge
issue.
	   But he cautioned that the result may be nothing.
	   The Maoist-inspired guerrilla movement caused the deaths of
about one Cambodian in five from forced labor, starvation, disease,
torture and systematic execution. No one has ever been punished for
them.
	   After their overthrow by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979, Khmer
Rouge guerrillas were supported by anti-Hanoi government in China,
Thailand and the United States.
	   Vietnamese troops left in 1989, but continuous political turmoil
in Cambodia and ongoing usefulness or deals made with various Khmer
Rouge factions and Cambodia's leaders has prevented arrest,
prosecution and punishment.
	   The Maoist-inspired movement started to crumble in 1996 after
thousands of guerrillas led by the deputy of longtime leader Pol
Pot, Ieng Sary, defected to the government two years ago.
	   Ieng Sary was given amnesty in exchange for helping weaken a
festering civil war and is living a peaceful life in gem-rich
Pailin in northwest Cambodia.
	   Pol Pot died of purported heart failure in April. He had been
purged by Ta Mok, his chief general, in a bloody power struggle in
1997.
	   Ta Mok and two other senior Khmer Rouge leaders, Khieu Samphan
and Nuon Chea, are still at large in the northern jungle, supported
by a few hundred guerrillas. There is no sign of their imminent
arrest.
	   ``An international court should try main leaders of the Khmer
Rouge,'' Khieu Kanharith said. ``Those at lower level can be tried
by local court.''
	   Hammarberg received support from King Norodom Sihanouk and
Cambodia's most powerful politician, Hun Sen, for the U.N. mission
during his visit to the kingdom last week.
	   The political opposition led by the king's son, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, and former finance minister Sam Rainsy also support the
mission.
	   The team is composed of former Australian Governor General Sir
Ninian Stephen, who served on the Yugoslav tribunal and was made
chairman; Rajsoomer Lallah, the U.N.'s human rights investigator
for Myanmar; and Stephen Ratner, a professor at the University of
Texas Law School.

First batch of U.N. inspectors prepare to leave
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Six U.N. weapons inspectors _ most of them
experts on missiles _ were leaving Baghdad Saturday in the first
stage of the U.N. reduction of its teams in Iraq.
	   The withdrawal comes a week after Iraq said it was halting all
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM here, said the monitors
leaving Saturday were ``a visiting missile team that just happened
to be here when Iraq made its announcement.''
	   ``The support staff is staying in place,'' Ms. Cross said.
``They have the qualifications to resume work immediately should
Iraq have a change of heart.''
	   It is not known when more inspectors will leave.
	   UNSCOM announced Friday it will withdraw 26 of about 120 to 140
staff in Iraq because its government has banned all spot
inspections and monitoring.
	   The United Nations Security Council condemned Iraq's move in a
resolution Thursday, but it remains divided on whether to authorize
military strikes as favored by the United States and Britain.
	   There has so far been no official response by Iraq on the
resolution.
	   On Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen returned from a
tour of Arab nations and Turkey, saying he was satisfied the United
States would have adequate support from Arab allies to carry out
military action.
	   But comments made by officials in the region indicate that the
Arabs may be against another war.
	   Iraq's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement Friday that any
armed actions are ``fraught with most unpredictable consequences
for peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a
whole.''
	   Iraq has said it will resume cooperation with UNSCOM only if the
Security Council gives a timetable for the lifting of economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, however, cannot be lifted until UNSCOM says Iraq
is free of all weapons of mass destruction. Iraq also had a
suspected nuclear program, which is now believed to be dismantled.
	   The Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency
deals with Iraq's compliance on nuclear issues, and its monitors
have not been banned by Iraq.
	   Cross, the UNSCOM spokeswoman, said a nuclear team went into the
field to continue monitoring work Saturday. No details were
available.

Saudi executed for murder

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi man convicted of murder has
been executed, the al-Riyadh newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Abdullah Saud al-Shibani was beheaded Friday for shooting to
death a fellow tribesman, Mohammed Badi al-Shibani, the paper said
without elaborating.
	   Al-Shibani's execution in Riyadh raised to 23 the number of
beheadings in the kingdom this year. Last year 124 people were
executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

``cowards''
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with king rejecting pressure from
politicians to dissolve government.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk rejected
pressure Saturday to dissolve Cambodia's existing government until
a new one can be formed by rival political parties stuck in a
deadlock since disputed elections in July.
	   In an interview with his palace bulletin, the Cambodian monarch
acknowledged that strongman Hun Sen, who narrowly won the elections
but failed to capture the two-thirds of parliamentary seats needed
to form a government on his own, would not permit such a move.
	   The elections were intended to replace the government running
the country since Hun Sen toppled the king's son, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, as co-prime minister in a bloody coup in July 1997.
	   The king noted he was under pressure from Ranariddh and former
finance minister Sam Rainsy, the election losers, to dissolve the
post-coup regime and replace it with an interim, technocratic
administration.
	   He has also been asked to amnesty several of their supporters
abroad who are under threat of arrest by Hun Sen if they return.
	   Hun Sen ``would not fail to vigorously fight, with all the means
in his possession'' either attempt, Sihanouk said. ``I cannot carry
it out, because a conflict between Hun Sen and myself would be to
the detriment of our unhappy Cambodia and our already very
unfortunate people.''
	   Earlier, Hun Sen accused the opposition parties of using stated
fears for their safety as a pretext to maintain Cambodia's
political stalemate.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 Assembly
seats in the elections, but Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, whose
combined seats total 58, say he won through widespread fraud and
intimidation.
	   Hun Sen branded them ``cowards'' in a televised speech Saturday.
	   The two, along with many newly elected members of Parliament,
left the country soon after the ceremonial assembly opening on
Sept. 24. It was marred by a rocket attack which Hun Sen and his
security chiefs claimed was an assassination attempt by the
opposition.
	   The opposition has recently demanded from Hun Sen a written
guarantee of safety and freedom from arrest. They labeled as an
empty promise a government guarantee that it was safe for
opposition members to conduct political activities inside Cambodia.
	   Hun Sen described the security problems as ``unimportant'' and
``a political pretext'' to prolong the current stalemate.
	   Although he acknowledged that the return of opposition
legislators would help pull Cambodia out of political and economic
stagnation, Hun Sen added that ``Cambodia will not die either, if
they don't return.''

First batch of U.N. inspectors prepare to leave
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Six U.N. weapons inspectors _ most of them
missiles experts _ were leaving Baghdad Saturday in the first stage
of the U.N. reduction of its teams in Iraq.
	   The withdrawal comes a week after Iraq said it was halting all
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM here, said the monitors
leaving Saturday were ``a visiting missile team that just happened
to be here when Iraq made its announcement.''
	   ``The support staff is staying in place,'' Ms. Cross said.
``They have the qualifications to resume work immediately should
Iraq have a change of heart.''
	   It is not known when more inspectors will leave.
	   UNSCOM announced Friday it will withdraw 26 of about 120 to 140
staff in Iraq because its government has banned all spot
inspections and monitoring.
	   The United Nations Security Council condemned Iraq's move in a
resolution Thursday, but it remains divided on whether to authorize
military strikes as favored by the United States and Britain.
	   Iraq has so far not officially responded to the resolution.
	   On Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen returned from a
tour of Arab nations and Turkey, saying he was satisfied the United
States would have adequate support from Arab allies to carry out
military action.
	   But comments made by officials in the region indicate that the
Arabs may be against another war.
	   Iraq's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement Friday that any
armed actions are ``fraught with most unpredictable consequences
for peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a
whole.''
	   Iraq has said it will resume cooperation with UNSCOM only if the
Security Council gives a timetable for the lifting of economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, however, cannot be lifted until UNSCOM says Iraq
is free of all weapons of mass destruction. Iraq also had a
suspected nuclear program, which is now believed to be dismantled.
	   The Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency
deals with Iraq's compliance on nuclear issues, and its monitors
have not been banned by Iraq.
	   Cross, the UNSCOM spokeswoman, said a nuclear team went into the
field to continue monitoring work Saturday. No details were
available.

<TEXT>
	   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The sheer scope of damage caused by
Hurricane Mitch in Central America has led former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter to predict a lengthy recovery and urge lenders to
forgive the foreign debts of the two countries hardest hit.
	   Carter's comments Friday followed a flight over Nicaragua's
disaster zone, where mudslides killed an estimated 2,000 people and
obliterated villages. Still, Carter warned, ``The worst is yet to
come: cholera and dengue.''
	   Some diseases apparently already have arrived. In Guatemala, 25
cases of cholera have been reported, the Public Health Ministry
said Friday. And in Posoltega, near the slides, doctors suspected a
6-year-old girl shaking with fever had contracted malaria.
	   Dr. Rigoberto Sampson dabbed Justa Pastora Povera Guillen with a
wet cloth and gave her half a tablet of Tylenol. There was little
he could do: ``We are lacking medicine. We can't give her blood
tests to see whether it's malaria, but because of the situation
here, I think it is.''
	   Storm devastation has overwhelmed Central America, where
officials say more than 10,000 people died in flooding and
mudslides. Honduras said 569,000 were homeless and about 1 million
others lost family or property. Nicaragua said more than 750,000 of
its people were affected.
	   In the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, a crowd stared Friday
from behind yellow police tape as dozens of vultures picked at
bloated pig carcasses mired in a massive debris jam alongside the
Mallol Bridge.
	   Half the 200-yard (meter) bridge was swept away by the
flood-swollen Choluteca River, which still lapped at its rails.
	   Residents speculated that human corpses were buried in the flow,
but rescuers hadn't searched because a mudslide upstream was
tenuously holding back a small lake of water and could break at any
moment.
	   ``They say people from Colonia Soto are in there,'' said
national police cadet Daniel Merino, 22, standing guard with a
rifle to keep the curious at bay. ``The disaster won't go away.''
	   Nicaraguan victims of last week's storm have accused President
Arnoldo Aleman of being slow to help some of the worst-hit regions
because inhabitants overwhelmingly support leftist Sandinistas, the
former rebels who governed through the 1980s.
	   ``The government has not sent anything. The only ones who are
helping us are the Sandinistas,'' Posoltega Mayor Felicita Zeledon
said.
	   President Clinton is sending dlrs 70 million in aid to the
region. Private U.S.-based relief groups said they were flooded
with calls volunteering private money and supplies.
	   Dean Owen, spokesman for World Vision, called it ``one of the
largest efforts we've seen in several years.'' The international
group hopes to raise drls 5 million in cash and donations of
blankets, towels, soap and other personal care items.
	   Carter, meanwhile, urged international lenders to help ease the
burden in Honduras and Nicaragua by forgiving the countries'
foreign debt. Honduras owes dlrs 4.2 billion and Nicaragua owes
dlrs 6 billion, mainly to international lending agencies.
	   ``The World Bank and International Monetary Fund should forgive
Nicaragua and Honduras' outstanding debts because it will probably
take them 10 to 15 years to recover,'' Carter told reporters in
Managua.
	   Worldwide, governments are pledging assistance. Taiwan has
promised relief; Brazil said it would send food, medicine and field
tents; and Central American embassies and consulates in Brazil
opened special bank accounts to collect monetary donations. Spain
also approved an emergency aid package and Australia has pledged
dlrs 630,0000.
	   The U.S. Navy said its Mobile Construction Battalion Seven was
ordered Friday to leave its station in Puerto Rico and head to
Honduras to help in the rebuilding effort.
	   Still, money and supplies have been slow in getting to those in
need.
	   In Honduras, relief workers waited anxiously for promised aid
and scrambled to find aircraft, trucks, gasoline and aviation fuel
to get it to hundreds of isolated towns.
	   CARE worker Pilar de Pastor sat helplessly in a jeep on a
Tegucigalpa street. ``We're hoping to get two helicopters from
Palmerola'' air base up north, she said. ``Maybe today they'll
come.''

Thai officials to review status of DiCaprio, Foster films
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Caught in a pair of controversies, Thai
film authorities say they will review Monday whether and under what
conditions movies starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jodie Foster can
be shot here.
	   ``The Beach,'' starring ``Titanic'' heartthrob DiCaprio, has
been given the green light but is running into opposition from
environmental activists upset that the landscape of Phi Island, a
national park, will be altered for the shooting.
	   A remake of ``Anna and the King'' starring Foster and Chow Yun
Fat has meanwhile been denied approval because of deep-rooted
feeling that the story _ basis for the Broadway musical and film
``The King and I'' _ is insulting to a revered monarch.
	   The Public Relations Department, which oversees the Film Board
that approves movie projects in Thailand, will consider appeals
Monday from opponents of ``The Beach'' and supporters of ``Anna and
the King.'' Both are 20th Century Fox productions.
	   ``The Beach'' has caused the greatest uproar. A protest led by a
man in a DiCaprio mask sprouting vampire fangs was held in downtown
Bangkok on Thursday, and Thai reporters who tried to visit the
location set on Phi Island on Friday were turned away.
	   The film-making team has already started clearing the land. They
have permission from the Forestry Department have paid a large
deposit against any environmental damage that may be caused.
	   Despite being a national park, Phi Phi has undergone steady
development in recent years. Critics allege that corruption has
played a major role.
	   Vijit Vuuthiamphon, director-general of the department, was
quoted by The Nation newspaper Saturday as saying an ad hoc
committee will decide Monday whether to continue permission for
filming ``The Beach.''
	   ``If the committee concludes the project is inappropriate, we
will revoke the permission,'' Vijit told The Nation.
	   Boosters say the film will provide important publicity for
Thailand's tourism industry and jobs to people amid Thailand's
worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Film Board officials say that neighboring Malaysia is trying
hard to win the ``The Beach'' if Thailand rejects it.
	   Malaysia has also been mentioned as a possible location
alternative for the non-musical ``Anna and the King'' if Thailand
maintains its refusal to allow the project.
	   Fox's local office contends shooting the film in Thailand would
allow Thais to exercise some influence on the portrayal of King
Mongkut, also known as Rama IV, whom many Thais feel was portrayed
as an arrogant buffoon in previous films.
	   Mongkut was a noted linguist and Buddhist scholar and one of the
greater kings in the current Chakri dynasty. The monarchy is
revered in Thailand and it is a criminal offense to insult the
king.

	   SAN JOSE, California. (AP) _ Bruce Arena wasn't disappointed
that his debut as U.S. soccer coach ended in a 0-0 tie with
Australia on Friday night.
	   ``It was a good first outing for our team,'' Arena said. ``I'm
happy to be in this position and look forward to the challenge.''
	   It was the first match for the United States since it was
eliminated from the World Cup in France on June 25. Arena was named
U.S. coach on Oct. 27, replacing Steve Sampson.
	   ``It was a good opportunity to get young players their first
international experience,'' Arena said. ``I know we'll continue to
improve.''
	   U.S. goalie Zach Thornton, making his second appearance with the
national team, made 11 saves to help keep the game scoreless.
	   ``He played an outstanding game,'' said Australia coach Raul
Blanco. ``He did absolutely nothing wrong all night.''
	   Australia goalie Jason Petkovic turned back all eight shots he
faced.
	   Australia had an indirect kick from six yards out in the 78th
minute, but Mark Viduka's shot was blocked by Cobi Jones.
	   ``I thought we did a solid job. This was a good start for us,''
said U.S. defender Jeff Agoos, the only member of the national team
to have played for all five coaches. ``It's a great new atmosphere.
Everyone is excited. It feels like a new beginning.''
	   U.S. midfielder Clint Mathis made a nice run down the right side
into the penalty area in the 49th minute, but shot the ball across
the face of the net.
	   In the 60th minute, U.S. forward Roy Lassiter stole a pass back
to the goalie, but lofted the ball over the net.
	   The Americans' best chance to score in the first half came in
the third minute, when Lassiter had a one-on-one with Petkovic just
outside the goalkeeper's box. Petkovic came out to challenge and
was able to block Lassiter's shot.
	   The game was just the second international between Australia and
the United States. Australia won 1-0, on June 13, 1992 in Orlando,
Fla.

Singapore court jails reckless driver who killed three
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore court jailed a reckless driver for
two years on Saturday after he killed three bystanders in an
accident that shocked the nation earlier this year.
	   Peck Teck Siong, 25, plowed into a crowded bus stop on May 12
after losing control of the sports car he was delivering for his
father. Three young women were killed and six others were injured.
	   The court found Peck guilty of causing death through rash and
dangerous driving, a crime for which he could have been jailed up
to five years, reported Singapore's state-run television. He was
also banned from driving for life.
	   Peck, a used car salesman who was not injured in the accident,
was traveling 20 to 25 kilometers per hour (12 to 16 miles per
hour) above the speed limit when he swerved while overtaking a car,
then careened across the four-lane road and slammed into the bus
stop.

England out for 187
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ England captain Alec Stewart and
former skipper Mike Atherton returned to duty Saturday but the
Ashes tourists were bowled out for a disappointing 187 by South
Australia.
	   Stewart (0) and Atherton (4) joined Mark Butcher (2) and Graham
Thorpe as top order failures after overcoming injuries to make
their opening first-class games on tour.
	   It was a discouraging innings looking ahead to the five-test
series starting against Australia in Brisbane on Nov. 20.
	   In reply, South Australia was 26 for no wicket at stumps with
Greg Blewett not out 10 and Martin Faull on 15.
	   Paceman Mark Harrity claimed 3-27 from 15.3 overs while Jason
Gillespie, pressing for a recall to the Australian side after a
long absence through injury, took 1-24 off 15 overs.
	   England vice-captain Nasser Hussain top scored with 57 and
allrounder Dominic Cork struck 51 from 71 balls but only two other
batsmen, Mark Ramprakash (31) and tailender Alex Tudor (33),
reached double figures.
	   Hussain made a century in the opening match, last week's drawn
game against Western Australia.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ About 15 U.N. weapons inspectors _ some of
them experts on missiles _ were leaving Baghdad Saturday in the
first stage of the U.N. reduction of its teams in Iraq.
	   The withdrawal comes a week after Iraq said it was halting all
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM here, said the monitors
leaving Saturday included six who were ``a visiting missile team
that just happened to be here when Iraq made its announcement.''
	   ``The support staff is staying in place,'' Ms. Cross said.
``They have the qualifications to resume work immediately should
Iraq have a change of heart.''
	   She said ``about 15'' staffers are expected to fly to Bahrain on
a U.N. plane from an air base outside Baghdad.
	   The experts are among 26 people that UNSCOM has decided to
withdraw from its staff of about 120 to 140. The decision announced
Friday was in response to Iraq's Oct. 31 announcement banning all
spot inspections and monitoring.
	   It is not known when the other inspectors will leave.

Arafat pledges to hunt masterminds in suicide attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian security officials identifying second
assailant as Islamic Jihad activist, minor editing thruout &QL;

 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has promised
to track down those involved in a suicide bombing in the heart of
Jerusalem that killed the two assailants, injured 21 people and
jeopardized the new peace accord.
	   ``We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront
these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,''
Arafat said after Friday's attack on a crowded open-air market
swarming with shoppers readying for the Jewish Sabbath.
	   In a rare direct statement to the Israeli people, Arafat
appeared on Israeli television and urged that the attack not be
allowed to set back peace efforts. He promised to ``exert 100
percent effort'' to track down those involved in planning the
bombing.
	   It was the second suicide bombing since the signing of the
land-for-security accord two weeks ago. On Oct. 29, an activist
from the radical group Hamas activist killed himself and an Israeli
soldier when he tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus
carrying Jewish schoolchildren.
	   Hamas claimed responsibility for Friday's attack, but
Palestinian security officials blamed members of the militant
Islamic Jihad.
	   The officials identified one of the dead assailants as Yusef Ali
Mohammed Zughayar, 18, of Anata, a refugee camp north of Jerusalem,
and the second as Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 23, from a village
outside the West Bank town of Jenin. Both were described as Islamic
Jihad activists.
	   Arafat called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express his
sorrow over Friday's bombing, but Netanyahu's office said the
Israeli leader told Arafat that for the peace process to continue,
the Palestinians would have to significantly step up their war
against terrorists.
	   Israel's Cabinet, which was meeting at the time of the attack,
cut short its debate on ratifying the accord, and did not set a
date for resuming it.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet condemned the attack following its own
meeting Friday night, but said Israel should not use it as an
excuse to halt the peace process.
	   The toll from the attack at the Mahane Yehuda market was far
lighter than might have been expected because the explosives
apparently went off prematurely. Many shoppers in the crowded
market saw smoke and flames coming from the car and fled moments
before the main blast.
	   Suitcases were found in the car's wreckage, Israel radio
reported, suggesting the attackers may have intended to carry
separate parcels of explosives deep into the crowd. That method was
used in an attack at the market 16 months ago that killed the two
suicide bombers and 16 others.
	   Attacks at the market, spread over a poor, predominantly
religious neighborhood, stretch back three decades. Bombings in
1968, 1990 and 1997 have killed 31 Israelis. In between, there have
been numerous stabbings.
	   But Jerusalemites say danger will not keep them away. Mahane
Yehuda's wooden stalls of mango, fresh fish on ice and dried fruits
are part of everyday life in the city.
	   ``We always shopped here and we always will, come what may,''
Shlomo Aviran, 58, said while waiting for his loaf of rye bread to
be sliced at the Habah Bakery. ``I was born and bred in Jerusalem
and I've seen many explosions.''

Three killed in Kenya plane crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A small plane crashed and burst into
flames in a game park, killing all three people on board, an
airport official said Saturday.
	   The 12-seat King Air 200 plowed into Nairobi National park just
10 minutes after taking off from Wilson Airport Friday, the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The plane was loaded with khat, a narcotic leaf, bound for the
Somali capital, Mogadishu.
	   The pilot and two passengers were killed on impact. Their names
were not immediately released, the official said.
	   The fire destroyed more than 12 hectares (30 acres) of
grasslands on the eastern side of Nairobi National Park.
	   The cause of the crash was under investigation.

Kurosawa's last screenplay will be made into film
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A screenplay by the late Akira Kurosawa, which
portrays the enduring love between a wandering samurai and his
wife, will be made into a film, Japanese media reports said
Saturday.
	   Kurosawa, Japan's greatest director, died in September at the
age of 88, leaving behind a legacy of spectacular but
heart-wrenching films, including ``Rashomon,'' ``Seven Samurai,''
``Ran'' and the Academy Award-winning ``Dersu Uzala.''
	   Titled ``After the Rain,'' the script, his last before his
death, centers around a gentle samurai, whose weak outward
appearance belies his superb fighting skills, the reports said.
	   Kurosawa had written directions in a notebook alongside the
script, the Asahi newspaper said.
	   One said: ``Make this a funny scene without letting the audience
know it.''
	   Another said: ``As long as we live, we're not getting any
younger, but to be alive is wonderful _ no matter how much we
suffer.''
	   Shooting will begin next spring with completion slated for the
fall in time for the first anniversary of his death, the Asahi
said.
	   The project will reunite Kurosawa's old team, including his son
Hisao as producer and Takashi Koizumi, his assistant, directing,
the reports said. The actors have not yet been decided.
	   Kurosawa's office was closed for the weekend and could not be
immediately reached for comment.
	   Shortly after Kurosawa's death, his production company said that
he had been working on a film called ``The Sea Was Watching'' about
prostitutes in the feudal age.
	   But Saturday's reports said Kurosawa began writing ``After the
Rain'' in 1995, when ``The Sea Was Watching'' ran into financial
difficulties.
	   Kurosawa suffered a serious hip injury while writing ``After the
Rain,'' but the script, based on a short story by Shugoro Yamamoto,
was nearly finished.

Mubarak says peace unlikely under Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's president says there is ``virtually
nobody'' who believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
will implement the latest peace deal with Palestinians.
	   In an interview published Saturday, President Hosni Mubarak said
if Netanyahu wants to change that perception he must boldly face
the setback to peace caused by Friday's car bombing in Jerusalem
that killed the two bombers and injured 21.
	   ``I tell the Israelis that the solution does not lie in freezing
negotiations,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying by the government-run
Egyptian Mail newspaper.
	   Mubarak is a key player in Middle East peace negotiations and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat regularly consults him. Mubarak's
comments reflect the popular Arab feeling that Israel is insincere
about peace, and that it only looks for excuses to retain control
over West Bank.
	   Mubarak said explosions are a worldwide occurrence. But ``does
life come to a halt? On the contrary. The peace foes who are many
should be denied the chance,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Following Friday's bombing, Netanyahu's right-wing Cabinet
suspended the ratification of an interim peace deal he reached last
month with Arafat at Wye River in the United States.
	   Under the accord, Israel agreed to relinquish a further 13
percent of the West Bank and Arafat promised to develop a plan to
uproot terrorists on Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   Mubarak said that even as the accord was signed Oct. 23 he was
cautioning that implementation of the deal was more important than
words.
	   ``This is because I felt apprehensive what occurred (in
Jerusalem) would happen,'' he said.
	   However, that is no reason to go back on the accord, he said.
	   ``I tell ... Netanyahu that there is virtually nobody who trusts
that you will carry out the Wye River accord. Should you want to
change this perception, you have to take the initiative and make
practical steps to comply with ... the agreement,'' Mubarak was
quoted as saying.
	   Failure to do so will only ensure recurrence of violence, he
said.
	   ``The Palestinians are beset with frustrations from all sides.
So when a ray of hope appears for them on the horizon, they should
be supported, not the other way round,'' he said.
	   On normalizing Arab-Israeli ties, Mubarak said the two peoples
should accept the idea first before anything is imposed by
``supreme decrees.''
	   And people can only be won over by ``sowing the seeds of trust,
by handing over land to their rightful owners and respecting
treaties and accords.'' he said.

Pioneer AIDS researcher hopes for vaccine in four years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ American AIDS researcher Robert Gallo
has said that recent work has raised his confidence that a vaccine
can be developed against the deadly disease in four years.
	   Speaking to Thai researchers Friday at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn
University, Gallo, credited for co-discovering HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, said he was more confident of a vaccine than a year
ago.
	   ``Recent researches make me confident that we will have
something in the form of a preventive vaccine, say, in the coming
three or four years,'' Gallo was quoted by The Nation newspaper as
saying.
	   Gallo said recent laboratory studies show that a protein in the
urine of women early in pregnancy can inhibit the replication of
HIV virus in the test tube.
	   Study on a vaccine is meanwhile under way on 80 volunteers in
several European countries and Israel made by combining interferon,
used in treating Hepatitis B and cancer, with TAT, an HIV-generated
protein.
	   Trials are likely to begin in the United States after it
receives approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
possibly in February, Gallo was quoted by the Bangkok Post as
saying.
	   Clinical trials could begin in Thailand after that, he said.
	   Gallo is a director of the Institute of Human Virology in
Baltimore, Maryland.

	   NEW AMSTERDAM, Guyana (AP) _ The U.S. Coast Guard gave up. The
owners of the yacht gave up.
	   But the people of this town are holding nightly vigils, refusing
to lose hope for 11 native sons aboard a tourist yacht that tried
to outrun the unpredictable Hurricane Mitch.
	   Many in this town of 30,000 cannot or will not accept the
sailors as lost.
	   ``They must have got to Central America, somewhere,'' said the
wife of a missing sailor who refused to give her name.
	   As Hurricane Mitch approached, the Fantome, a four-masted,
282-foot (86-meter) schooner, safely dropped off its 100 passengers
in Belize City.
	   The crew stayed on the ship, planning to head north toward
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to get away from Mitch. But the storm
changed course, and the ship was caught.
	   The Fantome's last radio message said it was experiencing 115
mph (185 kph) winds and the ship was rolling, Windjammer officials
said.
	   ``It is pretty much confirmed that the ship is not there any
more,'' said James Canty, vice president of corporate development
for Windjammer Barefoot Cruises Inc. of Miami. The Fantome was the
pride of the Windjammer fleet.
	   Asked whether he thought the 31 crew members had perished at
sea, Canty said, ``As much as I hate to say it, yes.''
	   In New Amsterdam, many relatives had a hard time believing that.
They clung to the hope that the men had made it to land in Central
America.
	   Hundreds gathered at the town hall Friday night, more than 24
hours after the U.S. Coast Guard abandoned the search. Mayor Errol
Alphonso said he expects hundreds more Saturday.
	   Amid the hymns, prayers, sobs and wails, a few attempted to deal
with the worst possibility.
	   ``They could probably be down at the bottom of the sea because
they have searched and they can't find them. Where else could they
be?'' said a distraught Marcelle August, wife of crewman Colin
August and mother of their two children.
	   Hours after it was announced that the search had been called
off, Windjammer flew two representatives to meet with relatives in
New Amsterdam and another dozen countries of crew members.
	   August said Windjammer was paying families two months salary and
had promised to set up a trust fund for the children of crew
members.
	   Four Coast Guard planes and a British warship searched for the
schooner for a week. The Coast Guard said that it had covered more
than 145,000 square miles (375,550 square kilometers).
	   A life vest was found Monday. In the end, there were two areas
of debris off the Honduran coast, including portions of a wooden
staircase and blue tarpaulin from the boat.
	   But no bodies were found.
	   ``If in fact the Coast Guard has given up, it is my very strong
view that they gave up too early,'' Alphonso said as he left the
vigil Friday night.
	   Windjammer also said it was hopeful.
	   ``I think there's always hope. Personally, I have hope and I
think many people here have hope,'' Windjammer's Canty said in
Miami.
	   The Fantome was built in 1927 for the Duke of Westminster and
bought in the 1950s by Aristotle Onassis as a wedding present for
Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco. He never delivered it,
though, because he wasn't invited to the wedding.

Mubarak says peace unlikely under Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's president says there is ``virtually
nobody'' who believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
will implement the latest peace deal with Palestinians.
	   In an interview published Saturday, President Hosni Mubarak said
if Netanyahu wants to change that perception he must boldly face
the setback to peace caused by Friday's car bombing in Jerusalem
that killed the two bombers and injured 21.
	   ``I tell the Israelis that the solution does not lie in freezing
negotiations,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying by the government-run
Egyptian Mail newspaper.
	   Mubarak is a key player in Middle East peace negotiations and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat regularly consults him. Mubarak's
comments reflect the popular Arab feeling that Israel is insincere
about peace, and that it looks for excuses to retain control over
the West Bank.
	   Mubarak said explosions are a worldwide occurrence. But ``does
life come to a halt? On the contrary. The peace foes who are many
should be denied the chance,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Following Friday's bombing, Netanyahu's right-wing Cabinet
suspended the ratification of an interim peace deal he reached last
month with Arafat at Wye River in the United States.
	   Under the accord, Israel agreed to relinquish a further 13
percent of the West Bank and Arafat promised to develop a plan to
uproot terrorists on Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   Mubarak said that even as the accord was signed Oct. 23 he was
cautioning that implementation of the deal was more important than
words.
	   ``This is because I felt apprehensive what occurred (in
Jerusalem) would happen,'' he said.
	   However, that is no reason to go back on the accord, he said.
	   ``I tell ... Netanyahu that there is virtually nobody who trusts
that you will carry out the Wye River accord. Should you want to
change this perception, you have to take the initiative and make
practical steps to comply with ... the agreement,'' Mubarak was
quoted as saying.
	   Failure to do so will only ensure recurrence of violence, he
said.
	   ``The Palestinians are beset with frustrations from all sides.
So when a ray of hope appears for them on the horizon, they should
be supported, not the other way round,'' he said.
	   On normalizing Arab-Israeli ties, Mubarak said the two peoples
should accept the idea first before anything is imposed by
``supreme decrees.''
	   And people can only be won over by ``sowing the seeds of trust,
by handing over land to their rightful owners and respecting
treaties and accords.'' he said.

U.S. gives dlrs 50,000 to help bombing victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The United States donated dlrs 50,000 on
Saturday to help provide trauma counseling to survivors of the
terrorist bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
	   U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, who was lightly wounded in
the attack, donated the money to Operation Recovery at a ceremony
marking the three-month anniversary of the blast.
	   It was the first installment of a larger donation to assist
victims and support medical services in the aftermath of the Aug. 7
bombing that killed 213 people, including a dozen Americans, and
wounded more than 5,400.
	   A nearly simultaneous bomb killed 11 people at the U.S. Embassy
in neighboring Tanzania.
	   Three men _ Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali
and Wadih el Hage, a Texan _ are in custody in New York and have
pleaded innocent to the bombing. Three others, including exiled
Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of the
bombing, are fugitives.
	   The U.S. government also expects to help pay outstanding
hospital bills for those treated in connection with bombing
injuries, the U.S. Embassy said in a statement.
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development is working with
the Kenya Ministry of Health and local hospitals to determine
actual costs incurred during the emergency and a fair method of
reimbursement, the statement said.
	   USAID previously provided money to Oasis Counseling, a partner
to Operation Recovery, to provide immediate assistance to people
affected by the bombing.
	   In addition, President Bill Clinton recently signed legislation
that provides about dlrs 37 million to assist victims and their
families, renovate property damaged in the blast, and aid private
businesses hurt by the bombing.

Arafat pledges to find suicide attackers

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has promised
to find those behind a suicide bombing in the heart of Jerusalem
that killed the two assailants, injured 21 people and jeopardized
the new peace accord.
	   ``We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront
these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,''
Arafat said after Friday's attack on a crowded open-air market
swarming with shoppers readying for the Jewish Sabbath.
	   In a rare direct statement to the Israeli people, Arafat
appeared on Israeli television and urged that the attack not be
allowed to set back peace efforts. He promised to ``exert 100
percent effort'' to track down those involved in planning the
bombing.
	   It was the second suicide bombing since the signing of the
land-for-security accord two weeks ago. On Oct. 29, an activist
from the radical group Hamas activist killed himself and an Israeli
soldier when he tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus
carrying Jewish schoolchildren.
	   Hamas claimed responsibility for Friday's attack, but
Palestinian security officials blamed members of the militant
Islamic Jihad.
	   The officials identified one of the dead assailants as Yusef Ali
Mohammed Zughayar, 18, of Anata, a refugee camp north of Jerusalem,
and the second as Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 23, from a village
outside the West Bank town of Jenin. Both were described as Islamic
Jihad activists.
	   Arafat called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express his
sorrow over Friday's bombing, but Netanyahu's office said the
Israeli leader told Arafat that for the peace process to continue,
the Palestinians would have to significantly step up their war
against terrorists.
	   Israel's Cabinet, which was meeting at the time of the attack,
cut short its debate on ratifying the accord, and did not set a
date for resuming it.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet condemned the attack following its own
meeting Friday night, but said Israel should not use it as an
excuse to halt the peace process.
	   The toll from the attack at the Mahane Yehuda market was far
lighter than might have been expected because the explosives
apparently went off prematurely. Many shoppers in the crowded
market saw smoke and flames coming from the car and fled moments
before the main blast.
	   Suitcases were found in the car's wreckage, Israel radio
reported, suggesting the attackers may have intended to carry
separate parcels of explosives deep into the crowd. That method was
used in an attack at the market 16 months ago that killed the two
suicide bombers and 16 others.
	   Attacks at the market, spread over a poor, predominantly
religious neighborhood, stretch back three decades. Bombings in
1968, 1990 and 1997 have killed 31 Israelis. In between, there have
been numerous stabbings.
	   But Jerusalemites say danger will not keep them away. Mahane
Yehuda's wooden stalls of mango, fresh fish on ice and dried fruits
are part of everyday life in the city.
	   ``We always shopped here and we always will, come what may,''
Shlomo Aviran, 58, said while waiting for his loaf of rye bread to
be sliced at the Habah Bakery. ``I was born and bred in Jerusalem
and I've seen many explosions.''

 &UR; Pakistan pins high hopes on lifting of sanctions &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: CHANGES dateline. ADDS lifting of sanctions likely to save IMF
package for Pakistan &QL; 
 &UR; With US-India-Pakistan &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Battered by international sanctions
that have put Pakistan on the brink of economic collapse,
government officials woke up Saturday to the good news that
Washington had lifted some sanctions.
	   ``I have just heard and we haven't had time to study it, but
this is very good news for us,'' said Ashfaq Ahmed, economic
advisor to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
	   Analysts here said Washington's decision will save a desperately
needed dlrs 5 billion package from the International Monetary Fund,
while market analysts said they hoped the move would boost the
stock market.
	   On Friday U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to lift some of
the sanctions citing a promise by both Pakistan and India not to
conduct further nuclear tests. The sanctions were imposed following
last May's underground nuclear tests by the two often hostile
neighbors.
	   U.S. officials also cited progress by India and Pakistan on
curbing their nuclear weapons program and a promise by both
countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It was not
immediately know which sanctions remain in force.
	   But in newspapers in Pakistan on Saturday, Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad made it clear that Pakistan will not sign the test
ban treaty during Sharif's visit to Washington next month.
	   ``We are not going to sign the CTBT at this moment,'' the
English language daily newspaper The News quoted Ahmed as saying.
	   Pakistan has repeatedly said it would not be ``coerced'' into
signing any international nuclear treaty. The lifting of the
sanctions, however, may be the signal Pakistan needed to sign.
	   For Pakistan the sanctions have been devastating, immediately
jeopardizing critical International Monetary Fund loans and putting
the country precariously on the brink of defaulting on its dlrs 32
billion debt.
	   Less dependent on international aid, the Indian economy has not
been as affected, but Indian foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh
called the reported U.S. step ``positive.''
	   The Indian economy has only recently begun to open up to foreign
investment, and U.S. companies had been eager to do business in a
country with a population approaching 1 billion.
	   Among the sanctions the U.S. official said would be lifted are
prohibitions on participation in U.S. foreign investment and trade
promotion programs. The programs were worth dlrs 300 million to
India before the sanctions were imposed, the official said.
Pakistan did not take part in these programs.
	   ``Washington's decision is an admission such punitive actions
are restricting U.S. diplomacy,'' said Brahma Chellany, at the
Center for Policy research in New Delhi.
	   The U.S. administration also will attempt, on a one-time basis,
to facilitate an agreement between Pakistan and the International
Monetary Fund, the official said.
	   And for Pakistan this is good news.
	   Pakistan is in the middle of negotiating a dlrs 5 billion bail
out package from the IMF, without which the country would be forced
to either declare a moratorium on its debt repayment or outright
default.
	   Foreign exchange reserves are barely dlrs 600 million, which
will pay the bill for roughly one month of imports.
	   Pakistan has withheld millions of dollars in payments to
multilateral donors, including the World Bank. However Pakistan
currently is in the middle of a ``grace period'' that ends within
the next month when payments will have to be made, said western
economists, who wouldn't be identified.
	   Without the IMF package the Pakistan will either default or
declare a moratorium.
	   Ali Hussein, a broker on the Karachi Stock Exchange, said the
U.S. administration decision paves the way for an IMF agreement and
will go a long way to inspiring shattered investor confidence in
Pakistan.
	   ``I think that first of all by lifting of sanctions on Pakistan
there will be a change of perception of foreign investors in
Pakistan,'' he said.
	   ``We're hoping that this will result in an optimistic attitude
by the foreign investor and the stock market will be bullish.''

Taiwan's exports mark further drop in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Reflecting continuing fallout from the
Asian economic crisis, Taiwan recorded a trade deficit in October
that economists say might compel the government to reduce its
economic growth rate estimate of 5.3 percent for the year.
	   Taiwan's trade deficit hit U.S. dlrs 27.4 million last month,
compared with a U.S. dlrs 10.4 billion surplus in the same period a
year ago, the Ministry of Finance said Saturday.
	   Exports plunged 17 percent last month to U.S. dlrs 8.66 billion
against U.S. dlrs 10.4 billion a year ago, the ministry said.
	   Imports also fell to U.S. dlrs 8.69 billion, down from U.S. dlrs
9.38 billion in the same month last year, said the ministry.
	   Taiwan's currency dipped after the announcement, slipping to
32.558 against the U.S. dollar amid low trading volume. A weakened
Japanese yen also weighed on the currency.
	   Economists said the fall in exports could force the government
to cut its estimate of 5.3 percent economic growth for the year.
	   ``The (October trade) figures are not ideal, and it will be
difficult to avoid lowering full-year growth forecasts again,''
said W.P. Chang, director of planning at the cabinet's Council for
Economic Planning and Development.
	   Though buoyed by U.S. dlrs 83 billion in foreign exchange
reserves and little government debt, Taiwan has suffered over the
past year from a drastic decline in exports amid evaporating
markets and heightened competition. The island recorded its first
quarterly trade deficit in 17 years over the first three months of
the year, before a slight recovery.
	   October exports fell in all major markets except Europe. Sales
to that region posted a 1 percent increase to U.S. dlrs 1.63
billion, accounting for 19 percent of all exports.
	   Exports to the United States fell 7.7 percent to U.S. dlrs 2.43
billion, while Hong Kong bought U.S. dlrs 1.85 billion in Taiwanese
goods last month, a 25 percent drop from a year ago. Japan
purchased U.S. dlrs 704 million, a 20 percent drop. The United
States and Hong Kong, through which most of Taiwan's exports to
China transit, account for almost half of all Taiwanese exports.
	   Imports from Japan fell 12 percent to U.S. dlrs 2.24 billion
from U.S. dlrs 2.53 in October 1993, while Taiwan bought 18 percent
less from the U.S. last month than a year ago, or U.S. dlrs 1.43
billion, down from U.S. dlrs 1.74 billion. The U.S. and Japan
accounted for 42 percent of all imports purchased by Taiwan last
month.
	   European imports, though, rose 22 percent last month to U.S.
dlrs 1.86 billion, accounting for 21 percent of all the island's
imports.

Tajikistan troops surround rebel forces in northern towns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By UMED BABAKHANOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops have encircled
bands of rebel fighters in two northern outposts and appeared
poised Saturday to put down the latest revolt in the restive
Central Asian nation.
	   More than 200 combatants and civilians have been killed since
the rebels launched raids in the northern part of the country
Wednesday, renewing concerns about the government's ability to
maintain order.
	   After suffering losses at the beginning of the fighting, the
government forces have surrounded the rebels in the northern city
of Khudzhand and the village of Aini, news reports said.
	   In Khudzhand, the site of the first attack on Wednesday, about
40 rebels were holed up in an old fortress in the city center.
Government troops have retaken the rest of the city, but have not
attempted to storm the fortress because it is well fortified and
the rebels were holding captured soldiers as hostages, official
said.
	   Khudzhand is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the
capital Dushanbe.
	   Meanwhile, government forces have surrounded a second group of
rebels, numbering 200 to 300 in Aini, a village about 160
kilometers (100 miles) north of the capital, presidential spokesman
Zafar Saidov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies
reported.
	   The rebels are led by former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, who
has demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov free all political
prisoners and bring his supporters into the government. Rakhmonov
firmly ruled out any talks with the rebels, saying the government
will destroy or capture them all.
	   Khudoberdyev claimed his guerrillas had mined the dam on the
Kairakkhum reservoir, and threatened to set off explosions that
would ``flood vast territories of Central Asia.''
	   The Kairakkhum reservoir is so large it is referred to locally
as a ``sea.'' But the government said army forces were protecting
the dam and it was not in danger of sabotage.
	   A peace treaty signed last year formally ended five years of
civil war between Rakhmonov's hardline, secular government and the
mostly Muslim opposition. The main opposition groups are now
participating in the government and the armed forces.
	   However, a number of warlords have refused to recognize the
peace deal and periodically launch small-scale rebellions. The war,
which began shortly after the country received independence from
the Soviet Union, has badly damaged the economy in the poor,
mountainous nation.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ About 15 U.N. weapons inspectors _ some of
them experts on missiles _ were leaving Baghdad Saturday in the
first stage of the U.N. reduction of its teams in Iraq.
	   The withdrawal comes a week after Iraq said it was halting all
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM here, said the monitors
leaving Saturday included six who were ``a visiting missile team
that just happened to be here when Iraq made its announcement.''
	   ``The support staff is staying in place,'' Ms. Cross said.
``They have the qualifications to resume work immediately should
Iraq have a change of heart.''
	   She said ``about 15'' staffers are expected to fly to Bahrain on
a U.N. plane from an air base outside Baghdad.
	   The experts are among 26 people that UNSCOM has decided to
withdraw from its staff of about 120 to 140. The decision announced
Friday was in response to Iraq's Oct. 31 announcement banning all
spot inspections and monitoring.
	   It is not known when the other inspectors will leave.
	   The United Nations Security Council condemned Iraq's move in a
resolution Thursday, but the council remains divided on whether to
authorize military strikes as favored by the United States and
Britain.
	   There has so far been no official response by Iraq on the
resolution. However, Iraq's government newspaper, Al-Jumhouriya,
dismissed it as a ``conspiracy'' to prolong U.N. sanctions.
	   On Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen returned from a
tour of Arab nations and Turkey, saying he was satisfied the United
States would have adequate support from Arab allies to carry out
military action.
	   But comments made by officials in the region indicate that the
Arabs may be against another war.
	   Iraq's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement Friday that any
armed actions are ``fraught with most unpredictable consequences
for peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a
whole.''
	   Iraq has said it will resume cooperation with UNSCOM only if the
Security Council gives a timetable for the lifting of the sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, however, cannot be lifted until UNSCOM says Iraq
is free of all weapons of mass destruction. Iraq also had a
suspected nuclear program, which is now believed to be dismantled.
	   The Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency
deals with Iraq's compliance on nuclear issues, and its monitors
have not been banned by Iraq.
	   Cross, the UNSCOM spokeswoman, said a nuclear team went into the
field to continue monitoring work Saturday. No details were
available.
	   Meanwhile, Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Baghdad, said the Security Council
has asked Annan to help resolve the standoff. Annan signed an
agreement with Iraq on Feb. 23 to end a previous crisis over
inspections of presidential palaces.

Singapore union chief: workers should expect a 15 percent pay cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore workers should brace themselves for a
15 percent pay reduction as part of business cost cutting measures
to be unveiled by the government soon, reported state-run
television Saturday.
	   The overall 15 reduction would include a proposed 50 percent cut
in employer's mandatory contributions to the workers' pension fund,
said National Trades Union Congress chief Lim Boon Heng late
Friday.
	   Lim, who is also a cabinet minister, said Singaporeans must
reduce their financial expectations because of the country's
economic slowdown, which has already led to a record level of lay
offs and falling salaries.
	   Singapore is one of the most affluent places in Asia, and in
recent years, its average annual per capita income has placed it
among the ten most prosperous countries in the world.
	   But the regional crisis has led to a real threat of recession
here after years of strong growth, rising salaries and low
unemployment. Singapore just posted its first quarterly economic
contraction in 13 years.
	   The city-state relies largely on foreign demand for its goods
and services, and since operating expenses have risen to levels
much higher than its competitors, Singapore has targeted business
costs.
	   A government panel is due to release recommendations on November
11 that are widely expected to focus on slashing labor costs,
principally through lower salaries and pension payments.
	   But employers ``must not only look at wage cuts to bring
companies to a competitive level,'' said Lim. ``They must also look
at other costs that they can trim'' in addition to government
action to lower fees, levies and other charges.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ About 15 U.N. weapons inspectors _ some of
them experts on missiles _ were leaving Baghdad Saturday in the
first stage of the U.N. reduction of its teams in Iraq.
	   The withdrawal comes a week after Iraq said it was halting all
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM here, said the monitors
leaving Saturday included six who were ``a visiting missile team
that just happened to be here when Iraq made its announcement.''
	   ``The support staff is staying in place,'' Ms. Cross said.
``They have the qualifications to resume work immediately should
Iraq have a change of heart.''
	   She said ``about 15'' staffers are expected to fly to Bahrain on
a U.N. plane from an air base outside Baghdad.
	   The experts are among 26 people that UNSCOM has decided to
withdraw from its staff of about 120 to 140. The decision announced
Friday was in response to Iraq's Oct. 31 announcement banning all
spot inspections and monitoring.
	   It is not known when the other inspectors will leave.
	   The United Nations Security Council condemned Iraq's move in a
resolution Thursday, but the council remains divided on whether to
authorize military strikes as favored by the United States and
Britain.
	   There has so far been no official response by Iraq on the
resolution. However, Iraq's government newspaper, Al-Jumhouriya,
dismissed it as a ``conspiracy'' to prolong U.N. sanctions.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Islamic militants are pulling out all the stops
to keep the new U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace accord from
becoming reality.
	   In recent days, suicide bombers have attacked an Israeli school
bus in the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem's outdoor market. Last month,
grenades were hurled at a bus stop in the southern city of
Beersheba.
	   But the failure of those attacks and others to inflict major
casualties marks a change from past terrorist spectacles and is an
indication that Israeli and Palestinian efforts may have already
weakened the militants.
	   In Friday's market attack _ which was initially claimed by the
largest militant group, Hamas, but later blamed on activists from
the smaller Islamic Jihad group _ Israel radio quoted police as
describing the explosives as an ``amateur bomb.'' It killed the two
bombers and injured 21 Israelis.
	   Yaakov Perry, former head of the Israeli Shin Bet, told The
Associated Press that raids by Israeli agents and, in recent weeks,
by Palestinian security forces as well have led to the arrest of
key leaders and the killing of expert bombmakers.
	   ``There is a weakness both in the explosives used and the
engineers, the experts who can put together the bomb, and there is
also a problem in the quality of the terrorist themselves,'' he
said, adding recent attackers appeared poorly trained.
	   Abdel-Satter Qassem, a professor at An Najah University in the
West Bank town of Nablus who is familiar with the thinking of the
Islamic leadership, said Friday's attack came in response to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's recent crackdown on the
radicals.
	   As part of that campaign, Hamas founder and spiritual leader,
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was placed under house arrest last week.
	   ``It is a message (to Arafat) that if you are going to keep your
promises to the Israelis and hit hard on Islamists there will be a
response that will curb your efforts to reach agreement with
Israel,'' Qassem said.
	   He said last week's Gaza car bomb that narrowly missed a school
bus with 40 children aboard was in response to Israel's killing of
two Hamas leaders, Adel and Imad Awadallah in September, and the
death of master bomb maker Mohiyedine Sharif in March.
	   Perry and another former Shin Bet chief, Carmi Gilon, said the
Israeli Cabinet decision to suspend consideration of the Mideast
peace deal reached at the Wye summit in Maryland was a mistake that
only encouraged Hamas and other groups.
	   Gilon said the aim of the militants was to ``ruin the whole
process. I'm just sorry our Cabinet made such a decision which is
exactly the aim of Hamas _ to stop Wye.''
	   In 1995 and 1996, a series of suicide-bombings by Islamic
militants claimed scores of Israeli lives and halted the peace
process, bringing to power the hard-line government of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Arafat's police rounded up the
militants then, but the activists were later released from jail.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said it was impossible
to continue the troop withdrawal process because Arafat's forces
were doing so little.
	   He predicted that the militants would keep attacking until
Arafat's police uprooted the sources of support _ including
charities that collected money, teachers that recruited the youth
and clergy who encouraged attacks. He said Israel was merely lucky
that recent attacks hadn't claimed more casualties.
	   ``We can't rely any longer on miracles. We have to have some
action on the part of the Palestinian Authority,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   At a rally in the Gaza Strip several hours after Friday's market
bombing, a former Hamas activist who is now in Arafat's Cabinet
said Netanyahu's policies, such as building Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, were to blame for the attacks.
	   ``We want to tell him that if you put pressure on the
Palestinian people and against the Palestinian organizations, those
groups will point their arrows against you,'' Communications
Minister Imad Falouji told the crowd.
	   Falouji shared a platform with Abdallah Shami, leader of the
Islamic Jihad, a militant group sponsored by Iran, who affirmed
``our right to fight the occupiers as our religion and laws
dictate.''
	   Many in the crowd cheered.

Kuwait to buy 48 American howitzers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait has decided to buy U.S.-made howitzers, the
U.S. ambassador announced Saturday, confirming a controversial deal
for 48 cannons that many lawmakers say are unsuitable for the
emirate's tiny army.
	   Ambassador James Larocco said the Paladin M-109, 155mm
self-propelled artillery pieces will be custom built for Kuwait by
a U.S. firm, United Defense, over the next several years. He gave
no details but the Pentagon had said previously that Kuwait was
planning to buy 48 howitzers for about dlrs 496 million.
	   The guns will have a 52-caliber barrel with a range of 40
kilometers (25 miles), and will employ the U.S. Army's most
advanced fire control system, Larocco said in a statement.
	   Howitzers are short cannons, larger than mortars, and fire
shells in a high arc.
	   The Paladin howitzers will be ``updated to respond to (Kuwait's)
unique requirements,'' Larocco's statement said without
elaborating.
	   A number of lawmakers in Kuwait's 50-seat parliament believe the
government has disregarded expert opinion that the guns were
unsuitable for Kuwait's armed forces. It is not known what the
experts have said about the guns and the lawmakers have not
elaborated.
	   Legislator Mubarak al-Duwailah, a Muslim fundamentalist, has
also accused the defense ministry of wasting public money on the
deal to please the United States, Kuwait's main Gulf War ally.
	   Shortly after the 1991 war that ended a seven-month Iraqi
occupation of this Gulf country, Kuwait signed a 10-year defense
agreement with Washington. The pact calls for weapons purchases and
continuous war games.
	   Kuwait signed similar agreements with its other allies, Britain,
France and Russia.
	   It has been rebuilding its small armed forces that was shattered
by the Iraqi occupation.

Prince Charles declares admiration of queen, denies abdication
</HEADLINE>
claim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles, angered by a claim that he wanted
his mother to abdicate, has issued a strong denial and an unusually
personal statement of his respect for her.
	   ``The queen will always have my abiding admiration and affection
and any suggestion that I wish Her Majesty to abdicate is utterly
ludicrous,'' the heir to throne said in response to a press release
about a TV documentary to be broadcast Sunday.
	   Prince Charles, who is traveling in Bulgaria, responded Friday
evening to the publicity for London Weekend Television's
documentary marking his 50th birthday Nov. 14.
	   The producers stood by their report and said it was based on
briefings by a senior palace aide.
	   The prince's statement, issued through Buckingham Palace and his
own St. James's Palace office, said he telephoned the queen to say
how distressed he was about the report.
	   Members of the royal family rarely speak publicly about each
other in such personal terms. They also rarely issue statements in
the first person, preferring to have a spokesman make comments on
their behalf.
	   Prince Charles rejected the suggestion by LWT that he would be
privately ``delighted if the queen were to abdicate.''
	   ``The claims made in LWT's press notice are not only deeply
offensive but completely wrong. They in no way reflect my views,''
he said.
	   ``I begin to tire of needing to issue denials of false stories
about all manner of thoughts which I am alleged to be having,'' he
said.
	   ``Some stories are so preposterous that they barely warrant a
denial. However, others are both so outrageous and hurtful to my
family, to the monarchy and to me personally, that they demand a
response,'' his statement said.
	   ``This country and the Commonwealth are served by an outstanding
monarch. There is no one with a greater sense of duty and loyalty
than the queen. She is an example to us all and I find these
comments such as these abhorrent.''
	   ``This is yet another example of people trying to create
divisions in my family where they do not exist. It may successfully
boost viewing figures but it is wrong.''
	   Two weeks ago Prince Charles and his longtime love Camilla
Parker Bowles jointly stated that they were not involved ``in any
way'' in a new book that criticizes Princess Diana and purports to
be based on interviews with his friends, family and aides.
	   A spokeswoman for LWT said the producers of the documentary
stood by the program and that it was based on four briefings with a
senior palace aide.
	   ``We specifically asked for information on the Prince of Wales's
thinking on the future of the monarchy. ... The key points in the
briefing were reiterated at least twice and were checked again as
recently as this week,'' the unidentified spokeswoman said.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The father of one of the Islamic militants who
died in the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market said
Saturday he was sad about his son's death but proud of what he had
done.
	   Friday's bombing at the open-air Mahane Yehuda market killed the
two assailants, injured 21 Israelis and jeopardized the 2-week-old
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised to track down the
masterminds of the bombing and urged that it not be allowed to set
back the new land-for-security agreement.
	   ``We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront
these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,''
Arafat said after the attack on the market, which was swarming with
shoppers readying for the Jewish Sabbath.
	   In a rare direct statement to the Israeli people, Arafat
appeared on Israeli TV and promised to ``exert 100 percent effort''
to catch and punish those who had planned the bombing.
	   The radical group Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack,
but Palestinian security officials blamed members of the militant
Islamic Jihad.
	   One of the dead bombers was identified as Yusef Ali Mohammed
Zughayar, who lived in an Israeli-controlled area north of
Jerusalem. His family said he was 22 and acknowledged he was active
in Islamic Jihad.
	   Palestinian security officials said the other was Suleiman Musa
Dahayneh, 23, from a village outside the West Bank town of Jenin.
	   At Zughayar's house near the Anata refugee camp, dozens of
friends and relatives gathered Saturday to mourn, although they
could not hold a funeral because the body had not been handed over
by Israeli authorities.
	   ``I didn't raise him to lose him like that,'' said Zughayar's
54-year-old father, Mohammed. ``I'm proud, but I'm sad because I
loved my son.''
	   Friday's attack was the second suicide bombing since the signing
of the peace accord on Oct. 23.
	   On Oct. 29, an activist from Hamas killed himself and an Israeli
soldier when he tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus
carrying Jewish schoolchildren.
	   Arafat called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express
sorrow over Friday's bombing, but the Israeli leader told him that
for the peace process to continue, the Palestinians would have to
significantly step up their war against terrorists.
	   Israel's Cabinet, which was meeting at the time of the attack,
cut short its debate on ratifying the accord, and did not set a
date for resuming it.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet condemned the attack following its own
meeting Friday night, but said Israel should not use it as an
excuse to halt the peace process.
	   The toll from the attack at the Mahane Yehuda market was far
lighter than might have been expected because the explosives
apparently went off prematurely. Many shoppers in the crowded
market saw smoke and flames coming from the car and fled moments
before the main blast.
	   Suitcases were found in the car's wreckage, Israel radio
reported, suggesting the attackers may have intended to carry
separate parcels of explosives deep into the crowd.
	   That method was used in an attack at the market 16 months ago
that killed the two suicide bombers and 16 others.

Kenyan police arrest businessman over forgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A prominent businessman with close ties to
President Daniel arap Moi's ruling party was arrested by fraud
investigators.
	   Banking Fraud Investigations Department refused to specify the
reason for the arrest of Kamlesh Pattni on Friday.
	   Pattni is involved in two lawsuits.
	   In a trial that resumed in March, Pattni is charged with
fraudulently obtaining 5.8 billion Kenya shillings (dlrs 83 million
at 1992-93 rates) from the Central Bank of Kenya as compensation
for gold, diamonds and other jewels allegedly exported from Kenya
by his firm, Goldenberg International.
	   Kenya has no gold or diamond reserves.
	   Impatient with the government's failure to prosecute the case,
which has been on the books since late 1993, and its reluctance to
tackle graft in the top echelons of the government, the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank last year stopped
multimillion dollar loans to Kenya.
	   Pattni also is involved in a court dispute over the ownership of
duty-free shops at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi,
and Moi International Airport, Mombasa.
	   Nassir Ibrahim Alif, chairman of World Duty Free, alleges Pattni
forged letters, signatures and company seals to fraudulently sell
the shops.

WWF urges Japan to stop ``scientific'' whaling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLAND, Switzerland (AP) _ The World Wide Fund for Nature has
renewed its criticism of Japan's whaling, saying the purchase of a
new multi-million dollar catcher boat proves it isn't just
interested in scientific research.
	   The Japanese fleet _ a factory ship with three catcher boats and
one sighting boat _ has just departed for its annual hunt in the
Antarctic region. Last season it caught 438 minke whales in the
area.
	   ``The launch of this new boat shows Japanese research whaling is
becoming more aggressive,'' said WWF's Cassandra Phillips in a
statement issued Friday.
	   The International Whaling Commission has declared the Southern
Ocean a whale sanctuary. It has condemned Japan for whaling under
the guise of ``research programs.''
	   The whaling commission banned commercial whaling worldwide in
1986.
	   The Japanese government and fishing industry argues it needs to
continue the hunt for scientific purposes. Whale meat is popular in
Japan.

German conservatives look to renewal after election defeat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kohl speech. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Helmut Kohl bid a teary-eyed farewell as
leader of Germany's conservative Christian Democrats on Saturday
after guiding the party to its worst showing in a national election
in nearly a half-century.
	   Kohl's sentimental speech to about 1,000 party delegates
launched them into their new role as German opposition after the
defeat in Sept. 27 elections that unseated the chancellor after a
record 16 years in office.
	   Later, the party was expected to elect Kohl's hand-picked
successor, Wolfgang Schaeuble, as chairman, with the former
chancellor giving up the post he held for 25 years.
	   Tears glistened on Kohl's jowls as one of his closest aides,
former Labor Minister Norbert Bluem, praised his greatest
achievement _ seizing the chance for German unification in 1990
after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
	   For his part, Kohl accused Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's new
government of hewing to the left despite campaigning on a centrist
platform. Unapologetic, he blamed his defeat on Germans unsettled
by ``the dynamism of global change'' who had voted for a stronger
government role in the economy.
	   ``These parties offer the easier, more comfortable way,'' he
asserted. ``Our course will prove to be the right one, and we will
fight to make the majority of voters recognize this.''
	   He urged his party to stay true to its principles, including the
free market, a commitment to social justice rooted in Christianity,
and European unity.
	   ``Let us not give in to pressure to run after changing trends of
political fashion,'' he said. ``We need a renewal that will bear
new fruit _ not one that rips out the roots.''
	   Kohl smiled and waved from the podium as delegates gave him a
final, five-minute standing ovation.
	   The one-day meeting is part of the nation's farewell to its
longest-serving chancellor this century, whose bulky presence
defined German politics from Oct. 1, 1982 until his defeat by
Schroeder, a Social Democrat, six weeks ago.
	   Schaeuble, a Kohl protege, is the point man for rejuvenating and
modernizing the party after its worst showing in a national
election in 49 years. A series of state elections next year will
test the party's chances of survival.
	   ``One should not have any illusions about the enormity of the
challenge,'' he said recently.
	   Schaeuble, 56, has been in a wheelchair since being shot by an
apparently deranged man while campaigning in 1990.
	   With Kohl gone, the gates have been opened for a group of young
dissenters who lay the party's election defeat at his feet, saying
he lost touch with the national mood by pushing historic goals such
as unification and a single European Union currency.
	   Known as the ``Wild Youth,'' many in their 40s, they chafed
under the 68-year-old Kohl's iron-fisted hold on the party and now
want a piece of the leadership pie.
	   One of them, the party chief in Lower Saxony, 39-year-old
Christian Wulff, is expected to be elected to one of the four
deputy chairmanships. Most other top leadership posts are also
being cleared for fresher faces.

Mubarak says peace unlikely under Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's president says there is ``virtually
nobody'' who believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
will implement the latest peace deal with Palestinians.
	   In an interview published Saturday, President Hosni Mubarak said
if Netanyahu wants to change that perception he must boldly face
the setback to peace caused by Friday's car bombing in Jerusalem
that killed the two bombers and injured 21.
	   ``I tell the Israelis that the solution does not lie in freezing
negotiations,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying by the government-run
Egyptian Mail newspaper.
	   Mubarak is a key player in Middle East peace negotiations and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat regularly consults him. Mubarak's
comments reflect the popular Arab feeling that Israel is insincere
about peace, and that it only looks for excuses to retain control
over West Bank.
	   Mubarak said explosions are a worldwide occurrence. But ``does
life come to a halt? On the contrary. The peace foes who are many
should be denied the chance,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Following Friday's bombing, Netanyahu's right-wing Cabinet
suspended the ratification of an interim peace deal he reached last
month with Arafat at Wye River in the United States.
	   Under the accord, Israel agreed to relinquish a further 13
percent of the West Bank and Arafat promised to develop a plan to
uproot terrorists on Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   Mubarak said that even as the accord was signed Oct. 23 he was
cautioning that implementation of the deal was more important than
words.
	   ``This is because I felt apprehensive what occurred (in
Jerusalem) would happen,'' he said.
	   However, that is no reason to go back on the accord, he said.
	   ``I tell ... Netanyahu that there is virtually nobody who trusts
that you will carry out the Wye River accord. Should you want to
change this perception, you have to take the initiative and make
practical steps to comply with ... the agreement,'' Mubarak was
quoted as saying.
	   Failure to do so will only ensure recurrence of violence, he
said.
	   ``The Palestinians are beset with frustrations from all sides.
So when a ray of hope appears for them on the horizon, they should
be supported, not the other way round,'' he said.
	   On normalizing Arab-Israeli ties, Mubarak said the two peoples
should accept the idea first before anything is imposed by
``supreme decrees.''
	   And people can only be won over by ``sowing the seeds of trust,
by handing over land to their rightful owners and respecting
treaties and accords.'' he said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 15 inspectors scheduled to leave; newspaper
comment; Annan asked by Security Council to help resolve crisis &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ About 15 U.N. weapons inspectors _ some of
them experts on missiles _ were leaving Baghdad Saturday in the
first stage of the U.N. reduction of its teams in Iraq.
	   The withdrawal comes a week after Iraq said it was halting all
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM here, said the monitors
leaving Saturday included six who were ``a visiting missile team
that just happened to be here when Iraq made its announcement.''
	   ``The support staff is staying in place,'' Ms. Cross said.
``They have the qualifications to resume work immediately should
Iraq have a change of heart.''
	   She said ``about 15'' staffers are expected to fly to Bahrain on
a U.N. plane from an air base outside Baghdad.
	   The experts are among 26 people that UNSCOM has decided to
withdraw from its staff of about 120 to 140. The decision announced
Friday was in response to Iraq's Oct. 31 announcement banning all
spot inspections and monitoring.
	   It is not known when the other inspectors will leave.
	   The United Nations Security Council condemned Iraq's move in a
resolution Thursday, but the council remains divided on whether to
authorize military strikes as favored by the United States and
Britain.
	   There has so far been no official response by Iraq on the
resolution. However, Iraq's government newspaper, Al-Jumhouriya,
dismissed it as a ``conspiracy'' to prolong U.N. sanctions.
	   On Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen returned from a
tour of Arab nations and Turkey, saying he was satisfied the United
States would have adequate support from Arab allies to carry out
military action.
	   But comments made by officials in the region indicate that the
Arabs may be against another war.
	   Iraq's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement Friday that any
armed actions are ``fraught with most unpredictable consequences
for peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a
whole.''
	   Iraq has said it will resume cooperation with UNSCOM only if the
Security Council gives a timetable for the lifting of the sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, however, cannot be lifted until UNSCOM says Iraq
is free of all weapons of mass destruction. Iraq also had a
suspected nuclear program, which is now believed to be dismantled.
	   The Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency
deals with Iraq's compliance on nuclear issues, and its monitors
have not been banned by Iraq.
	   Cross, the UNSCOM spokeswoman, said a nuclear team went into the
field to continue monitoring work Saturday. No details were
available.
	   Meanwhile, Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Baghdad, said the Security Council
has asked Annan to help resolve the standoff. Annan signed an
agreement with Iraq on Feb. 23 to end a previous crisis over
inspections of presidential palaces.

Kane surges ahead in penultimate U.S. LPGA event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANNO, Japan (AP) _ Canadian Lorie Kane posted her career-best
score of 8-under-par 64 Saturday and surged ahead for a one-shot
lead going into the final round of the dlrs 800,000 Japan Classic
golf tournament.
	   Kane, starting five strokes off the pace, sank nine birdies,
including four straight from No. 13, against a lone bogey, en route
to a 10-under 134 total over the twisty 6,338-yard (5,768-meter),
par-72 Musashigaoka Golf Club course near Tokyo.
	   She had a previous low career round of 65 in the third round of
the 1997 State Farm Rail Classic.
	   ``I was pleased with the round today,'' said Kane, seeking her
first LPGA title since turning professional in 1993. ``I was
putting well and I was hitting the ball right.''
	   Taiwanese Huang Yu-chen shot a 68 and kept her position in
second place with a 135 total for the tournament, the next-to-last
official U.S. LPGA event of the year.
	   Japanese star Hiromi Kobayashi, winner of the Rainbow Foods LPGA
Classic in August, fired her second straight 68 and was alone in
third at 136.
	   Lisa Walters and Helen Alfredsson each shot a 67 and tied for
fourth at 138.
	   LPGA Hall of Famer Betsy King also turned in a 67 and shared
sixth at 139 with Kris Tschetter, Megumi Matsuo and overnight
leader Tina Barrett. Tschetter and Matsuo went around in 69, while
Barrett struggled to a 74.
	   Defending champion Liselotte Neumann of Sweden shot her second
straight 72 for a share of 27th at 144.
	   Akiko Fukushima, Japan's top money winner in the last two
seasons, fired a fat 76 for 149. She has just qualified for the
U.S. tour.
	   The Japan Classic is a limited-field event featuring 45 of the
top players from the U.S. LPGA Tour and 38 members of the Japan
LPGA Tour.
	   Of the field of 83, Janice Moodie and eight players from the
Japan tour failed to qualify for the final round. It took a 149 to
survive the cut.
	   Annika Sorenstam, who leads the race for U.S. LPGA's Player of
the Year points and the season money list, has skipped the
tournament.
	   So did rookie sensation Pak Se-ri, who has already clinched the
1998 Rolex Rookie of the Year honors. She was forced to withdraw
due to illness and fatigue.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Fifteen U.N. weapons inspectors _ some of
them experts on missiles _ were leaving Baghdad Saturday in the
first stage of the U.N. reduction of its teams in Iraq.
	   The withdrawal comes a week after Iraq said it was halting all
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   In response, UNSCOM said Friday it will withdraw 26 people from
its staff of about 120 to 140.
	   Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters that Iraq's
position on halting cooperation ``still stands.''
	   He was the first Cabinet minister to comment publicly since a
Security Council resolution Thursday called the Iraqi position a
``flagrant violation'' of previous U.N. resolutions, and urged Iraq
to allow UNSCOM work.
	   Iraq says inspections can resume only if the Council gives a
timetable for the lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait. But sanctions can't be lifted until UNSCOM
certifies Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM here, said the 15 experts
leaving Saturday included four based in Baghdad and 11 who were on
a special assignment. The 11 included some six members of a missile
team.
	   ``A visiting missile team ... just happened to be here when Iraq
made its announcement,'' she said.
	   ``The support staff is staying in place,'' Ms. Cross said.
``They have the qualifications to resume work immediately should
Iraq have a change of heart.''
	   The experts drove out of the U.N. headquarters for an air base
outside Baghdad from where they will fly to Bahrain.
	   More inspectors will leave Monday and Wednesday, Ms. Cross said.
	   The standoff has raised fears of a military strike by the United
States and Britain.
	   On Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen returned from a
tour of Arab nations and Turkey, saying he was satisfied the United
States would have adequate support from Arab allies to carry out
military action.
	   But other members of the Security Council oppose military
strikes.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement Friday that
armed actions are ``fraught with most unpredictable consequences
for peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a
whole.''
	   Besides UNSCOM, experts from the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency are also in Iraq, dealing with
its compliance on nuclear issues. IAEA monitors have not been
banned by Iraq.
	   Cross, the UNSCOM spokeswoman, said a nuclear team went into the
field to continue monitoring work Saturday. No details were
available.
	   Meanwhile, Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Baghdad, said the Security Council
has asked Annan to help resolve the standoff. Annan signed an
agreement with Iraq on Feb. 23 to end a previous crisis over
inspections of presidential palaces.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ After a tumultuous homecoming visit,
LPGA rookie star Se Ri Pak left for the United States on Saturday
to prepare for the Tour Championship tournament.
	   The 21-year-old South Korean returned home to a hero's welcome
on Oct. 27. But Pak came down with a flu and exhaustion and was
hospitalized for four days after she was besieged by the media and
an unending round of promotional events for her corporate sponsor
Samsung.
	   Pak was forced to skip this weekend's Japan Classic golf
tournament. Instead she has rested at her parents' home in Seoul
since Wednesday and spent time together with friends ``shopping and
gossiping.''
	   ``While in hospital bed, I thought much about what it is like to
be a public figure,'' Pak told journalists before boarding a plane
bound for Los Angles.
	   ``My condition is not perfect but is fairly good. I will go into
the last LPGA tournament with no big expectations, but I will do my
best,'' she added.
	   The Tour Championship is the last LPGA event of this year. Pak
has only a slim chance of beating Annika Sorenstam in the Player of
the Year points race.
	   A victory at the Tour Championship is worth 60 points and Pak is
about 40 points behind Sorenstam.
	   On Friday, Pak received South Korea's second highest sports
medal from President Kim Dae-jung.
	   Pak rose to fame after winning four LPGA tournaments, including
the U.S. Women's Open and the LPGA Championship, in the best LPGA
rookie year since Nancy Lopez debuted in 1978.

	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ When the assets of the National Herald go
up for sale next week, among the momentos from the once illustrious
newspaper will be a table and chair used by a noted reporter,
Jawaharlal Nehru.
	   A court has ordered the paper and its sister publications to
sell off their stocks to pay three years of accumulated electricity
and telephone bills, the salaries of 538 employees that have gone
unpaid for 22 months, and other debts totaling 60 million rupees
(dlrs 1.43 million). An auction was scheduled for Nov. 9.
	   It's a sad end to a paper venerated by many Indians as a weapon
in their independence fight against Britain, and which was the
proud organ of the Congress Party when Nehru was the unchallenged
leader of the party and the nation.
	   The National Herald is the flagship of Associated Journals Ltd.,
which also owns a Hindi- and an Urdu-language daily. All three
papers shut down in Lucknow two months ago, but the New Delhi
edition of the English paper still prints about 500 copies daily.
	   The group is run by a trust founded by Nehru and now controlled
by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of Nehru's grandson Rajiv Gandhi and
current head of the Congress Party.
	   ``The newspapers' employees are starving and had approached the
High Court, which ordered the state government of auction off the
movable properties,'' said Shyama Charan Tiwari, an editor of the
Hindi-language Navjeevan.
	   An auction notice was posted on the imposing gates of the
colonial-era four-story office of Associated Journals announcing
the sale of furniture, rare books and manuscripts, as well as
computers and laser printers.
	   The National Herald was founded in Lucknow in 1938 by two
prominent members of the Congress Party, which was the engine of
India's independence movement. The headquarters shifted to New
Delhi, 410 kilometers (255 miles) to the west, in 1963.
	   ``Whenever Nehru was in Lucknow, he would write out news reports
on meetings held by Congress leaders or articles of India's freedom
struggle in his own hand while sitting among other sub editors and
reporters,'' said Gurcharan Rai, who at 71 is one of the paper's
oldest employees.
	   Although the paper had a pro-national line, it remained
editorially independent until the early 1970's, when Nehru's
daughter and political heir, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, used it
for her own agenda. Circulation began to fall.
	   The paper was threatened with closure once before. An auction
was due to be held in 1987, but it was scheduled for the birthday
of then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi _Indira's son.
	   As a birthday gift, Congress leaders collected the money to pay
enough bills to keep the paper going.

Eight more suspected killers lynched by mobs in Java
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with latest killings of three others

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs have lynched eight people
suspected of taking part in the murders of dozens of Muslim clerics
and others accused of dabbling in black magic, official and news
reports said Saturday.
	   Police said three men were beaten to death Saturday by
vigilantes in Pemalang, 350 kilometers (218 miles) east of Jakarta.
The attackers allegedly believed the three were the mysterious
serial killers. Two others, who managed to escape, were under
police protection.
	   Two villagers were arrested on suspicion of carrying out the
attacks but were later released for ``security reasons'' after a
mob of hundreds, sympathetic to the alleged murderers, protested
the arrests, said Lt. Col. Suyadi, chief of the local military.
	   The mob gathered after the two other suspected serial killers
escaped from the vigilantes, said a police officer. He added that
the mob attacked a police station before being dispersed.
	   Police fired warning shots and tear gas to disperse the
protesters.
	   ``Fortunately, I and (Islamic) preachers were able to persuade
the mob, saying lootings and burnings are prohibited by Islamic
teachings,'' said Suyadi. ``We told them that lootings and burning
were prohibited in Islam.''
	   The killings brought to eight the number dead in revenge attacks
by vigilantes in the province since Thursday.
	   In other revenge attacks, vigilantes killed five people in three
separate locations in Central Java, reported The Jakarta Post
newspaper.
	   Two men and one woman killed in the attacks were mentally ill,
the report said.
	   ``This has gone too far,'' said Col. Monang Manulang, police
chief of Jepara district, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of
Jakarta, where two of the victims were killed.
	   ``People do need to secure their villages, but killing mentally
ill people? Residents should not take the law into their own
hands,'' he said.
	   Vigilantes have taken to the streets on the main island of Java
after the murders of more than 150 Muslim clerics.
	   Fear prevails in many small towns, where mobs have lynched
people suspected of carrying out the murders. In many areas,
mentally ill people have become scapegoats.
	   Muslim leaders have warned that they will deploy their own
civilian security forces if the military is unable to restore
order.
	   News reports said the Central Java police have rounded up some
200 mentally ill and homeless people to prevent them from being
lynched by mobs.

Second day of talks could begin hard bargaining
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ South African and Caribbean officials were
expected to begin hard bargaining Saturday with West Indian
cricketers over a pay dispute threatening a historic tour of the
republic.
	   Informal talks Friday broke off with no indication of progress.
Ali Bacher, the head of South African cricket, maintained the key
could be a letter from South African President Nelson Mandela
urging compromise.
	   ``He (Mandela) conveyed the importance of this tour to our
country,'' Bacher said. ``He asked that the parties concerned
compromise, show goodwill, good intent and come to an amicable
solution which will ensure the tour takes place.''
	   Bacher arrived from South Africa Friday for the emergency talks
being held at a hotel near London's Heathrow airport accompanied by
Clive Lloyd, manager of the the West Indies touring squad, and West
Indies Cricket Board member Joel Garner.
	   Bacher said it might take until Sunday to resolve the deadlock,
which sees the players battling the West Indies Cricket Board over
pay for the tour and reported security concerns.
	   The WICB on Wednesday fired captain Brian Lara and vice-captain
Carl Hooper after they refused to travel to South Africa.
	   Reported solutions include more prize money, increased meal
money, and the reinstatement of Lara and Hopper to the squad. There
are also suggestions Courtney Walsh would be named captain with
players saying off the record they'll hold out as long as it takes.
	   Bacher admits he's relying heavily on Mandela's letter to pull
off the West Indies' first official tour of South Africa since the
end of apartheid.
	   ``I'm sure the letter from the president will have a great
impression on the West Indies players,'' Bacher said. ``They know
him to be a man of great integrity and one of the great statesmen
of the century.''
	   ``One is confident of a result to the impasse,'' he added. ``I'm
sure the people in Caribbean and South Africa and world cricket in
general will see it as important that the tour goes ahead.''
	   The first match of the tour is scheduled to begin next Tuesday.
The first Test is scheduled for Nov. 26.
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher said.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   The WICB said it would fine the no-show players between 5 and 10
percent of their tour fees, which could be as much as dlrs 60,000
for Lara.
	   Lara and Hooper have wide player support. Only seven of the 16
members of the squad traveled to South Africa, and all returned
Friday to London to rally around the two.
	   On Friday, Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll joined calls for
the WICB to be fired. ``The members of the board should be fired,''
he declared. ``This is not simply a matter of cricket and the board
cannot be allowed to treat the players in such a manner.''
	   In Port-of-Spain, the Trinidadian capital, Lara's fans set up a
massive blackboard in the heart of the city at Woodford Square and
dozens signed it to show ``100 percent support for Lara and his
men.''
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.
	   Lara, rated the world's best batsman, hinted a compromise can be
reached.
	   ``What has resulted so far is a bit unfortunate and I hope it
can be resolved in the near future,'' he said. ``The main thing is
that the West Indies tour to South Africa should be on.''
	   Lara, the batting superstar of the sport, set a world record of
375 runs in a 1994 Test against England. A few weeks later, he
scored a first-class record of 501 for his English county side
Warwickshire.

Iran says Caspian oil reserve estimates are exaggerated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's oil minister said Saturday that all
estimates for Caspian Sea oil reserves were exaggerated, and that
the region would not be a second Gulf in terms of oil production.
	   ``Even the most optimistic surveys say that only between 2
million and 3 million barrels a day can be exploited through
2015,'' Bijan Namdar Zangeneh told news conference on the sidelines
of the Caspian Oil and Gas Resources conference in Tehran.
	   Iran fears it will be locked out of Caspian oil deals because of
a U.S. embargo that bans large foreign investments in the Iranian
energy sector.
	   At a Caspian conference in Abu Dhabi late last month, reserve
estimates ranged from 16 billion barrels to 200 billion barrels.
	   Zangeneh said Iran is ``determined'' to develop its Caspian
resources, but noted that Caspian investment isn't very attractive
to oil companies right now because of low oil prices.
	   ``Iran has other oil resources which could be very attractive
for the investment of the foreign companies,'' he said.
	   ``In recent months, we have been witnessing the withdrawal of
some companies from the Caspian,'' the minister said. ``I think the
future depends on the oil price and the technology.''
	   Zangeneh added that Iran cannot wait years for the establishment
of a legal regime for the Caspian.
	   Iran has long advocated a moratorium on Caspian countries
signing contracts to exploit Caspian resources until it's legally
determined if the Caspian is a lake or a sea.
	   One ruling would divide up the Caspian's resources equally among
bordering countries, while the other would grant them sovereignty
over territorial waters along their coastlines.
	   ``We are interested that this legal regime be implemented,''
Zangeneh said. ``If not, we can use our right and exploit oil and
gas from the Caspian. But this would be our last option,'' he said.

	   IWAKI, Japan (AP) _ Kaname Yokoo collected 14 points Saturday to
stay atop with a seven-point lead after three rounds in the 120
million yen (dlrs 1.02 million) Acom International golf tournament.
	   Yokoo, in contention for his first title in three years as a
pro, scored an eagle and five birdies against a lone bogey for a
total of 36 points at the 6,948-yard (6,323-meter), par-72 Seve
Ballesteros Golf Club course.
	   The tournament's modified Stableford scoring system awards 8
points for a double eagle, 5 for an eagle, 2 for a birdie, zero for
par, minus-1 for a bogey and minus-3 for a double bogey or worse.
	   Katsumasa Miyamoto sank seven birdies against two bogeys for 12
points and was alone in second place at 29 points.
	   Kimpachi Yoshimura and Hirofumi Miyase were tied for third at 27
points.
	   Another point back at 26 points were Taisuke Kitajima and Ryoken

India's interior minister says Pakistan is insincere
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ India's hard-line home minister on Saturday
accused Pakistan of negotiating peace in bad faith, saying even as
it talks with India on forging peace in Kashmir, it supports a
separatist movement in the disputed territory.
	   Pakistan's ``continuing proxy war in India speaks of its
insincere intentions and the talking posture is merely a showoff,''
Lal Krishna Advani said during a visit to Jammu, Kashmir's winter
capital.
	   Despite the lack of progress, Advani said talks should continue.
	   India accuses Pakistan, an officially Islamic state, of
sponsoring a 9-year-old insurgency in Jammu-Kashmir, the only state
in predominantly Hindu India with a Muslim majority. Islamabad
denies giving material or military aid to the rebels but supports
their goal of seceding from India.
	   Senior Indian and Pakistani officials are holding a week of
talks in New Delhi on outstanding disputes, but not on their rival
territorial claims to Kashmir _ the cause of two of their three
wars in the last 50 years. A high level discussion last month on
Kashmir yielded little.
	   On Friday, the two sides discussed the Siachen Glacier, but
failed to silence the artillery on the Himalayan ice sheet where 13
soldiers have been killed in clashes the last two weeks.
	   Advani, who was in Jammu to review security in the area,
inspected two microlight aircraft seized by the police from forests
near the India-Pakistan border. He said the discovery of these
``flying bombs'' added another dimension to cross-border terrorism.

Two Muslims injured in explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Two Muslims have been injured
in an explosion in the village of Aladinici in the southern Bosnian
Stolac area, local police said Saturday.
	   The explosion occurred late Friday when an unidentified attacker
threw a hand grenade out of a passing car which exploded near a
group of Muslims.
	   Two injured Muslims, Himzo Balavac, 50, and Indir Vukicevic, 30,
were hospitalized in the regional medical center in Mostar, north
of Stolac.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, more than 50 Muslim houses have
been damaged in similar incidents in the area of Stolac, 115
kilometers (72 miles) southwest of Sarajevo.
	   The incidents are part of ethnic violence Croat hard-liners have
been accused of since the end of the Bosnian war in 1995. The
Croats hope to prevent Muslim refugees from returning to their
homes they were forced to leave during 1993-94 Muslim-Croat
fighting.
	   The Stolac area is one of the worst ethnic hotspots.
	   The blast occurred just a few hours after Hamo Maslesa, a local
leader, requested from Carlos Westendorp, the international envoy
to Bosnia, to withhold international assistance to local
authorities in the Stolac municipality for failure to identify the
perpetrators of recent attacks against returning Muslim refugees.
	   ``The situation in the field is alarming, and the constant
dynamiting of homes and bomb attacks against returnees and their
property cannot be tolerated,'' Maslesa said in his letter to
Westenddorp.

Nigeria welcomes easing of EU sanctions, but says EU lacks
</HEADLINE>
openness &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Nigeria's Foreign Minister Ignatius
Olisemeka on Saturday welcomed the easing of European Union
sanctions against his country but said Europe should be doing more
for Africa.
	   ``Europe was built on resources from our continent. Europe
should always be conscious of that,'' the minister who visited
Brussels to meet with EU officials told a news conference.
	   He said one of the ways in which Europe could help is by having
a ``more flexible approach'' towards immigration from Africa.
``We've always had our doors wide open for you ... we expect you to
open your doors to African nationals,'' the minister said.
	   The minister expressed ``deep appreciation'' towards the EU for
its decision on Oct. 30 to lift most of its sanctions against
Nigeria in view of the new government's moves toward democracy and
economic reform.
	   Only military aspects of the EU's 1995 sanctions remain,
including an arms embargo and suspension of military cooperation.
	   Nigerian government members, military officials and their
families will again be able to travel to the 15 EU nations.
Military personnel can rejoin diplomatic missions, and high-level
visits will be restored.
	   EU foreign ministers slapped the sanctions on Nigeria after the
regime of the late Gen. Sani Abacha executed nine dissidents.
	   ``Nigeria still has a long way to go but we've made a good
beginning,'' Olisemeka said, adding: ``We should try to forget the
very regrettable past.''
	   Abacha died of a heart attack in June and the new government,
led by Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, has moved toward increased
democracy and international acceptance.
	   Abubakar has freed political prisoners, welcomed foreign envoys,
invited exiles to return and committed his government to
presidential elections, set for Feb. 27.

Seeking Yeltsin's resignation, communists mark Russian revolution
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Demanding the resignation of President Boris
Yeltsin, thousands of mostly communist demonstrators marched
throughout Russia on Saturday to mark the 81th anniversary of the
Russian revolution.
	   Many protesters were elderly and poor, and their common refrain
was that Yeltsin was to blame for the loss of Soviet-era stability
and the country's economic collapse. But the crowds, which have
been dwindling in recent years, were far short of the organizers'
predictions.
	   In Moscow, police estimated that about 5,000 people took part in
a march that concluded at Lubyanka square, site of the former
headquarters of the KGB secret police. Communist Party organizers
had forecast up to 300,000 marchers.
	   Even among the protesters there was a sense of disappointment in
the turnout, but many blamed that on Yeltsin as well.
	   ``People used to celebrate this holiday,'' said retired teacher
Lidiya Alexeeva, waving a small red flag in time to the music of a
marching band. ``Now there are no holidays. If you live in our
country, you see that our people are the poorest in the world.''
	   Similar demonstrations were held in scores of other cities and
towns across Russia, and there were no reports of trouble.
	   In Belarus, where authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko
is openly nostalgic for Soviet times, about 4,000 demonstrators
gathered in the capital city of Minsk and some placed flowers by a
monument to Vladimir Lenin. Communists in the former Soviet
republic of Armenia unveiled a new bust of Lenin in Yerevan.
	   The relatively quiet gathering in Moscow was in sharp contrast
to the Soviet-era spectacles where the country's Communist leaders
gathered atop Lenin's mausoleum on Red Square to review a massive
military parade as hundreds of thousands of citizens looked on.
	   There is widespread discontent with Yeltsin, whose popularity
rating is in single digits, according to several recent polls. But
opposition groups have not been able to mount large street
demonstrations, strikes, or other protests.
	   The president has been at the southern Black Sea resort of Sochi
for the past week, recuperating from his latest illness, described
as fatigue and high blood pressure.
	   Besides criticizing Yeltsin at every turn, communist speakers
said they would work to help Russia's poor make it through the
winter with enough food.
	   ``We must quickly gather all our resources and provide all
people with the ability to survive the winter,'' said communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov. ``Solidarity is the greatest weapon of the
people.''
	   The country's economic crisis has prompted concerns about
possible food shortages in Russia, and the United States reached an
agreement with the Russians on Friday to provide more than 3
million tons of food aid this winter.
	   Zyuganov also said communist leaders had passed around a
petition to governors and parliament deputies across Russia asking
them to support yet another call for Yeltsin's ouster. The
president, meanwhile, says he will serve out the remainder of his
term, which runs until the year 2000.
	   Some young supporters of far-right groups took part in the
demonstration, but otherwise the crowd was made up almost entirely
of older Russians.
	   ``The young don't understand that Russia is suffering horribly,
electrician Valentin Yegorov, 64, said over the strains of the
Soviet anthem and the recorded sounds of cheering crowds. ``They
have been stupefied by Yeltsin's propaganda. As for me, I'm ready
to shoot Yeltsin and his entire team myself.''

Government considering review of contract of Swiss customs firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Saturday he may order a review of the government's contract with a
Swiss customs surveillance firm after it allegedly failed to curb
smuggling and to transfer know-how to Filipinos.
	   Speaking during his regular Saturday nationwide radio program,
Estrada said the government is paying billions of pesos (millions
of dollars) to the Societe Generale de Surveillance ``but nothing
has happened.''
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the contract with SGS,
which began operating in the late 1980s under former President
Corazon Aquino, was supposed to expire in October but was extended
to 1999 by the previous administration of Estrada's predecessor,
Fidel Ramos.
	   ``I was surprised when the contract was extended, considering
that the service has been bad and smuggling continued. Why should
we allow them to continue and why was the contract extended,'' said
Estrada, who took office June 30.
	   ``We will review the contract to see if we still need its
services,'' he added.
	   Espiritu said the contract with SGS included transfer of
technology or know-how, which has not been accomplished despite
over a decade of operation.
	   ``That's not good,'' Estrada said. ``They are are making it
appear that Filipinos are dumb.''
	   Espiritu also said that SGS services should have been phased out

Two Muslims injured in explosion

	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Two Muslims have been injured
in an explosion in the village of Aladinici in the southern Bosnian
Stolac area, local police said Saturday.
	   The explosion occurred late Friday when an unidentified attacker
threw a hand grenade out of a passing car which exploded near a
group of Muslims.
	   Two injured Muslims, Himzo Balavac, 50, and Indir Vukicevic, 30,
were hospitalized in the regional medical center in Mostar, north
of Stolac.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, more than 50 Muslim houses have
been damaged in similar incidents in the area of Stolac, 115
kilometers (72 miles) southwest of Sarajevo.
	   The incidents are part of ethnic violence Croat hard-liners have
been accused of since the end of the Bosnian war in 1995. The
Croats hope to prevent Muslim refugees from returning to their
homes they were forced to leave during 1993-94 Muslim-Croat
fighting.
	   The Stolac area is one of the worst ethnic hotspots.
	   The blast occurred just a few hours after Hamo Maslesa, a local
leader, requested from Carlos Westendorp, the international envoy
to Bosnia, to withhold international assistance to local
authorities in the Stolac municipality for failure to identify the
perpetrators of recent attacks against returning Muslim refugees.
	   ``The situation in the field is alarming, and the constant
dynamiting of homes and bomb attacks against returnees and their
property cannot be tolerated,'' Maslesa said in his letter to
Westenddorp.

Protest erupts after one week lull
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ For the first time since ousted
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim's trial began, Malaysians held
an anti-government demonstration Saturday.
	   A small group of people gathered outside a mosque in central
Kuala Lumpur, shouting slogans against Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   There were few policemen at the scene and no violence was
reported. A small peaceful protest was held in the same area,
called Kampong Baru, last Saturday.
	   On Oct. 24, the country's first violent protest in almost three
decades broke out there. Police fired tear gas shells and water
cannons to disperse stone-pelting activists.
	   Saturday's demonstration in Kampong Baru was the first one after
Anwar's trial began in the High Court on Monday. Anwar faces 10
counts of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   Street protests erupted in Malaysia after Anwar was fired from
his post and then arrested on Sept. 20. Demonstrators have demanded
Mahathir's ouster and justice for Anwar.
	   Hundreds of people had been detained during recent downtown
rallies demanding justice for Anwar. Police have warned they will
come down hard on participants in the banned protests.

King offers royal protection to opposition, plans trip to China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with king pledging security for opposition
leaders, planning urgent medical trip to China
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk offered his
royal palace and security detail Saturday as protection to
opposition leaders if they wish to return to Cambodia for talks on
forming a new government with strongman Hun Sen.
	   Sihanouk, 76, said the opposition leaders needed to take him up
on the offer before Nov. 13, saying his doctors have warned him he
needs to travel to China no later than Nov. 14 for an urgent
medical checkup for his numerous ailments.
	   The king's offer of protection under a one-week deadline puts
pressure on opposition leaders _ the king's son, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, and former finance minister Sam Rainsy _ to break their
deadlock with Hun Sen following disputed elections in July.
	   Hun Sen's formerly communist Cambodian People's Party narrowly
won the parliamentary elections, but failed to win the two-thirds
majority needed to form a new government. The opposition parties
have withheld their backing, claiming Hun Sen won by fraud and
intimidation.
	   The deadlock has prevented Cambodia from eliminating the
political instability that followed Hun Sen's bloody coup in July
1997 that ended his tense four-year co-premiership with Ranariddh.
	   In a message to diplomats made available to news organizations,
Sihanouk said that his doctors have warned him to go to Beijing for
``urgent'' medical checkups and treatment. The king suffers from
cancer, now in remission, arteriosclerosis and cataracts.
	   Sihaounk's absence would deprive Cambodia of the only political
force able to bring the feuding leaders to the negotiating table.
	   The opposition leaders and many of their supporters in
parliament left Cambodia after the new assembly was sworn in Sept.
24, fearing for their safety.
	   Saturday, Sihanouk offered Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy places to
stay in the Royal Palace compound if they wish to come within the
next week. The king said he was willing to try to organize a
summit.
	   Royal security guards would serve as motorcycle outriders
between the airport and palace, the king said.
	   If no meeting can be arranged, any of the leaders is welcome to
meet him at his Beijing residence after Nov. 15 and he could try to
arrange a summit there if the Chinese government concurs.
	   Earlier, Sihanouk rejected opposition pressure to dissolve the
post-coup government still in place and replace it with an interim
body, saying Hun Sen would use every means at his disposal to stop
it.
	   The king also ruled out amnesty for several opposition
supporters who are abroad and face arrest by Hun Sen if they
return.
	   ``A conflict between Hun Sen and myself would be to the
detriment of our unhappy Cambodia and our already very unfortunate
people,'' Sihanouk said in an interview with his palace bulletin.

German conservatives look to renewal after election defeat

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kohl designated successor's speech. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Helmut Kohl bid a teary-eyed farewell as
leader of Germany's conservative Christian Democrats on Saturday
after guiding his party to its worst showing in a national election
in nearly a half-century.
	   Kohl's sentimental speech to about 1,000 party delegates
launched them into their new role as German opposition, a result of
Sept. 27 elections that unseated the chancellor after a record 16
years in office.
	   Later, the party was expected to elect Kohl's hand-picked
successor, Wolfgang Schaeuble, as chairman, with the former
chancellor giving up the post he held for 25 years.
	   Tears glistened on Kohl's jowls as one of his closest aides,
former Labor Minister Norbert Bluem, praised his achievements _
topped by German unification in 1990 after the fall of the Berlin
Wall.
	   For his part, Kohl accused new Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of
leading Germany to the left despite campaigning on a centrist
platform. Unapologetic, Kohl blamed his defeat on Germans unsettled
by ``the dynamism of global change'' who had voted for a stronger
government role in the economy.
	   ``These parties offer the easier, more comfortable way,'' he
asserted. ``Our course will prove to be the right one, and we will
fight to make the majority of voters recognize this.''
	   He urged his party to stay true to its principles, including the
free market, a commitment to social justice rooted in Christianity,
and European unity.
	   ``Let us not give in to pressure to run after changing trends of
political fashion,'' he said. ``We need a renewal that will bear
new fruit _ not one that rips out the roots.''
	   Kohl smiled and waved from the podium as delegates gave him a
final, five-minute standing ovation.
	   Schaeuble then began chipping away at Kohl's huge shadow, making
clear that the party had increasingly lost touch with average
Germans under his overbearing reign.
	   ``We must open up for new issues and thinking,'' he declared.
``The CDU must regain its ability to campaign.'' That could include
reaching out to labor unions and ecology-minded voters, he said.
	   Another challenge, he said, was regaining voters in economically
struggling eastern Germany, the formerly communist area where the
Christian Democrats were routed despite Kohl's image as ``father of
German unity.''

Romania repatriates remains of the French soldiers who died in
</HEADLINE>
World War I
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Dozens of French and Romanian
officials attended Saturday a ceremony of symbolic repatriation of
the remains of French soldiers who died in Romania during World War
I.
	   ``We will never forget that France's sons fought alongside their
Romanian brothers and soaked with their blood the Romanian land,''
said President Emil Constantinescu in front of an honor guards.
	   A total of 423 French soldiers died in Romania in the World War
I years 1916-18, fighting German and Austro-Hungarian Empire
troops.
	   The Romanian Defense Ministry and a French-Romanian foundation
gathered some clods of earth from the soldiers' graves, scattered
throughout the country, and put them in a coffin in a symbolic
gesture.
	   Early Saturday, the coffin was brought to Bucharest's biggest
Catholic cathedral, Saint Joseph, where a funeral mass was held. A
military ceremony took place afterward at the Bucharest Arch of
Triumph.
	   The officials paid tribute to French General Henri Mathias
Berthelot, who led the French troops during the World War I.
	   '' We can hardly express our homage for those who changed the
war's fate,'' Constantinescu said.
	   Later in the day, the coffin was to arrive in France for
ultimate burial Monday during a military ceremony in the small
community of Dieuze. The cemetery of Dieuze shelters the remains of
947 Romanians, who died in France during the two world wars.
	   Romania, whose capital was once known as ``Paris of the East,''
has long felt a strong affinity with France because of some
similarity of their Latin-based languages as well as historical and
cultural links.

Two Israelis arrested for spying

	   LARNACA, Nicosia (AP) _ Police on Saturday arrested two Israel
men on suspicion of spying, and a court ordered them detained for
eight days pending investigations.
	   The two were produced in court hours after their arrest from a
rented apartment in a village near the south coastal town of
Larnaca.
	   Police Sgt. Kyriakos Kyriacou told the court that police found
cameras, wireless instruments and documents ``which are being
investigated to determine whether they were ... spying on behalf of
Israel.''
	   The two men were identified as Udi Hargov, 27 and Igal Damary,
49. They will appear in court again on Nov. 16 when either formal
charges will be filed or the prosecution might ask for further
remand.
	   Kyriacou said there were suspicions that the two men were spying
against the Cypriot army and had been under surveillance. He didn't
say for how long the surveillance had been going on.
	   Describing this as a very serious case, Kyriacou asked for a
remand order of eight days, which was granted by Judge Elena
Ephraim after Costas Dimitriades, a lawyer appearing for the two
Israelis, did not object.
	   Justice Minister Nikos Koshis was quoted by Cyprus state radio
as saying the police are carrying out investigations on the basis
of documents found in their apartment. But this does not mean the
spying activities were conducted on the behalf of the state of
Israel, Koshis was quoted as saying.

London extremist group plans rally of Islamic militants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A London-based Muslim extremist group plans
to hold a conference in Britain for militant groups from around the
world, a leading Arabic daily reported Saturday.
	   The London-based Al-Hayat said the conference on the
``challenges by the West'' is being organized by the group
Al-Muhajiroun, or the Emigrants, which had tried to hold a similar
meeting in August 1996.
	   That attempt failed after a number of Muslim countries,
including Egypt, complained to Britain that the organizers had
invited militants who were trying to overthrow their governments.
	   It is not known if any Muslim nation has complained yet about
the upcoming conference scheduled for Nov. 20.
	   The Al-Muhajiroun, led by a Syrian exile, Omar Bakri Mohammed,
is a fundamentalist group seeking to revive the caliphate system of
Islamic rule, which began after the death of Prophet Mohammed in
632 AD. Caliphs were spiritual and temporal rulers but did not have
prophetic authority.
	   Since the end of the caliphate system early this century,
several pan-Islamic congresses to establish a rightful Caliph.
	   Al-Hayat said Al-Muhajiroun has invited representatives of the
Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah and the Egyptian group,
al-Jihad among others.
	   Hezbollah is fighting to oust Israeli troops from a swath of
land in south Lebanon that Israel occupies as a buffer against
cross-border guerrilla attacks on its northern cities.
	   Al-Jihad wants to oust the government of President Hosni Mubarak
and install Islamic rule. Al-Jihad was blamed for the assassination
of Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar Sadat.
	   Among the other groups invited for the conference are the lesser
known Afghanistan's Council for the European Taliban Movement, the
Supporters of Hamas and the Liberation Party, al-Hayat said,
quoting a statement by Al-Muhajiroun.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Fifteen U.N. weapons inspectors _ some of
them experts on missiles _ left Baghdad on Saturday in the first
stage of the U.N. reduction of its teams in Iraq.
	   The withdrawal comes a week after Iraq said it was halting all
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   In response, UNSCOM said Friday it will withdraw 26 people from
its staff of about 120 to 140.
	   Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters that Iraq's
position on halting cooperation ``still stands.''
	   He was the first Cabinet minister to comment publicly since a
Security Council resolution Thursday called the Iraqi position a
``flagrant violation'' of previous U.N. resolutions and urged Iraq
to allow UNSCOM work.
	   Iraq says inspections can resume only if the council gives a
timetable for the lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait. But sanctions can't be lifted until UNSCOM
certifies Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM here, said the 15 experts
leaving Saturday included four based in Baghdad and 11 who were on
a special assignment. The 11 included some six members of a missile
team.
	   ``A visiting missile team ... just happened to be here when Iraq
made its announcement,'' she said.
	   ``The support staff is staying in place,'' Ms. Cross said.
``They have the qualifications to resume work immediately should
Iraq have a change of heart.''
	   The experts left from an air base outside Baghdad on at flight
to Bahrain at 2:40 p.m. (1140gmt), the spokeswoman said.
	   More inspectors will leave Monday and Wednesday, she said.
	   The standoff has raised fears of a military strike by the United
States and Britain.
	   On Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen returned from a
tour of Arab nations and Turkey, saying he was satisfied the United
States would have adequate support from Arab allies to carry out
military action.
	   But other members of the Security Council oppose military
strikes.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement Friday that
armed actions are ``fraught with most unpredictable consequences
for peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a
whole.''
	   Besides UNSCOM, experts from the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency are also in Iraq, dealing with
its compliance on nuclear issues. IAEA monitors have not been
banned by Iraq.
	   Cross said a nuclear team went into the field to continue
monitoring work Saturday. No details were available.
	   Meanwhile, Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Baghdad, said the Security Council
has asked Annan to help resolve the standoff. Annan signed an
agreement with Iraq on Feb. 23 to end a previous crisis over
inspections of presidential palaces.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa didn't deliver the home run the Japanese
fans were all waiting for.
	   But Cleveland Indian Manny Ramirez had two and Atlanta
outfielder Andruw Jones had another to lead the major league
all-stars to an 8-1 win over their Japanese counterparts Saturday
in the first of a seven-game exhibition series.
	   Ramirez, the Most Valuable Player for the game, smacked two
consecutive homers _ a three-run shot in the seventh and another in
the ninth that added two more runs.
	   Jones slammed a two-run home run off Yakult starter Kazuhisa
Ishii in the third inning.
	   ``I feel good,'' said Jones, who also had a hit in the fifth but
was thrown out at second by Yakult catcher Atsuya Furuta when he
tried to steal.
	   ``I am happy to be playing in Japan right now and be part of the
all-star team. There are a lot of great guys on the team,'' Jones
said.
	   Ishii said he knew right away it was a home run.
	   ``They didn't let the fans down, and I got hit,'' he said.
	   Sosa's each at-bat was welcomed with whistles and cheers from
the stands at the Tokyo Dome.
	   The Cubs star's race with Mark McGwire for the major league
season home run record was almost as closely watched in
baseball-loving Japan as it was back home.
	   Sosa finished a disappointing 1-for-4 for the day but managed to
please the fans with his stealing finesse in the first inning.
	   After hitting to center and advancing to second on a hit by Greg
Vaughn of the Padres, Sosa stole third, sliding in head first after
Yomiuri Giants first baseman Kazuhiro Kiyohara caught a foul from
Colorado slugger Vinny Castilla.
	   Braves catcher Javy Lopez brought Sosa home with a hit along the
third baseline for the first run for the U.S. all-stars.
	   It wasn't until the fourth inning that Japan finally had a hit,
by Orix outfielder Ichiro Suzuki _ one of just three hits majors
starter Jamie Moyer of Seattle gave up in five innings.
	   Suzuki stole second, then third. Giants outfielder Hideki Matsui
then batted in Japan's only run with a hit to left field.

Russia to begin fueling first component of International Space
</HEADLINE>
Station &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia planned to begin fueling the first
component of the new International Space Station on Saturday in
preparation for its launch on Nov. 20, a news report said.
	   It will take five days to fuel the Zarya cargo module with 4.5
metric tons (5 tons) of a highly toxic fuel before its launch from
the Baikonur cosmodrome in the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Next week, space workers will link the module with a Proton
booster rocket and place it on the launching pad at the cosmodrome,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   The Zarya module will be the first component launched for the
International Space Station, a manned station that involves the
United States, Japan, Russia, Canada and 12 European nations. It is
expected to cost upwards of dlrs 40 billion.
	   The Zarya, with a design based on modules of older Soviet space
stations, cost dlrs 200 million, ITAR-Tass said. The module can
stay in flight for 430 days without refueling, ITAR-Tass said.
	   NASA is scheduled to launch a module of its own to link up with
the Zarya in December. The first crews are not expected on the
space station until the latter part of 1999 or early in the year
2000.
	   The United States already had paid Russia about dlrs 1.2 billion
to keep the project on schedule, but Russia has repeatedly failed
to meet deadlines. The project is already a year behind schedule
and will take about four or five years to complete.

Mainland China has right to try reputed Hong Kong mobster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government reiterated Saturday that
mainland Chinese authorities had the legal right to try a reputed
Hong Kong mobster and his gang members on charges of cross-border
kidnappings, murder and smuggling.
	   Cheung Tze-keung, also known as ``Big Spender'' is awaiting
verdicts in southern China on charges that could carry the death
sentence. He and his underlings have been charged with the killings
of a Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robberies
and smuggling of explosives into this territory.
	   Hong Kong's Secretary for Security, Regina Ip, told reporters
that some of the crimes were committed on the Chinese mainland and
that authorities there had the jurisdiction to try Cheung and his
members.
	   She said that if Cheung had been captured in Hong Kong and the
police had sufficient evidence of his crimes, the alleged gang
leader would have been tried in Hong Kong.
	   Local media have extensively covered the closed hearing of
Cheung in the neighboring city of Guangzhou. Cheung and his gang
are also charged with the kidnapping of two wealthy Hong Kong
businessmen, who reportedly paid hundreds of millions dollars in
ransom.
	   Most these crimes are punishable by death in mainland China, and
Cheung's lawyers have been pushing to have the case transferred to
Hong Kong, which has no capital punishment.
	   Martin Lee, leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, earlier
Saturday expressed concern over the trial of Cheung because of
questions over who had legal jurisdictions for crimes that occurred
in Hong Kong.
	   But Ip said there was no question that Cheung and the other
defendants were deprived of their legal rights as they were all
represented by lawyers in China.
	   Hong Kong also plans to hold talks with the mainland about the
extradition of fugitives, she said. At present, there is no formal
extradition agreement between the two sides.

Investigators reportedly identify top suspect in 1996 Paris
</HEADLINE>
bombing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Anti-terrorism investigators believe that an
Islamic militant arrested in a March siege at a house in Brussels
is the likely culprit in the unsolved 1996 bombing at Paris' Port
Royal subway station, the newspaper Le Parisien reported Saturday.
	   The Dec. 3, 1996, bombing that killed four people and injured
scores of others has remained unsolved. Authorities have long
suspected Muslim extremists who waged a 1995 bombing campaign in
France that killed eight people, but have been unable to make a
direct connection.
	   Militants backing the radical Algerian Armed Islamic Group
claimed responsibility for some of the 1995 bombings, but not for
the bomb that exploded in the suburban train at the Port Royal
station.
	   According to Le Parisien, Belgian and French investigators were
able to piece together the puzzle after the March 5 arrest of Farid
Melouk, a 33-year-old French man arrested after an eight-hour siege
at a house in Brussels, where some 10 other people were arrested.
The daily paper provided no direct sources for its report, but
suggested the information came from investigators.
	   Melouk and an accomplice, after arriving from Brussels,
allegedly took the Line B train at Charles de Gaulle airport and
got off at the Gare du Nord, leaving a sports bag with a bomb
inside on the train, Le Parisien wrote. The suspects were preparing
to catch a train for Brussels when the bomb exploded minutes later.
	   The Brussels siege came two months before a Europe-wide sweep of
suspected Islamic militants ahead of the World Cup soccer
championship in France. Authorities said they were acting
``preventatively'' after receiving indications that a GIA leader in
Algeria, Hassan Hattab, was looking to internationalize the Islamic
insurgency in Algeria waged since 1992. An estimated 75,000 people
have been killed in violence in the former French colony.

Second-division player handed three-month ban for steroid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ An Italian second-division soccer player has
been suspended for three months after testing positive for a banned
anabolic steroid.
	   The Italian league's disciplinary committee announced its
sanction Friday for Lecce defender Cristiano Pavone.
	   It is the first drug suspension in Italy since two players for
first-division AS Roma were banned for using stimulants in 1991,
and comes during a wave of investigations into the use of
performance-enhancing substances by Italy's soccer players.
	   The inquiries have led to the resignation of Italian Olympic
Committee President Mario Pescante and the closing of the country's
drug-testing laboratory. The lab was accused of handling soccer
doping tests improperly.
	   Pavone failed a surprise drug test in August and a second test
last month. The three-month ban is retroactive to Oct. 9, when the
league forced him to the sidelines until the case was settled.
	   The player, who appeared in the 1996 Italian Cup final with
then-first-division club Atalanta of Bergamo, has argued the test
results could have been affected by medication he took after a
motorcycle accident.

Death toll rises as Albanian rebels try to assert authority

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Violence in Kosovo is growing
despite a de-facto peace treaty designed to end bloodshed in the
turbulent Serbian province and set the stage for a political
agreement between Serb authorities and Kosovo's majority Albanians.
	   Nevertheless, plans for setting up a 2,000-strong Kosovo
Verification Mission went ahead Saturday.
	   An advance team for 74 American observers, who have been in
Belgrade the past week, was coming to Kosovo, Richard Huckaby, the
spokesman for the U.S. sector of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission, said Saturday.
	   Five suspected ethnic Albanian guerrillas died Friday in a
shootout with Serb police, according to a Serb media statement.
	   The deaths raised the number of Albanians killed since Thursday
afternoon to seven. Foreign observers say attacks by both Serb
forces and Albanian guerrillas have increased this week, as the
United States and European nations try to push ahead with the Oct.
12 agreement reached with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with KLA officials Friday in
Dragobilje, a village 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Albanian sources said he gave the rebels a draft
political agreement that will restore self-rule for the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo. Hill's office would only say that he
met with the rebels to discuss the peace process.
	   The rebels have rejected any political agreement that stops
short of full independence for Kosovo, although they have
grudgingly agreed to stop fighting if not attacked. Both sides
blame each other for the newest violence.
	   KLA representative Jakup Krasniqi confirmed the meeting with
Hill and said his side would comment on the document once it has
had a chance to review it.
	   Showing its dissatisfaction with the Kosovo peace process, the
KLA said Friday it intends to establish its own civilian rule in
territory it controls.
	   In a statement carried by local media, the guerrilla group said
its military command would form local government institutions,
disregarding both Serbian authorities and established ethnic
Albanian political leaders.
	   Such a move would widen a rift among the majority of Albanians
who support moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, and the minority that
rejects Rugova's nonviolent strategy.
	   Rugova has been elected Kosovo president in elections neither
Serb authorities nor anyone else has recognized as valid. A
self-styled Albanian assembly also exists, though it is rarely
convened and also is not recognized by Serbian authorities.
	   At his weekly news conference Friday, Rugova said he hoped the
international verification mission led by the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe will provide security for
returning refugees.
	   Meanwhile, Huckaby, the U.S. spokesman, said in Pristina
Saturday fewer than 10 of the 74 American observers would come to
theKosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission headquarters in the Kosovo
capital. The new observers were contracted privately from DynCorp,
a U.S. company of military specialists.
	   The KDOM mission, which started in July, eventually will be
absorbed into the larger Kosovo verification mission. The OSCE
mission is expected to open near the end of the month, at the
earliest.
	   On Saturday morning, KDOM chief Shaun Byrnes met with Adem
Demaci, the political spokesman for the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation
Army, at Demaci's headquarters in Pristina. No details of the
meeting were immediately available.
	   Byrnes has said KDOM officials meet regularly with the ethnic
Albanian guerrillas to explain the Oct. 12 accord in which Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to the withdrawal of Serbian
police and Yugoslav army troops, to the return of all refugees and
negotiations toward a political settlement of the Kosovo conflict.
	   . It was unclear if Saturday's meeting was connected to talks
that U.S. envoy Christopher Hill held Friday with KLA figures in
Dragobilje, a village 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina.
	   Milosevic stripped the majority Albanians of self-rule in 1989
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
That started a period of protests and increased violence that led
to his crackdown on Albanian separatists in February.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Fifteen U.N. weapons inspectors, some of
them experts on missiles, were leaving Baghdad on Saturday in the
first stage of the U.N. reduction of its teams in Iraq. The
withdrawal comes a week after Iraq said it was halting all
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles. Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said
Iraq's position on halting cooperation ``still stands.'' He was the
first Cabinet minister to comment publicly since a Security Council
resolution Thursday called the Iraqi position a ``flagrant
violation'' of previous U.N. resolutions, and urged Iraq to allow
UNSCOM work. (IRAQ-UN)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The father of one of the Islamic militants who
died in the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market said
Saturday he was sad about his son's death but proud of what he had
done. Friday's bombing at the open-air Mahane Yehuda market killed
the two assailants, injured 21 Israelis and jeopardized the latest
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
promised to track down the masterminds and urged that the attack
not be allowed to set back the new land-for-security agreement. In
a rare direct statement to the Israeli people, Arafat appeared on
Israeli TV and promised to ``exert 100 percent effort'' to catch
and punish those who had planned the bombing. The radical group
Hamas claimed responsibility, but Palestinian security officials
blamed members of Islamic Jihad. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Battered by international sanctions
that have put Pakistan on the brink of economic collapse,
government officials woke up Saturday to the good news that
Washington had lifted some sanctions. ``I have just heard and we
haven't had time to study it, but this is very good news for us,''
said Ashfaq Ahmed, economic advisor to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Analysts here said Washington's decision to lift some sanctions on
India and Pakistan will save a desperately needed dlrs 5 billion
package from the International Monetary Fund, while market analysts
said they hoped the move would boost the stock market.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Space shuttle Discovery was packed
up and ready for the trip back to Earth on Saturday to deliver John
Glenn home from another historic ride into orbit. Eight hours
before their scheduled return, the crew was awakened to complete
preparations for landing to the tune of ``La Cucaracha,'' dedicated
to Pedro Duque, the first Spaniard in space. The shuttle was due to
touch down at 1704 GMT at Florida's Kennedy Space Center. There
were three other opportunities to land Saturday, including two at
Edwards Air Force Base in California, in case of bad weather.
Flight controllers also were monitoring another potential problem:
the possibility that the shuttle's drag chute could inadvertently
pop open because of a missing compartment door that fell off four
seconds before liftoff. (US-GLENN-SHUTTLE)
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajik troops have encircled bands of
rebel fighters in two northern outposts and appeared poised
Saturday to put down the latest revolt in the restive Central Asian
nation. More than 200 combatants and civilians have been killed
since the rebels launched raids in the northern part of the country
Wednesday, renewing concerns about the government's ability to
maintain order. After suffering losses at the beginning of the
fighting, the government forces have surrounded the rebels in the
northern city of Khudzhand and the village of Aini, news reports
said. (TAJIKISTAN-FIGHTING)

Pete Sampras accepts wild card
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Pete Sampras has accepted a wild card
by the organizers of the Stockholm Open next week, tournament
director Johan Flink said.
	   The top-ranked American has never won the tournament, one of the
world's oldest indoors. He reached the semifinal in 1994, when the
tournament was held in the 14,000-seat Globe Arena. In 1995, the
tournament moved across town to its original site, the Royal Tennis
Hall.
	   ``This is a big boost for the tournament, having the world's top
player,'' Flink said.
	   Sampras is looking to end the season as No. 1 for a record sixth
consecutive year. He*s now tied with Jimmy Connors, who also was
top-ranked for five straight years.
	   Marcelo Rios, the only player who can finish ahead of Sampras,
will play a clay court event in his native Chile (Santiago) next
week. He lost in the quarterfinals of the Paris Open Friday.
Sampras, the defending Paris champion, reached Saturday's
semifinals.
	   Jonas Bjorkman, who led Sweden to a 5-0 shutout over a U.S. team
led by Sampras in last year's Davis Cup finas in Goteborg, Sweden,
is the defending Stockhom Open champion and will be back at the
Royal Tennis Hall.
	   Fellow Swede Thomas Enqvist, who hopes to join Bjorkman on the
team that plays Italy in this year's final in Milan Dec. 4-6, is
also in the field. Other leading players include Tim Henman, Greg
Rusedski, Cedric Pioline, Magnus Gustafsson and Thomas Johansson.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Demanding the resignation of President Boris
Yeltsin, thousands of mostly communist demonstrators marched
throughout Russia on Saturday to mark the 81st anniversary of the
Russian revolution.
	   Many protesters were elderly and poor, and their common refrain
was that Yeltsin was to blame for the loss of Soviet-era stability
and the country's economic collapse. But the crowds, which have
been dwindling in recent years, were far short of the organizers'
predictions.
	   In Moscow, police estimated about 5,000 people took part in a
march that concluded at Lubyanka square, site of the former
headquarters of the KGB secret police. The Communist Party
organizers had forecast up to 300,000 marchers.
	   Even among the protesters there was a sense of disappointment in
the turnout, but many blamed that on Yeltsin as well.
	   ``People used to celebrate this holiday,'' said retired teacher
Lidiya Alexeeva, waving a small red flag in time to the music of a
marching band. ``Now there are no holidays. If you live in our
country, you see that our people are the poorest in the world.''
	   Similar demonstrations were held in over 200 other cities and
towns across Russia, and in several former Soviet republics. There
were no reports of trouble, police said. An estimated 10,000 people
gathered in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city where the
revolution began in 1917.
	   Yeltsin, who has been at the southern Black Sea resort of Sochi
for the past week recuperating from his latest illness, made a
taped television broadcast Saturday afternoon.
	   Speaking slowly and looking pale, Yeltsin called Russia's
revolutionary period ``irrevocably over.''
	   ``Yes, they (communists) again came out with red banners, they
again cursed reforms and called for cancellation of the presidency,
but only fanatics could call for a massacre or an uprising like in
... 1917,'' he said.
	   ``Today's communists fully enjoy the results of democracy, from
the free market to freedom of assembly and especially freedom of
press,'' Yeltsin said.
	   The relatively quiet gathering in Moscow was in sharp contrast
to the Soviet-era spectacles where the country's Communist leaders
gathered atop Lenin's mausoleum on Red Square to review a massive
military parade as hundreds of thousands of citizens looked on.
	   There is widespread discontent with Yeltsin, whose popularity
rating is in single digits, according to several recent polls. But
opposition groups have not been able to mount large street
demonstrations, strikes, or other protests.
	   Besides criticizing Yeltsin at every turn, communist speakers
said they would work to help Russia's poor make it through the
winter with enough food.
	   ``We must quickly gather all our resources and provide all
people with the ability to survive the winter,'' said communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov. ``Solidarity is the greatest weapon of the
people.''
	   The country's economic crisis has prompted concerns about
possible food shortages in Russia, and the United States reached an
agreement with the Russians on Friday to provide more than 3
million tons of food aid this winter.
	   Some young supporters of far-right groups took part in the
demonstration, but otherwise the crowd was made up almost entirely
of older Russians.
	   ``The young don't understand that Russia is suffering horribly,
electrician Valentin Yegorov, 64, said over the strains of the
Soviet anthem and the recorded sounds of cheering crowds. ``They
have been stupefied by Yeltsin's propaganda. As for me, I'm ready
to shoot Yeltsin and his entire team myself.''

Iranian foreign minister in Riyadh to discuss Iraq, oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi arrived here Saturday for talks on Iraq's latest crisis
with the United Nations and the low global oil prices.
	   Kharrazi was met at the airport by his counterpart, Prince Saud
al-Faisal, a Saudi official said. He is expected to meet Saudi King
Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah later Saturday, Iranian ambassador
Mohammed Nouri Shahroudi said.
	   Shahroudi said Iran and Saudi Arabia are against any strikes on
Iraq, as advocated by the United States and Britain to retaliate
for Baghdad's refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Shahroudi said Tehran and Riyadh believed in a diplomatic
solution but also think Iraq should comply with United Nations
resolutions.
	   ``The two sides are in complete agreement,'' Shahroudi told The
Associated Press.
	   Iraq last week stopped all inspection and monitoring work by the
U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the destruction of Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   The destruction of Baghdad's arsenal is stipulated under U.N.
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, which led to
the Gulf War.
	   Besides Iraq, Kharrazi will also discuss oil, the main source of
income for Iran and Saudi Arabia. Falling prices have hurt
economies of both countries, which are members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. However, they disagree on how to
resolve the problem.
	   Iran has supported additional production cuts to boost sagging
oil prices while Saudi Arabia has called for an extension of
previous cuts until the end of 1999.
	   Kharrazi will also discuss plans for a visit by Iran's first
deputy president, Hassan Habibi, to the kingdom, Saudi officials
said earlier. They did not disclose a date for the visit.
	   Saudi Arabia used to be extremely wary of Iran, owing to
Tehran's stated policy of exporting its Islamic revolution. The
kingdom, a Sunni Muslim state, also disapproved of citizens from
Iran, a Shiite Muslim state, holding demonstrations during the
annual pilgrimage to Mecca.
	   But relations began to improve after Iran's President Mohammad
Khatami, a political moderate, took office last year. The ties
received a boost in February when Iran's former president, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, visited the kingdom.
	   In May, the two countries signed a wide-ranging agreement on
trade, exchanges of academics and students, and technological
cooperation.

Pete Sampras accepts wild card
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Pete Sampras has accepted a wild card
slot at the Stockholm Open next week, tournament director Johan
Flink said.
	   The top-ranked American has never won the tournament, one of the
world's oldest indoors. He reached the semifinal in 1994, when the
tournament was held in the 14,000-seat Globe Arena. In 1995, the
tournament moved across town to its original site, the Royal Tennis
Hall.
	   ``This is a big boost for the tournament, having the world's top
player,'' Flink said.
	   Sampras is looking to end the season as No. 1 for a record sixth
consecutive year. His five years at the top currently ties him with
Jimmy Connors.
	   Marcelo Rios, the only player who can finish ahead of Sampras,
will play a clay court event in his native Chile (Santiago) next
week. He lost in the quarterfinals of the Paris Open Friday.
Sampras, the defending Paris champion, reached Saturday's
semifinals.
	   Jonas Bjorkman, who led Sweden to a 5-0 shutout over a U.S. team
led by Sampras in last year's Davis Cup finals in Goteborg, Sweden,
is the defending Stockholm Open champion and will be back at the
Royal Tennis Hall.
	   Fellow Swede Thomas Enqvist, who hopes to join Bjorkman on the
team that plays Italy in this year's final in Milan, Dec. 4-6, is
also in the field. Other leading players include Tim Henman, Greg
Rusedski, Cedric Pioline, Magnus Gustafsson and Thomas Johansson.

Emirates starts first ferry service to Iraq since Gulf war

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A passenger and cargo ferry
service to Iraq started Saturday, the first direct link between the
Gulf and its sanctions-hit neighbor since the 1990 Gulf crisis.
	   The Jebel Ali 1, a luxury cruise ship that can carry 600
passengers, will travel from Dubai to the southern Iraqi port of
Umm al Qasr every Saturday, said Mohammed Hamdan al-Shamsi, manager
of Naif Marine Services, a private company operating the service.
	   The ship, which can also carry 500 tons of cargo, will make the
return trip to Dubai every Monday. Al-Shamsi said the ferry will
cater mostly to Shiite pilgrims and businessmen.
	   The 32-hour journey will cost 1,200 dirhams (dlrs 329) for a
two-way trip, considerably cheaper and quicker than the other
option, traveling by air to the Jordanian capital Amman, and then
making the 1,000 kilometer (600-miles) road journey to Baghdad.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait bar
flights to and from Iraq as well as other direct trade links. The
ferry has been approved by the United Nations.
	   Only 70 passengers and a 45-man crew were on the ship for the
maiden voyage, said Tarek Habeeb, Naif Marine Services assistant
manager.
	   Most of the passengers were Iraqis visiting or working in Dubai.
Others were the company's owners and members of the press.
	   ``This is much easier than flying,'' said Sanaa Abdul-Rahman, a
pregnant Iraqi woman traveling with her 5-year-old daughter,
Ananas. She was visiting her husband who works in Dubai.
	   Al-Shamsi said the ferry will also cater to passengers from
other countries in the region including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and
Bahrain. He said travel agents in those countries have made many
inquiries.
	   Dozens have asked about the possibility of having the ferry stop
at the Bahraini port of Manama en route to Iraq.
	   ``If it's feasible, if they can guarantee at least 100
passengers, then we can do that in the future,'' al-Shamsi said.
	   About half of the passenger are expected to be Shiite Muslims
who visit the shrines at Karbala and Najaf in southern Iraq. For
Shiites, the sites are second only to the holy shrines of Saudi
Arabia.
	   Diplomats in Baghdad have estimated that at least 25,000 Shiites
visit Najaf and Karbala each month. Most Gulf states have sizable
Shiite minorities, but all are ruled by adherents to the mainstream
Sunni sect.
	   The ferry is the first direct link between the Arab Gulf states
and Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which led to the
Gulf War. Gulf nations supported the U.S.-led allies that drove out
Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
	   The Emirates has been at the forefront of calls for Gulf nations
to normalize ties with Iraq.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa didn't deliver the home run the Japanese
fans were all waiting for.
	   But Cleveland Indian Manny Ramirez had two and Atlanta
outfielder Andruw Jones had another to lead the major league
all-stars to an 8-1 win over their Japanese counterparts Saturday
in the first of a seven-game exhibition series.
	   Ramirez, the Most Valuable Player for the game, smacked two
consecutive homers _ a three-run shot in the seventh and another in
the ninth that added two more runs.
	   Jones slammed a two-run home run off Yakult starter Kazuhisa
Ishii in the third inning.
	   ``I feel good,'' said Jones, who also had a hit in the fifth but
was thrown out at second by Yakult catcher Atsuya Furuta when he
tried to steal.
	   ``I am happy to be playing in Japan right now and be part of the
all-star team. There are a lot of great guys on the team,'' Jones
said.
	   Ishii said he knew right away it was a home run.
	   ``They didn't let the fans down, and I got hit,'' he said.
	   Sosa's each at-bat was welcomed with whistles and cheers from
the stands at the Tokyo Dome.
	   The Cubs star's race with Mark McGwire for the major league
season home run record was almost as closely watched in
baseball-loving Japan as it was back home.
	   Sosa finished a disappointing 1-for-4 for the day but managed to
please the fans with his running finesse in the second inning.
	   After hitting to center and advancing to second on a hit by Greg
Vaughn of the Padres, Sosa dashed to third, sliding in head first
after Yomiuri Giants first baseman Kazuhiro Kiyohara caught a foul
from Colorado slugger Vinny Castilla.
	   Braves catcher Javy Lopez brought Sosa home with a hit along the
third baseline for the first run for the U.S. all-stars.
	   It wasn't until the fourth inning that Japan finally had a hit,
by Orix outfielder Ichiro Suzuki _ one of just three hits majors
starter Jamie Moyer of Seattle gave up in five innings.
	   Suzuki stole second, then third. Giants outfielder Hideki Matsui
then batted in Japan's only run with a hit to left field.

French govt launches France Telecom stake sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French government on Saturday launched the sale
of a second tranche in France Telecom, a year after beginning the
largest privatization project in French history.
	   A statement by the Finance Ministry said it would sell 51
million France Telecom shares, with an option of up to an
additional 15 million shares -- equivalent to about 13 percent of
the company's capital. Pre-placement is to begin on Monday.
	   The government also is to sell a 2 percent stake in France
Telecom to Germany's Deutsche Telecom. France Telecom will issue a
5 percent capital increase.
	   Pricing on the shares is to be set after the close of the
pre-placement, which usually lasts about two weeks. The maximum
price is to be announced later.
	   Once the operations are complete, the government will hold about
62 percent of France Telecom.
	   France Telecom, a symbol of the state that reaches into almost
all French homes, began the privatization process in October 1997,
selling off a 20 percent stake to institutional and individual
investors.
	   Under the sale plan for the second tranche, the leftist
government will sell around 32 million shares to individual buyers
and around 19 million shares to institutional buyers. Institutional
buyers will also be able to buy 18.75 million shares which France
Telecom will issue the government in its free warrant offer.
	   Up to 7 million shares destined for institutional investors
could be sold instead to individuals if demand is sufficient, the
Finance Ministry said.
	   The additional 15 million shares which may be sold would come
from current state-owned shares and could be sold either to
individual, institutions, or both.
	   The price offered to individuals will be at least 10 francs
(dlrs 1.80) below that offered to institutions, the Finance
Ministry added. Shares sold in 1997 went for 182 francs (dlrs 33 at
today's exchange rate) per share to individuals and five francs
more to institutions.
	   According to market-watchers, France Telecom is looking to raise
up to 50 billion francs (dlrs 9 billion) from the sale. The French
government in early October postponed the second tranche sale,
citing poor market conditions.

Taiwan grounds Dornier 228s after Taipei runway skid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's UNI Airlines grounded its fleet
of Dornier 228 commuter planes Saturday after one spun off the
runway at Taipei, temporarily halting flights to the outlying Matsu
island.
	   The airline's three Dornier's will be turned over for safety
inspections, keeping them on the ground until at least Monday,
Taiwan Television reported.
	   The announcement followed the skidding of a Dornier off the
runway at Taipei's Sungshan domestic airport as it was taxiing for
takeoff. None of the 15 persons on board were injured and
passengers were taken on to Matsu aboard helicopters hired by the
airline.
	   The cause of the accident was still under investigation, but
passengers said they felt a strong vibration before the plane
veered off into the grass alongside the runway.
	   Taiwanese airlines have had a series of problems with the
German-made, 15-19 seat Dornier 228, used on routes to outlying
islands.
	   Citing landing and mechanical problems, the Civil Aeronautics
Administration grounded UNI airlines' three Dorniers in August
after one skidded off the runway on Matsu Island.
	   A Formosa Airlines Dornier 228 crashed into a mountain on Matsu
in August 1997, just over a year after another of the airlines'
Dornier 228s fell into the sea off Matsu in April 1996, killing
five passengers.

Thai king leads cremation for `no problem' premier Chatichai
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ King Bhumibol Adulyadej led thousands
of Thais in Buddhist cremation ceremonies Saturday for Chaitichai
Choonhavan, the so-called ``no problem prime minister'' who died
earlier this year.
	   Thousands of politicians, family and friends witnessed the
cremation at the Thepsirin Temple in Bangkok after 150 days of
keeping Chatichai's body in state. Parts of the ceremony were
broadcast live on television.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai wrote in the visitor's book that
Chatichai's death was a serious loss to the country.
	   The cigar-smoking, wine-loving Chatichai died at the age of 76
on May 5 in a London hospital from complications from cancer.
	   Chatichai earned the sobriquet the ``no problem prime minister''
due to his mantra-like answer when posed with questions about
Thailand's troubles during his premiership from 1988 to 1991.
	   The period was an economic boom for Thailand, and Chatichai and
his government were constantly beset by allegations of corruption _
leading to the military coup that toppled him.
	   Civilian rule returned in 1992 and Chatichai remained the head
of the Chart Pattana Party, which was a member of several unstable
coalition governments.
	   But he saw his hopes of becoming prime minister again dashed
last year when Chuan and his Democrat Party emerged from political
infighting to succeed Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, whose premiership saw
the collapse of the Thai economy.

Prosecuted Belgrade daily prints again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Popular Belgrade daily Dnevni
Telegraf reappeared on newsstands Saturday after weeks of political
and legal controversy, bans and lawsuits against the paper critical
of President Slobodan Milosevic's rule.
	   Some 60,000 copies of the independent daily were sold within
hours Saturday morning after the paper's management found a
loophole to continue publishing by re-registering the paper from
Serbia in Montenegro, the other Yugoslav republic.
	   The paper, along with another daily, got banned last month by a
government decree that effectivly imposed censorship, requiring
strictly ``patriotic'' coverage of events, especially the ongoing
crisis in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   The decree was later superseded by a general, restrictive law on
public information which resulted in a lawsuit and hefty fines for
the paper's publisher and editors, whose articles in a sister
weekly magazine were deemed anti-state activity.
	   The police had even raided the newspaper's office, hauling away
equipment to collect some of dlrs 246,000 in fines.
	   But publishing resumed despite a brief attempt late Friday by
the police and internal revenue officials to halt the actual
printing of Dnevni Telegraf. Newspaper managers said they
eventually persuaded the officials to give up because Dnevni
Telegraf now has a new legal identity, registered in comparatively
more democratic Montenegro, the other republic in rump Yugoslavia.

Yeltsin lashes out against communists on Revolution Day.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Calling Russia's revolutionary period
``irrevocably over,'' President Boris Yeltsin lashed out against
his communist opponents Saturday in a nationally televised
television address on the 81st anniversary of Russia's revolution.
	   Yeltsin's speech came during nationwide protests timed to
coincide with the anniversary. Communists called for his ouster,
the abolishment of the presidency and a return to Soviet-style
economic planning.
	   ``Yes, they (the Communists) again came out with red banners,
they again blamed reforms and called for cancellation of the
presidency, but only fanatics could call for a massacre or an
uprising like in October 1917,'' the president said.
	   Yeltsin, who is recuperating from his latest illness at the
southern Black Sea resort of Sochi, also accused the Communists of
taking advantage of his political and economic reforms while
demanding their reversal at the same time.
	   ``Today's Communists fully enjoy the results of democracy, from
the free market to freedom of assembly and especially freedom of
press,'' Yeltsin said.
	   ``Their party programs aren't only about the bright future and
social fairness. There appears also democracy and private property.
Free enterprise and the financial market. And there's not one word
about the old (Communist) values _ the fight against religion, the
hegemony of the proletariat, world revolution.''
	   Yeltsin's popularity is in the single digits, and Russians
generally express disappointment with him after he promised
sweeping reform and a better future after the collapse of the
Soviet Union.
	   Even though anger with Yeltsin has grown in the last few months
as he continues to be sidelined for health reasons, opposition
leaders have failed to mount any serious threat to his presidency.
	   Looking pale and speaking slowly, Yeltsin also claimed that
Russia had gone too far down the path of reform to go back.
	   ``No matter how much (the communists) curse reforms, the most
important have been done.'' Reforms ``turned around not only the
course of history, but also the outlook of the people. From enmity
and hatred to tolerance and dialogue.''

Malaysia finance ministry in talks with World Bank on loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia is holding talks with the
World Bank to secure a dlrs 700 million loan from the institution,
Malaysia's junior finance minister said Saturday.
	   Malaysia obtained dlrs 300 million in credit to finance rural
development and social spending plans in July. But further
disbursements have been delayed by the country's decision to impose
some controls on the flow of capital in early September.
	   Talks on releasing the remaining amount were held between
Mustapa Mohamed, the junior finance minister, and visiting World
Bank vice president Jean-Michael Severino.
	   ``There's been some progress,'' Mustapa told reporters. ``We're
working on the details of this lending.''
	   He stressed that the World Bank hadn't stopped the loans,
because there hadn't been a definite agreement made to get further
credit from the World Bank.
	   Mustapa also reiterated that Malaysia won't remove its capital
controls until there is a significant commitment from the world's
leading economies to curb destabilizing capital flows.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad imposed the capital controls as
part of his strategy to pull Malaysia out of its worst recession in
more than a decade.
	   On Saturday Mahathir ruled out relaxing currency controls for
fear that the move could expose Malaysia once again to speculative
attacks by currency traders.
	   ``As long as currency trading is not regulated by the
international community and certain countries, there is no
guarantee that currency traders would not return to stage another
attack once they have overcome their present problems,'' he said.

Aid flown to Nicaragua in wake of Hurricane Mitch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ An Iberia jet took off from Spain on
Saturday to bring tons of medicine, food, water and other supplies
to thousands of Central America's victims of Hurricane Mitch.
	   In all, about 55 tons of supplies donated by the Spanish branch
of the Red Cross were shipped to Managua. The Boeing 747, the
national airline's biggest plane, also carried members of Spanish
humanitarian groups.
	   ``There is a lack of everything there and a long task to
rehabilitate the region,'' Leopoldo Gomez, secretary-general of
Spain's Red Cross, said at Madrid's Barajas airport.
	   The Spanish government approved 1.89 billion pesetas (dlrs 13.4
million) in emergency aid Friday to the four countries affected by
the hurricane: Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador, and
it temporarily suspended the deportation of illegal immigrants from
these countries.
	   In less than a week, Spain's humanitarian groups have collected
4.5 billion pesetas (dlrs 31 million) for Central America.
	   Hurricane Mitch has killed thousands and caused widespread
damage in what were already some of the world's poorest countries.
Scores more are missing and tens of thousands were left homeless.

Portuguese to vote on creation of regional assemblies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portuguese are to vote in a referendum
Sunday on whether to create regional assemblies which would be
responsible for administration, planning and development policy in
their areas.
	   The proposal, backed by the Socialist government and the
Portuguese Communist Party, would devolve limited administrative
powers to elected assemblies in eight regions.
	   The assemblies would recommend policies to the central
government _ which would have the final say _ and then carry them
out in conjunction with local councils.
	   In the 15-nation European Union, only Portugal and Greece have
maintained a centralized model of government.
	   Even so, the center-right Social Democrat Party and the rightist
Popular Party oppose the move, saying there is no need to divide up
a country of just 9.9 million people.
	   They insist the move will increase public spending and
bureaucratic red tape.
	   Supporters of the proposal say the move will bring democracy
closer to the people and that the cost will be minimal. Neither
side has said exactly how much they think it will cost.
	   An opinion poll published last week by daily Publico found that
37 percent of those questioned were against the proposal, while 23
percent favored it.
	   Of the 13,000 people questioned in the national survey, 27
percent did not know how they would vote, 11 percent said they did
not intend to vote, and just over 1 percent said they would leave
their ballot blank.
	   The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
	   The ballot is also seen as a test for the policy of holding
referendums, which were introduced last year.
	   Almost 70 percent of the country's 8.4 million eligible voters
stayed away from the first-ever referendum, on abortion, in June.
	   A referendum's result is binding only if more than half of
registered voters participate.
	   Final results of Sunday's referendum were expected Monday.

Azerbaijani police club and arrest protesters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Police used clubs to beat demonstrators
and disperse 2,000 marchers Saturday who sought to protest last
month's presidential elections, which they said were undemocratic,
according to a news report.
	   Dozens of protesters were either beaten, arrested or both by
police, who never allowed the march to begin in the capital Baku,
the Turan news agency reported. At least 10 suffered injuries, it
said.
	   The rally was organized by Etibar Mamedov, leader of the
National Independence Party, who finished a distant second to the
country's authoritarian leader Geidar Aliev in presidential
elections in October.
	   Aliev won another term with 76 percent of the vote last month.
Mamedov captured only 11 percent, and claimed the poll was rigged.
Most opposition groups boycotted the election, and international
observers said it was undemocratic.
	   The marchers initially gathered at a subway station, but a large
police contingent began beating demonstrators and blocked their
planned route, the report said.
	   Police also blocked the headquarters of the National
Independence Party and did not allow Mamedov to take part in the
march, the report said.
	   The marchers sought to re-form the demonstration at Baku State
University, but were again beaten back by police, the report added.
	   Human rights groups have repeatedly criticized Aliev for his
crackdowns against opposition groups. Aliev, 75, led Azerbaijan
when it was part of the Soviet Union and reclaimed power in a 1993
coup.

	   THANE, India (AP) _ A five-story apartment building collapsed
Saturday in southern India's Maharashtra state, killing at least
five people, injuring 11 others and trapping about 40, news
agencies reported.
	   Press Trust of India said fire department officials put the toll
at 13 dead, but that police and hospital sources could confirm only
five deaths in the collapse at Thane, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
north of Bombay, India's largest city.
	   United News of India news agency added that workers were
clearing the debris and looking for survivors and bodies.
	   The structure, with about 60 apartments, was put up without
obtaining building licenses and was erected in a water drainage
area in violation of building codes, Maharashtra Labor Minister
Shabbir Sheikh told PTI. Such violations are common in India, often
resulting in fatal accidents.

Police search American school, interview students
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NADIA RYBAROVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Police searched a private American
school in south Moravia on Friday, acting on suspicions that
educational methods there are too harsh, the school's secretary
said Saturday.
	   Martina Krystofova said police searched the school's premises
Friday afternoon and took some of the students out for interviews.
More interviews will follow, she said.
	   Nobody was immediately available for comment at police
headquarters in Brno, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of
Prague. The regions of Bohemia and Moravia make up the territory of
the Czech Republic.
	   The police search came only three days after media reported that
the Brno school in fact was a correction facility for American
teenagers with behavior problems.
	   Based on information from unnamed former employees of the
school, media said that the children were being inadequately
punished and were forbidden to leave the premises.
	   Martin Pilka, the co-owner of Morava Academy agency that runs
the school, told The Associated Press earlier this week that the
school is a regular boarding school for American teenagers who at
home were neglecting school and also had problems to get along with
their families.
	   He ruled out any harsh methods, saying the children were being
regularly taken out for walks and excursions.
	   Pilka said that the school has 60 students age 15-18. The first
students arrived in Brno in March. The course takes 8 to 10 months,
he said. But he claimed the school is accepted in the United States
as part of the U.S. educational system.
	   Pilka explained it is part of a broader project including twelve
similar institutions in different parts of the world.
	   ``Mr. Atkin likes it here and wanted the children to get to know
Europe, that's why he opted for the Czech Republic,'' Pilka said.
Ralph Atkin from St. George, Utah, is the majority owner of Morava
Academy, according to Pilka, who holds the minority share.
	   According to private NOVA television, parents pay dlrs 80 per
day for each kid.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Prague said they are aware of the school's
existence here but have no legal means to check a private
institution.
	   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said Saturday that representatives
of a non-governmental Fund for Children in Danger also visited the
school but found no evidence for the allegations.

Sainz in sight of title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Spain's Carlos Sainz is in sight of the
world championship following a blunder by rival and title holder
Tommi Makinen in Rally Australia on Saturday.
	   Makinen, seeking a third world title, made a costly mistake in
the 2.2-kilometer (1.36-mile) 19th stage at Langley Park. The Finn,
driving a Mitsubishi, was penalized 1 minute for jumping the start
in the short stage and he tumbled from second to sixth, 1 minute,
22 seconds behind Sainz.
	   Sainz, driving a Toyota, took over the lead in an eventful day
of racing.
	   With only the RAC Rally in Britain to go, Sainz can wrap up the
championship Sunday if he wins and Makinen finishes worse than
fifth.
	   Sainz went to the front when leader Richard Burns of England
rolled his Mitsubishi in the 14th stage and lost his 1 minute, 20
second lead over the field.
	   He managed to continue as he limped to the service park, but
lost more time with a damaged turbocharger.
	   Sainz inherited the lead from Burns as Frenchman Didier Auriol
held down second spot in another Toyota.
	   Makinen had to battle back after a penalty for a late service
exit on Friday and had climbed into second before his mishap in the
final stage Saturday.
	   At the end of racing, Sainz held a strong 35.4-second lead over
Auriol with Burns in third, Juha Kankkunen fourth and Colin McRae
fifth.

British say force must remain an option in Iraq confrontation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Defense Secretary George Robertson insisted
Saturday that the use of force must remain an option in the effort
to make Saddam Hussein back down in his latest confrontation with
the United Nations over weapons monitoring.
	   Robertson, who goes to Kuwait on Sunday to see British troops,
told BBC Radio that the time for military action had not yet come.
	   ``But it is still an option there because Saddam has reneged on
the agreement he came to in February of this year'' with United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Iraq announced Oct. 31 it was halting all cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the destruction of Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   The U.N. Security Council remains divided on whether to
authorize military strikes as favored by the United States and
Britain.
	   ``Force is not the preferred option, it's not the best option
but it has to be an option because in many ways that is the only
thing Saddam recognizes,'' Robertson said.
	   ``The world community,'' he said, was ``absolutely united in
telling him he must comply with the Security Council resolutions
and we are absolutely determined to get over the message in the
Gulf and elsewhere that this man represents a threat not just to
his neighbors but to the stability of the world as a whole.''
	   He said, however, that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was not a
matter for the international community, but for the people of Iraq
who he believed would oust Saddam eventually.
	   ``We assist the democratic alternatives to Saddam but it is not
the function of this country or the U.N. to set about removing
people from power,'' he said. ``That is not the function of
international law. There is no basis for doing that.''
	   Ahmed Chalabi, president of the opposition Iraqi National
Congress, based in London, told the BBC that any campaign to bomb
Iraq would be counterproductive because there was no serious
attempt to overthrow Saddam.
	   There ``had only been futile attempts'' to fuel a palace coup
against Saddam, he said.
	   He welcomed the Iraq Liberation Act, legislation introduced last
month by U.S. Republicans in Congress to provide nearly dlrs 100
million in military aid to Iraqi opposition groups trying to oust
Saddam.
	   Chalabi called for the Iraqi resistance to be given weapons and
training to overthrow Saddam.

Iraqi Kurd leader: Kurd federation hinges on dialogue with a `free

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An Iraqi Kurdish leader said Saturday a
proposed Kurdish federation in northern Iraq could be formed only
through dialogue with a free Iraqi government.
	   In September, a U.S.-backed deal that sealed a cease-fire
between the two Iraqi Kurdish factions that control northern Iraq
referred to a future federal authority for Kurds.
	   ``That is the wish of our people,'' Masoud Barzani, leader of
the Kurdistan Democratic Party, told a news conference in Ankara.
``The Kurdish regional parliament in 1992 declared this principal
vital.''
	   However, he said, ``this can only be implemented with the
central government in Baghdad when there is free Iraq.''
	   The reference to a federal structure for Kurds had angered
Turkey. Turkey opposes creation of a Kurdish state in northern
Iraq, fearing it inspire Turkey's own Kurdish rebels in their fight
for autonomy.
	   But Turkish leaders declared themselves reassured the plan would
not lead to creation of a Kurdish state after meeting with Barzani
on Wednesday.
	   ``We do not call for the establishment of an independent Kurdish
state, nor have Americans encouraged us to do so, at all,'' Barzani
said. ``We know that this is not a realistic objective and we know
the consequences of calling for an independent Kurdish state in
this region.''
	   Repeatedly throughout Kurdish history, Kurds rebellions were
crushed by forces of states in which they have lived. At present,
they are divided by five national borders.
	   ``Therefore, really, we look for what is possible for our people
under these circumstances,'' Barzani said.
	   He made no direct reference to Saddam Hussein. Saddam rejected
Kurds' 1992 call for a federal authority, saying Kurds should be
satisfied with the limited autonomy he offered them in 1978.
	   Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit said Wednesday that Barzani agreed
that ``any solution to northern Iraq has to be within the
territorial integrity of Iraq.''
	   Under the September accord, Barzani and Jalal Talabani of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan agreed to share power and hold
elections in the de facto autonomous Kurdish zone in northern Iraq,
set up after 1991 Gulf War.
	   Barzani said the elections were scheduled for July.
	   Talabani is also due to arrive in Ankara later in the day. He is
expected to meet with Barzani on Sunday.
	   Barzani said they would discuss details of carrying out the
accord.

	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Police on Saturday arrested two Israeli
men on suspicion of spying, and a court ordered them detained for
eight days pending investigations.
	   The two were produced in the Larnaca District Court hours after
police raided and searched their apartment near an army camp
shortly after midnight in the village of Ziyi near the south
coastal town of Larnaca.
	   Sgt. Kyriakos Kyriacou, the police lawyer for Larnaca district,
told the court that an investigation is being conducted against the
two for spying against the Cypriot army.
	   He said police found in their apartment ``documents which may
constitute the crime of spying.'' He did not elaborate.
	   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
two men are suspected of spying for Israel on behalf of Turkey. The
two countries have a military alliance.
	   Justice Minister Nikos Koshis was also quoted by Cyprus state
radio as saying that it should not be assumed they were spying for
Israel.
	   This was seen as an inference that spying, if any, might be for
Turkey, which has occupied the northern third of the island since a
1974 invasion in the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of
union with Greece.
	   Kyriacou said police found cameras, wireless instruments, a tape
recorder with tapes of conversations in Greek between police patrol
cars and tourist maps in the apartment. Also confiscated were radio
scanners, which are banned in Cyprus, he said.
	   The two men were identified as Udi Hargov, 27 and Igal Damary,
49. They will appear in court again on Nov. 16 when either formal
charges will be filed or the prosecution might ask for further
remand.
	   Kyriacou said the pair arrived in Cyprus Friday. They had also
visited Cyprus and stayed in Ziyi between Oct. 15 and Oct. 22 when
the army was conducting its annual exercise nearby.
	   The two men were under surveillance, he said.
	   The arrest came only three days after Israeli President Ezer
Weizman ended a three-day visit to the island this week. The visit,
the first by an Israeli president, was hailed as ushering in a new
era in the lukewarm relations between the two countries.
	   The visit was nevertheless overshadowed by repeated expressions
of concern by President Glafcos Clerides over Israel's military
cooperation agreement with Turkey.
	   Weizman said before leaving he was sorry he had not succeeded in
persuading the Greek Cypriots that Israel's cooperation with Turkey
was not directed against Cyprus or any other party.
	   Once a hotbed of Arab-Israeli espionage, spying activity has
been muted recently in Cyprus.
	   In the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was a listening post for the
intelligence agents of Israel as well as the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which was based in Lebanon, a half-hour flight from
this Mediterranean island.

Death toll rises as Albanian rebels try to assert authority

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Violence in Kosovo is growing
despite an accord meant to end bloodshed in the turbulent Serbian
province and set the stage for a political agreement between Serb
authorities and Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   Five suspected ethnic Albanian guerrillas died Friday in a
shootout with Serb police, according to a Serb media statement.
	   The deaths raised the number of ethnic Albanians killed since
Thursday afternoon to seven. Foreign observers say attacks by both
Serb forces and Kosovo guerrillas have increased this week, as the
United States and European nations try to push ahead with the Oct.
12 agreement with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Each side blames the other for the latest violence.
	   Nevertheless, plans for setting up a 2,000-member Kosovo
Verification Mission went ahead Saturday.
	   An advance team for 74 American observers, who have been in
Belgrade this past week, was coming to Kosovo, Richard Huckaby, the
spokesman for the U.S. sector of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission, said Saturday.
	   Milosevic stripped the majority Albanians of self-rule in 1989
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
That sparked protests and increased violence that led to his
crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in February.
	   The rebels have rejected any political agreement that stops
short of full independence for Kosovo, although they have
grudgingly agreed to stop fighting if not attacked.
	   Huckaby, the U.S. spokesman, said in Pristina that Saturday
fewer than 10 of the 74 American observers would come to the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission headquarters in Kosovo's capital. The
new observers are from DynCorp, a U.S. company of military
specialists.
	   The KDOM mission, which started in July, eventually will be
absorbed into the larger Kosovo verification mission.
	   KDOM chief Shaun Byrnes met with Adem Demaci, the political
spokesman for the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army, at Demaci's
headquarters in Pristina on Saturday. No details were immediately
available.
	   Byrnes has said that KDOM officials meet regularly with the
ethnic Albanian guerrillas to explain the accord in which Milosevic
agreed to the withdrawal of Serbian police and Yugoslav army
troops, to the return of all refugees and negotiations toward a
political settlement of the Kosovo conflict.

Department store boosts wages after strike in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A major department store
chain, Edgars, has agreed to boost minimum monthly wage to 1,500
rand (dlrs 270) for its employees after a six-week strike.
	   The wage boost _ about 100 rand (dlrs 17) a month for all
workers _ was negotiated through the official Commission for
Conciliation, Arbitration and Mediation, a spokesman said Friday.
	   The strike followed an announcement in late September that
Edgars would have to freeze wages because of a 28 percent slump in
profits.
	   The two unions involved initially demanded wage increases of 15
to 20 percent, which the company said would force it to cut back
jobs.
	   The number of total employees was not known.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Fifteen U.N. weapons inspectors, including
missile experts, left Baghdad on Saturday in the first stage of the
U.N. reduction of its teams in Iraq.
	   The withdrawal comes a week after Iraq said it was halting all
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   In response, UNSCOM said Friday it will withdraw 26 people from
its staff of about 130.
	   Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters that Iraq's
position on halting cooperation ``still stands.''
	   He was the first Cabinet minister to comment publicly since a
Security Council resolution Thursday called the Iraqi position a
``flagrant violation'' of previous U.N. resolutions and urged Iraq
to allow the UNSCOM inspectors to do their work.
	   Iraq says inspections can resume only if the council gives a
timetable for the lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait. But sanctions can't be lifted until UNSCOM
certifies Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM here, said the 15 experts
leaving Saturday included four based in Baghdad and 11 who were on
a special assignment. The 11 included some six members of a missile
team.
	   ``A visiting missile team ... just happened to be here when Iraq
made its announcement,'' she said.
	   ``The support staff is staying in place,'' Ms. Cross said.
``They have the qualifications to resume work immediately should
Iraq have a change of heart.''
	   The experts left from an air base outside Baghdad on at flight
to Bahrain, the spokeswoman said. More inspectors will leave Monday
and Wednesday, she said.
	   The standoff has raised fears of a military strike by the United
States and Britain.
	   On Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen returned from a
tour of Arab nations and Turkey, saying he was satisfied the United
States would have adequate support from Arab allies to carry out
military action.
	   But other members of the Security Council oppose military
strikes.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement Friday that
armed actions are ``fraught with most unpredictable consequences
for peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a
whole.''
	   Besides UNSCOM, experts from the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency are also in Iraq, dealing with
its compliance on nuclear issues. IAEA monitors have not been
banned by Iraq.
	   Cross said a nuclear team went into the field to continue
monitoring work Saturday. No details were available.
	   Meanwhile, Prakash Shah, the envoy of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan in Baghdad, said the Security Council has asked Annan to
help resolve the standoff. Annan signed an agreement with Iraq on
Feb. 23 to end a previous crisis over inspections of presidential
palaces.

Judge escaped assassination attempt

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An unidentified gunman Saturday fired at the
car of a judge who has gained the ire of Muslim extremist groups by
sentencing many militants to death, police said. The judge escaped
unhurt.
	   Ahmed Salaheddin Baddour, the head of the Supreme State Security
Court, was driving out of the northern city of Alexandria toward
the capital Cairo when a single shot slammed into his car, police
said.
	   Two armed body guards in the car returned fire in all directions
but were unable to locate the sniper, said police officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity. They refused to give details.
	   Baddour has been dubbed the ``death judge'' by the opposition
media for handing harsh sentences on militants. He has received
death threats in the past and lawyers representing the militants
have often asked for his removal.
	   More than 1,200 people have died since 1992 in a militant
insurgency against the state aimed at installing a strict Islamic
state. Eighty-one militants have been sentenced to death by various
courts.

Israelis detained in Cyprus on suspicion of spying

	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek Cypriot police arrested two Israeli
men Saturday on suspicion of spying, and a court ordered them
detained pending investigation.
	   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
two men were suspected of spying for Israel on behalf of Turkey.
The two countries have a military alliance.
	   Justice Minister Nikos Koshis was also quoted by Cyprus state
radio as saying that it should not be assumed they were spying for
Israel.
	   This was seen as an inference that spying, if any, might be for
Turkey, which has occupied the northern third of the island of
Cyprus since a 1974 invasion in the wake of an abortive coup by
supporters of union with Greece.
	   In the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was a listening post for the
intelligence agents of Israel as well as the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which was based in Lebanon, a half-hour flight from
the Mediterranean island.
	   The suspects appeared in Larnaca District Court hours after
police raided and searched their apartment in the village of Ziyi
shortly after midnight. Ziyi is near an army camp and the southern
coastal town of Larnaca.
	   Sgt. Kyriakos Kyriacou, the police lawyer for the district, told
the court that an investigation is being conducted of whether the
two spied on the Cypriot army.
	   Kyriacou said the pair arrived in Cyprus on Friday. They also
visited Cyprus and stayed in Ziyi between Oct. 15 and Oct. 22, when
the army was conducting its annual exercise nearby. The two men
were under surveillance, he said.
	   The men were identified as Udi Hargov, 27 and Igal Damary, 49.
They will appear in court again on Nov. 16 when formal charges
could be filed or the prosecution might ask for further remand.
	   The arrest came three days after Israeli President Ezer Weizman
ended a three-day visit to the island. The visit, the first by an
Israeli president, was hailed as ushering in a new era in the
lukewarm relations between the two countries.

Ethiopian leader warns Eritrea as talks due to begin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Ethiopia's prime minister
arrived for peace talks Saturday with a warning that a six-month
border feud with neighboring Eritrea will continue unless Eritrea
withdraws from disputed territory.
	   Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said Ethiopia was hoping for peace
but prepared for a prolonged frontier squabble.
	   ``I'm coming here seeking peace and justice. I wouldn't be here
if I had no hope of it succeeding,'' Meles said. ``But the
underlying problem has not been resolved and that is Eritrea has
invaded part of our territory and occupied it. Until it has been
resolved, one cannot expect complete tranquility.''
	   Meles was scheduled Saturday to meet in Burkina Faso's capital
with a mediation committee appointed by the Organization of African
Unity. Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki was also due to arrive
later in the day for separate talks with the committee, which has
developed a list of peace proposals.
	   Direct meetings between the rivals have not been scheduled and
Meles deflected questions of whether he was willing to speak
face-to-face with his counterpart.
	   Meetings are expected to continue on Sunday. The committee
comprises Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore, Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Djibouti's President Hassan
Ghouled Aptidon.
	   OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim has also arrived for the
meetings as has U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun.
	   Mediation efforts so far have failed to resolve the dispute.
Ethiopian officials have said they are committed to a U.S.-Rwanda
peace proposal forwarded earlier this year, which requires that
both sides withdraw to positions held before hostilities broke out
in May.
	   Eritrea, however, has rejected that proposal. Isaias, speaking
Thursday before departing for the talks, said the only way to end
the conflict was to declare a ceasefire and then demarcate the
common border.
	   After a lull in fighting between the two Horn of Africa nations,
sporadic fighting erupted over the past two weeks. Earlier this
week, two Ethiopian towns were reportedly shelled, with at least
nine people killed in one of them.
	   Several hundred people have been killed during the six months of
the dispute.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and was granted
independence in 1993, but the border between the two countries has
never been officially demarcated.

Islamic terrorist reported in the Czech Republic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ An Islamic terrorist suspect was
reported to have spent some time in the Czech Republic recently,
showing interest in Radio Free Europe stationed in Prague, a
leading newspaper said Saturday.
	   The report in Lidove Noviny came only one week after the
U.S.-funded radio started its broadcasts to Iraq and Iran from
Czech territory. Czech government officials were not reachable on
Saturday.
	   The report did not say from what country the alleged terrorist
was.
	   The daily, which has been mostly reliable in the past, said the
information, which apparently leaked from the Czech government, was
confirmed by the Interior Ministry and the Czech intelligence
service, BIS.
	   ``The fact that this information leaked is awful,'' Lidove
Noviny quoted Jaroslav Basta, minister without portfolio, who is in
charge of secret services in the Czech Republic, as saying.
	   Basta said not all the government was informed about the alleged
terrorist's presence in the country but refused to say who of the
ministers had the information.
	   Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty began transmitting from Munich,
Germany, in 1951, spreading uncensored news to Soviet-controlled
countries behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War between the
West and the Communist East.
	   It moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995 following the
collapse of communism six years earlier.
	   Last month, the Czech government allowed broadcasts into Iraq,
and the Farsi-language service into Iran was approved in August.
The government, however, expressed serious concerns about possible
security risks.
	   Last Tuesday, Iran recalled its ambassador from Prague to
protest the broadcasts.
	   The BIS is worried that the leak can threaten its anti-terrorist
operation which is carried out along with partner services from
abroad, Lidove Noviny said.
	   Basta denied allegations the leak was aimed at providing
arguments for those who were opposing the broadcasts to Iran and
Iraq, the daily said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ For the first time since the trial
of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim began last week,
Malaysians held an anti-government demonstration Saturday.
	   A few hundred people gathered in the rain outside a mosque in
central Kuala Lumpur, shouting slogans against Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
	   There were few policemen at the scene and no violence was
reported. A small peaceful protest was held in the same area,
called Kampong Baru, last Saturday.
	   Wearing badges saying ``Justice for Anwar,'' supporters screamed
``Mahathir Resign'' and ``Reformasi,'' the Malay word for reforms.
	   Passing cars honked in solidarity and some motorcycle riders let
go their handlebars to hold aloft Anwar's portraits which were
being handed out.
	   Activists also made a bonfire of a pro-Mahathir banner that was
taken down from a nearby street and burned copies of a
pro-government Malay-language newspaper.
	   On Oct. 24, the country's first violent protest in almost three
decades broke out at the same site. Police fired tear gas shells
and water cannons to disperse stone-pelting activists.
	   Saturday's demonstration in Kampong Baru was the first one since
Anwar's trial began in the High Court on Monday. Anwar faces 10
counts of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   Street protests erupted in Malaysia after Anwar was fired from
his post and then arrested on Sept. 20. Demonstrators have demanded
Mahathir's ouster and justice for Anwar.
	   Hundreds of people had been detained during recent downtown
rallies demanding justice for Anwar. Police have warned they will
come down hard on participants in the banned protests.

Unions plan weekly strike protest against Zimbabwe gas price hike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions on
Saturday called for its one million members to strike one day a
week until the Zimbabwe government cancels a 67 percent fuel price
hike.
	   ``We have agreed to embark on a mass stay away every Wednesday
until these issues are ironed out,'' said Morgan Tsvangirai,
secretary general of the trade union group.
	   The decision was made by the group's national council.
	   A strike by private taxis and buses against the price hike kept
most workers from reaching their work places on Wednesday in the
capital of Zimbabwe, as the former Rhodesia is now known.
	   Some workers were on the job later in the week as heavily armed
government troops kept watch in outlying townships to prevent
protests.
	   Defense Minister Moven Mahachi said the army is preventing
anarchy.
	   Tsvangirai charged that President Robert Mugabe had violated an
agreement made in September that the government would consult with
unions and employers before instituting major economic changes,
such as the fuel price hike.
	   ``We cannot trust people who violate the very next day
agreements they have entered into. That is a very serious
betrayal,'' Tsvangirai said.
	   Worsening economic hardships and civil unrest are seen as the
biggest threat to Mugabe, who recently committed 6,000 troops to
backing the Congolese government in a civil war.

Pakistan pins high hopes on lifting of sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Sharif receives letter from
Clinton telling him of decision to waive sanctions, minor edits. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Battered by international sanctions
that have put Pakistan on the brink of economic collapse,
government officials welcomed the good news Saturday that
Washington had decision to lift some restrictions.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton wrote Pakistan's Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif to tell him, according to a foreign ministry statement
issued in the Pakistani capital.
	   The government is hoping this will be a ''harbinger of the
elimination of all sanctions, which Pakistan has consistently
maintained are unjustified and counterproductive,'' the ministry
statement said.
	   In his letter, Clinton assured Sharif that the U.S.
administration would ''exercise its influence with the
international financial institutions to meet Pakistan's economic
difficulties,'' the statement said.
	   This is good news for Pakistan, which is in the midst of
troubled talks with the International Monetary Fund for a dlrs 5
billion bailout package, without which Islamabad will surely
default on its dlrs 32 billion debt.
	   Sanctions imposed on both Pakistan and India following
underground nuclear tests in May hit this poor nation of 140
million particularly hard because of its heavy dependence on
international borrowing.
	   Neighboring India, which had foreign reserves in excess of dlrs
25 billion, was better able to weather the storm.
	   Less dependent on international aid, the Indian economy has not
been hit as hard, but Indian foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh
called the reported U.S. step ``positive.''
	   The Indian economy has only recently begun to open up to foreign
investment, and U.S. companies had been eager to do business in a
country with a population approaching 1 billion.
	   ``Washington's decision is an admission such punitive actions
are restricting U.S. diplomacy,'' said Brahma Chellany at the
Center for Policy research in New Delhi.
	   Clinton's decision followed progress by both India and Pakistan
on curbing their nuclear weapons program and promising to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, according to U.S. officials.
	   But in newspapers in Pakistan on Saturday, Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad made it clear that Pakistan will not sign the test
ban treaty during Sharif's visit to Washington next month.
	   ``We are not going to sign the CTBT at this moment,'' the
English language daily newspaper The News quoted Ahmed as saying.
	   Pakistan has repeatedly said it would not be ``coerced'' into
signing any international nuclear treaty. The lifting of the
sanctions, however, may be the signal Pakistan needed to sign.
	   The waiver will allow Pakistan's army to participate in the
International Military and Education Training Program, which
according to Clinton's letter is ''an important step toward
creating the kind of security relationship that is appropriate for
the next century.''
	   According to the foreign ministry statement issued in Islamabad,
Clinton wrote that he intended to ''lift restrictions on private
U.S. bank lending and to authorize overseas private investment
corporation, U.S. export-import bank and the trade and development
agency to resume financial and commercial activities in Pakistan.''
	   ``This is very good news for us,'' said Ashfaq Ahmed, economic
advisor to the government.
	   Market analysts said they hoped the move would boost the stock
market.
	   Pakistan's economy has been teetering. Foreign exchange reserves
are barely dlrs 600 million, which will pay the bill for roughly
one month of imports.
	   Ali Hussein, a broker on the Karachi Stock Exchange, said the
U.S. administration decision paves the way for an IMF agreement and
will go a long way to inspiring shattered investor confidence in
Pakistan.
	   ``I think that first of all by lifting of sanctions on Pakistan
there will be a change of perception of foreign investors in
Pakistan,'' he said. ``We're hoping that this will result in an
optimistic attitude by the foreign investor and the stock market
will be bullish.''

Sao Tome and Principe to hold general elections

<TEXT>
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ Voters in Sao Tome and
Principe go to the polls Sunday in a general election that has
focused on the tiny West African island nation's deep economic
woes.
	   Eight political parties are taking part in the ballot for 55
parliamentary seats.
	   Campaigning has been dominated by the two major parties, which
are close to President Miguel Trovoada and former president Manuel
Pinto da Costa, the twin-island nation's main political figures and
serious rivals.
	   The six smaller parties have little cash for campaigning,
leaving the way clear for Pinto da Costa's governing Sao Tome and
Principe Liberation Movement/Social Democratic Party and Trovoada's
Independent Democratic Alliance.
	   Both parties have campaigned on a centrist platform with pledges
to relaunch stagnant economic growth in the impoverished country of
120,000 people.
	   The government's inability to improve living conditions means
the approximately 49,600 registered voters across seven districts
are expected to favor the IDA. Final results are expected Monday.
	   The unemployment rate hovers round 45 percent. The average
salary is about dlrs 220 per year, while a pair of shoes costs dlrs
50.
	   The economic troubles have sparked social unrest, including
strikes by teachers, health workers and other state employees over
the past year.
	   An aborted military coup in August 1995 led to the formation
four months later of a coalition government which has been in power
since then.
	   The economy relies largely on the export of tropical produce,
particularly cocoa, but the discovery earlier this year of oil in
the country's waters could remedy the economic ills and help pay
off foreign debt estimated at some dlrs 300 million.
	   Sao Tome and Principe lies in the Gulf of Guinea, about 150
miles (240 km) west of Gabon, which is one of the most active oil
exploration areas in the African continent.

Palestinian officials: Israel bears some responsibility in bombing

	   SILAT AL HARITHIYA, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian officials said
Saturday that Israel should not use a suicide bombing at a
Jerusalem market that killed the two assailants and wounded 21
Israelis as an excuse to stop the peace process.
	   One of Israel's key demands is that the Palestinians do more to
fight Islamic militants' attacks on Israelis.
	   The Palestinians, however, said the two bombers had come from
Israeli-controlled areas, so Israel bore at least part of the
security responsibility for Friday's attack.
	   Hours after the bombing at Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market,
Israel suspended Cabinet debate on the Wye River accord reached two
weeks ago. Ministers said action would resume only once Israel was
satisfied that Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority was doing all
it could to fight terror.
	   The Israeli military said it could not confirm the bombers'
identities and hometowns, but they were disclosed by Palestinian
security officials and reported by Palestinian media.
	   Their families said both were activists in the radical Islamic
Jihad group and that one had lived near the Anata refugee camp,
north of Jerusalem, while the other lived in the West Bank village
of Silat al Harithiya, outside the town of Jenin.
	   Both were killed when their car blew up at the entrance to
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market. Israeli authorities reportedly
found suitcases in the wreckage, suggesting the pair had intended
to hand-carry bombs into the crowded market and detonate them
there.
	   The families said the two met in Israeli jails and were related
by marriage. Both families held so-called mourning houses on
Saturday, but not actual funerals, since Israeli authorities still
have their bodies.
	   ``I didn't raise him to lose him like that,'' said Mohammed
Zughayar, 54, the father of Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar, 22. ``I'm
proud, but I'm sad because I loved my son.''
	   The family of Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 24, said he had been
married for three months to Zughayar's sister, Basma. They met when
she was visiting her brother, who was in prison with Dahayneh, the
family said.
	   Dahayneh had been angry and embittered since losing part of his
leg after he was shot during a clash with Israeli troops when he
was 13, his relatives said.
	   His wife showed visitors a letter she said he had written her
before the attack, saying, ``Not the Wye agreement, not the
Palestinian Authority, or the Israeli government, or even Clinton,
will stop me from meeting my God. If they can, let them stop me.''
	   Palestinian Cabinet Minister Nabil Shaath sharply criticized
Israel Saturday for suspending action on the accord.
	   ``This Israeli government is as guilty as those who want to
destroy the peace process with acts of violence,'' Shaath said in
Cairo. ``The Israeli government seems happy to continue
procrastinating.''
	   The Palestinian Cabinet condemned the attack following its own
meeting on Friday night.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, in a rare statement on Israeli
television, promised to track down the masterminds.
	   ``We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront
these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,'' he
said.
	   Israel has not announced a date for resumption of debate on
ratifying the accord. The delay almost certainly means a slowing of
the tight 12-week implementation timetable set down in the accord.
	   Friday's attack was the second suicide bombing since the signing
of the peace accord on Oct. 23. On Oct. 29, an activist from Hamas
killed himself and an Israeli soldier when he tried to ram an
explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish schoolchildren in
the Gaza Strip.

Cuba, Russia lead in quarterfinals round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tournament favorites Russia and Cuba won matches
Saturday to remain in the lead of their quarterfinals groups in the
Women's World Volleyball Championships.
	   Russia beat Japan 16-17, 15-7, 15-5, 15-8. After edging the
taller Russians in the first set, Japan had to accept its first
defeat of the tournament.
	   ``We lost, that's the fact,'' Japanese head coach Nobuchika
Kuzuwa said. ``The players did their best. I am sorry that their
concentration which we could see in the first set did not last.''
	   Russian team captain Valentina Oguienko said, ``On the whole we
did not play very well. The Japanese played very well supported by
a lot of fans, but we finally won.''
	   In other Group E matches at Nagoya, Peru defeated the Dominican
Republic 9-15, 15-12, 15-13, 8-15, 16-11.
	   The blocking of Yulissa Zamudio and strong defense of Leyla
Chihuan gave Peru the victory in an up-and-down game marked by an
exciting tie-break.
	   Brazil overpowered the Netherlands 15-5, 15-7, 15-3. Although,
Elles Leferink showed her talent at the net, the match was
dominated by the Brazilians.
	   In Group F at Fukuoka, Cuba, the Olympic champion and defending
World Volleyball Champions, outclassed South Korea 15-8, 15-2,
15-5.
	   China beat Italy 15-3, 15-8, 15-5. The Asian champion team took
just one hour to win the one-sided match.
	   Croatia defeated Bulgaria 15-9, 16-14, 11-15, 17-15. With the
victory, the runner-up of the two last European championships
remains in the running to reach the next round in Osaka.

One killed, many injured in clashes in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ One person was killed and scored
injured in clashes that erupted in the capital Saturday when
Bangladesh's main political party tried to commemorate a 1975
military coup.
	   Waliur Rahman, a leader of the youth wing of Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party, was shot and killed as rival
political activists fought with bombs and guns.
	   Opposition leader Khaleda Zia called for a nationwide general
strike Monday and Tuesday to protest the violence.
	   Politics in Bangladesh has long been marred by violence. The
country's first prime minister, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was the
current prime minister's father, was assassinated in August 1975.
In November that year, army officers who had come to power were
themselves ousted in a coup that paved the way for Khaleda Zia's
husband Gen. Zia ur Rahman to come to power. Zia ur Rahman was
assassinated in 1981 in a failed coup.
	   Khaleda Zia, who now heads her husband's Bangladesh Nationalist
Party, called a rally Saturday to commemorate what her party calls
the 1975 ``Nov. 7 peoples' soldiers revolution.''
	   Witnesses said a procession of Zia supporters headed to the
rally were attacked by governing party activists, and police then
fired tear gas shells.
	   More than 100 vehicles were damaged in the more than three-hour
melee. Police arrested more than 50 people.
	   Similar unrest was also reported in other Bangladeshi cities,
independent news agency United News of Bangladesh reported.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ It wasn't Sammy Sosa but Manny Ramirez who
delivered the home run for the Japanese fans.
	   And the Cleveland Indians outfielder gave them two as the team
of major league stars beat their Japanese counterparts Saturday 8-1
in the first of a seven-game exhibition series.
	   Ramirez, the game's MVP, belted a three-run homer in the seventh
inning off Daiei Hawks Tatsuji Nishimura.
	   Ramirez then blasted a two-run homer in the ninth, following a
hit by Brewer second baseman Fernando Vina.
	   ``I was surprised to hit two homers today,'' Ramirez told Kyodo
News agency. ``I was just trying to make contact and hit the ball
hard.''
	   The major leaguers led 3-1 after Atlanta Braves outfielder
Andruw Jones slammed a two-run home run off Yakult starter Kazuhisa
Ishii in the third inning.
	   ``I feel good,'' said Jones, who also singled in the fifth
inning but was thrown out at second by Yakult catcher Atsuya Furuta
when he tried to steal.
	   ``I am happy to be playing in Japan right now and be part of the
All-Star team. There are a lot of great guys on the team.''
	   Ishii said he knew right away it was a home run.
	   ``They didn't let the fans down, and I got hit,'' he said.
	   Each of Sosa's at-bats was welcomed with whistles and cheers
from the crowd at the Tokyo Dome.
	   The Chicago Cubs star's race with Mark McGwire for the major
league season home run record was almost as closely watched in
baseball-loving Japan as it was back home.
	   Sosa finished 1-for-4 for the day but pleased the fans with his
baserunning skill in the second inning.
	   After singling to center and advancing to second on a hit by
Greg Vaughn of the San Diego Padres, Sosa raced to third, sliding
in head first after Yomiuri Giants first baseman Kazuhiro Kiyohara
caught a foul ball from Colorado Rockies slugger Vinny Castilla.
	   Braves catcher Javy Lopez brought Sosa home with a hit along the
third baseline for the first run.
	   Japan was held hitless for three innings by Seattle Mariners
left-hander Jamie Moyer, who ended up allowing three hits in five
innings.
	   Moyer's changeups threw the Japanese off. Yomiuri outfielder
Hideki Matsui singled in Japan's only run in the fourth.

German conservatives choose new leader for post-Kohl era
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES and RECASTS with Kohl successor elected, more
quotes, background. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Faced with their worst defeat in postwar
German elections, the conservative Christian Democrats chose a new
leader Saturday to guide them into a future without Helmut Kohl.
	   Kohl gave up his grip on the party chairman's job in a tearful
farewell, the last act in a 16-year era that ended when voters
dumped him as chancellor on Sept. 27. Some 1,000 party delegates
elected his hand-picked successor, Wolfgang Schaeuble, to the post
that Kohl held for a quarter-century.
	   Tears glistened on Kohl's jowls as one of his closest aides,
former Labor Minister Norbert Bluem, praised his historic
achievements, topped by German unification in 1990 after the fall
of the Berlin Wall.
	   Schaeuble, 56, faces the task of rebuilding morale and focusing
the party on new ideas, something Kohl resisted during his long
tenure. In his convention speech, he promised to make the Christian
Democrats a strong opposition to the new center-left government of
Social Democrats and environmentalist Greens, which won on a
promise to fight unemployment.
	   He attacked election victor Gerhard Schroeder as ``the
chancellor of randomness'' for leading Germany to the left despite
a centrist platform, and he vowed to oppose government plans to
ease citizenship rules to help integrate foreigners.
	   But he also chipped away at Kohl's legacy, making clear that the
Christian Democrats had lost touch with voters during his
overbearing reign.
	   ``We must open up for new issues and thinking,'' he declared.
``The CDU must regain its ability to campaign.'' That could include
reaching out to labor unions and ecology-minded voters, he said.
	   Another task, he said, was regaining voters in economically
struggling eastern Germany, the formerly communist area where the
Christian Democrats were routed despite Kohl's image as ``father of
German unity.''
	   Schaeuble was Germany's most popular politician in pre-election
polls. A loyal Kohl protege who suppressed his own yearning for the
chancellorship, he has been in a wheelchair since an assassin shot
him during campaigning in 1990. As chairman, he will also keep his
job as the party's leader in parliament.
	   Running unopposed for chairman, Schaeuble got strong support
from delegates, polling 93 percent of the votes.
	   The Christian Democrats are only beginning the debate on their
future after their worst showing in national elections since 1949.
It hardly surfaced at Saturday's meeting, where the focus was on
installing a new leadership team.
	   Schaeuble said the Christian Democrats must stay united behind
their core values _ the free market, European unity, law and order,
and a commitment to social justice rooted in Christianity.
	   Kohl, 68, urged his party to fight to regain power.
	   ``Let us not give in to pressure to run after changing trends of
political fashion,'' he said. ``We need a renewal that will bear
new fruit _ not one that rips out the roots.''
	   He smiled and waved from the podium as delegates gave him a
final, five-minute standing ovation.

Families honor WWI soldiers shot for desertion, cowardice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Relatives of World War I soldiers who were
executed for cowardice or desertion laid wreaths in their memory on
Saturday at the Cenotaph war memorial.
	   At the same memorial, in the midst of Whitehall's government
buildings, Queen Elizabeth II will lead the official Remembrance
Day ceremonies for Britain's war dead on Sunday. But because of the
dishonor of the deaths of 306 executed men, they are not
acknowledged as part of the ceremony.
	   Many of them now are believed to have been suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder after month of heavy bombardment in
the trenches.
	   The Defense Ministry this summer rejected relatives' appeals for
posthumous pardons for the men, but expressed ``regret'' about the
way they were treated.
	   As Big Ben chimed 11 a.m on Saturday, a lone trumpeter played
and half a dozen families paid tribute to all the executed
servicemen with wreaths of paper poppies.
	   Gertrude Harris from north London said her father, Pvt. Harry
Farr, 26, was executed in October 1916 after reporting sick from
shell shock.
	   ``Because there were no bandages or wounds they did not believe
him,'' said Mrs. Harris, 84, who laid a wreath describing him as
``A Victim of the Great War.''
	   ``My ambition is to have a posthumous pardon for my father to
prove that he and the other soldiers were not cowards and then they
could all be recognized on Remembrance Sunday.''
	   Nora High traveled from her home in Seaham, northern England, to
lay a wreath for her uncle, Pvt. William Nelson, who was executed
in August 1916 at age 20.
	   He absconded three times, she said, but always at times of
family crisis, including the death of his mother, which left his
12-year-old sister to look after an infant brother. Their father
was a prisoner of war.
	   The note on her wreath read: ``As the petals of the poppies fall
so do my tears. For the life and love denied one so young all these
long years. Unjustly shot.''

Clerides denies postponement of missile deployment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
reaffirmed Saturday that his government would deploy a battery of
Russian anti-aircraft missiles that Turkey has threatened to
destroy.
	   The president issued a statement saying that media reports of a
postponement were ``completely unfounded.''
	   Newspapers in Greece and Cyprus had published unsourced reports
Friday and Saturday that the missiles would be stored on the Greek
island of Crete in order to defuse the threat of military action by
Turkey.
	   Clerides did not say when the missiles would arrive, but
appealed to the media to drop the matter.
	   ``Public debate on the issue of the missiles is not in the best
interests of Cyprus,'' the statement said.
	   When Cyprus ordered the S-300 missiles in January 1997, it said
they would be deployed in the spring or summer of 1998.
	   But this year, after coming under heavy pressure from the United
States and European Union, the government said it had postponed the
deployment to December or even later.
	   The United States and the EU have been pressing Cyprus to cancel
the missiles, arguing that their arrival would have an adverse
effect on the U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the
island.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in 1974 in the wake of a coup by
supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state
in the north is only recognized by Ankara which maintains 35,000
troops there.
	   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of the
reunification talks in August 1997. He has said he will not return
to the negotiating table until his breakaway state is recognized,
Cyprus halts its accession talks with the EU, and the missile
deployment is canceled.
	   Turkey has vowed to prevent the missiles' deployment, saying
that their presence would threaten its air superiority in the
Cypriot region.

Celtic general manager resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Jock Brown resigned Saturday as general
manager of Scottish Premier Division champions, Celtic, ending a
brief but tumultuous stint at the helm of the club.
	   Brown, the brother of Scottish national team manager Craig
Brown, joined Celtic in June 1997.
	   The Glasgow club subsequently ended Rangers' decade-long grip on
the Scottish Premiership last season but championship-winning coach
Wim Jansen left the club after reportedly falling out with Brown.
	   This season, Brown has been criticized by players and supporters
for his stance in the players bonus crisis with players threatening
to go on strike.
	   A statement released Saturday by Celtic confirmed Brown had
tendered his resignation after a meeting with club chairman Fergus
McCann and his resignation had been accepted by the club board.

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Police used clubs to beat demonstrators
and disperse 2,000 marchers Saturday who sought to protest last
month's presidential elections, which they said were undemocratic.
	   Dozens of protesters were either beaten, arrested or both by
police, who never allowed the march to begin in the capital, Baku.
At least 18 suffered injuries, organizers said.
	   The rally was organized by Etibar Mamedov, leader of the
National Independence Party, who finished a distant second to the
country's authoritarian leader Geidar Aliev in presidential
elections in October.
	   ``Today's event testifies to the agony of Aliev's regime,''
Mamedov told reporters after the violence. ``We had hoped to
express our protest against falsification of the results of the
presidential elections.''
	   Aliev won another term with 76 percent of the vote last month.
Mamedov captured only 11 percent, and claimed the poll was rigged.
Most opposition groups boycotted the election, and international
observers said it was undemocratic.
	   The marchers initially gathered at a subway station, but a large
police contingent began beating demonstrators and blocked their
planned route.
	   Police also blocked the headquarters of the National
Independence Party and did not allow Mamedov to take part in the
march.
	   The marchers sought to re-form the demonstration at Baku State
University, but were again beaten back by police.
	   Agshin Zeymalov, a spokesman for the Baku police, insisted that
police didn't beat any protesters, and said 10 policemen were hurt
in the clashes. Russian television broadcast video footage that
clearly showed police with riot sticks beating demonstrators.
	   Human rights groups have repeatedly criticized Aliev for his
crackdowns against opposition groups. Aliev, 75, led Azerbaijan
when it was part of the Soviet Union and reclaimed power in a 1993
coup.

Determined Sampras beats Martin to reach Paris Open final

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World No. 1 Pete Sampras slammed an ace to close
out a tight second-set tiebreaker and beat fellow American Todd
Martin 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) Saturday to reach the final of the dlrs 2.55
million Paris Open.
	   The top-seeded American skipped and pumped his fist in the air
after the semifinal win, clearly relieved after a back injury
earlier in the week seemed to threaten his chances.
	   Sampras, the defending champion, will now face either Britain's
Greg Rusedski or Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov in Sunday's final.
	   After hurting his back Thursday during a match against France's
Jerome Golmard, Sampras was back in fine form Saturday, slamming 11
aces and volleying with ease.
	   But Martin was not an easy opponent, hitting 13 aces himself and
matching Sampras' power from all parts of the court.
	   In the first set, the players held serve until 5-4, when Sampras
broke Martin to take the set.
	   In the second set, it was more of the same, with Martin saving a
break point for 3-3 and then four break points in the exciting
eighth game to even the set at 4-4.
	   The players battled to 6-6, then played a hard-fought
tiebreaker. Sampras screamed with relief when he got the mini-break
at 6-4, but Martin answered right back with an ace for 6-5. Sampras
closed out the match with an ace of his own.
	   Sampras is looking to end the season as No. 1 for a sixth
consecutive year, and that quest will take him to Hanover for the
ATP World Championships, where he will be competing for the top
spot against Chile's Marcelo Rios.
	   On Friday, a tired Sampras criticized the heavy schedule players
must cope with, saying it leads to injuries.
	   ``If I want to play for many more years, which I want to do, I
need more of a break,'' he said. ``I moan about this all the time
but nothing changes.''
	   Martin, ranked No. 26, had a great tournament in Paris, beating
both Patrick Rafter and Andre Agassi on the way to his matchup with
Sampras.

Ukrainian emergency workers battling devastating floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian emergency workers continued to
battle devastating floods in the west of the country on Saturday,
but the rising water level in local rivers was making more
settlements susceptible to inundation, officials said.
	   Heavy rains so far have flooded a total of 118 towns and
villages in the Zakarpattia region, forcing the temporary
evacuation of about 7,500 people, the Emergency Situations Ministry
said.
	   Floods and landslides that struck the region this week have
destroyed about 300 buildings, 20 bridges and 12 dams, cut off
electricity to more than 100 settlements, and damaged dozens of
roads and railways, making some remote villages unreachable, the
ministry said.
	   ``There has never been such a disaster in Ukraine before,''
Emergency Situations Minister Valery Kalchenko said during a visit
to the flooded city of Mukachevo on Friday, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Kalchenko said two people were killed and 298 injured in the
flooded villages in previous days, while the water has covered the
territory populated by some 300,000 people.
	   The floods have also hit a dozen settlements in the western Lviv
region, but improving weather there allowed officials to fully
resume supplying electricity to the villages and repair the damage
quickly, the UNIAN news agency said.
	   But the floods in Zakarpattia were expected to continue all
weekend, with rain in the forecast through Sunday.
	   President Leonid Kuchma visited the region on Friday and
promised assistance to the people made homeless by the disaster.
	   He met with Zakarpattia authorities to discuss raising funds to
compensate people for the losses.
	   Some 5,900 people were working in the flooded area to repair the
damage, including local army troops, who brought machines and
equipment to help evacuate people and organize food supplies for
them.
	   No official estimates of the losses incurred by the floods have
been announced, but the government has already allocated 1.2
million hryvna (dlrs 350,000) for repair work.

Smaller radical group claims responsibility for market bombing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with claim of responsibility from
Islamic Jihad &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILAT AL HARITHIYA, West Bank (AP) _ The radical group Islamic
Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the suicide bombing of a
crowded Jerusalem market and vowed more attacks to try to block the
new peace accord.
	   ``This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the
last,'' the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organizations.
``We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the
Zionist enemy.''
	   The leaflet could not immediately be authenticated, but its
style was consistent with that of past communications from the
group. The Associated Press contacted several known officials of
the group, but none could comment on the claim.
	   Palestinian security sources and the families of the dead
bombers had already identified them as Islamic Jihad activists. At
least half a dozen other Islamic activists have been rounded up
since the bombing, the sources said.
	   Meanwhile, Palestinian political leaders said Israel should not
use Friday's suicide bombing, which killed the two assailants and
wounded 21 Israelis, as an excuse to stop the peace process.
	   One of Israel's key demands is that the Palestinians do more to
fight attacks by Islamic militants against Israeli targets. The
Palestinians, however, said the two bombers had come from
Israeli-controlled areas, so Israel bore at least part of the
security responsibility for Friday's attack.
	   Hours after the bombing at Jerusalem's open-air Mahane Yehuda
market, Israel suspended Cabinet debate on ratification of the
2-week old Wye River accord and did not announce a date for
resumption.
	   The Israeli military said it could not confirm the bombers'
identities and hometowns, but they were disclosed by Palestinian
security officials and also reported by Palestinian media.
	   One lived near the Anata refugee camp, north of Jerusalem, and
the other lived in the West Bank village of Silat al Harithiya,
outside the town of Jenin.
	   Both were killed when their car blew up at the entrance to
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market. Israeli authorities reportedly
found suitcases in the wreckage, suggesting the pair had intended
to hand-carry bombs into the crowded market and detonate them
there.
	   Their families said the two had met in Israeli jails and were
related by marriage. Both families held so-called mourning houses
on Saturday, but not actual funerals, since Israeli authorities
still have their bodies.
	   ``I didn't raise him to lose him like that,'' said Mohammed
Zughayar, the 54-year-old father of Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar,
22. ``I'm proud, but I'm sad because I loved my son.''
	   The family of Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 24, said he had been
married for three months to Zughayar's sister, Basma. They met when
she was visiting her brother, who was in prison with Dahayneh, the
family said.
	   Dahayneh had been angry and embittered since losing part of his
leg after being shot during a clash with Israeli troops when he was
13, his relatives said.
	   His wife showed visitors a letter she said he had written to her
before the attack, saying, ``Not the Wye agreement, not the
Palestinian Authority, or the Israeli government, or even Clinton,
will stop me from meeting my God. If they can, let them stop me.''
	   Palestinian Cabinet Minister Nabil Shaath sharply criticized
Israel Saturday for suspending action on the accord in response to
the bombing.
	   ``This Israeli government is as guilty as those who want to
destroy the peace process with acts of violence,'' Shaath said in
Cairo. ``The Israeli government seems happy to continue
procrastinating.''
	   The Palestinian Cabinet condemned the attack following its own
meeting on Friday night, but also said it should not be used as a
pretext for delaying implementation of the accord.
	   Friday's attack was the second suicide bombing since the signing
of the peace accord on Oct. 23. On Oct. 29, an activist from the
radical group Hamas killed himself and an Israeli soldier when he
tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish
schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.

Ukrainian evacuees expected from flooded areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary expects several thousand people
evacuated from flooded areas in neighboring Ukraine, the Hungarian
Water Management minister said Saturday.
	   Recent abundant rainfalls have flooded parts of Ukraine, Hungary
and Romania, causing several deaths and widespread damage.
	   Authorities have prepared for receiving at least 4,000 people at
the Hungarian-Ukrainian border at Nagyhodos, 280 kilometers (200
miles) east of Budapest, Kalman Katona was quoted as saying by the
state news agency, MTI, but preparations are underway for accepting
more people.
	   According to information from the Ukraine side of the border,
the river Tisa (Tisza in Hungarian) has already overflown the dams
at Velikaya Palagy, and all the residents of this town populated
mostly by ethnic Hungarians had to be evacuated.
	   Simultaneously, aid shipments have left for Ukraine from Hungary
with clothings, medicine, blankets, food cans and drinking water.
	   The flood situation is grave in Hungary, too, but so far only
the residents of four villages had to be evacuated.
	   There is hope for a significant improvement by early next week
due to favorable weather conditions, Katona said.

Government and church look into torture allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOHAG, Egypt (AP) _ The Interior Minister summoned a top police
official _ and the Coptic Church called in a bishop _ to look into
their role in the alleged police torture of Christians in southern
Egypt and media coverage of the incident.
	   The moves follows a murder investigation in el-Kusheh village,
400 kilometers (240 miles) south of Cairo, that led to the arrests
of 1,200 Christians and torture of scores of them, according to
Egyptian human rights groups.
	   Egyptian officials, already facing criticism in the West about
alleged discrimination against the Christian minority, were upset
at some foreign news accounts which suggested the police rampage
was aimed at Copts.
	   The human groups noted police avoided arresting Muslims for the
slaying of two Christians to avoid sparking civil strife. But they
said the issue was not a question of religion but of police torture
which has been aimed at Muslims as well.
	   Egypt _ which denies torture occurred _ has since launched a
media campaign, with prominent Copts denouncing the reports as
exaggerated and praising their relations with Muslim Egyptians.
	   The summoning of the police official and Coptic bishop Saturday
was in apparent attempt to reprimand both the police and the Coptic
clergy who spoke out about the incident for projecting a negative
image of the country.
	   On Saturday, Interior Minister Habib el-Adly summoned Maj. Gen.
Khalil Makhlouf, head of the Sohag security force, to Cairo for an
investigation into the incident, police officials said.
	   For his part, Pope Shenouda III summoned Bishop Wissa, a Coptic
leader in el-Kusheh to Cairo, according to officials in the Sohag
government who insisted on anonymity.
	   Wissa was briefly detained in October, after he complained to
human rights groups about the incident, on grounds he allegedly
incited unrest against the government. He was released on a bail,
but could still be tried for incitement, which carries a jail term
of up to 25 years.

Ukrainian Communists mark anniversary of Bolshevik revolution

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Memories of the Soviet era and anger over
declining living standards drew thousands of people throughout
Ukraine on Saturday to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the
Bolshevik revolution.
	   About 4,000 mostly elderly people, led by Ukrainian Communist
Party leaders, marched through the capital, Kiev, waving large red
banners. They called for the restoration of the Soviet Union and
blasted Ukraine's present leadership.
	   ``Those in power in Ukraine are waging a battle against their
own people, and are living on the money that was stolen from
them,'' Communist Party leader Petro Symonenko told a cheering
crowd that gathered at Yevropeiska Square in downtown Kiev.
	   Communist sentiments have remained strong in Ukraine since the
former Soviet republic gained independence in 1991.
	   The country's severe economic decline has nurtured nostalgia for
the Soviet past, particularly among older people, who became
gravely impoverished by years of recession.
	   Ukraine's leftists, who openly call for reunion with other
former Soviet republics and a return to a Soviet governmental
system, have tried to capitalize on discontent with the country's
economic downfall.
	   They captured more than a third of the seats in parliamentary
elections earlier this year, and have increasingly protested
government policies in recent months in preparation for next year's
presidential elections.
	   The demonstrators in Kiev called for Ukraine's reunion with
Russia and Belarus as the first step towards creation of a ``new
union of brotherly independent Soviet republics.''
	   They also demanded formation of a new ``government of popular
trust.''
	   Rallies were held elsewhere in the country as well, drawing
5,000 people in Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine and 2,000 in the Crimean
port city of Sevastopol.
	   Ukraine's nationalists, who traditionally counter Communists'
rallies on Nov. 7, were far outnumbered this year.
	   A demonstration of mourning for ``victims of the Communist
terror,'' organized by rightist parties in Kiev, drew only about
1,500 people. There were smaller anti-Communist protests elsewhere.

Smaller radical group claims responsibility for market bombing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with claim of responsibility from
Islamic Jihad. No pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SILAT AL HARITHIYA, West Bank (AP) _ The radical group Islamic
Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the suicide bombing of a
crowded Jerusalem market and promised more attacks to try to block
the new peace accord.
	   ``This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the
last,'' the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organizations.
``We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the
Zionist enemy.''
	   The leaflet could not immediately be authenticated, but its
style was consistent with that of past communications from the
group. The Associated Press contacted several known officials of
the group, but none could comment on the claim.
	   Palestinian security sources and the families of the dead
bombers had already identified them as Islamic Jihad activists. At
least half a dozen other Islamic activists have been rounded up
since the bombing, the sources said.
	   Meanwhile, Palestinian political leaders said Israel should not
use Friday's suicide bombing, which killed the two assailants and
wounded 21 Israelis, as an excuse to stop the peace process.
	   One of Israel's key demands is that the Palestinians do more to
fight Islamic militants' attacks on Israeli targets. The
Palestinians, however, said the two bombers had come from
Israeli-controlled areas, so Israel bore at least part of the
security responsibility for Friday's attack.
	   Hours after the bombing at Jerusalem's open-air Mahane Yehuda
market, Israel suspended Cabinet debate on ratification of the Wye
River accord reached two weeks ago and did not announce a date for
resumption.
	   The Israeli military said it could not confirm the bombers'
identities and hometowns, but they were disclosed by Palestinian
security officials and also reported by Palestinian media.
	   One lived near the Anata refugee camp, north of Jerusalem, and
the other lived in the West Bank village of Silat al Harithiya,
outside the town of Jenin.
	   Both were killed when their car blew up at the entrance to the
market. Israeli authorities reportedly found suitcases in the
wreckage, suggesting that the pair had intended to hand-carry bombs
into the crowded market and detonate them there.
	   Their families said the two had met in Israeli jails and were
related by marriage. Both families held so-called mourning houses
on Saturday, but not actual funerals, since Israeli authorities
still have their bodies.
	   ``I didn't raise him to lose him like that,'' said Mohammed
Zughayar, 54, the father of Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar, 22. ``I'm
proud, but I'm sad because I loved my son.''
	   The family of Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 24, said he had been
married for three months to Zughayar's sister, Basma. They met when
she was visiting her brother, who was in prison with Dahayneh, the
family said.
	   Dahayneh had been angry and embittered since losing part of his
leg after he was shot during a clash with Israeli troops when he
was 13, his relatives said.
	   His wife showed visitors a letter she said he had written her
before the attack, saying, ``Not the Wye agreement, not the
Palestinian Authority, or the Israeli government, or even Clinton,
will stop me from meeting my God. If they can, let them stop me.''
	   Palestinian Cabinet Minister Nabil Shaath sharply criticized
Israel on Saturday for suspending action on the accord in response
to the bombing.
	   ``This Israeli government is as guilty as those who want to
destroy the peace process with acts of violence,'' Shaath said in
Cairo. ``The Israeli government seems happy to continue
procrastinating.''
	   The Palestinian Cabinet condemned the attack following its own
meeting on Friday night, but also said it should not be used as a
pretext for delaying implementation of the accord.
	   Friday's attack was the second suicide bombing since the signing
of the peace accord on Oct. 23. On Oct. 29, an activist from the
radical group Hamas killed himself and an Israeli soldier when he
tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish
schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and Jordan

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia wants to reduce public
spending to improve the country's economy hit by the recent dip in
oil prices, Crown Prince Abdullahhe said in remarks published
Saturday.
	   ``We are serious about about reducing public spending and taking
practical measures to find alternative sources of national
revenue,'' Okaz newspaper quoted Abdullah as saying.
	   Saudi Arabia, the world's major oil producer, is suffering from
an estimated dlrs 13 billion deficit because of low prices of oil,
its main source of revenue. The government has frozen most major
new projects in an effort to reduce spending.
	   Abdullah lobbied foreigners to invest in the kingdom during a
recent world tour.
	   ``I invited the countries that I visited to set up medium and
heavy industries in our country and to invest in the petroleum and
petrochemical industries,'' the newspaper quoted Abdullah as
saying.
	   He said Saudi Arabia was providing new incentives to lure
foreign investments to the kingdom and that he found many oil and
industrial companies ready and willing to invest in Saudi Arabia.
He did not give details.
	   Abdullah, second in line to the throne after ailing King Fahd,
returned last month from a world tour that included key allies, the
United States, France, Britain, China and Japan.
	   Abdullah, who took over the throne briefly in 1995 when Fahd had
a stroke, has taken on more responsibilities lately since Fahd has
been hospitalized four times this year. One of his main priorities
has been getting the economy back on track.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The government should not intervene to shore up
prices whenever the index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange falls
sharply, and when there were no indications of a real crisis at the
market, an independent report said Saturday.
	   The index started to improve last week, following a drop to an
almost two-year low caused mainly by lack of liquidity. The
minister of commerce and industry, Abdul-Aziz al-Dakheel, had said
the government would take steps to increase the flow of funds into
the market.
	   The report by Al-Shall Economic Consultants said state
intervention was ``unacceptable,'' and the government had to let
investors take responsibility for their decisions.
	   Falling prices have to stop at one point, the report said.
	   Al-Shall said it doubted the government was going to take any
direct action. The firm believed the government should announce
this decision clearly in order to open the door for a full-force
correction, and so that the exchange can become ``more mature and
more attractive to reasonable investments.''
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices slipped, but turnover
increased on the stock exchange in October because dealings focused
on shares of lucrative firms.
	   Brokers said Saturday that despite the increased turnover,
activity was generally sluggish during last month mainly because of
Israeli obstacles hampering trade with the Palestinian territories.
	   A stock market report said the 60-company general share prices
index declined by 5.51 percent to 161.82 points in 21 business days
in October.
	   It said shares of industrial firms declined by 8.11 percent,
commercial banks by 5.07 percent, services companies by 2.20
percent and insurance firms by 0.67 percent.
	   Turnover nudged up by 20.8 percent to 23.8 million Jordanian
dinars (dlrs 33.5 million), the report said.
	   It said shares of commercial banks made up 58.8 of the total
trading.
 &UR; ___
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh
said Saturday that his country welcomed all foreign investments in
Caspian Sea oil projects, and called on U.S. companies to work out
their problems with Washington.
	   Iran ``has not exempted American oil companies from taking part
in the projects,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
Zanganeh as saying.
	   Speaking on the sidelines of the Caspian Oil and Gas Resources
conference which opened in Tehran Saturday, Zanganeh said
``American companies should solve their problems with their own
government.''
	   U.S. legislation bans large foreign investments in Iran's oil
and gas sectors.
	   ``Sanctions are imposed by the U.S. government, not Iranian
governments,'' Zangeneh said.
	   When asked about his presence at the conference, U.S.-based
Conoco representative Brian Neylon noted that sanctions don't
prohibit U.S. citizens or companies from traveling to Tehran.
	   ``Because of our previous experience, we come primarily to
maintain our relationship with the NIOC (National Iranian Oil Co.)
people that we've known through the years,'' he said.
	   ``Under the U.S. sanctions, we're not allowed to pursue or sign
any deals,'' he said.
	   In 1995, the Clinton administration blocked Conoco from
developing Iran's Sirri oil field in the Gulf. The dlrs 550 million
contract was subsequently awarded to France's Total and Malaysia's
Petronas.
 &UR; ___
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Foreign companies have invested some dlrs
360 million in Iran's free-trade zones, a senior Iranian official
said Saturday.
	   Morteza Alviri, vice president and head of the FTZs, said that
the money had been invested by 33 foreign companies in the zones in
Chabahar, Qeshm, Kish and Sirjan, the official Tehran radio
reported.
	   He said another 14 banks and foreign financial institutions had
applied to open branches in the zones, but he did not name the
firms.
	   Alviri said two oil refineries, worth dlrs 1 billion, were under
construction in Chabahar and Qeshm, the radio reported.
	   Alviri said that President Mohammad Khatami's policy of mending
ties with the West had encouraged foreign investment. However, he
did not say what portion of the investment had arrived after
Khatami's election last year.
	   ``Detente in foreign policy - a necessity for joint
international economic ventures - has fortunately been followed by
President Khatami, and has resulted in a sound confidence among
foreign countries,'' the radio quoted Alviri as saying.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations began reducing its
weapons inspection staff in Iraq on Saturday as the Baghdad regime
held firm to its decision to prevent them from working.
	   Some 15 U.N. weapons experts, including a team of missile
inspectors, took a U.N. flight to nearby Bahrain. They said nothing
to the media on their arrival in the capital, Manama.
	   The departure of the U.N. arms inspectors comes amid increased
fear of a military strike by the United States and Britain in
response to Iraq's blocking the inspectors from working.
	   On Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen returned from a
tour of Arab nations and Turkey, saying he was satisfied the United
States would have adequate support for an attack from its Arab
allies.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission in Baghdad,
Caroline Cross, said more staffers would leave Monday and
Wednesday. UNSCOM is responsible for overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq began curtailing the activities of the weapons teams on
Aug. 5 when it banned spot inspections, which are unannounced
visits to suspected weapons sites. On Oct. 31 it went further,
barring U.N. teams from sites designated for long-term monitoring.
	   UNSCOM in New York said Friday it would withdraw 26 staffers _
or about 20 percent of its roughly 130-member permanent staff in
Iraq _ because they were sitting idle.
	   Iraq has said it will not resume cooperation until the U.N.
Security Council begins to lift the punishing trade sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The council has said
the sanctions, which cover the sale of oil, will not be lifted
until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has disarmed.
	   Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters Saturday that
``our position still stands as it is.''
	   He was the first Cabinet minister to comment publicly since a
Security Council resolution Thursday called the Iraqi position a
``flagrant violation'' of previous U.N. resolutions and urged Iraq
to resume cooperation.
	   While Washington and London have threatened military action,
other members of the Security Council oppose such a move.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement Friday that
armed actions are ``fraught with most unpredictable consequences
for peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a
whole.''
	   Khudeir ad-Duleimi, editor of the government-run Baghdad
Observer newspaper, said in an interview that Iraq was forced to
act because the inspections were dragging on endlessly.
	   ``The world must understand Iraq's position,'' he said. ``The
aim has been diverted from eliminating weapons capability to
maintaining the sanctions as the main political aim.''
	   Iraq has long accused UNSCOM of working on behalf of the United
States to prolong the sanctions as a means to weakening the
government of President Saddam Hussein.
	   The last major crisis over weapons inspections occurred early
this year when Iraq refused to open presidential palaces to U.N.
inspectors. It was defused when U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
reached an agreement Feb. 23 with Saddam for full Iraqi cooperation
with U.N. inspectors.
	   Annan's envoy, Indian diplomat Prakash Shah, remains in Baghdad
trying to work out a compromise to the latest disagreement. He has
declined to discuss his negotiations.
	   The 15 inspectors who left Saturday included four based in
Baghdad and 11 who were here on short-term assignments, including
six doing missile inspections, Cross said.
	   U.N. experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency have
been allowed to continue monitoring Iraq's compliance with nuclear
disarmament.
	   Cross said two nuclear teams went into the field on Saturday.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla bases in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla bases Saturday in their fifth raid on south Lebanon this
week.
	   The jets fired two missiles at targets between the villages of
Zibqine and Yater, 15 kilometers (nine miles) south of this port
city, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The sunset attack followed hours of intermittent fire between
Hezbollah guerrillas and Israeli troops. No casualties were
reported.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman said aircraft had
attacked ``sources of guerrilla shelling'' and that the pilots had
reported accurate hits.
	   The targeted area faces the Israeli-occupied zone of southern
Lebanon. It is often used by militants of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah group to launch attacks on the zone.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties from the raid.
	   Hezbollah is the most active of guerrilla groups fighting to
oust some 1,500 Israeli troops and their 2,500 Lebanese militia
allies from the zone that Israel set up in 1985 to prevent
cross-border attacks.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Eight days after a new pro-western
government took power in Slovakia, Czech President Vaclav Havel
made an official visit to the country that became independent, as
did the Czech Republic, following the peaceful split of
Czechoslovakia in 1993.
	   Havel is the first foreign official to meet the new Slovak
government and parliament that emerged from September elections
which toppled from power autocratic Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.
	   Shortly after arrival, Havel, who was accompanied by his wife
Dagmar, paid tribute to Alexander Dubcek, the Slovak-born leader of
the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' communist reform movement who died in a
road accident six years ago.
	   Former Slovak President Michal Kovac, who also visited Dubcek's
grave, said that Havel's visit ``is a beginning of a new era of
relations between the Czech Republic and Slovakia,'' the Czech news
agency CTK reported from the Slovak capital.
	   Havel spoke of his first-ever meeting with Dubcek back in 1968,
recalling how surprised he was that the Communist secretary general
was listening to him.
	   ``This ability for dialogue, tolerance, openness, ability to
listen to the others, that's a quality all politicians should
have,'' CTK quoted Havel as saying.
	   ``Many Czech and Slovak politicians of todaycould learn from
Dubcek,''Havel said.
	   Accompanied by Bratislava officials, Havel then went for a walk
through the historical center, where he was greeted by both
Bratislava citizens and foreign tourists.
	   ``I want to discuss new and - let's hope - close political
cooperation and possibilities of broader regional cooperation
within what used to be called the Visegrad Group,'' havel said,
referring to a loose regional grouping of former Communist
countries in the region.
	   ``Of course, I want to speak about European integration
processes and about how neighbors can help Slovakia, which is
slightly behind,'' Havel told reporters.
	   He was to return to the Czech Republic before midnight (2300
GMT) Saturday.

France thanks Britain's old soldiers from `bottom of her heart'

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ France on Saturday bestowed its highest honor on
all 160 surviving British World War I veterans who fought on French
soil, and thanked them ``from the very bottom of her heart.''
	   Thirteen frail old men, several in wheelchairs and many over 100
years old, went to the Imperial War Museum to receive the Legion
d'Honneur personally from French Ambassador Bernard in a ceremony
marking the 80th anniversary of the end of the 1914-1918 war.
	   The ambassador told them of France's ``immense gratitude'' and
said, ``This is more than a belated gesture of recognition to these
men. It is a symbol designed to inform young people of what
happened on French soil during those years.
	   ``France remembers and from the very bottom of her heart says
thank you.''
	   A minute's silence followed the presentation.
	   ``This is the proudest moment for me since I left the army,''
said Robert Burns, whose 103rd birthday is Thursday.
	   ``It has been wonderful to receive such a permanent memento, but
many of the men have been moved to tears,'' he said, standing
easily without the aid of his walking stick.
	   Close to tears himself, Burns remembered the young men who died
in the war with Germany and its allies.
	   ``People say to me it is thanks to people like me that they are
free today, but I say it is thanks to those who died that I am here
today.''
	   Another veteran, Stanley Clayton, 104, who signed up and went to
France aged 20, was overwhelmed.
	   ``I don't know what I did to deserve this medal. I only did my
best for my country and then I tried to forget about it,'' he said
from his wheelchair with a row of shining medals on his chest.
	   Said Frank Humphries, 100, ``I have tried to forget about it and
this brings it all back, but I feel very honored.''

Ethiopian leader warns Eritrea as talks due to begin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with arrival of Eritrean president.

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Ethiopia's prime minister
warned neighboring Eritrea that a six-month border feud between the
two Horn of Africa countries will continue unless Eritrea withdraws
from disputed territory.
	   Arriving for a series of talks with African mediators, Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi said Ethiopia was hoping for peace but
prepared for a prolonged frontier squabble.
	   ``I'm coming here seeking peace and justice. I wouldn't be here
if I had no hope of it succeeding,'' Meles said. ``But the
underlying problem has not been resolved and that is Eritrea has
invaded part of our territory and occupied it. Until it has been
resolved, one cannot expect complete tranquility.''
	   Meles was scheduled Saturday to meet with a mediation committee
appointed by the Organization of African Unity.
	   Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki arrived later in the
afternoon for separate talks with the committee, which has
developed a list of peace proposals. Isaias did not speak to
journalists and went straight to government offices in Burkina
Faso's capital.
	   Direct meetings between the rivals were not foreseen and Meles
deflected questions of whether he was willing to speak face-to-face
with his counterpart.
	   Meetings are expected to continue on Sunday. The committee
comprises Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore, Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Djibouti's President Hassan
Ghouled Aptidon.
	   OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim has also arrived for the
meetings as has U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun.
	   Mediation efforts so far have failed to resolve the dispute.
Ethiopian officials have said they are committed to a U.S.-Rwanda
peace proposal forwarded earlier this year, which requires that
both sides withdraw to positions held before hostilities broke out
in May.
	   Eritrea, however, has rejected that proposal. Isaias, speaking
Thursday before departing for the talks, said the only way to end
the conflict was to declare a ceasefire and then demarcate the
common border.
	   After a lull in fighting between the two Horn of Africa nations,
sporadic fighting erupted over the past two weeks. Earlier this
week, two Ethiopian towns were reportedly shelled, with at least
nine people killed in one of them.
	   Several hundred people have been killed during the six months of
the dispute.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and was granted
independence in 1993, but the border between the two countries has
never been officially demarcated.

Surprised Graf needs three sets but reaches Leipzig final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Steffi Graf, surprising herself, reached
the final of the Leipzig Open Saturday as her latest comeback from
injury continued to gather steam.
	   The former world No. 1 needed one hour and 52 minutes to
struggle past Belgium's Dominique van Roost, 6-1, 3-6, 6-0 at the
dlrs 450,000 event in her first tournament in two months.
	   Graf, seizing on 12 double faults by the world's 13th-ranked
player, said she hadn't expected this good of results so early in
her latest comeback bid.
	   ``I'm surprised. None of these matches were easy, I wasn't
handed any points,'' said Graf, who had a operation for a bone spur
on her right hand following the U.S. Open in late August.
	   ``I'm trying to get back to the top, but I've had a lot of
injuries the past few months. But I keep overcoming them and coming
back,'' added Graf, 29.
	   Graf, now ranked 22nd, faces the winner of the second semifinal
match between top-ranked Nathalie Tauziat, the Wimbedone finalist,
and Romania's Irina Spirlea in Sunday's final.
	   Van Roost double faulted away the last point in a match that was
tougher for Graf than the outcome indicated.
	   Van Roost often dictated play against a tentative if steady
Graf, catching the German flatfooted by blasting winners into the
open court.
	   ``I notice then that if I had played more in the last two,
years, I might be able to hit shots with more precision and
pressure,'' said Graf, whose career has been curtailed by injuries
in recent years.
	   Van Roost hit three double faults to hand Graf a 2-0 first set
lead, then added two more as she gave the German a key 2-0 break in
the final set.
	   Graf, who helped found the Leipzig tournament, now boasts a 24-0
record at the event, where she had claimed four of her 104 career
titles.
	   The victory pushed Graf's record total career earnings to dlrs
20,361,911. Her victory Friday against France's Anne-Gaelle Sidot
vaulted her past Martina Navratilova's 13-year-old earnings mark of
20,344,061.
	   ``Such records do show what you've achieved but they are not all
that important to me,'' said Graf.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations began reducing its
weapons inspection staff in Iraq on Saturday and the Baghdad regime
held firm to its decision to prevent them from working.
	   Some 15 U.N. weapons experts, including a team of missile
inspectors, took a U.N. flight to nearby Bahrain. They said nothing
to the media on their arrival in the capital, Manama.
	   The departure of the inspectors comes amid increased fear of a
military strike by the United States and Britain in response to
Iraq's blocking the inspectors from working.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission in Baghdad,
Caroline Cross, said more staffers would leave Monday and
Wednesday. The staff includes about 130 people.
	   UNSCOM, as the committee is known, is responsible for overseeing
the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has disarmed before the
U.N. Security Council will lift crippling sanctions imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. But Iraq says it will not resume
cooperation until the council begins to lift the trade sanctions.
	   Iraq began curtailing the activities of the weapons teams on
Aug. 5 when it banned spot inspections, which are unannounced
visits to suspected weapons sites. On Oct. 31 it went further,
barring U.N. teams from sites designated for long-term monitoring.
	   Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters Saturday that
``our position still stands as it is.''
	   He was the first Cabinet minister to comment publicly since a
Security Council resolution Thursday called the Iraqi position a
``flagrant violation'' of U.N. resolutions and urged Iraq to resume
cooperation.
	   Khudeir ad-Duleimi, editor of the government-run Baghdad
Observer newspaper, said in an interview that Iraq was forced to
act because the inspections were dragging on endlessly.
	   ``The world must understand Iraq's position,'' he said. ``The
aim has been diverted from eliminating weapons capability to
maintaining the sanctions as the main political aim.''
	   Iraq has long accused UNSCOM of working on behalf of the United
States to prolong the sanctions as a means of weakening the
government of President Saddam Hussein.
	   While Washington and London have threatened military action,
other members of the Security Council oppose such a move.
	   The last major crisis over weapons inspections was early this
year, when Iraq refused to open presidential palaces to U.N.
inspectors. It was defused when U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
reached an agreement Feb. 23 with Saddam for full Iraqi cooperation
with U.N. inspectors.
	   Annan's envoy, Indian diplomat Prakash Shah, remains in Baghdad
trying to work out a compromise to the latest disagreement. He has
declined to discuss his negotiations.
	   The 15 inspectors who left Saturday included four based in
Baghdad and 11 who were here on short-term assignments, including
six doing missile inspections, Cross said.
	   U.N. experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency have
been allowed to continue monitoring Iraq's compliance with nuclear
disarmament.
	   Cross said two nuclear teams went into the field on Saturday.

Plea to forgive WWI mutineers sparks duel with president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A World War I mutiny that France all but erased
from its memory has returned to haunt the realms of state, stirring
a public dispute between the nation's conservative president and
the leftist prime minister who wants forgiveness to replace shame.
	   ``I think that (Prime Minister) Lionel Jospin did well to return
to our collective memory people who refused to be sacrificed like
cannon fodder,'' Socialist Deputy Jean-Louis Bianco told fellow
lawmakers Saturday as the dispute moved into its third day.
	   A week before France celebrates the 80th anniversary of the
war's end, Jospin, a Socialist, paid a visit Thursday to the
northern town of Craonne, near the site of a catastrophic offensive
against the Germans at Chemin des Dames. There, he asked that the
49 mutineers executed ``as an example'' be ``fully reintegrated
today into our national collective memory.''
	   Thousands of soldiers revolted during the bloody 1917 offensive,
refusing to fight on the front line. France has actively worked to
forget the rebellion, even censuring for years Stanley Kubrick's
1957 movie ``Paths of Glory'' that centered on the mutiny.
	   On Friday, Jospin's gesture was chastised by his political
opponents. By the end of the day, even President Jacques Chirac --
in charge of the Armed Forces -- weighed in, calling Jospin's
remarks ``inopportune.''
	   It was one of the few moments of public friction between Chirac
and Jospin since the two entered a delicate period of power-sharing
following the Socialist landslide victory in 1997 legislative
elections.
	   Both men had, until now, maintained a facade of polite
cooperation.
	   Chirac's party, the Rally for the Republic, was more outspoken
than the president. Former Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said
that Jospin's remarks were ``of a nature to justify acts of mutiny
in the future.''
	   A statement from the presidential office noted that Jospin spoke
as the nation prepares to honor on Nov.11. the death of more than 1
million French soldiers in the four-year war that ended in 1918.
	   Jospin's remarks represented the first time a French official
tried to expunge what has been viewed as a shameful episode in the
nation's history.
	   Jospin, instead, paid homage to ``these soldiers exhausted by
attacks, condemned in advance, slipping through mud soaked in
blood, plunging into a despair without end (and) refusing to be
sacrificed.''
	   The first secretary of the Socialist Party, Francois Hollande,
chastised the right for defending a ``caricature vision of
history.'' The mutineers, he said, ``were not at all bad French,
simply men ... who got lost in a hell of fire and blood.''
	   The mutiny occurred at the height of an offensive in the Aisne
region ordered by Gen. Robert George Nivelle. With some 80,000
people killed in two months, anger rose and troops despaired.
	   Between 30,000 and 40,000 soldiers are estimated to have
abandoned the front lines. Only a small portion of them faced a
military tribunal and only 49 were executed.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla bases in south Lebanon on Saturday in their fifth raid of
the week.
	   The jets fired two missiles at targets between the villages of
Zibqine and Yater, 15 kilometers (nine miles) south of the port
city of Tyre, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The sunset attack followed hours of intermittent fire between
Hezbollah guerrillas and Israeli troops. No casualties were
reported.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman said aircraft
attacked ``sources of guerrilla shelling'' and that the pilots
reported accurate hits.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
	   The targeted area faces the Israeli-occupied zone of southern
Lebanon. It is often used by militants of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah group to launch attacks on the zone.
	   Hezbollah is the most active of guerrilla groups fighting to
oust some 1,500 Israeli troops and their 2,500 Lebanese militia
allies from the zone that Israel set up in 1985 to prevent
cross-border attacks.

WICB President Pat Rousseau; CHANGES byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The cricket crisis threatening to ruin the West
Indies' historic tour to South Africa could be resolved as early as
Sunday.
	   The key seems to be the reported arrival Sunday of West Indian
Cricket Board President Pat Rousseau.
	   South African cricket chief Ali Bacher said Saturday he was
confident the tour would go on as scheduled and that Brian Lara and
Carl Hooper would be reinstated to restore the West Indies to full
strength.
	   The West Indian players, on strike in a pay dispute and in
support of sacked captain Lara and vice-captain Hooper, have
gathered in London and are threatening to abandon the tour.
	   Bacher said that after an hour-long talk with Rousseau Saturday,
he was convinced the dispute would be resolved.
	   ``While I cannot disclose what Mr. Rousseau told me, I'm certain
in my own mind that all problems will be resolved,'' Bacher said.
	   Bacher, West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, and WICB member
Joel arrived in London Friday and have held two days of informal _
and so far _ unfruitful talks with the players.
	   West Indian management and striking players are camped in
neighboring hotels near London's Heathrow Airport but the parties
are apparently content not to meet formally in the absence of
Rousseau.
	   Rousseau and other WICB officials were expected to arrive in
London on Sunday, although at least one report in the Caribbean
said Rousseau would not arrive until Monday.
	   The tour is scheduled to start with a one-day match at
Johannesburg on Tuesday, with the first test due to start on Nov.
26.
	   The key might still be a letter sent to the players by South
African President Nelson Mandela. This would be the West Indies'
first official tour of South Africa since the end of apartheid.
	   ``He (Mandela) conveyed the importance of this tour to our
country,'' Bacher said. ``He asked that the parties concerned
compromise, show goodwill, good intent and come to an amicable
solution which will ensure the tour takes place.''
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher added.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   The strike was sparked Wednesday when the WICB fired Lara and
Hooper after they refused to travel to South Africa.
	   Reported solutions include more prize money, increased meal
money, and the reinstatement of Lara and Hopper to the squad. There
are also suggestions Courtney Walsh would be named captain with
players saying off the record they'll hold out as long as it takes.
	   The WICB has said it would fine the no-show players between 5
and 10 percent of their tour fees, which could be as much as dlrs
60,000 for Lara.
	   Lara and Hooper have wide player support. Only seven of the 16
members of the squad traveled to South Africa, and all returned
Friday to London to rally around the two.
	   On Friday, Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll joined calls for
the WICB to be fired. ``The members of the board should be fired,''
he declared. ``This is not simply a matter of cricket and the board
cannot be allowed to treat the players in such a manner.''
	   In Port-of-Spain, the Trinidadian capital, Lara's fans set up a
massive blackboard in the heart of the city at Woodford Square and
dozens signed it to show ``100 percent support for Lara and his
men.''
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.
	   Lara, the batting superstar of the sport, set a world record of
375 runs in a 1994 Test against England. A few weeks later, he
scored a first-class record of 501 for his English county side
Warwickshire.

	   PARIS (AP) _ World No. 1 Pete Sampras slammed an ace to close
out a tight second-set tiebreaker and beat compatriot Todd Martin
6-4, 7-6 (7-5) Saturday to reach the final of the dlrs 2.55 million
Paris Open.
	   The top-seeded American skipped and pumped his fist in the air
after the semifinal win, clearly relieved after a back injury
earlier in the week threatened his chances of staying in the
tournament.
	   Sampras, the defending champion, will now face either Britain's
Greg Rusedski or Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov in Sunday's final.
	   Both Americans were in top form on Saturday, and Sampras
recognized it.
	   ``Today's tennis was just about as good as it gets,'' he said.
	   After hurting his back Thursday during a match against France's
Jerome Golmard, Sampras showed no sign of injury Saturday, slamming
11 aces and volleying with ease.
	   ``It's amazing, the ups and downs I've gone through the last few
days,'' he said. ``My back felt just about as good as it could feel
today.''
	   But Martin was not an easy opponent, hitting 13 aces himself and
matching Sampras' power from all parts of the court.
	   In the first set, the players held serve until 5-4, when Sampras
broke Martin to take the set.
	   In the second set, it was more of the same, with Martin saving a
break point for 3-3 and then four break points in the exciting
eighth game to even the set at 4-4.
	   The players battled to 6-6, then played a hard-fought
tiebreaker. Sampras screamed with relief when he got the mini-break
at 6-4, but Martin answered right back with an ace for 6-5. Sampras
closed out the match with an ace of his own.
	   Sampras is looking to end the season as No. 1 for a sixth
consecutive year, and that quest will take him to Hanover for the
ATP World Championships, where he will be competing for the top
spot against Chile's Marcelo Rios.
	   But first, he plays next week in Stockholm _ all in an attempt
to gain as many points as possible in his quest to stay No. 1.
	   ``I need goals,'' Sampras said. ``I need something to work
for.''
	   Martin, ranked No. 26, had a great tournament in Paris, beating
both Patrick Rafter and Andre Agassi on the way to his matchup with
Sampras.
	   ``It was thrilling,'' he said Saturday. ``I've had a great
week.''
	   But he said he was still frustrated at the loss to Sampras.
	   ``A player like me doesn't get an opportunity like this too
often, and its disappointing that I couldn't make better of it,''
he said.

Dominguez, quick tries lift Italy past Argentina 23-19
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PIACENZA, Italy (AP) _ Fly-half Diego Dominguez accounted for 13
points and Italy scored a try early in each half Saturday to build
a big lead and then hold off favored Argentina for a 23-19 victory
in a rugby union test match.
	   Alessandro Moscardi scored a try off a scrum just three minutes
into the match and Carlo Checcinato added another five points two
minutes after halftime with a short burst following a series of
nice exchanges up the left flank as the hosts built a 17-3
advantage before a crowd of about 8,000 at Garilli Stadium.
	   The Argentine-born Dominguez, who is Italy's all-time leading
scorer, connected on the two-point conversions after each try and
added penalty kicks in the 23rd minute of the game and in the 23rd
and 38th minutes of the second half.
	   Argentina fly-half Gonzalo Quesada scored off three penalties,
but also missed two kicks in a row in the second half _ six lost
points that could have given the South Americans a victory.
	   The visitors rallied late in the game as substitute Nicolas
Fernandez Miranda hit a penalty with 14 minutes remaining, and the
referee awarded Argentina a technical try in the closing minutes
when Dominguez was whistled for obstruction.
	   Italy, which last defeated Argentina in 1995, has put together a
string of impressive outings in the build-up to when it joins the
prestigious Five Nations tournament in 2000.
	   The Italians earned a victory bonus of 5 million lire (dlrs
3,000) per player Saturday.
	   Massimo Cuttitta entered the game for Italy as a substitute at
the half-hour mark of the second half and tied the country's record
for most appearances with his 60th.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Memories of the Soviet era and anger over
declining living standards drew thousands of people throughout
Ukraine on Saturday to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the
Bolshevik revolution.
	   About 4,000 mostly elderly people, led by Ukrainian Communist
Party leaders, marched through the capital, Kiev, waving large red
banners. They called for the restoration of the Soviet Union and
blasted Ukraine's present leadership.
	   ``Those in power in Ukraine are waging a battle against their
own people, and are living on the money that was stolen from
them,'' Communist Party leader Petro Symonenko told a cheering
crowd that gathered at Yevropeiska Square in downtown Kiev.
	   Communist sentiments have remained strong in Ukraine since the
former Soviet republic gained independence in 1991.
	   The country's severe economic decline has nurtured nostalgia for
the Soviet past, particularly among older people, who became
gravely impoverished by years of recession.
	   Ukraine's leftists, who openly call for reunion with other
former Soviet republics and a return to a Soviet governmental
system, have tried to capitalize on discontent with the country's
economic downfall.
	   They captured more than a third of the seats in parliamentary
elections earlier this year, and have increasingly protested
government policies in recent months in preparation for next year's
presidential elections.
	   The demonstrators in Kiev called for Ukraine's reunion with
Russia and Belarus as the first step towards creation of a ``new
union of brotherly independent Soviet republics.''
	   They also demanded formation of a new ``government of popular
trust.''
	   Rallies were held elsewhere in the country as well, drawing
5,000 people in Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine and 2,000 in the Crimean
port city of Sevastopol.
	   In the western city of Lviv, known for its strong anti-Communist
sentiments, several hundred nationalists attacked about 500 elderly
leftists with clubs and stones. The brief fight, quickly stopped by
police, left about five people injured.
	   No more clashes were reported from other cities throughout
Ukraine, where the nationalists, who traditionally counter
Communists' rallies on Nov. 7, were far outnumbered this year.
	   A demonstration of mourning for ``victims of the Communist
terror,'' organized by rightist parties in Kiev, drew only about
1,500 people. There were smaller anti-Communist protests elsewhere.

Zimbabwe restrict Sri Lanka to 196 all out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL be UPDATED with Zimbabwe innings

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Eddo Brandes and Craig
Evans led a superb bowling performance to see Zimbabwe dismiss
world champions Sri Lanka for 196 in the second match Friday of the
Coca Cola Cup Trophy.
	   Opting to field after winning the toss, Zimbabwe soon had Sri
Lanka reeling at 24 for 3, with Brandes having both Avishka
Gunawardena (1) and Marvan Atapattu (0) trapped leg before wicket.
	   Romesh Kaluwitharna was run out off Brandes' bowling by a direct
throw by Grant Flower at the other end.
	   Sanath Jayasuriya, who square cut a six and struck a boundary
off paceman Neil Johnson, was the fourth to go. He was trapped leg
before wicket by Brandes with Sri Lanka's score at a poor 4 for 49
in the 11th over.
	   Brandes had an impressive 3 for 19 of 7 overs.
	   Aravinda de Silva helped Sri Lanka get back into the game by
scoring 55 off 68 balls, including six boundaries, but he too was
given out, adjudged leg before wicket, to Murray Goodwin.
	   Roshan Mahanama, who compiled 51 off 61 deliveries, shared a
face-saving seventh-wicket partnership of 46 runs with rookie
Thilan Samaraweera, who hit 20 from 41 deliveries.
	   However, Mahanama fell prey to medium paceman Evans who
undermined the lower order with two wickets in a single over.
	   Mahanama was bowled in the opening ball of the 48th over with
Sri Lanka's score at 188 for 9.
	   Evans returned figures of three for 11 as Zimbabwe's bowling
attack stuck to a tight line and length backed by a strong
fielding.
	   On Friday, Sri Lanka lost by three wickets to India in the
opening match of the dlrs 85,000 tournament which ends on Nov. 13.

Seeking Yeltsin's resignation, communists mark Russian revolution

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's aging and dwindling masses of Communists
took to the streets Saturday to mark the 81st anniversary of the
Russian revolution and demand the resignation of President Boris
Yeltsin.
	   About 5,000 people gathered at Lubyanka Square, site of the
former headquarters of the KGB secret police, to wave red flags and
banners and recall the glory years of Soviet power.
	   Many protesters were elderly and poor, and their common refrain
was that Yeltsin was to blame for the loss of Soviet-era stability
and the country's economic collapse. Speeches by leftist leaders
were also heavily larded with anti-Semitic rhetoric _ a seemingly
growing trend that Yeltsin denounced on Friday.
	   Similar demonstrations were held in over 200 other cities and
towns across Russia, and in several former Soviet republics. The
crowds were mostly orderly, although a state-run television
channel, ORT, said one of its cameramen was badly beaten and had
his camera smashed while covering the demonstration in Nizhny
Novgorod, Russia's third largest city.
	   An estimated 10,000 people gathered in St. Petersburg, Russia's
second-largest city, where the revolution began in 1917.
	   Throughout the country, crowds mostly fell short of organizers'
predictions. The Interior Ministry calculated that fewer than
150,000 people participated nationwide _ half the number that
Communist organizers had predicted for Moscow alone. Demonstrators
were rueful about their lack of strength.
	   ``People used to celebrate this holiday,'' said retired teacher
Lidiya Alexeeva, waving a small red flag in time to the music of a
marching band. ``Now there are no holidays. If you live in our
country, you see that our people are the poorest in the world.''
	   Yeltsin, who has been at the southern Black Sea resort of Sochi
for the past week recuperating from his latest illness, made a
taped television broadcast Saturday afternoon.
	   Speaking slowly and looking pale, the president called Russia's
revolutionary period ``irrevocably over.''
	   Referring to the Communists, he said: ``Yes, they again came out
with red banners, they again cursed reforms and called for
cancellation of the presidency, but only fanatics could call for a
massacre or an uprising like in ... 1917.''
	   The relatively quiet gathering in Moscow was in sharp contrast
to Soviet-era spectacles, in which the country's Communist leaders
gathered atop Lenin's mausoleum on Red Square to review a massive
military parade as hundreds of thousands of people looked on.
	   There is widespread discontent with Yeltsin, whose popularity
rating is in single digits, according to several recent polls. But
opposition groups have not been able to mount large street
demonstrations, strikes, or other protests.
	   Besides criticizing Yeltsin at every turn, communist speakers
said they would work to help Russia's poor make it through the
winter with enough food.
	   ``We must quickly gather all our resources and provide all
people with the ability to survive the winter,'' said communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov. ``Solidarity is the greatest weapon of the
people.''
	   Most Russians ignored the holiday. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the
outspoken ultranationalist leader, noted that Russia has two
holidays marking changes in its governmental system _ Nov. 7 and
the June 12 anniversary of the Soviet collapse.
	   ``How drugged must our people be to celebrate the collapse of
their country twice a year?'' he asked, according to the Interfax
news agency.

French skipper claims first place in 50-foot yacht race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Jean-Pierre Mouligne of France
claimed first place in the 50-foot category of the Around Alone
sailing race.
	   Mouligne, who entered Cape Town harbor on Friday, was followed
Saturday by British skipper Mike Garside.
	   American Brad van Liew sailed in just one and a half hours after
Garside, having lost second place in the last 36 hours of the race.
	   ``I had a blizzard about three days ago. The whole boat was
covered in snow, Garside said.
	   The 60-foot boats in Class I category started arriving last
Saturday, with Mike Golding of Britain smashing the old speed
record for the 7,000-mile (11,200-kilometer) leg of the race from
Charleston, South Carolina in the U.S.
	   Golding's time was 34 days and 18 hours.
	   The 27,000-mile (43,450-kilometer) long Around Alone race is
divided into four legs. The solo racers will stop in Auckland, New
Zealand, and Punta del Este, Uruguay, before returning to
Charleston next spring.
	   The race began in 1982 and is held once every four years.

Kosovo Serbs protest Albanian self-rule in the province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Alarmed that President Slobodan
Milosevic's talks on the future of Kosovo would effectively hand
over the province to ethnic Albanians, Kosovo Serbs protested
Saturday against any deal that would make them ``second-class
citizens.''
	   Some 200 participants at the gathering in Kosovo's capital
Pristina - local Serb leaders, opposition politicians and Serbian
Orthodox Church dignitaries - said they are basically for a
peaceful solution, but denied the right to Milosevic's regime ``to
negotiate or sign any agreement'' on behalf of the whole nation.
	   Under international pressure, Milosevic is negotiating with U.S.
envoys on allowing Albanian self-rule in the province where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1.
	   ``The agreement may be very damaging for Serbia, for Kosovo
Serbs and the entire nation,'' said Momcilo Trajkovic, a leader of
Kosovo's dwindling Serb community. ``We will become second-class
citizens here.''
	   In a unanimously adopted charter, the Pan-Serb convention warned
the international community of a likely ``massive exodus of Serbs''
if ethnic Albanian authority is established in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians have been unsuccessfully seeking independence
for years. Following hit-and-run attacks against Serbian police
stations and patrols, Milosevic ordered an all-out offensive to
crush the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting with arms for the
independence of the province.
	   After hundreds of casualties, some 300,000 displaced people and
NATO threats of intervention, Milosevic agreed to stop the
crackdown, pull out some troops and allow a broad autonomy for
Kosovo.
	   Blueprints of the settlement indicate the ethnic Albanians will
be allowed to form their authorities while the province would
formally remain within Serbia and the Yugoslav federation.
	   ``Problems in Kosovo have escalated because of the undemocratic
and autocratic regime of Slobodan Milosevic. The regime violates
basic human rights of all citizens, not of any ethnic community in
particular,'' the charter said.
	   The document also blamed the ethnic Albanian ``decades-long
separatism, aimed to secede Kosovo and create a Greater Albania''
by uniting with neighboring Albania proper.

	   PARIS (AP) _ World No. 1 Pete Sampras slammed an ace to close
out a tight second-set tiebreaker and beat compatriot Todd Martin
6-4, 7-6 (7-5) Saturday to reach the final of the dlrs 2.55 million
Paris Open.
	   The top-seeded American skipped and pumped his fist in the air
after the semifinal win, clearly relieved after a back injury
earlier in the week threatened his chances of staying in the
tournament.
	   Sampras, the defending champion, will face Britain's
hard-serving Greg Rusedski in Sunday's final. Rusedski beat Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in a tough, seesaw match that
had the crowd stomping their feet.
	   Sampras has beaten Rusedski all six times they've played.

Gulf Council's advisory committee meets for the first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A new committee designed to give the public a
greater say in decision-making in Gulf countries held its inaugural
meeting on Saturday.
	   The 30-member advisory panel was created almost a year ago at
the December summit of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council in
Kuwait.
	   Kuwait is the only GCC state with an elected parliament but, as
in the other member states, power is ultimately held by the ruling
family. The other GCC members are Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
	   Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, proposed the
committee as a forum that would give opinions on issues referred by
member governments.
	   On Saturday, committee members elected Abdullah Bishara, a
Kuwaiti and former secretary general of the GCC, as their chairman.
	   In his acceptance speech, Bishara described the panel as
expressing a ``renewal in thought and ... flexibility in the
regimes,'' the Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   A committee member from Qatar, Hamad bin Abdul-Aziz al-Kawwari,
wrote in Saturday's edition of the independent Kuwaiti newspaper,
Al-Qabas, that the forum's success would depend on what issues it
reviews, its candor in dealing with them, and whether its
recommendations are taken into consideration.
	   Academics and opinion-makers have criticized the 17-year-old
GCC, a loose political and economic alliance, for failing to
improve the lives of its ordinary citizens.
	   The committee consists of five men appointed as representatives
of each member state.
	   The Kuwaiti agency said 10 members are former or serving Cabinet
ministers and four are former editors of newspapers or magazines.

Swiss grant legal aid in Lazarenko case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland is helping Ukrainian
authorities in their attempts to track down money allegedly stashed
away in Swiss banks by a former premier and current opposition
leader, an official said Saturday.
	   Folco Galli, spokesman for the Federal Police Office, said since
February 1997 it had received 20 separate requests from Ukraine for
legal aid in the case of Pavlo Lazarenko, who is accused of
corruption.
	   Switzerland had handed over some bank documents to Ukraine,
Galli said. But he could not confirm a report by the respected Neue
Zuercher Zeitung newspaper that about dlrs 40 million in accounts
had been frozen.
	   Most of the investigations in Switzerland concerned gathering
evidence and questioning witnesses, he said.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister in 1996-97, when he was sacked by
President Leonid Kuchma. He now leads the centrist opposition
Hromoda party and has accused Kuchma and his allies of trying to
blacken his name by the corruption charges.
	   Last month he alleged that authorities were plotting to kill
him.
	   Ukraine's Justice Minister Suzanna Stanik visited Switzerland
last week for talks with her Swiss counterpart Arnold Koller and
Federal Prosecutor Carla del Ponte on legal assistance to the Kiev
government.
	   The Neue Zuercher Zeitung report said that several cantons
(states) had frozen accounts linked to Lazarenko.
	   Under Switzerland's decentralized legal system, individual
cantons are responsible for investigating charges of money
laundering.

Sunday looks like key day in tour talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Lloyd quotes 9th graf, Barbados Cricket reaction
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The cricket crisis threatening to ruin the West
Indies' historic tour to South Africa could be resolved as early as
Sunday.
	   The key seems to be the reported arrival Sunday of West Indian
Cricket Board President Pat Rousseau.
	   South African cricket chief Ali Bacher said Saturday he was
confident the tour would go on as scheduled and that Brian Lara and
Carl Hooper would be reinstated to restore the West Indies to full
strength.
	   The West Indian players, on strike in a pay dispute and in
support of sacked captain Lara and vice-captain Hooper, have
gathered in London and are threatening to abandon the tour.
	   Bacher said that after an hour-long talk with Rousseau Saturday,
he was convinced the dispute would be resolved.
	   ``While I cannot disclose what Mr. Rousseau told me, I'm certain
in my own mind that all problems will be resolved,'' Bacher said.
	   Bacher, West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, and WICB member
Joel arrived in London Friday and have held two days of informal _
and so far _ unfruitful talks with the players.
	   West Indian management and striking players are camped in
neighboring hotels near London's Heathrow Airport but the parties
are apparently content not to meet formally in the absence of
Rousseau.
	   Lloyd said the players deserved to be played commensurate with
their ability but negotiations should have been completed long
before the tour started.
	   ``I don't know what their beef is,'' he said Saturday. ``We'll
only know tomorrow when we have the meeting.''
	   Rousseau and other WICB officials were expected to arrive in
London on Sunday, although at least one report in the Caribbean
said Rousseau would not arrive until Monday.
	   The tour is scheduled to start with a one-day match at
Johannesburg on Tuesday, with the first test due to start on Nov.
26.
	   The key might still be a letter sent to the players by South
African President Nelson Mandela. This would be the West Indies'
first official tour of South Africa since the end of apartheid.
	   ``He (Mandela) conveyed the importance of this tour to our
country,'' Bacher said. ``He asked that the parties concerned
compromise, show goodwill, good intent and come to an amicable
solution which will ensure the tour takes place.''
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher added.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   The strike was sparked Wednesday when the WICB fired Lara and
Hooper after they refused to travel to South Africa.
	   Reported solutions include more prize money, increased meal
money, and the reinstatement of Lara and Hopper to the squad. There
are also suggestions Courtney Walsh would be named captain with
players saying off the record they'll hold out as long as it takes.
	   The WICB has said it would fine the no-show players between 5
and 10 percent of their tour fees, which could be as much as dlrs
60,000 for Lara.
	   Lara and Hooper have wide player support. Only seven of the 16
members of the squad traveled to South Africa, and all returned
Friday to London to rally around the two.
	   On Friday, Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll joined calls for
the WICB to be fired. ``The members of the board should be fired,''
he declared. ``This is not simply a matter of cricket and the board
cannot be allowed to treat the players in such a manner.''
	   In Port-of-Spain, the Trinidadian capital, Lara's fans set up a
massive blackboard in the heart of the city at Woodford Square and
dozens signed it to show ``100 percent support for Lara and his
men.''
	   The Barbados Cricket Association urged the WICB and the players
to reach a compromise in the best interests of the game and
relations between the Carribean and South Africa.
	   In a letter to Rousseau, the BCA recommended that Lara and
Hooper be reinstated and a meeting between the players
representatives and the WICB be set up as early as possible and
determine and document a negotiating procedure.
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.
	   Lara, the batting superstar of the sport, set a world record of
375 runs in a 1994 Test against England. A few weeks later, he
scored a first-class record of 501 for his English county side
Warwickshire.

	   PIACENZA, Italy (AP) _ Fly-half Diego Dominguez accounted for 13
points and Italy scored a try early in each half Saturday to build
a big lead and then hold off favored Argentina for a 23-19 victory
in a rugby union test match.
	   Alessandro Moscardi scored a try off a scrum just three minutes
into the match and Carlo Checcinato added another five points two
minutes after halftime with a short burst following a series of
nice exchanges up the left flank as the hosts built a 17-3
advantage before a crowd of about 8,000 at Garilli Stadium.
	   The Argentine-born Dominguez, who is Italy's all-time leading
scorer, connected on the two-point conversions after each try and
added penalty kicks in the 23rd minute of the game and in the 23rd
and 38th minutes of the second half.
	   Argentina fly-half Gonzalo Quesada scored off three penalties,
but also missed two kicks in a row in the second half _ six lost
points that could have given the South Americans a victory.
	   The visitors rallied late in the game as substitute Juan
Fernandez Miranda hit a penalty with 14 minutes remaining, and the
referee awarded Argentina a technical try in the closing minutes
when Dominguez was whistled for obstruction.
	   Italy, which last defeated Argentina in 1995, has put together a
string of impressive outings in the build-up to when it joins the
prestigious Five Nations tournament in 2000.
	   The Italians were opening their new season ahead of qualifying
rounds for the 1999 World Cup and earned a victory bonus of 5
million lire (dlrs 3,000) per player Saturday.
	   Massimo Cuttitta entered the game for Italy as a substitute at
the half-hour mark of the second half and tied the country's record
for most appearances with his 60th.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The lineups:
	   Italy _ Paolo Vaccari, Fabio Roselli, Cristian Stoica, Francesco
Mazzariol, Marcello Cuttitta (substitute: Manuel Dallan, 15th
minute), Diego Dominguez, Alessandro Troncon, Carlo Caione, Orazio
Arancio, Massimo Giovannelli, Valter Cristofoletto, Carlo
Checchinato, Franco Properzi (Massimo Cuttitta, 70th), Alessandro
Moscardi, Giampiero De Carli.
	   Argentina _ Manuel Contepomi, Diego Albanese, Eduardo Simone,
Lisandro Arbizu, Facundo Soler (Ezequiel Jurado, 53rd), Gonzalo
Quesada (Juan Fernandez Miranda, 60th), Agustin Pichot (Nicolas
Fernandez Miranda, 60th), Fernandez Lobbe, Rolando Martin (Miguel
Ruiz, 46th), Santiago Phelan (Martin Duran, 46th), Alejandro Allub,

	   LOCARNO, Switzerland (AP) _ A Bulgarian parachutist was killed
when his parachute failed to open properly at an international
tournament, officials said Saturday.
	   The dead man was part of a five-member display team attempting
at synchronized night-time jump from 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) on
to Locarno airfield late Friday.
	   His main parachute failed to open properly and his reserve
parachute got caught up, organizers said. He landed on a car and
died of his injuries.
	   The three day ``Day and Night'' international jumping event in
southern Switzerland was scrapped as a result of the tragedy.
	   The man was not identified.

Greece's OTE to buy Romania's telecommunication operator RomTelecom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Greece's Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA _ or OTE _ won Saturday the right to buy a 35
percent stake in the state telecommunication operator RomTelecom,
privatization authorities said.
	   ``OTE offered the best price possible on the market at this
moment,'' Communications Minister Sorin Pantis told private radio
ProFM.
	   OTE, Greece's state-owned company, offered for RomTelecom's
stake dlrs 675 million, and the contract signed Saturday stipulates
that OTE will invest another dlrs 400 million over the next three
years as needed to expand its activities.
	   Romanian privatization authorities, represented by the
Privatization Ministry and the State Ownership Fund, were to sign
next week with OTE a first contract on the privatization deal.
	   The remainder of RomTelecom will be sold in installments of 20
percent each year over the next three years.
	   Only Italy's STET International and OTE competed for the stake
in RomTelecom.
	   ``STET's offer did not include a bank guarantee and did not
specify any sum,'' Pantis said.
	   RomTelecom's is considered Romania's biggest privatization deal
to date.
	   RomTelecom has 50,000 employees and holds the communication
monopoly in Romania.
	   The company reported in 1997 a turnover of lei 6,130 billion
(almost dlrs 645 million) and a net profit of lei 706 billion
(almost dlrs 74 million).

Elton John concert backs fight against Hepatitis B
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 2100 GMT, Saturday Nov. 7. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Elton John gave a helping hand to United Nations
efforts to fight hepatitis B with a fundraising concert in Geneva
Saturday.
	   The World Health Organization is guaranteed a minimum 100,000
Swiss francs (dlrs 73,500) from the concert with further proceeds
from ticket sales and a charity auction.
	   Hepatitis B, a virus that attacks the liver, is spread through
exchange of bodily fluids. It can be transmitted through blood,
sexual contact or infected needles.
	   The Geneva-based WHO's vaccination campaign is subscribed to by
100 countries.
	   But some 25 to 30 nations are missing out because they can't
afford the vaccine, according to Bjorn Melgaard, director of WHO's
expanded program on immunization.
	   The donation from Elton John will be targeted at the countries
which has been unable to join the WHO program, many of which are in
sub-Saharan Africa.
	   The vaccine costs between 50 and 60 cents per dose in developing
countries.
	   WHO says it helped prevent 2.4 million children worldwide from
contracting the disease last year. Some 350 million people carry
the virus, it says.
	   U.N. health chief Gro Harlem Brundtland thanked the pop star
``on behalf of the WHO and the children who will benefit from this
donation.''
	   WHO ``cannot do this alone,'' she added.

Africa's most acclaimed boxer retires
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Azumah Nelson, Africa's most celebrated
boxer, is hanging up his gloves to devote time to business
interests and help develop young fighters, Nelson's spokesman said
Saturday.
	   Nelson, 38, a three-time world champion featherweight and
super-featherweight who is often praised as Africa's greatest boxer
of all time, leaves with a record of 39 wins, five losses and two
draws.
	   He plans to pursue his multi-million dollar real estate
interests and other business pursuits in his hometown of Accra, the
fighter's spokesman Sam Okaitey said.
	   Nelson also hopes to get involved in youth development programs
in Ghana and elsewhere, Okaitey said.
	   Nelson began his career in 1978 and turned pro shortly after the
1980 Olympics in Moscow, where he did not compete because of the
American-led boycott.
	   He has held various titles for more than 10 years and had a draw
and a victory in bouts against another triple world champion,

Elton John backs fight against Hepatitis B with concert

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Elton John gave a helping hand to U.N. efforts to
fight hepatitis B with a fundraising concert in Geneva on Saturday.
	   The World Health Organization is guaranteed a minimum 100,000
Swiss francs (dlrs 73,500) from the concert, with further proceeds
from ticket sales and a charity auction.
	   Hepatitis B, a virus that attacks the liver, is spread through
exchange of bodily fluids. It can be transmitted through blood,
sexual contact or infected needles.
	   The Geneva-based WHO's vaccination campaign is subscribed to by
100 countries.
	   But some 25 to 30 nations are missing out because they can't
afford the vaccine, according to Bjorn Melgaard, director of WHO's
expanded program on immunization.
	   The donation from Elton John will be targeted at the countries
which have been unable to join the WHO program, many of which are
in sub-Saharan Africa.
	   The vaccine costs between 50 and 60 cents per dose in developing
countries.
	   WHO says it helped prevent 2.4 million children worldwide from
contracting the disease last year. Some 350 million people carry
the virus, it says.
	   U.N. health chief Gro Harlem Brundtland thanked the pop star
``on behalf of the WHO and the children who will benefit from this
donation.''
	   WHO ``cannot do this alone,'' she added.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Faced with their worst defeat in postwar
German elections, the conservative Christian Democrats chose a new
leader Saturday to guide them into a future without Helmut Kohl.
	   Kohl gave up his grip on the party chairman's job in a tearful
farewell, the last act of an era that ended when voters dumped him
as chancellor on Sept. 27 after 16 years in power.
	   Party delegates elected his hand-picked successor, Wolfgang
Schaeuble, to the chairman's post that Kohl held for a
quarter-century.
	   Earlier, tears glistened on Kohl's jowls as a close aide, former
Labor Minister Norbert Bluem, praised his greatest success _ German
unification in 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
	   Schaeuble, 56, faces the tough task of modernizing the party's
image, something Kohl hindered.
	   In his convention speech, he promised to marshal a strong
opposition to the new center-left government of Social Democrats
and environmentalist Greens, which won on a pledge to fight
unemployment.
	   He attacked election victor Gerhard Schroeder as ``the
chancellor of randomness'' for leading Germany to the left despite
a centrist platform, and he vowed to oppose government plans to
ease citizenship rules to help integrate foreigners.
	   But he also chipped away at the 68-year-old Kohl's legacy,
making clear that the Christian Democrats had lost touch with
voters during his overbearing reign.
	   ``We must open up for new issues and thinking,'' he declared.
``The CDU must regain its ability to campaign.'' That could include
reaching out to labor unions and ecology-minded voters, he said.
	   A key task, he said, was regaining voters in economically
struggling eastern Germany, the formerly communist area where the
Christian Democrats were routed despite Kohl's image as ``father of
German unity.''
	   Considered a pro-market reformer, Schaeuble was Germany's most
popular politician in pre-election polls. A loyal Kohl protege who
suppressed his own yearning for the chancellorship, he has been in
a wheelchair since an apparently deranged man shot him during
campaigning in 1990.
	   Running unopposed, Schaeuble polled a strong 93 percent support
among the nearly 1,000 delegates. He will also keep his job as the
party's leader in parliament.
	   The rejuvenated leadership includes Christian Wulff, part of a
loose group of up-and-coming Kohl critics mostly in their 40s who
are known as ``Wild Youth.''
	   Wulff, who recently charged that the party has ``wasted away,''
won a vice chairman's post. The party's new general secretary,
Angela Merkel, is an eastern German.
	   With the focus on installing fresh faces, the Christian
Democrats barely began the debate on their future after their worst
showing in national elections since 1949.
	   Schaeuble said the party must defend its core values _ free
enterprise, European unity, law and order, and a commitment to
social justice rooted in Christianity.
	   Kohl urged the party to unite in the fight to regain power.
	   ``Let us not give in to pressure to run after changing trends of
political fashion,'' he said.
	   He smiled and waved from the podium as delegates gave him a
final, five-minute standing ovation before electing him honorary
chairman.

	   OPTERUSHA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two bullet-riddled cars in which
five ethnic Albanian guerrillas died and Milazim Krasniqi's black
eye showed the state of security Saturday in this shattered central
Kosovo village.
	   The guerrillas were ambushed Friday along the road by Serb
police, who routinely patrol the village and beat anyone trying to
move back, Krasniqi said.
	   He repeated the assertion by ethnic Albanian refugees
everywhere: until Serb police withdraw completely, ``there's no way
I'm spending the night here.''
	   Violence in Kosovo is growing despite a de-facto peace treaty
designed to end bloodshed in the turbulent Serbian province and set
the stage for a political agreement between Serb authorities and
the province's majority Albanians.
	   Seven ethnic Albanians, all believed to be guerrilla fighters,
have been killed since Thursday afternoon. The Serb Media Center, a
mouthpiece for Serb officials, reported the deaths occurred in a
series of attacks by guerrillas on police. No police were reported
killed or injured.
	   Foreign observers say attacks by both Serb forces and Albanian
guerrillas have increased this week. Such violence violates the
Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, reached under the threat of NATO
airstrikes on Yugoslav and Serb forces in Kosovo.
	   While Milosevic has complied with some aspects of the agreement,
complaints of attacks by Serb police on some of the tens of
thousands of refugees trying to return to their homes have
continued. The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army also has launched
attacks, mostly on police targets.
	   On Saturday, two blood-stained, bullet-riddled cars driven by
the slain rebels sat on the roadside near Opterusha, 55 kilometers
(35 miles) southwest of Pristina. Both cars appeared to have been
shot at head-on.
	   The Serb Media Center report said the rebels fired first on a
police patrol, but Krasniqi disagreed.
	   ``The police ambushed them as they drove down the road,'' he
said. ``There's no chance they could have survived.''
	   Krasniqi said police beat him and other residents when they
tried to return to their homes this week. His right eye was clearly
bruised.
	   ``They beat me just because I'm Albanian,'' he said. ``Now,
everyone is staying away.''
	   The Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement calls for setting up a 2,000
strong verification mission of unarmed observers run by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Until it begins operating, possibly by the end of the month, a
previous observer mission started in July will continue to operate
patrols throughout Kosovo.
	   Richard Huckaby, the spokesman for the U.S. sector of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, said an advance team for 74 more
American observers was coming to Kosovo on Saturday. The new
observers were contracted privately from DynCorp, a U.S. company of
military specialists.
	   The KDOM mission eventually will be absorbed into the larger
OSCE mission.
	   Also Saturday, KDOM chief Shaun Byrnes met with Adem Demaci, the
political spokesman for the guerrilla KLA, at Demaci's headquarters
in Pristina. No details of the meeting were immediately available.
	   It was unclear if Saturday's meeting was connected to talks that
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill held Friday with KLA figures in
Dragobilje, a village 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina.
	   Hill is working on a political settlement for Kosovo that would
restore the self-rule for the ethnic Albanian majority that
Milosevic stripped in 1989. But most Albanians, especially the KLA,
want full independence.
	   Showing its dissatisfaction with the Kosovo peace process, the
KLA said Friday it intends to establish its own civilian rule in
territory it controls.
	   Also Saturday, Kosovo Serbs protested against the possible
political deal, saying it would result in Milosevic effectively
handing Kosovo to the ethnic Albanians.
	   A gathering of the Serbs in Pristina _ including Serb leaders,
opposition politicians and Serbian Orthodox Church dignitaries _
said they opposed having Milosevic's regime sign any agreement on
Kosovo on their behalf.
	   In a unanimously adopted charter, the Pan-Serb Convention warned
the international community of a likely ``massive exodus of Serbs''
if ethnic Albanians come to power in Kosovo.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Battered by international sanctions
that have put Pakistan on the brink of economic collapse,
government officials welcomed the good news Saturday that
Washington had decision to lift some restrictions.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton wrote Pakistan's Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif to tell him, according to a foreign ministry statement
issued in the Pakistani capital.
	   The government is hoping this will be a ''harbinger of the
elimination of all sanctions, which Pakistan has consistently
maintained are unjustified and counterproductive,'' the ministry
statement said.
	   In his letter, Clinton assured Sharif that the U.S.
administration would ''exercise its influence with the
international financial institutions to meet Pakistan's economic
difficulties,'' the statement said.
	   This is good news for Pakistan, which is in the midst of
troubled talks with the International Monetary Fund for a dlrs 5
billion bailout package, without which Islamabad will surely
default on its dlrs 32 billion debt.
	   Sanctions imposed on both Pakistan and India following
underground nuclear tests in May hit this poor nation of 140
million particularly hard because of its heavy dependence on
international borrowing.
	   Neighboring India, which had foreign reserves in excess of dlrs
25 billion, was better able to weather the storm.
	   Less dependent on international aid, the Indian economy has not
been hit as hard, but Indian foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh
called the reported U.S. step ``positive.''
	   In a statement released late Saturday, the Indian foreign
ministry said all sanctions should go, particularly those affecting
international lending agencies. The ministry, reflecting
longstanding complaints from New Delhi that the United States
favors Pakistan, noted with some bitterness that according to
reports from Washington, the United States was lifting sanctions in
large part to prevent economic collapse in Pakistan.
	   ``India has nothing against economic assistance to Pakistan,''
the statement said. ``The remarks attributed to U.S. officials,
however, reveal a selective and discriminatory approach which we
find hard to understand and reconcile.''

Determined Sampras beats Martin; Rusedski beats Kafelnikov

	   PARIS (AP) _ Staying on course to retain his coveted No. 1 spot
at year's end, Pete Sampras was in convincing form Saturday,
beating fellow American Todd Martin 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) to reach the
final of the dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open.
	   The top-seeded American closed out the second-set tiebreaker
with an ace, then skipped and pumped his fist in the air, clearly
relieved to reach the final after a back injury earlier in the week
threatened his chances.
	   Sampras, the defending champion, will face Britain's
hard-serving Greg Rusedski in Sunday's final. Rusedski beat Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in a tough, seesaw match that
had the crowd stomping their feet.
	   Sampras has beaten Rusedski all six times they've played.
	   Both Americans were in top form on Saturday, and Sampras
recognized it.
	   ``Today's tennis was just about as good as it gets,'' he said.
	   After hurting his back Thursday during a match against France's
Jerome Golmard, Sampras showed no sign of injury Saturday, slamming
11 aces and volleying with ease.
	   ``It's amazing, the ups and downs I've gone through the last few
days,'' he said. ``My back felt just about as good as it could feel
today.''
	   But Martin was not an easy opponent, hitting 13 aces himself and
matching Sampras' power from all parts of the court.
	   In the first set, the players held serve until 5-4, when Sampras
broke Martin to take the set.
	   In the second set, it was more of the same, with Martin saving a
break point for 3-3 and then four break points in the exciting
eighth game to even the set at 4-4.
	   The players battled to 6-6, then played a hard-fought
tiebreaker. Sampras screamed with relief when he got the mini-break
at 6-4, but Martin answered right back with an ace for 6-5. Sampras
closed out the match with an ace of his own.
	   Sampras is looking to end the season as No. 1 for a sixth
consecutive year, and that quest will take him to Hanover for the
ATP World Championships, where he will be competing for the top
spot against Chile's Marcelo Rios.
	   But first, he plays next week in Stockholm _ all in an attempt
to gain as many points as possible in his quest to stay No. 1.
	   ``I need goals,'' Sampras said. ``I need something to work
for.''
	   Martin, ranked No. 26, had a great tournament in Paris, beating
both Patrick Rafter and Andre Agassi on the way to his matchup with
Sampras.
	   ``It was thrilling,'' he said Saturday. ``I've had a great
week.''
	   But he was still frustrated at the loss to Sampras.
	   ``A player like me doesn't get an opportunity like this too
often, and its disappointing that I couldn't make better of it,''
he said.
	   Rusedski, whose game is based on his huge serve, raced to a 5-2
lead in the first set, and looked as if he was going to make short
work of the sometimes erratic Kafelnikov, a former French Open
champion.
	   But Kafelnikov came back to win the second set 6-4.
	   The most dramatic point of the match came in the third set at
4-3, Rusedski serving, when a Kafelnikov shot was called out. He
argued bitterly and the crowd agreed, becoming so boisterous that
for several moments Rusedski couldn't continue serving. But the
Briton held on to go up 5-3, then closed out the match two games
later.
	   ``It's worked very well for me this week,'' he said later,
addressing the Parisian crowd in French. ``Of course it will be a
very tough match against Pete, I've never beaten him. But if the
public supports me, maybe I can do it.''

Dublin scores two in Villa debut; Derby beats Liverpool
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dion Dublin, in his first match with Aston Villa,
scored two first-half goals Saturday as the league leaders beat
Tottenham 3-2 on a day when Liverpool went down to Derby 2-1.
	   The win kept Aston Villa on top of the Premier League with 25
points, four ahead of Manchester United and five ahead of defending
champions Arsenal. Manchester United was to face Newcastle on
Sunday and Arsenal played Everton.
	   Villa, unbeaten in 11 league games this season, needed the
victory after bouncing back from a home loss Tuesday to Spain's
Celta, eliminating the English side from the UEFA Cup.
	   Dublin, who moved from Coventry earlier in the week on a
5.75-million-pound (dlrs 9.5 million) transfer from Coventry,
scored on a short volley in the 31st minute and then broke in all
alone to score in the 38th.
	   Middlesbrough, holding down fourth place with 18 points, had to
settle for a 3-3 draw at last-place Southampton with all the goals
comes in the second period. Paul Gascoigne, trying to bounce back
after entering a substance-abuse clinic, got the first goal of the
match in the 47th.
	   Derby, playing without seven regulars, won 2-1 at Liverpool's
Anfield _ Derby's first win there in 29 seasons. Derby moved into
fifth place with 17 points, the same as Leicester and Wimbledon.
	   It was also Liverpool's first home loss of the season and a
come-down after eliminating Spain's Valencia Tuesday in the second
round of the UEFA Cup.
	   In other games Saturday: Blackburn 1, Coventry 2; Charlton 0,
Leicester 0; Nottingham Forest 0, Wimbledon 1.
	   In Sunday matches: Leeds vs. Sheffield Wednesday; Arsenal vs.
Everton; West Ham vs. Chelsea; Manchester United vs. Newcastle.
	   In England's first division, Sunderland stayed on top with 37
points after a 3-1 home win over Grimsby. Ipswich has 32 points in
second place after a 2-2 draw at Huddersfield. Birmingham also has
32 after beating cross-town rival West Brom 3-1.
	   In Scotland's Premier Division, Celtic stunned Dundee 6-1 just
hours after club general manager Jock Brown resigned. Elsewhere in
Scotland's top league it was: Aberdeen 2, Dunfermline 1; Dundee
United 2, Motherwell 2. Hearts 2, Kilmarnock 1.
	   Rangers, playing Sunday at St. Johnstone, lead with 24 points to
23 for Kilmarnock.

Ship found off adrift off southern Italy bearing hundreds of

abandoned immigrants &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police found a dilapidated freighter bearing about
400 illegal immigrants drifting off southeastern Italy on Saturday,
abandoned by its crew.
	   Six children and two women from the boat were taken to a
hospital for examination.
	   The first police to board the ship described the overall
condition of the refugees, most of them Kurds, as ``distressing,''
Italy's ANSA news service said.
	   The ship had been painted black to avoid detection. Italian
police found it about 400 meters (1,300 feet) off the very tip of
the Italian peninsula, its engines cut.
	   It was unclear how many days the refugees had been adrift.
Authorities said the refugees may have been trying to signal other
boats at the time they were found.
	   The immigrants were taken from the boat to a holding center.
Police were questioning them to find out the country from which the
boat left.
	   Authorities said favorable conditions at sea made for an
overnight influx of illegal refugees along the coast of Italy's
poor Puglia region, across the Adriatic from Albania and
Yugoslavia. Hundreds are believed to have come to shore; 200 or
more of them were stopped.
	   Interior Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino had gone to Albania on
Oct. 28 to promise more Italian assistance stopping the flow of
refugees.
	   She expressed frustration Saturday, saying, ``We had wished and
hoped that the phenomenon would in some way be contained and
stopped.''

	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Steffi Graf, surprising herself, reached
the final of the Leipzig Open Saturday as her latest comeback from
injury continued to gather steam.
	   The former world No. 1 needed one hour and 52 minutes to
struggle past Belgium's Dominique van Roost, 6-1, 3-6, 6-0 at the
dlrs 450,000 event in her first tournament in two months.
	   Graf, seizing on 12 double faults by the world's 13th-ranked
player, said she hadn't expected this good of results so early in
her latest comeback bid.
	   ``I'm surprised. None of these matches were easy, I wasn't
handed any points,'' said Graf, who had a operation for a bone spur
on her right hand following the U.S. Open in late August.
	   ``I'm trying to get back to the top, but I've had a lot of
injuries the past few months. But I keep overcoming them and coming
back,'' added Graf, 29.
	   Graf, now ranked 22nd, faces match between top-ranked Nathalie
Tauziat of France in Sunday's final. The Wimbledon finalist ousted
Romania's Irina Spirlea, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.
	   Van Roost double faulted away the last point in a match that was
tougher for Graf than the outcome indicated.
	   Van Roost often dictated play against a tentative if steady
Graf, catching the German flatfooted by blasting winners into the
open court.
	   ``I notice then that if I had played more in the last two,
years, I might be able to hit shots with more precision and
pressure,'' said Graf, whose career has been curtailed by injuries
in recent years.
	   Van Roost hit three double faults to hand Graf a 2-0 first set
lead, then added two more as she gave the German a key 2-0 break in
the final set.
	   Graf, who helped found the Leipzig tournament, now boasts a 24-0
record at the event, where she had claimed four of her 104 career
titles.
	   The victory pushed Graf's record total career earnings to dlrs
20,366,842. Her victory Friday against France's Anne-Gaelle Sidot
vaulted her past Martina Navratilova's 13-year-old earnings mark of
20,344,061.
	   ``Such records do show what you've achieved but they are not all
that important to me,'' said Graf.

Three brothers drown in a Nile canal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ On Saturday morning the Mohammeds of the
Nile Delta were a happy family of five. By evening they were a
family of two.
	   The three children _ brothers Sayed Mustapha, 10, Ibrahim, 9,
and Ahmed, 7 _ had drowned while taking a dip in a canal.
	   On hearing of the tragedy, their mother lost her powers of
speech and their father fainted, police officials said in Faqus, a
town 90 kilometers (55 miles) northeast of Cairo.
	   It is not known why the boys drowned while having a swim on
their way home from school. Swimming in the canals that irrigate
the Delta is a common pastime.
	   Their bodies have been recovered, said the officials, who spoke
on customary condition of anonymity.

	   OPTERUSHA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two bullet-riddled cars in which
five ethnic Albanian guerrillas died and Milazim Krasniqi's black
eye showed the state of security Saturday in the shattered Kosovo
village of Opterusha.
	   The guerrillas were ambushed Friday by Serb police, who
routinely patrol the village and beat anyone trying to move back,
Krasniqi said.
	   He repeated the assertion of ethnic Albanian refugees everywhere
in Kosovo: Until Serb police withdraw completely, ``There's no way
I'm spending the night here.''
	   Violence in Kosovo is growing again despite an accord designed
to end bloodshed in the turbulent Serbian province and set the
stage for a political agreement between Serb authorities and the
province's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   Seven ethnic Albanians, all believed to be guerrilla fighters,
have been killed since Thursday afternoon. The Serb Media Center, a
mouthpiece for Serb officials, said the deaths occurred in a series
of attacks by guerrillas on police. No police were reported killed
or injured.
	   Foreign observers say attacks by both Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian guerrillas have increased this week. Such violence
violates the Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, reached under the
threat of NATO airstrikes on Yugoslav and Serb forces in Kosovo.
	   While Milosevic has complied with some aspects of the agreement,
complaints of attacks by Serb police on some of the tens of
thousands of refugees trying to return to their homes have
continued. The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army also has launched
attacks, mostly on police targets.
	   Milosevic stripped the majority Albanians of self-rule in 1989
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
That sparked protests and increased violence that led to his
crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in February.
	   The rebels have rejected any political agreement that stops
short of full independence for Kosovo, although they grudgingly
agreed to stop fighting if not attacked.
	   Kosovo Serbs protested a possible political deal Saturday,
saying it would result in Milosevic effectively handing Kosovo to
the ethnic Albanians.
	   A gathering of Serbs in Pristina, including Serb leaders,
opposition politicians and Serbian Orthodox Church dignitaries,
said they opposed having Milosevic's regime sign any agreement on
Kosovo on their behalf.
	   In a unanimously adopted charter, the Pan-Serb Convention warned
the international community of a likely ``massive exodus of Serbs''
if ethnic Albanians come to power in Kosovo.
	   Also Saturday, two blood-stained, bullet-riddled cars driven by
the slain rebels sat on the roadside near Opterusha, 55 kilometers
(35 miles) southwest of Pristina. Both cars appeared to have been
shot at from head-on.
	   The Serb Media Center report said the rebels fired on a police
patrol first, but Krasniqi disagreed.
	   ``The police ambushed them as they drove down the road,'' he
said. ``There's no chance they could have survived.''
	   Krasniqi said police beat him and other residents when they
tried to return to their homes this week. His right eye was
bruised.
	   ``They beat me just because I'm Albanian,'' he said. ``Now
everyone is staying away.''

Lawmakers fight pitched battle over bill as protesters march
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL-HENRI du LIMBERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of people opposed to the leftist
government's proposal to give legal status to unmarried couples
marched through Paris Saturday as opposition lawmakers waged a
pitched parliamentary battle to kill the bill.
	   The right has proposed more than 1,000 amendments to the bill --
known as the Civil Solidarity Pact, or PACS -- that the leftist
government hopes to adopt Tuesday. But a barrage of delaying
tactics, including marathon debates, stands in the way.
	   Last Tuesday, centrist deputy Christine Boutin, one of the
bill's most outspoken opponents in parliament, denounced the
proposal in a speech that lasted more than five hours. Another
planned five-hour speech Saturday was cut short by Speaker Laurent
Fabius after just three hours.
	   Meanwhile, opponents made themselves heard in the streets where
thousands of people from around France marched against the bill.
	   Opponents contend the measure strikes at the heart of French
values and could lead to homosexual adoptions.
	   Carrying signs reading ``PACS Attack'' and ``Love Doesn't
PACS,'' demonstrators marched through the Left Bank to the
esplanades of the Invalides, site of Napoleon's tombe.
	   Police put the number of protesters at just over 7,000, while
organizers said there were 130,000 people in the streets.
	   The proposal was initially scuttled by rightist politicians Oct.
9.
	   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said it
has made only minor changes to the bill.
	   The revised bill would allow two unrelated people to conclude a
union that would, among other things, allow them to file joint tax
returns, gain inheritance benefits, and take part in the other's
social security coverage.
	   Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou on Friday called for an end to
``fantasies'' over the legislation. ``The real debate,'' she said,
``is that we must be able to recognize the rights of people who
live together without being married, be they homosexual or
heterosexual, or be they people without carnal ties.''

Istanbul ousts convicted Islamic mayor from office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Authorities ousted Istanbul's
pro-Islamic mayor as a result of his conviction for inciting
religious hatred, Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia news agency said
Saturday.
	   The ouster was made official after an administrative court
upheld Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 10-month prison sentence on Thursday.
	   Erdogan, elected in 1994 as the first Islamic-oriented mayor of
Turkey's largest city, was sentenced in September following his
conviction for reading aloud a stridently Islamic poem at a rally.
	   The conviction barred him from ever again serving in public
office. It ended the political career of a man many saw as a future
leader of Turkey's Islamic political movement.
	   The Islamic movement has been hit repeatedly by Turkey's secular
establishment, which closed down a forerunner of Erdogan's Virtue
Party earlier this year.
	   The leader of that party, former Premier Necmettin Erbakan, was
banned from politics for five years.
	   Istanbul's city board is to elect a new mayor from among its
members in the next 10 days.
	   It's not clear when Erdogan would start serving his sentence.
Turkish law would let him postpone it until after the holy month of
Ramadan, which starts in mid-December.

Bayern Munich coasts against 1860 in showdown of top teams
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Bayern Munich, which hasn't lost to its cross-town
rival for 21 years, kept that streak alive against 1860 Munich
Saturday in a battle between the Bundesliga's two top teams.
	   Bayern Munich, led by Jens Jeremies, proved they have no rivals
in the German league at the moment in a convincing 3-1 victory
against the second-place team.
	   Jeremies, who came from 1860 this season, broke open a scoreless
match in the 60th minute by blasting in a header. Striker Alexander
Zickler, four minutes later, and defender Thomas Linke in the 87th
finished off the one-sided match.
	   ``There's a block there, it's unexplainable,'' said 1860 player
Harald Cerny. ``We'll beat them when we believe in ourselves
more.''
	   The win by Bayern, over a team it has long overshadowed in
Munich, moved it eight points clear in the table.
	   In an even more one-sided match, hapless Borussia
Moenchengladbach was crushed 7-1 by VfL Wolfsburg. The last-place
team had been routed 8-2 in its last match against Bayer
Leverkusen.
	   Bayern Munich appeared sluggish after a 2-1 win Champions Cup
triumph Wednesday against Barcelona, but still had enough left to
coast to its ninth win in 11 Bundesliga outings.
	   Jeremies, a 24-year-old German national team player, paved the
way for his former club's downfall when he sprang Thomas Strunz
free with a pass, charged to the goal and headed in his teammate's
long cross.
	   ``He's become one of the most important players on the club.
He's a fighter and he wants to win,'' said Munich coach Ottmar
Hitzfeld.
	   Zickler followed by blasting a shot into the left side of the
net, while Linke connected on a rocket from 18 meters (18 yards).
In the 90th minute, Jochen Kientz scored a consolation goal for
1860.
	   In other matches, FC Kaiserslautern edged SC Freiburg 1-0,
Bochum beat visiting Berlin 2-0, Schalke and Hamburg played to 2-2,
while Hansa Rostock and Frankfurt also played a 2-2 draw.
	   Visiting Kaiserslautern, moving up to fourth place, beat
Freiburg at home when Bulgaria's Marian Christov, connected in the
37th minute on a counter.
	   Moenchengladbach's players were derided by management as
``spineless'' after the 8-2 debacle against Leverkusen. Against
Wolfsburg, recording its biggest Bundesliga win ever, they didn't
do much to refute the charges.
	   After Ghana international Charles Akonner put Wolfsburg up 2-1
in the 14th minute, the team folded. Akonner scored again, while
Roy Praeger and Andrzei Juskoviak added a pair apiece against zero
resistance.
	   ``The goals fell like fruit from a tree,'' said one Wolfsburg
player.
	   Berlin again failed to win an away match, this time falling
victim to a mistake by keeper Gabor Kiraly that allowed Axel
Sundermann to score in the 60th minute. Zdravko Drincic followed
for Bochum's second goal in the 89th minute.

Istanbul ousts convicted Islamic mayor from office
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Authorities ousted Istanbul's
pro-Islamic mayor as a result of his conviction for inciting
religious hatred, Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia news agency said
Saturday.
	   The ouster was made official after an administrative court
upheld Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 10-month prison sentence on Thursday.
	   Erdogan, elected in 1994 as the first Islamic-oriented mayor of
Turkey's largest city, was sentenced in September following his
conviction for reading aloud a stridently Islamic poem at a rally.
	   The conviction barred him from ever again serving in public
office. It ended the political career of a man many saw as a future
leader of Turkey's Islamic political movement.
	   The Islamic movement has been hit repeatedly by Turkey's secular
establishment, which closed down a forerunner of Erdogan's Virtue
Party earlier this year.
	   The leader of that party, former Premier Necmettin Erbakan, was
banned from politics for five years.
	   Istanbul's city board is to elect a new mayor from among its
members in the next 10 days.
	   It's not clear when Erdogan would start serving his sentence.
Turkish law would let him postpone it until after the holy month of
Ramadan, which starts in mid-December.

	   SILAT AL HARITHIYA, West Bank (AP) _ The radical group Islamic
Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the suicide bombing of a
crowded Jerusalem market and promised more attacks to try to block
the new peace accord.
	   ``This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the
last,'' the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organizations.
``We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the
Zionist enemy.''
	   The leaflet could not immediately be authenticated, but its
style was consistent with that of past communications from the
group.
	   An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of Damascus
confirmed that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed
responsibility for Friday's bombing in an interview with the
Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo.
	   Palestinian security sources and the families of the dead
bombers had already identified them as Islamic Jihad activists. At
least half a dozen other Islamic activists have been rounded up
since the bombing, the sources said.
	   Although Hamas initially claimed responsibility through
anonymous phone calls to the police, all sides now have agreed that
it was Islamic Jihad that carried it out. There was no immediate
explanation for the inaccurate claim, but the two groups have
carried out attacks together in the past as part of their goal of
stopping the peace process.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An Iraqi Kurdish leader said Saturday a
proposed Kurdish federation in northern Iraq could be formed only
through dialogue with a free Iraqi government.
	   A U.S.-backed deal in September that sealed a cease-fire between
the two Iraqi Kurdish factions that control northern Iraq referred
to a future federal authority for Kurds.
	   ``That is the wish of our people,'' Masoud Barzani, leader of
the Kurdistan Democratic Party, told a news conference in Ankara.
``The Kurdish regional parliament in 1992 declared this principal
vital.''
	   However, he said, ``this can only be implemented with the
central government in Baghdad when there is free Iraq.''
	   The reference to a federal structure for Kurds had angered
Turkey. Turkey opposes creation of a Kurdish state in northern
Iraq, fearing it inspire Turkey's own Kurdish rebels in their fight
for autonomy.
	   But Turkish leaders declared themselves reassured the plan would
not lead to creation of a Kurdish state after meeting with Barzani
on Wednesday.
	   ``We do not call for the establishment of an independent Kurdish
state, nor have Americans encouraged us to do so, at all,'' Barzani
said. ``We know that this is not a realistic objective and we know
the consequences of calling for an independent Kurdish state in
this region.''
	   Repeatedly throughout Kurdish history, Kurds rebellions were
crushed by forces of states in which they have lived. At present,
they are divided by five national borders.
	   ``Therefore, really, we look for what is possible for our people
under these circumstances,'' Barzani said.
	   He made no direct reference to Saddam Hussein. Saddam rejected
Kurds' 1992 call for a federal authority, saying Kurds should be
satisfied with the limited autonomy he offered them in 1970.
	   Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit said Wednesday that Barzani agreed
that ``any solution to northern Iraq has to be within the
territorial integrity of Iraq.''
	   Under the September accord, Barzani and Jalal Talabani of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan agreed to share power and hold
elections in the de facto autonomous Kurdish zone in northern Iraq,
set up after 1991 Gulf War.
	   Barzani said the elections were scheduled for July.
	   Talabani also arrived in Ankara on Saturday and is expected to
meet with Barzani on Sunday.
	   Barzani said they would discuss details of carrying out the
accord.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Staying on course to retain his coveted No. 1 spot
at year's end, Pete Sampras was in convincing form Saturday,
beating fellow American Todd Martin 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) to reach the
final of the dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open.
	   The top-seeded American closed out the second-set tiebreaker
with an ace, then skipped and pumped his fist in the air, clearly
relieved to reach the final after a back injury earlier in the week
threatened his chances.
	   Sampras, the defending champion, will face Britain's
hard-serving Greg Rusedski in Sunday's final. Rusedski beat Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in a seesaw match that had the
crowd stomping their feet.
	   Sampras has beaten Rusedski all six times they've played.
	   Both Americans were in top form on Saturday, and Sampras
recognized it.
	   ``Today's tennis was just about as good as it gets,'' he said.
	   After hurting his back Thursday during a match against France's
Jerome Golmard, Sampras showed no sign of injury Saturday, slamming
11 aces and volleying with ease.
	   ``It's amazing, the ups and downs I've gone through the last few
days,'' he said. ``My back felt just about as good as it could feel
today.''
	   But Martin was not an easy opponent, hitting 13 aces himself and
matching Sampras' power from all parts of the court.
	   In the first set, the players held serve until 5-4, when Sampras
broke Martin to take the set.
	   In the second set, it was more of the same, with Martin saving a
break point for 3-3 and then four break points in the exciting
eighth game to even the set at 4-4.
	   In the tiebreaker, Sampras screamed with relief when he got a
mini-break at 6-4, but Martin answered right back with an ace for
6-5. Sampras closed out the match with an ace of his own.
	   Sampras wants to end the season as No. 1 for a sixth consecutive
year, and that quest will take him to Hanover for the ATP World
Championships, where he will be competing for the top spot against
Chile's Marcelo Rios.
	   But first, he plays next week in Stockholm _ all in an attempt
to gain as many points as possible in his quest to stay No. 1.
	   ``I need something to work for,'' he said.
	   Martin, ranked No. 26, had a great tournament in Paris, beating
both Patrick Rafter and Andre Agassi on the way to his matchup with
Sampras.
	   ``It was thrilling,'' he said Saturday. But he was still
frustrated at the loss to Sampras.
	   ``A player like me doesn't get an opportunity like this too
often, and its disappointing that I couldn't make better of it,''
he said.
	   Rusedski, who hit a 216 kph (134 mph) serve Saturday, raced to a
5-2 lead in the first set and looked as if he would make short work
of the sometimes erratic Kafelnikov, a former French Open champion.
	   But Kafelnikov came back to win the second set 6-4.
	   The most dramatic point of the match came in the third set at
4-3, Rusedski serving, when a Kafelnikov shot was called out. He
argued bitterly and the crowd agreed, becoming so boisterous that
for several moments Rusedski couldn't serve. But the Briton held on
to go up 5-3, then closed out the match two games later.
	   ``It's worked very well for me this week,'' he said later,
addressing the Parisian crowd in French. ``Of course it will be a
very tough match against Pete, I've never beaten him. But if the
public supports me, maybe I can do it.''
	   Kafelnikov said he'd simply succumbed to the pressure.
	   ``If I had played calmly from the beginning ... it would have
been different,'' he said.
	   Asked if he saw a possible Rusedski victory over Sampras on
Sunday, he had a blunt reply: ``Not at all.''

 &UR; Belgrade war crimes debate: Yugoslavia must cooperate on Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. war crimes official
rejected Saturday Yugoslav authorities' claim that the
Netherlands-based U.N. war crimes tribunal has no jurisdiction over
Kosovo province.
	   ``In the U.N. Security Council there is unanimous consent of all
its members that investigators of The Hague tribunal have full
authority to do their job in Kosovo,'' said David Scheffer, the
U.S. State Department's war crimes envoy at a panel discussion held
in Belgrade.
	   Yugoslav authorities, dominated by President Slobodan Milosevic,
have defied international pressure to allow prosecutors from the
U.N. tribunal to look into allegations of atrocities in Kosovo, the
southern province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Speaking at the round-table discussion organized by the
Belgrade-based non-governmental Humanitarian Law Center, Scheffer
said there were reasons to believe that ``serious violations of
international law'' were committed in Kosovo.
	   On Wednesday, Yugoslavia refused to allow tribunal staff to
probe alleged atrocities in Kosovo. Tribunal Chief Prosecutor
Louise Arbour and a team of investigators had been planning a
weeklong mission in Kosovo, but were granted visas only to attend
the Belgrade meeting, which they declined. They were effectively
banned from Kosovo.
	   Arbour and Scheffer have threatened Yugoslavia with U.N.
sanctions if the authorities continue to defy demands for unlimited
access.
	   ``Since February this year, between 600 and 1,000 people died in
Kosovo, many more were wounded,'' Scheffer said about the war
between Kosovo's ethnic Albanian separatists and government forces.
	   Scheffer criticized the authorities for also defying earlier
demands to extradite three Yugoslav army officers suspected of war
crimes in the 1991 Croatian war.
	   Serbia and Yugoslavia cooperate with the tribunal in cases where
Serbs were victims in Croatia and Bosnia. Extraditions of Serbs
have been refused on grounds that it would be against the country's
law and the constitution. Scheffer said that could have been
settled by changing the regulations.
	   He also engaged in a heated debate with a Belgrade lawyer, Milan
Vujin, who alleged that the Hague tribunal was an instrument for
political pressure on small countries like Yugoslavia.
	   Scheffer rejected the claim, saying that ``The Hague tribunal is
not a political instrument,'' adding every court needs ``support
from political institutions... especially for financing.''

Tajikistan troops surround rebel forces in northern towns

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops have encircled
bands of rebel fighters in two northern outposts and appeared
poised Saturday to put down the latest revolt in the restive
Central Asian nation.
	   More than 200 combatants and civilians have been killed since
the rebels launched raids in the northern part of the country
Wednesday, renewing concerns about the government's ability to
maintain order.
	   After suffering losses at the beginning of the fighting, the
government forces have surrounded the rebels in the northern city
of Khudzhand and the village of Aini, news reports said.
	   In Khudzhand, the site of the first attack on Wednesday, about
40 rebels were holed up in an old fortress in the city center.
Government troops have retaken the rest of the city, but have not
attempted to storm the fortress because it is well fortified and
the rebels were holding captured soldiers as hostages, official
said.
	   Khudzhand is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the
capital Dushanbe.
	   Meanwhile, government forces have surrounded a second group of
rebels in Aini, a village about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of
the capital, presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov was quoted as
saying by Russian news agencies reported.
	   Although Saidov said there were as many as 300 rebels in Aini,
Interfax quoted the government commander at the scene, Maj. Gen.
Sukhrob Kasymov, as saying his men were fighting about 120 rebels
Saturday night.
	   Six government soldiers were killed and nine wounded Saturday,
and the government said 16 rebels were killed and four captured.
	   Also, ITAR-Tass reported that Aziz Saidov, Tajikistan's trade
representative to Russia and a member of the Tajik parliament, was
killed by rebels Saturday while he was on a business trip in
northern Tajikistan.
	   The rebels are led by former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, who
has demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov free all political
prisoners and bring his supporters into the government. The
president has ruled out any talks with the rebels.
	   Former prime minister Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov and other
ex-government officials also were involved in organizing the
rebellion, said Saidov, the president's spokesman.
	   ``They are feverishly looking for ways to leave the boundaries
of the republic,'' Saidov told the ITAR-Tass.
	   Khudoberdyev claimed his guerrillas had mined the dam on the
Kairakkhum reservoir, and threatened to set off explosions that
would ``flood vast territories of Central Asia.''
	   The Kairakkhum reservoir is so large it is referred to locally
as a ``sea.'' But the government said army forces were protecting
the dam and it was not in danger of sabotage.
	   A peace treaty signed last year formally ended five years of
civil war between Rakhmonov's hardline, secular government and the
mostly Muslim opposition. The main opposition groups are now
participating in the government and the armed forces.
	   However, a number of warlords have refused to recognize the
peace deal and periodically launch small-scale rebellions. The war,
which began shortly after the country received independence from
the Soviet Union, has badly damaged the economy in the poor,
mountainous nation.

	   Capsules on matches played Saturday.
 &UR; Aston Villa 3 Tottenham 2 (2-0) &QC; 
	   Dion Dublin scored two _ and apparently scored three _ in his
debut with Aston Villa. On top of goals in the 31st and 38th, he
also netted one in the 77th. The play was called off side, though
television replays showed differently. Dublin's new running mate up
front, Stan Collymore, made it 3-0 in the 48th before Tottenham
rallied with a penalty by Darren Anderton in the 65th and a goal
from substitute Ramon Vega in the 76th.
 &UR; Blackburn 1, Coventry 2 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Noel Whelan got the winner for Coventry in the 74th. Coventry's
Darren Huckerby gave his side a 1-0 lead in the 54th, but Tim
Sherwood tied 1-1 in the 73rd. Blackburn has only nine points, just
clear of last-place Southampton with seven. Coventry has 11.
 &UR; Charlton 0, Leicester 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   A hard-earned point for both sides in a sellout at the Valley.
Steve Walsh came closest for the visitors with a header cleared off
the line in the 24th by Addicks skipper Mark Kinsella. Clive
Mendonca came nearest to scoring for Charlton with a shot that went
just wide of Kasey Keller's post in the 58th minute.
 &UR; Liverpool 1, Derby 2 (0-2) &QC; 
	   Derby got off to a 2-0 lead on goals by Kevin Harper (6th) and
Paulo Wanchope (27th) and then held on with Jamie Redknapp scoring
for Liverpool in the 84th. Liverpool, with its first league loss at
Anfield since February, has only one league win in its last eight
matches. Liverpool forwards Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen did
little, shut down by Derby defenders Steve Elliott, Horacio
Carbonari and Jacob Laursen.
 &UR; Nottingham Forest 0, Wimbledon 1 (0-1) &QC; 
	   Marcus Gayle scored the winner for Wimbledon in the 23rd as
Forest, in 19th place in the 20-team league, continues to struggle.
Pierre van Hooijdonk, playing his first match after refusing to
join Nottingham Forest for three months, was jeered the first few
times he touched the ball. He missed a shot wide of the post after
just 25 seconds and also had a good chance off a free kick. His
contribution was limited and he did well to last 90 minutes.
 &UR; Southampton 3, Middlesbrough 3 (0-0) &QC; 
	   This was a difficult draw to suffer for Middlesbrough as it
finished with only nine players and got the equalizer in the 90th
from Gianluca Festa. Paul Gascoigne made it 1-0 after 47 minutes,
but Ken Monkouis leveled in the 61st. Middlesbrough's Robbie Mustoe
was then given his second yellow card in the 62nd. Still, Buro took
a 2-1 led in the 66th on an own goal by Claus Lundekvam. James
Beattie evened again for Southampton in the 82nd. In the 85th, Egil
Ostenstad gave Southampton a 3-2 lead, which looked safe when
Middlesbrough's Phil Stamp got a red card in the 87th to set the
stage for Festa's equalizer.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Marku Tuomainen scored two goals as
host Finland beat the Czech Republic 5-3 Saturday to win the
Karjala Cup ice hockey tournament.
	   With only one game left against defending world champion Sweden
on Sunday, Finland leads the standings with four points.
	   Jarkko Ruutu, who turned down three offers to join the Vancouver
Canucks earlier this fall and stayed with his Finnish League team
in Helsinki, opened the scoring at 7:07.
	   Aki Petteri Berg, back in Finland after a disappointing stint
with the Los Angeles Kings, and Juha Rihijarvi also scored for the
Finns before a crowd of 10,327.
	   David Vyborny, Jan Srdinko and Tomas Kucharcik scored for the
Czechs, who meet the Russians on Sunday.
	   The tournament is the second in the European Hockey Tour. Sweden
won the first tournament in the Czech Republic two months ago.

As Colombian troops pull out, residents await rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CESAR GARCIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) _ Amid doubts about rebel
intentions, a government troop pullout went into effect Saturday in
five war-wracked Colombian towns where peace talks are set to begin
by December.
	   President Andres Pastrana's concession, the removal of 2,000
soldiers and police from a region of foothills and savannahs the
size of Switzerland, is the boldest ever in efforts to end his
country's 34-year civil war.
	   ``We've carried out the president's orders,'' army chief Gen.
Jorge Mora said in a radio interview Saturday, confirming the
evacuation. The troops were redeployed along the perimeter of the
16,200-square-mile (42,000-square-kilometer) pullout zone.
	   It is a stronghold of the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which has been fighting since the
1960s and hold the battlefield advantage over the dispirited
military.
	   With the troops now absent as a guarantee for guerrilla
negotiators, the rebels _ who already rule the surrounding
countryside _ are expected to waltz into town centers across the
demilitarized zone.
	   A delegation led by presidential peace envoy Victor G. Ricardo
arrived in San Vicente on Saturday. Tree-planting, poetry reading
and the release of 500 white doves were planned for the afternoon.
	   The process is moving forward despite growing doubts about the
guerrillas' willingness to make peace.
	   ``Pastrana is putting all his eggs into one basket, and it's a
very fragile basket,'' former government peace negotiator Jesus
Antonio Bejarano said this week.
	   Recent rebel attacks are deepening the fears. A week ago, the
FARC overran a remote state capital in southeastern Colombia,
raining homemade missiles on an outmanned police barracks and
killing at least 50 people.
	   The FARC may just be flexing muscle, hoping to strengthen its
hand in the talks, ``but that's the most benign hypothesis, and
there aren't many who agree with it,'' said former foreign minister
Augusto Ramirez Ocampo.
	   Perhaps as a goodwill gesture, rebels on Saturday freed the
mayor of Milan, a town 78 miles (125 kilometers) southwest of San
Vicente. He had been held since April to protest elections.
	   At a news conference Friday, Ricardo said the pullout would not
disrupt everyday life. The national cattlemen's association said,
however, that rebels have already expropriated 8,000 steers from
the area.
	   Courts were closed and shifted to nearby towns, although banks,
schools and hospitals and transportation would function normally,
Ricardo said. Civilians are to be deputized as temporary police,
but they will not carry arms.
	   Ricardo said peace talks would begin once both sides agree that
security is adequate. A commission of Colombian and international
observers will help monitor each side's actions.
	   Pastrana says he'll attend the negotiations, but it's unclear
whether across the table from him will be FARC commander Manuel
Marulanda, who has voiced fears of an assassination attempt.
	   The talks will probably focus on rebel demands to reform
Colombia's corrupt political system and skewed wealth distribution.
The guerrillas have also offered to swap the nearly 300 police and
soldiers they've captured in battle for 452 guerrillas held in
government jails.
	   Also at issue will be Colombia's booming cocaine trade, which
Pastrana says can only be stemmed if there is peace.
	   The rebels' top revenue sources are taxes on peasant coca
production and payoffs for providing security to drug traffickers.
In a recent interview, Marulanda said the FARC would help the
government convince farmers to switch to legal crops over three to
five years.

USA thrashes Estonia, solidifies bid to remain in A-Pool
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: will be UPDATED with later matches &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KLAGENFURT, Austria (AP) _ Corey Millen scored three times to
lead the United States to a crushing 7-1 win over Estonia at the
A-Pool qualifying tournament Saturday, solidifying the Americans'
chances of climbing back up among the world's elite hockey nations.
	   Having also won their opening game Thursday against Kazakhstan,
the Americans could clinch one of the four remaining A-Pool berths
as early as Saturday evening if Austria defeats the Kazaks in the
day's later match.
	   ``I feel confident we're the best team here at the tournament,''
said Millen, 34. ``Our toughest task lies ahead with our final
match against Austria, but if the Austians win tonight we might
requalify early, and not have to worry about it too much.''
	   It was immediately apparent the Americans would dominate the
Estonians, with Millen opening the scoring just 3:24 into the game
and David Emma doubling the lead less than two minutes later.
	   Deflecting Michael Rucinski's shot from the blueline, Millen
scored again on a powerplay, giving the Americans a 3-0 lead at
just 8:10 into the match.
	   Set up by the powerful Neal Broten and Michael Hartman duo,
Rucinski scored his own less than three miuntes later, flicking the
puck into the top left corner over Estonian netminder Aleksei
Terentjev's shoulder.
	   Estonia's lone goal was as unconvincing as their game plan, with
Mikhail Korsunov's feeble shot sending the puck trickling past a
distracted Parris Duffus at 16:47.
	   Tightening their game in the second while the Americans relaxed
theirs, the Estonians managed to prevent the United States from
causing any more damage for the first 15 minutes of the period.
	   It was only at 15:10 that Broten, one of the American ``Miracle
on Ice'' workers at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics, once again came
to the fore.
	   Broten, who, with Hartman led the team to a 3-0 win over the
Kazaks Thursday, increased the gap to 5-1 on a pass from Joe
Mullen, a 17-year NHL veteran and the all-time American-born
leading scorer, who came out of retirement for the tournament.
	   Millen assisted another goal with just 41 seconds remaining in
the second, as Hartman took the United States to a comfortable 6-1
lead, the Americans accounting for all the scoring in the period
and a desperate Estonia all the penalties.
	   Millen closed the scoring with a shorthanded goal at 14:30 into
the final period, on a pass from Hartman, taking the Americans up
to 7-1.
	   ``Estonia is a young team,'' said Millen, who's played in two
Olympic Games and two world championships. ``It was definitely a
question of experience over youth. Against Kazakhstan, too.
	   ``Many of them must have looked across the ice and seen some
guys with big NHL names from the past,'' said Millen, who plays for
Cologne in the German League. ``Maybe they were a little
intimidated.''
	   The United States' campaign is seemingly one of their most
successful efforts in what has been a disastrous year. The nation
made an early quarterfinal exit at the Nagano Olympics, prompting
certain American players to trash room at the athletes' village.
The whole incident was soon followed by an embarassing 12th place
finish at the world championships, its NHL-packed team recording
just a single victory.
	   The United States has relied mainly on a patchwork team of NHL
oldtimers and European league players to avoid returning to B-Pool
competition for the first time since 1983.
	   Broten, 38, retired from the NHL in 1997, while Mullen, 41, who
ended a 17 year NHL career in 1997, have both been key.
	   ``It's tough, I haven't skated that much and I'm a little
sore,'' said Broten. ``I'm honored that U.S. Hockey gave me a
chance to do this again.
	   ``I haven't played in almost two years, in fact I've only skated
maybe 15 times,'' estminated Broten. ``I've been pretty lucky here,
I don't have too much jump.''
	   In nearby Ljubljana, Slovenia, the Ukraine beat Germany 2-1 in
group B action.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Heeding warnings of epidemics of
hepatitis, malaria and other diseases, Hondurans trying to put
their lives back together lined up Saturday for vaccinations amid
the debris left by Hurricane Mitch.
	   Across flooded Central America, health authorities warned that
outbreaks of water-related diseases such as malaria and cholera
could emerge in the week to come. International relief flights
delivered the first water purification plants and needed medicines.
	   Dozens of taxi drivers took a break from shoveling tons of
debris in Tegucigalpa's devastated Comayaguela market district to
line up for tetanus and malaria shots Saturday. Troops stood watch
nearby, wearing face masks to ward of the stench from the many
blocks of muck and garbage, where it was feared more bodies were
still buried.
	   ``They say there likely are more people in there,'' said
Felicito Sorido, 51, who with hundreds of fellow drivers
volunteered for the massive cleanup in hopes of reaching their
cabs, buried several blocks away.
	   Juanita Aleman, 30, a health ministry nurse, filled syringes,
rolled up the drivers' sleeves and administered shots from a small
desk on a dusty sidewalk.
	   ``The military first asked for these shots for their soldiers,''
she said. `` Now the taxi drivers. Aside from conjunctivitis
there's no epidemic yet, but we expect it to come.''
	   Twenty-five cases of cholera have been reported in Guatemala,
the Public Health Ministry there reported Friday. The Guatemalan
government has increased water-treatment efforts to prevent the
disease from spreading.
	   Throughout Central America, the storm killed an estimated 10,000
people.
	   More than 6,000 people were killed in Honduras and hundreds of
thousands were left homeless. Each day, dozens more bodies are
found throughout the nation, including 15 in the town of Kabor in
the province of Intibuca.
	   U.S. Army Secretary Luis Caldera was inspecting storm damage and
meeting President Carlos Flores on Saturday. Caldera was expected
to continue on to Nicaragua, where an estimated 4,000 died in
flooding and mudslides last week. Hundreds also died in Guatemala
and El Salvador.
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development has sent relief
aid, and plans to ship dlrs 20 million worth of food to Honduras,
El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala in the next week, bringing the
U.S. government's relief package to dlrs 70 million.
	   Other nations are helping as well. Pledges include Spain's dlrs
13.4 million, Australia's dlrs 630,000, dlrs 2.6 million from
Taiwan and dlrs 300,000 from Ireland, as well as tons of food and
medicine and donations from private groups and the United Nations.
	   Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter visited Nicaragua on Friday,
and former president George Bush was to visit Honduras on Sunday.
Carter said following a flight over Nicaragua's disaster zone that
``the worse is yet to come, cholera and dengue.''
	   Already strained to near-capacity, Tegucigalpa hospitals expect
a swarm of storm-related patients as the government patches up
roads. Workers hastily fixed up a temporary connection between the
capital and San Pedro Sula to the north, allowing the first
shipments of gasoline to Tegucigalpa.
	   In the south, three children contracted hemorrhagic dengue, and
one died, said Elliethe Giron, a government vice minister.
Thousands of respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia, have been
reported, while 17 cases of hepatitis A occurred in the northern
town of Pena Blanca, she said.
	   Giron urged residents to stay clear of muddy rivers that may
carry human and animal remains and to filter, chlorinate and boil
water before drinking it.
	   Still, many in Tegucigalpa _ where water service has been
severely disrupted _ failed to heed the warnings, washing clothes
or salvaging possessions in mud-ridden rivers or drinking untreated
water.
	   ``Next week,'' said Dr. Ivan Cruz, an emergency room supervisor
at Tegucigalpa's Teachers Hospital, when asked when the surge in
patients could come.

Sunday looks like key day in tour talks

	   LONDON (AP) _ The reported arrival Sunday of West Indian Cricket
Board President Pat Rousseau appears to be the key to ending a
strike by the islanders that could wipe out a historic tour to
South Africa.
	   The West Indians, embroiled in a pay dispute and rallying in
support of sacked captain Brian Lara and vice-captain Carl Hooper,
have gathered in London and are threatening to abandon the tour.
	   South African cricket chief Ali Bacher said Saturday he was
confident the tour would go on as scheduled and that Lara and Carl
would be reinstated.
	   Bacher talked by telephone with Rousseau for an hour Saturday
and said he was sure the dispute would be cleared up.
	   ``While I cannot disclose what Mr. Rousseau told me, I'm certain
in my own mind that all problems will be resolved,'' Bacher said.
	   Bacher, West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, and WICB member
Joel arrived in London Friday and have held two days of informal _
and so far _ unfruitful talks with the players.
	   West Indian management and striking players are camped in
neighboring hotels near London's Heathrow Airport but the parties
are apparently content not to meet formally in the absence of
Rousseau.
	   Lloyd said the players deserved to be well paid, but said
negotiations should have been completed before the tour started.
	   ``I don't know what their beef is,'' he said Saturday. ``We'll
only know tomorrow when we have the meeting.''
	   Rousseau and other WICB officials were expected to arrive in
London on Sunday, although at least one report in the Caribbean
said Rousseau would not arrive until Monday.
	   The tour is scheduled to start with a one-day match at
Johannesburg on Tuesday, with the first test due to start on Nov.
26.
	   The key might still be a letter sent to the players by South
African President Nelson Mandela. This would be the West Indies'
first official tour of South Africa since the end of apartheid.
	   ``He (Mandela) conveyed the importance of this tour to our
country,'' Bacher said. ``He asked that the parties concerned
compromise, show goodwill, good intent and come to an amicable
solution which will ensure the tour takes place.''
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher added.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   The strike was sparked Wednesday when the WICB fired Lara and
Hooper after they refused to travel to South Africa.
	   Reported solutions include more prize money, increased meal
money, and the reinstatement of Lara and Hopper to the squad. There
are also suggestions Courtney Walsh would be named captain.
	   The WICB has said it would fine the no-show players between 5
and 10 percent of their tour fees, which could be as much as dlrs
60,000 for Lara.
	   Lara and Hooper have wide support. Only seven of the 16 members
of the squad traveled to South Africa, and all returned Friday to
London to rally around the two.
	   In a letter dated Friday, the Barbados Cricket Association urged
the WICB and players to reach a compromise. In a letter to
Rousseau, the BCA recommended that Lara and Hooper be reinstated
and a meeting between the players representatives and the WICB be
set up as early as possible.
	   Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll has been more forceful. ``The
members of the (WICB) board should be fired,'' he said. ``This is
not simply a matter of cricket and the board cannot be allowed to
treat the players in such a manner.''
	   In Port-of-Spain, the Trinidadian capital, Lara's fans set up a
massive blackboard in the heart of the city at Woodford Square and
dozens signed it to show ``100 percent support for Lara and his
men.''
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.
	   Lara, the batting superstar of the sport, set a world record of
375 runs in a 1994 Test against England. A few weeks later, he
scored a first-class record of 501 for his English county side
Warwickshire.

Congolese president rules out talks with Rwanda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila on Saturday
ruled out holding peace talks with Rwanda, which admitted a day
earlier that it has troops in Congo where a civil war has escalated
into a regional conflict.
	   Speaking on national radio, Kabila said his embattled government
was determined to ``win the war'' and would not negotiate with
Rwanda, which he said had invaded Congolese territory and pulled
the strings behind the rebellion.
	   ``We cannot make a pact with a tiny country such as Rwanda,''
Kabila said. ``Besides, we have the military advantage on the
ground and the people of Congo are determined to oust the
aggressors who are marionettes behind the rebellion.''
	   After three months of denials, Rwanda's Vice President Paul
Kagame on Friday acknowledged that an unspecified number of Rwandan
troops are in Congo. He said the troops were defending Rwanda's
security concerns.
	   Kagame said he hoped the admission would remove a final
stumbling block after several months of fruitless negotiations to
end the conflict.
	   Until now, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels,
demanding to speak directly with the Rwandans.
	   Civil war in Congo _ a vast, mineral-rich central African nation
_ has drawn in troops from at least six nearby countries since
early August.
	   Kabila's allies include Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad while
the rebels are apparently backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Kagame said Rwanda was willing to withdraw its forces but that
any settlement must involve considerations of Rwanda's security
concerns.
	   Rwanda has accused Kabila's government of failing to contain
Rwandan Hutu extremists rebels who have used Congolese territory as
a staging base for attacks on Rwanda.
	   The Hutu extremists fled Rwanda fearing retaliation for the 1994
Rwandan genocide in which more than 500,000 people were killed.
	   The Congolese rebels _ a coalition of Tutsi fighters, former
soldiers and former Kabila allies _ accuse Kabila of corruption,
mismanagement and stirring up ethnic rivalries.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Eight days after a new pro-western
government took power in Slovakia, Czech President Vaclav Havel
made an official visit on Saturday to the country that became
independent, as did the Czech Republic, following the peaceful
split of Czechoslovakia in 1993.
	   Havel was the first foreign official to meet the new Slovak
government and parliament that emerged from September elections
which toppled from power autocratic Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.
	   Shortly after arrival, Havel, who was accompanied by his wife
Dagmar, paid tribute to Alexander Dubcek, the Slovak-born leader of
the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' communist reform movement who died in a
road accident six years ago.
	   Former Slovak President Michal Kovac, who also visited Dubcek's
grave, said that Havel's visit ``is the beginning of a new era in
relations between the Czech Republic and Slovakia,'' the Czech news
agency CTK reported from the Slovak capital.
	   Havel spoke of his first-ever meeting with Dubcek back in 1968,
recalling how surprised he was that the Communist secretary general
was listening to him.
	   ``This ability for dialogue, tolerance, openness, ability to
listen to the others, that's a quality all politicians should
have,'' CTK quoted Havel as saying.
	   Havel did not visit Slovakia during the last four years when
Meciar was in power.
	   He said the Slovak government change means a lot for him
personally. ``I do not feel like an enemy of the government now,''
adding he was looking forward to more intensive relations between
the two neighboring republics.
	   ``I will use all means to stress that Slovakia today is
different than two months ago,'' he said, referring to the
September ballot.
	   Havel, who was invited by four non-governmental organizations,
was scheduled to meet with new Slovak PrimeMinister Mikulas
Dzurinda and other politicians at a dinner.
	   He said he wants to speak about European integration ``and about
how neighbors can help Slovakia, which is slightly behind.''
	   Havel was to return to the Czech Republic before midnight (2300
GMT) Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's aging and dwindling masses of Communists
took to the streets Saturday to mark the 81st anniversary of the
Russian revolution and demand the resignation of President Boris
Yeltsin.
	   About 5,000 people gathered at Lubyanka Square, site of the
former headquarters of the KGB secret police, to wave red flags and
banners and recall the glory years of Soviet power.
	   Many protesters were elderly and poor, and their common refrain
was that Yeltsin was to blame for the loss of Soviet-era stability
and the country's economic collapse. Speeches by leftist leaders
were also heavily larded with anti-Semitic rhetoric _ a seemingly
growing trend that Yeltsin denounced on Friday.
	   Similar demonstrations were held in over 200 other cities and
towns across Russia, and in several former Soviet republics. The
crowds were mostly orderly, although a state-run television
channel, ORT, said one of its cameramen was badly beaten and had
his camera smashed while covering the demonstration in Nizhny
Novgorod, Russia's third largest city.
	   An estimated 10,000 people gathered in St. Petersburg, Russia's
second-largest city, where the revolution began in 1917.
	   Throughout the country, crowds mostly fell short of organizers'
predictions. The Interior Ministry calculated that fewer than
150,000 people participated nationwide _ half the number that
Communist organizers had predicted for Moscow alone. Demonstrators
were rueful about their lack of strength.
	   ``People used to celebrate this holiday,'' said retired teacher
Lidiya Alexeeva, waving a small red flag in time to the music of a
marching band. ``Now there are no holidays. If you live in our
country, you see that our people are the poorest in the world.''
	   Yeltsin, who has been at the southern Black Sea resort of Sochi
for the past week recuperating from his latest illness, made a
taped television broadcast Saturday afternoon.
	   Speaking slowly and looking pale, the president called Russia's
revolutionary period ``irrevocably over.''
	   Referring to the Communists, he said: ``Yes, they again came out
with red banners, they again cursed reforms and called for
cancellation of the presidency, but only fanatics could call for a
massacre or an uprising like in ... 1917.''
	   The relatively quiet gathering in Moscow was in sharp contrast
to Soviet-era spectacles, in which the country's Communist leaders
gathered atop Lenin's mausoleum on Red Square to review a massive
military parade as hundreds of thousands of people looked on.
	   There is widespread discontent with Yeltsin, whose popularity
rating is in single digits, according to several recent polls. But
opposition groups have not been able to mount large street
demonstrations, strikes, or other protests.
	   Besides criticizing Yeltsin at every turn, communist speakers
said they would work to help Russia's poor make it through the
winter with enough food.
	   ``We must quickly gather all our resources and provide all
people with the ability to survive the winter,'' said communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov. ``Solidarity is the greatest weapon of the
people.''
	   Most Russians ignored the holiday. Former Prime Minister Yegor
Gaidar, who leads the liberal Democratic Choice Party, suggested it
might be time to ban the Communist Party again, as President Boris
Yeltsin did briefly after the Soviet collapse.
	   And Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the outspoken ultranationalist leader,
noted that Russia has two holidays marking changes in its
governmental system _ Nov. 7 and the June 12 anniversary of the
Soviet collapse.
	   ``How drugged must our people be to celebrate the collapse of
their country twice a year?'' he asked, according to the Interfax
news agency.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Marku Tuomainen scored two goals as
host Finland beat the Czech Republic 5-3 Saturday to win the
Karjala Cup.
	   With only one game left against defending world champion Sweden
on Sunday, Finland leads the standings with four points.
	   Jarkko Ruutu, who turned down three offers to join the Vancouver
Canucks of the North American National Hockey League earlier this
year and stayed with his Finnish League team in Helsinki, opened
the scoring at 7:07.
	   Aki Petteri Berg, back in Finland after a disappointing stint
with the Los Angeles Kings, and Juha Rihijarvi also scored for the
Finns before a crowd of 10,327.
	   David Vyborny, Jan Srdinko and Tomas Kucharcik scored for the
Czechs, who meet the Russians on Sunday.
	   The tournament is the second in the European Hockey Tour. Sweden
won the first tournament in the Czech Republic two months ago.

How the missteps added up for Gingrich
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ For months Newt Gingrich fielded questions
about Republican plans to oust President Bill Clinton. Who would
have thought Republicans would oust Gingrich instead?
	   Among the missteps that cost Gingrich his job _ this fall's
budget negotiations, which turned out better for President Clinton
than for Republicans, and an ad campaign that focused on Clinton's
character when voters wanted issues.
	   Gingrich also came under fire for mishandling impeachment
proceedings and for wildly over-optimistic predictions of
Republican success on election night _ which, when they turned out
wrong, fatally sapped his support within his own party.
	   Gingrich has always been a divisive figure _ he narrowly
survived one coup attempt last year. The speaker nevertheless
seemed poised before this fall's midterm elections to solidify his
position as the party's political leader.
	   But that confidence turned to political peril on election night
as core Democrats turned out in numbers, giving the Republicans a
loss of five Republican seats and whittling the Republican majority
to a thin dozen.
	   Gingrich had personally involved himself in his party's
fortunes, traveling to 48 states to campaign for House candidates
and, a week before the election, secretly approving an ad campaign
that included spots focusing on Clinton's affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky and on the president's credibility.
	   Sneered Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, the Democratic Party chief,
``Is that all you've got to say? 'Send us back and we'll
investigate the president more?'''
	   ``I do think it backfired,'' said Rep. Fred Upton. ``I think
some of my colleagues lost because of it.''
	   When asked about Clinton and impeachment, six in 10 voters said
they disapproved of how Congress was handling the matter. Nearly as
many said Congress should just drop the issue without proceeding to
impeachment hearings.
	   Yet there was House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde
issuing a statement after election day laying out a plan for
impeachment hearings.
	   Even before the election night debacle, many House Republicans
were already seething at Gingrich, saying he had negotiated away
the party's core values in striking a budget deal with the White
House.
	   ``At the end of this last Congress, we had budget train wreck,''
said Rep. Christopher Cox of California, who will now run for House
speaker.
	   But Gingrich was dismissive, bordering on insulting, saying that
lawmakers ``who have grown up and matured in this process
understand we have to work together on big issues.''
	   As to the Republican's failure to pass the dlrs 80 billion tax
cut approved earlier this year by the House, Gingrich blamed it on
the Senate. Only after the election did Gingrich concede, ``We
should probably have aggressively pushed cutting taxes.''
	   A tendency to underestimate his adversaries emerges in
Gingrich's recent history.
	   Last year, he dismissed as ``unruly children'' a group of
wayward House Republicans who later came close to engineering his
ouster. Days before voters came close to erasing the Republican
House majority, Gingrich wrote Clinton's political epitaph, saying
the president would be remembered as ``the man who ended the
Roosevelt majority.''
	   And even after the election, he said the House Republicans
mulling a run for the speakership ``are people who would in fact
take the party to a narrower base with fewer numbers.''
	   Gingrich, of course, also had great accomplishments: he was the
leader of the first sustained Republican takeover of the House
since before the Great Depression. But the mistakes the speaker
made in recent months were not unprecedented.
	   Last year's coup stemmed from anger in the Republican
rank-and-file over the 1995 government shutdown, another case where
Clinton appeared to get the better of Gingrich in head-to-head
negotiations.
	   In 1996, the House was preoccupied with an ethics investigation
of Gingrich that led to a 1997 vote of reprimand for his political
use of an ostensibly nonprofit academic organization. Later that
year, Republicans recoiled when it appeared Gingrich was ready to
yield to White House pressure on a tax cut bill.
	   This year the mistakes caught up with him.

Zimbabwe beats Sri Lanka by seven wickets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATED with Zimbabwe innings. CHANGES headline to Zimbabwe
win &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Grant Flower and Murray
Goodwin hit half centuries and Zimbabwe cruised to a seven-wicket
victory over Sri Lanka on Saturday in the Coca Cola Trophy.
	   After Sri Lanka was bowled out for 196 in 49.4 overs, Flower's
unbeaten 87 and Goodwin's 54 steered the Africans to 197 for three
in 46.1 overs.
	   Flower, who struck four boundaries in his 127-ball stand,
rallied Zimbabwe from 31 for two in the ninth over with a
third-wicket partnership of 90 with Goodwin, who reached his total
off 68 deliveries with six boundaries and a six.
	   Flower then joined brother for a for an unbeaten fourth wicket
of 76.
	   Sri Lanka's fielding, which is usually very good, was not up to
its mark, with captain Arjuna Ranatunga and Nuwan Zoysa dropping
easy catches.
	   Ironically, Ranatunga earned the dlrs 500 prize for the taking
the only catch of match, to dismiss Alistair Campbell for five off
Zoysa.
	   ``Our guys played really well and the disciplined run chase
capped a fine day for us,'' said Campbell, the Zimbabwe captain.
	   After winning the toss Zimbabwe opted to field and Eddo Brandes
and Craig Evans led a superb bowling performance that limited Sri
Lanka for 196 all out.
	   Zimbabwe took three wickets for 24, with Brandes having opener
Avishka Gunawardena (1) and Marvan Atapattu (0) leg before wicket.
	   Romesh Kaluwitharna was run out off Brandes' bowling by a direct
throw by Grant Flower at the other end.
	   Sanath Jayasuriya, who square cut a six and struck a boundary
off paceman Neil Johnson, was the fourth to go, again trapped by
leg before wicket by Brandes, with Sri Lanka's score at a poor four
for 49 in the 11th over.
	   Brandes finished with three for 19 of seven overs.
	   Aravinda de Silva helped Sri Lanka get back in the game with 55
off 68 balls, including six boundaries, but he too returned to the
pavilion after a leg before wicket given against him in Murray
Goodwin's bowling.
	   Mahanama, who scored 51 of 61 deliveries, had a face saving
seventh-wicket stand of 46 runs with Thilan Samaraweera, who
finished with 20 off 41 balls.
	   However, Mahanama fell prey to medium paceman Evans, who
undermined the lower order with two wickets in a single over.
	   Mahanama was bowled in the opening ball of the 48th over with
Sri Lanka's score at 188 for nine.
	   Evans had three for 11 as most Zimbabwe bowlers were backed by a
strong fielding.
	   Ranatunga, whose team was beaten on Friday by India in the
opening match of the tournament, praised Zimbabwe for their
performance but hoped his team will reach the finals.
	   ``Zimbabwe deserved to win because they played a better
all-round game than us but hopefully we will bounce back and win
the next two games to enter the final,'' he added.
	   On Sunday, Zimbabwe face India in the third match of the
three-nation dlrs 85,000 tournament, which ends on Nov. 13.

Sudan accuses Eritrea of firing rockets at its military positions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Eritrean forces fired rockets at Sudanese
military posts along the border Saturday, a Sudanese general said.
	   Eritrea has also massed ``three battalions, supported by tanks
and artillery'' on its border with Sudan, Gen. Abdel-Rahman
Sirul-Khatim said in a statement carried by the official Sudanese
News Agency.
	   Eritrean rocket launchers began firing at positions of the
Sudanese armed forces in the Hafrat area at 11:30 (9:30 GMT) and
continued for one hour, the general said.
	   ``The armed forces is monitoring these enemy movements and its
is ready to deal with them and deter them,'' he said.
	   Sudan has accused Eritrea of aiding Sudanese opposition groups
and of sending troops to fight alongside Sudanese rebels. Eritrea
has denied the charges.
	   Sudanese rebels have been fighting since 1983 for greater
autonomy for the Christians and animists in the south from the
Islamic north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the war
and related famines.

Newspaper: Pinochet says he feels betrayed by Britain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Embargoed until 0001 GMT Sunday, time set by source

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In his first public statement since his arrest in
a London hospital last month, former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet says he feels betrayed by Britain, The Sunday Times
reported.
	   ``I am saddened that the experience of my arrest has shaken my
belief in Britain. I did not believe I would be the subject of
spurious attempts by foreign prosecutors to convict me on unproven
charges,'' early editions of the newspaper available Saturday
quoted Pinochet as saying in a four page statement.
	   The newspaper said that the statement was passed to it Saturday
by a public relations company acting as an intermediary for the
general. A copy of the statement was sent to The Associated Press.
	   British police arrested Pinochet, 82, on Oct. 16 at the
instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him on
charges of genocide, terrorism and torture committed by his secret
police after he seized power in 1973, toppling President Salvador
Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to
include some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his
17-year-rule.
	   Pinochet's statement said that his arrest would undermine
attempts to achieve reconciliation in Chile, and compared the South
American country's predicament with those in Northern Ireland and
South Africa.
	   ``Today, we understand that reconciliation is essential to
peace. That is the lesson that we have learned from two world wars
and from numerous other conflicts this century,'' the statement
said,
	   ``In challenging Chile's reconciliation, Spain ignores it own
past,'' the statement said, a reference to the regime of late Gen.
Francisco Franco. ``Chile deserves the same rights as any other
country.''
	   Pincohet stepped down in 1990, but remained commander-in-chief
of the army until March as part of compromises in Chile's
transition to democracy.
	   The former dictator, who underwent back surgery Oct. 9, remains
under police guard in a north London hospital.

Simmering feud between prime minister, press erupts again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ The long-standing battle between
Prime Minister Basdeo Panday and the local media erupted again last
week as Panday accused the press of asking ``insulting, abusive and
stupid'' questions and then turned mum.
	   Panday also repeated old charges that racial emnity is behind
his problems with the press.
	   Panday's three years in office have been marked by his bouts
with the media. The latest incident occurred Tuesday when Channel 6
television reporter Natalie Williams asked about the awarding of a
contract for a new dlrs 100 million power plant.
	   The facility will be constructed by InnCogen, and a political
ally and friend of the prime minister, New York-based Trinidadian
businessman Namcaran Narine Singh, sits on the board of the
company.
	   ``Mr. Singh and I have been friends for over 20 years,'' Panday
told journalists. ``Do I suddenly abandon him? Or are you saying
that friends of the prime minister must not invest in this
country?''
	   On Friday, Panday took another approach, avoiding the press and
refusing to answer any questions at his public appearance.
	   Panday, the first Trinidadian of Indian descent to lead the
country, again accused ``certain sections of the media'' of
promoting racial strife in this two-island nation, which is split
between people of Indian and African ancestry.
	   He previously accused Port-of-Spain Daily Express newspaper
publisher Ken Gordon of racism, and he stirred controversy in 1997
by suggesting a new press law that Express and Trinidad Guardian
columnist and history professor Selwyn Cudjoe described as an
``official attempt to gag the press.''

Brazilian photographer who pictured massacre victims killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A Brazilian photojournalist whose
pictures of a peasant massacre were published around the world has
been killed ahead of the trial of police charged with the slayings,
a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Miguel Pereira de Melo was shot Thursday in Maraba, in the
Amazon state of Para, 1,600 miles (2,500 kms) northwest of Rio,
said the O Globo daily. He died in a hospital Friday.
	   Melo, 45, had been expected to testify at the trial of 159
police officers accused of the massacre of the landless farm
workers, said the newspaper.
	   The peasants were killed during a protest over land rights in
Eldorado de Carajas in April 1996. Melo's pictures of the peasants'
bodies piled in a truck were published in newspapers in Brazil and
abroad.
	   In April, tens of thousands of Brazilians gathered in 23 cities
to protest the delay in bringing the officers to trial. They were
led by the Landless Rural Workers Movement, which has gained
national prominence for invading uncultivated land to speed up the
government's agrarian reform effort.
	   About 20 percent of Brazil's population owns 88 percent of the
land, while the poorest 40 percent owns just 1 percent.
	   The Brazilian government said at the time that it hoped the
trial would take place by the end of the year. It was not clear
Saturday if a trial date had been set.
	   Police investigating Melo's death were unavailable for comment.

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Ethiopia's prime minister
warned neighboring Eritrea that a six-month border feud between the
two Horn of Africa countries will continue unless Eritrea withdraws
from disputed territory.
	   Arriving for a series of talks with African mediators, Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi said Ethiopia was hoping for peace but
prepared for a prolonged frontier squabble.
	   Meles and Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki began separate
meetings with the mediators appointed by the Organization of
African Unity on Saturday evening.
	   ``I'm coming here seeking peace and justice. I wouldn't be here
if I had no hope of it succeeding,'' Meles said. ``But the
underlying problem has not been resolved and that is Eritrea has
invaded part of our territory and occupied it. Until it has been
resolved, one cannot expect complete tranquility.''
	   Isaias did not speak to journalists and went straight to foreign
ministry offices in Burkina Faso's capital.

Kiwis' 36-16 win clinches historic series victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLTON, England (AP) _ Richie Barnett scored two tries and
created another Saturday as New Zealand fought back to score a
record-breaking 36-16 win over Britain.
	   The Kiwis, 22-16 victors in the first test last week, trailed
16-8 at halftime but scored five tries to nil in the second half to
register their first series win on British soil since 1971.
	   Britain scored on halftime to take a 16-8 lead but New Zealand,
despite squandering two certain tries, scored two tries in four
minutes shortly after the break to regain the lead and set-up the
win.
	   Barnett featured heavily in the opening minutes, taking a
brilliant catch from a bomb near his try line to deny Britain a
scoring chance, then combining with Stacey Jones for a 50-meter try
in the sixth minute.
	   British captain Andy Farrell reduced New Zealand's lead with a
penalty goal in the 18th minute before Jason Robinson scored the
home team's first try three minutes later.
	   Robinson came off the right wing, darted across field 30 meters
out and opened up the defense with two big, left-foot steps to
level the score. Farrell converted to give Britain an 8-6 lead.
	   New Zealand drew level when Darryl Halligan landed a long-range
penalty kick in the 27th minute but Farrell edged Britain ahead
10-8 with a penalty in the 33rd minute.
	   The Lions' relentless attacking raids leading into halftime were
rewarded when Iestyn Harris crossed for a try after selling two
dummies and splitting the defense on the quarterline.
	   But the Kiwis dominated the attack after the break.
	   Replacement forward Tony Puletua went to dummyhalf and barged
over from three meters in the 50th minute, then Barnett scored his
second when he leaped high to field a Jones' bomb on the Britain
line and touch-down next to the posts.
	   Halligan converted both tries and New Zealand had a 20-16 lead.
	   Sean Hoppe became New Zealand's most prolific try-scorer in the
60th minute when he swooped on a British mistake and sprinted 50
meters to score his 17th test try and stretch the lead to 26-16.
	   Ruben Wiki beat two defenders in a 10 meter charge to the line
in the 66th minute to extend the lead and Henry Paul finished off a
Barnett movement in the dying minutes to ensure New Zealand scored
its biggest winning margin over Britain.
	   The third test will be played at Watford on Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   BOLTON, England (AP) _ Richie Barnett scored two tries and
created another Saturday as New Zealand fought back to score a
record-breaking 36-16 win over Britain.
	   The Kiwis, 22-16 victors in the first test last week, trailed
16-8 at halftime but scored five tries to nil in the second half to
register their first series win on British soil since 1971.
	   Britain scored on halftime to take a 16-8 lead but New Zealand,
despite squandering two certain tries, scored two tries in four
minutes shortly after the break to regain the lead and set-up the
win.
	   Barnett featured heavily in the opening minutes, taking a
brilliant catch from a bomb near his try line to deny Britain a
scoring chance, then combining with Stacey Jones for a 50-meter try
in the sixth minute.
	   British captain Andy Farrell reduced New Zealand's lead with a
penalty goal in the 18th minute before Jason Robinson scored the
home team's first try three minutes later.
	   Robinson came off the right wing, darted across field 30 meters
out and opened up the defense with two big, left-foot steps to
level the score. Farrell converted to give Britain an 8-6 lead.
	   New Zealand drew level when Darryl Halligan landed a long-range
penalty kick in the 27th minute but Farrell edged Britain ahead
10-8 with a penalty in the 33rd minute.
	   The Lions' relentless attacking raids leading into halftime were
rewarded when Iestyn Harris crossed for a try after selling two
dummies and splitting the defense on the quarterline.
	   But the Kiwis dominated the attack after the break.
	   Replacement forward Tony Puletua went to dummyhalf and barged
over from three meters in the 50th minute, then Barnett scored his
second when he leaped high to field a Jones' bomb on the Britain
line and touch-down next to the posts.
	   Halligan converted both tries and New Zealand had a 20-16 lead.
	   Sean Hoppe became New Zealand's most prolific try-scorer in the
60th minute when he swooped on a British mistake and sprinted 50
meters to score his 17th test try and stretch the lead to 26-16.
	   Ruben Wiki beat two defenders in a 10 meter charge to the line
in the 66th minute to extend the lead and Henry Paul finished off a
Barnett movement in the dying minutes to ensure New Zealand scored
its biggest winning margin over Britain.
	   Halligan kicked five conversions and a penalty.
	   The third test will be played at Watford on Saturday.

Plea to forgive WWI mutineers sparks duel with president

 &UR; Eds: SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT spelling of ``censoring,'' ADD that
film forbidden in France for 18 years &QL; 
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A World War I mutiny that France all but erased
from its memory has returned to haunt the realms of state, stirring
a public dispute between the nation's conservative president and
the leftist prime minister who wants forgiveness to replace shame.
	   ``I think that (Prime Minister) Lionel Jospin did well to return
to our collective memory people who refused to be sacrificed like
cannon fodder,'' Socialist Deputy Jean-Louis Bianco told fellow
lawmakers Saturday as the dispute moved into its third day.
	   A week before France celebrates the 80th anniversary of the
war's end, Jospin, a Socialist, paid a visit Thursday to the
northern town of Craonne, near the site of a catastrophic offensive
against the Germans at Chemin des Dames. There, he asked that the
49 mutineers executed ``as an example'' be ``fully reintegrated
today into our national collective memory.''
	   Thousands of soldiers revolted during the bloody 1917 offensive,
refusing to fight on the front line. France has actively worked to
forget the rebellion, even censoring Stanley Kubrick's 1957 movie
``Paths of Glory'' that centered on the mutiny -- forbidden to be
shown in France for 18 years, according to the daily newspaper Le
Monde.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An Iraqi Kurdish leader said Saturday a
proposed Kurdish federation in northern Iraq could be formed only
through dialogue with a free Iraqi government.
	   A U.S.-backed deal in September that sealed a cease-fire between
the two Iraqi Kurdish factions that control northern Iraq referred
to a future federal authority for Kurds.
	   ``That is the wish of our people,'' Masoud Barzani, leader of
the Kurdistan Democratic Party, told a news conference in Ankara.
``The Kurdish regional parliament in 1992 declared this principal
vital.''
	   However, he said, ``this can only be implemented with the
central government in Baghdad when there is free Iraq.''
	   The reference to a federal structure for Kurds had angered
Turkey. Turkey opposes creation of a Kurdish state in northern
Iraq, fearing it inspire Turkey's own Kurdish rebels in their fight
for autonomy.
	   But Turkish leaders declared themselves reassured the plan would
not lead to creation of a Kurdish state after meeting with Barzani
on Wednesday.
	   ``We do not call for the establishment of an independent Kurdish
state, nor have Americans encouraged us to do so, at all,'' Barzani
said. ``We know that this is not a realistic objective and we know
the consequences of calling for an independent Kurdish state in
this region.''
	   Repeatedly throughout Kurdish history, Kurds rebellions were
crushed by forces of states in which they have lived. At present,
they are divided by five national borders.
	   ``Therefore, really, we look for what is possible for our people
under these circumstances,'' Barzani said.
	   He made no direct reference to Saddam Hussein. Saddam rejected
Kurds' 1992 call for a federal authority, saying Kurds should be
satisfied with the limited autonomy he offered them in 1970.
	   Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit said Wednesday that Barzani agreed
that ``any solution to northern Iraq has to be within the
territorial integrity of Iraq.''
	   Under the September accord, Barzani and Jalal Talabani of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan agreed to share power and hold
elections in the de facto autonomous Kurdish zone in northern Iraq,
set up after 1991 Gulf War.
	   Barzani said the elections were scheduled for July.
	   Talabani also arrived in Ankara on Saturday and is expected to
meet with Barzani on Sunday.
	   Barzani said they would discuss details of carrying out the
accord.

Newspaper: Pinochet says he feels betrayed by Britain

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In his first public statement since his arrest in
a London hospital last month, former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet says he feels betrayed by Britain, The Sunday Times
reported.
	   ``I am saddened that the experience of my arrest has shaken my
belief in Britain. I did not believe I would be the subject of
spurious attempts by foreign prosecutors to convict me on unproven
charges,'' early editions of the newspaper available Saturday
quoted Pinochet as saying in a four page statement.
	   The newspaper said that the statement was passed to it Saturday
by a public relations company acting as an intermediary for the
general. A copy of the statement was sent to The Associated Press.
	   British police arrested Pinochet, 82, on Oct. 16 at the
instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him on
charges of genocide, terrorism and torture committed by his secret
police after he seized power in 1973, toppling President Salvador
Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to
include some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his
17-year-rule.
	   Pinochet's statement said that his arrest would undermine
attempts to achieve reconciliation in Chile, and compared the South
American country's predicament with those in Northern Ireland and
South Africa.
	   ``Today, we understand that reconciliation is essential to
peace. That is the lesson that we have learned from two world wars
and from numerous other conflicts this century,'' the statement
said,
	   ``In challenging Chile's reconciliation, Spain ignores it own
past,'' the statement said, a reference to the regime of late Gen.
Francisco Franco. ``Chile deserves the same rights as any other
country.''
	   Pincohet stepped down in 1990, but remained commander-in-chief
of the army until March as part of compromises in Chile's
transition to democracy.
	   The former dictator, who underwent back surgery Oct. 9, remains
under police guard in a north London hospital.

Russian economic official says ruble to remain fairly stable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble, which has gained some stability
since its wild ride in August, won't lose much more of its value
this year, a top Russian economic official predicted Saturday.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov assured Russians on
national television that the ruble, the national currency, won't
drop any lower than 20 to the dollar by the end of 1998.
	   The ruble, which was hovering around 6 to the dollar before the
economic crisis struck in August, plunged as low as 20 to the
dollar after that. After considerable turbulence, it has stabilized
at around 16 to the dollar in recent weeks.
	   At one point in September, Russia's Central Bank was forecasting
that the ruble might tumble to as low as 30 to the dollar by year's
end.
	   Maslyukov, speaking in an interview on the popular ``Vremya''
program, said the government would issue the final version of its
economic plan on Tuesday. Within 10 days, he said, it would issue a
schedule of when the new economic measures will be carried out.
	   The program calls for greater government intervention in the
economy. But as the government has stressed, and Maslyukov
reiterated Saturday, it intends to continue aiming in the direction
of a market economy.
	   ``This is a program of moving toward a market economy, a
socially oriented economy,'' Maslyukov said.
	   As he has in the past, he criticized Russia's previous
governments for rushing into privatization of the economy and
selling off state assets at fire-sale prices.
	   ``We shouldn't have given away enterprises,'' he said. ``Today,
about 1,500 enterprises have no owner, and don't work. No one runs
them. The state should be a diligent owner of its property.''
	   He also said the government hopes to reach agreement with
foreign lenders on restructuring Russian government debt. If that
fails, he said, there are ``two civilized ways'' of raising money:
cutting government spending or taking out new loans.

Tajikistan troops surround rebel forces in northern towns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `In Khudzhand ...,' to UPDATE with government
reporting capture of portion of fortress. &QL; 
 &UR; By UMED BABAKHANOV &QC;

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops have encircled
bands of rebel fighters in two northern outposts and appeared
poised Saturday to put down the latest revolt in the restive
Central Asian nation.
	   More than 200 combatants and civilians have been killed since
the rebels launched raids in the northern part of the country
Wednesday, renewing concerns about the government's ability to
maintain order.
	   After suffering losses at the beginning of the fighting, the
government forces have surrounded the rebels in the northern city
of Khudzhand and the village of Aini, news reports said.
	   In Khudzhand, the site of the first attack on Wednesday, about
40 rebels were holed up in an old fortress in the city center.
Government troops reported capturing the highest point of the
fortress late Saturday, with fighting still going on.
	   Khudzhand is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the
capital Dushanbe.
	   Meanwhile, government forces have surrounded a second group of
rebels in Aini, a village about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of
the capital, presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov was quoted as
saying by Russian news agencies reported.
	   Although Saidov said there were as many as 300 rebels in Aini,
Interfax quoted the government commander at the scene, Maj. Gen.
Sukhrob Kasymov, as saying his men were fighting about 120 rebels
Saturday night.
	   Six government soldiers were killed and nine wounded Saturday,
and the government said 16 rebels were killed and four captured.
	   Also, ITAR-Tass reported that Aziz Saidov, Tajikistan's trade
representative to Russia and a member of the Tajik parliament, was
killed by rebels Saturday while he was on a business trip in
northern Tajikistan.
	   The rebels are led by former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, who
has demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov free all political
prisoners and bring his supporters into the government. The
president has ruled out any talks with the rebels.
	   Former prime minister Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov and other
ex-government officials also were involved in organizing the
rebellion, said Saidov, the president's spokesman.
	   ``They are feverishly looking for ways to leave the boundaries
of the republic,'' Saidov told the ITAR-Tass.
	   Khudoberdyev claimed his guerrillas had mined the dam on the
Kairakkhum reservoir, and threatened to set off explosions that
would ``flood vast territories of Central Asia.''
	   The Kairakkhum reservoir is so large it is referred to locally
as a ``sea.'' But the government said army forces were protecting
the dam and it was not in danger of sabotage.
	   A peace treaty signed last year formally ended five years of
civil war between Rakhmonov's hardline, secular government and the
mostly Muslim opposition. The main opposition groups are now
participating in the government and the armed forces.
	   However, a number of warlords have refused to recognize the
peace deal and periodically launch small-scale rebellions. The war,
which began shortly after the country received independence from
the Soviet Union, has badly damaged the economy in the poor,
mountainous nation.

Hondurans line up for vaccinations; fear of epidemics to come

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Heeding warnings of epidemics of
hepatitis, malaria and other diseases, Hondurans trying to put
their lives back together lined up Saturday amid the debris left by
Hurricane Mitch for vaccinations.
	   Across flooded Central America, health authorities warned that
outbreaks of water-related diseases such as malaria and cholera
could emerge in the week to come. To stem a rampage of disease,
international relief flights delivered the first water purification
plants and needed medicines.
	   Dozens of taxi drivers took a break from shoveling tons of
debris in Tegucigalpa's devastated Comayaguela market district to
line up for tetanus and malaria shots Saturday. Army troops stood
watch nearby, wearing face masks to ward of the stench of the
blocks of muck and garbage, where it was feared more bodies were
still buried.
	   ``They say there likely are more people in there,'' said
Felicito Sorido, 51, who with hundreds of fellow drivers
volunteered for the massive cleanup in hopes of reaching their cabs
buried several blocks away.
	   Juanita Aleman, 30, a health ministry nurse, filled syringes,
rolled up the drivers' sleeves and administered shots from a small
desk on a dusty sidewalk.
	   ``The military first asked for these shots for their soldiers,''
she said. ``Now the taxi drivers. Aside from conjunctivitis there's
no epidemic yet but we expect it to come.''
	   Twenty-five case of cholera have been reported in Guatemala, the
Public Health Ministry there reported Friday. The Guatemalan
government has increased water-treatment efforts to prevent the
disease from spreading.
	   Throughout Central America, the storm killed an estimated
10,000.
	   More than 6,000 people were killed in Honduras by the hurricane
and hundreds of thousands were left homeless. Each day, dozens more
bodies are found throughout the nation, including 15 in the town of
Kabor in western Intibuca province.
	   U.S. Army Secretary Luis Caldera inspected storm damage in
Honduras and met with President Carlos Flores Saturday. He said
U.S. soldiers have saved more than 700 lives in Honduras in rescue
missions, using helicopters to pluck some victims from rising
floodwaters.
	   ``From day one, the soldiers who have been stationed here were
out saving lives,'' he said.
	   U.S. military engineers arrived Saturday and more were en route
to help repair roads and bridges, and some 3,000 National Guardsmen
will be in the country between January and June for repair work,
Caldera said.
	   The United States was sending 12 more helicopters to join 20
already in the country. U.S. forces will also help transport pipes
into Tegucigalpa to repair the water network, now running at 25
percent capacity, Caldera said.
	   More aid was forthcoming, he added, noting the U.S. relief
mission ``is very extensive, so we're going through a lot of
resources very quickly.''
	   Over the long term, Caldera said, ``it is clear that rebuilding
Honduras and ... these countries of Central America is going to
require a sustained effort.''
	   Caldera announced the additional aid before flying to Guatemala
and Nicaragua to evaluate storm damage and relief efforts in those
countries. An estimated 4,000 died in flooding and mudslides in
Nicaragua, and hundreds more died in Guatemala and El Salvador.

Military affirms its presence on and off the battlefield

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The Algerian Army's publication affirmed
in its latest edition that the nation has ``truly overcome the
crisis'' pitting the military against Islamic insurgents and warned
it stands ready to oppose anyone who discredits the nation.
	   El Djeich, the army monthly, warned ``the enemies, their
accomplices and traitors of all kinds that the men of Algeria have
vowed to continue the struggle until the total elimination of the
terrorist plague on this territory.''
	   Security forces have been fighting an Islamic insurgency spawned
after the army canceled 1992 legislative elections to thwart the
likely victory of a Muslim fundamentalist party, since banned. An
estimated 75,000 people have been killed.
	   Algeria has ``truly overcome the crisis, thanks to determined
action and the price of enormous sacrifices,'' the monthly said.
	   The article was centered on the early presidential elections,
set for April. The elections ``will reaffirm the continuity of
democracy and the state of law,'' it said.
	   But in an unusual show of frankness, the article noted the
military -- the real source of power in this North African nation
-- has served as ``influential actors and witnesses of the changes
which have marked the country ...'' and will continue to do so.
	   The military will ensure the failure of ``venomous statements,
catastrophic scenarios and fantasy analyses aimed at disorienting
our people and throwing doubt and discredit on the institutions of
our nation,'' the article said. It did not elaborate, but the
statement made clear that the army remains a force to contend with
off the battlefield.
	   President Liamine Zeroual, whose term ends in the year 2000, in
September announced plans to cut short his five-year term. The
announcement was widely seen as the result of pressure from the
army.

	   LONDON (AP) _ In his first public statement since his arrest in
a London hospital last month, former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet says he feels betrayed by Britain, The Sunday Times
reported.
	   ``I am saddened that the experience of my arrest has shaken my
belief in Britain. I did not believe I would be the subject of
spurious attempts by foreign prosecutors to convict me on unproven
charges,'' early editions of the newspaper available Saturday
quoted Pinochet as saying in a four page statement.
	   The newspaper said that the statement was passed to it Saturday
by a public relations company acting as an intermediary for the
general. A copy of the statement was sent to The Associated Press.
	   British police arrested Pinochet, 82, on Oct. 16 at the
instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him on
charges of genocide, terrorism and torture committed by his secret
police after he seized power in 1973, toppling President Salvador
Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to
include some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his
17-year-rule.
	   Pinochet's statement said that his arrest would undermine
attempts to achieve reconciliation in Chile, and compared the South
American country's predicament with those in Northern Ireland and
South Africa.
	   ``Today, we understand that reconciliation is essential to
peace. That is the lesson that we have learned from two world wars
and from numerous other conflicts this century,'' the statement
said,
	   ``In challenging Chile's reconciliation, Spain ignores it own
past,'' the statement said, a reference to the regime of late Gen.
Francisco Franco. ``Chile deserves the same rights as any other
country.''
	   Pincohet stepped down in 1990, but remained commander-in-chief
of the army until March as part of compromises in Chile's
transition to democracy.
	   The former dictator, who underwent back surgery Oct. 9, remains
under police guard in a north London hospital.

Bermuda holds general elections Monday

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ Less than two years after its first
woman premier took power, another woman is trying to lead an
opposition party to the first win in its 35-year history as Bermuda
goes to the polls Monday.
	   Both the ruling United Bermuda Party and the opposition
Progressive Labour Party say their polls show them winning by a
slim margin, meaning that the only sure thing is that the election
remains in doubt.
	   Progressive leader Jennifer Smith is trying to pull off an
upset. The United Bermuda Party has been in power since 1968, and
Pamela Gordon has been Premier since then-Premier David Saul
retired from politics 18 months ago.
	   In play are the 40 seats in the U.K.-style Parliament.
	   Bermuda, a cluster of islands in the Atlantic about 650 miles
off the coast of North Carolina, has traditionally had among the
world's highest standards of living and low crime rates.
	   But tourism has declined in recent years and some off-shore
businesses, such as banking and insurance, are being under scrutiny
by international organizations. Along with some episodes of crime
in a previously tranquil site, the erosion in Bermuda's traditional
businesses has some of its 58,000 residents worried about the
future.
	   The parties are also split along racial lines. Seventeen of the
Progressive Party's 18 members of Parliament are black. Meanwhile,
the United Bermuda Party is generally seen as a closer ally of the
minority whites and business interests even though Gordon, herself,
and most of her cabinet members are black.
	   The United Bermuda Party won a controlling 22 seats in
Parliament in the 1993 elections.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The arrival Sunday of West Indian Cricket Board
President Pat Rousseau is expected to help end a strike by the
islanders that could wipe out a historic tour to South Africa.
	   The West Indians, embroiled in a pay dispute and rallying in
support of sacked captain Brian Lara and vice-captain Carl Hooper,
have gathered in London and are threatening to abandon the tour.
	   South African cricket chief Ali Bacher said Saturday he was
confident the tour would go on as scheduled and that Lara and Carl
would be reinstated.
	   Bacher talked by telephone with Rousseau for an hour Saturday
and said he was sure the dispute would be cleared up.
	   ``While I cannot disclose what Mr. Rousseau told me, I'm certain
in my own mind that all problems will be resolved,'' Bacher said.
	   Bacher, West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, and WICB member
Joel arrived in London Friday and have held two days of informal _
and so far _ unfruitful talks with the players.
	   West Indian management and striking players are camped in
neighboring hotels near London's Heathrow Airport but the parties
are apparently content not to meet formally in the absence of
Rousseau.
	   ``The president coming is good news,'' said Courtney Walsh, head
of the players association. ``We're looking forward to it.''
	   ``It's not just about money, it's general conditions and
everything.''
	   Lloyd said the players deserved to be well paid, but said
negotiations should have been completed before the tour started.
	   ``I don't know what their beef is,'' he said. ``We'll only know
tomorrow when we have the meeting.''
	   The tour is scheduled to start with a one-day match at
Johannesburg on Tuesday, with the first test due to start on Nov.
26.
	   Another key might still be a letter sent to the players by South
African President Nelson Mandela. This would be the West Indies'
first official tour of South Africa since the end of apartheid.
	   ``He (Mandela) conveyed the importance of this tour to our
country,'' Bacher said. ``He asked that the parties concerned
compromise, show goodwill, good intent and come to an amicable
solution which will ensure the tour takes place.''
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher added.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   The strike was sparked Wednesday when the WICB fired Lara and
Hooper after they refused to travel to South Africa.
	   Reported solutions include more prize money, increased meal
money, and the reinstatement of Lara and Hopper to the squad. There
are also suggestions Walsh would be named captain.
	   The WICB has said it would fine the no-show players between 5
and 10 percent of their tour fees, which could be as much as dlrs
60,000 for Lara.
	   Lara and Hooper have wide support. Only seven of the 16 members
of the squad traveled to South Africa, and all returned Friday to
London to rally around the two.
	   In a letter dated Friday, the Barbados Cricket Association urged
the WICB and players to reach a compromise. In a letter to
Rousseau, the BCA recommended that Lara and Hooper be reinstated
and a meeting between the players representatives and the WICB be
set up as early as possible.
	   Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll has been more forceful. ``The
members of the (WICB) board should be fired,'' he said. ``This is
not simply a matter of cricket and the board cannot be allowed to
treat the players in such a manner.''
	   In Port-of-Spain, the Trinidadian capital, Lara's fans set up a
massive blackboard in the heart of the city at Woodford Square and
dozens signed it to show ``100 percent support for Lara and his
men.''
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.
	   Lara, the batting superstar of the sport, set a world record of
375 runs in a 1994 Test against England. A few weeks later, he
scored a first-class record of 501 for his English county side
Warwickshire.

President announces new rules for candidates in next year's vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali
announced Saturday that the heads of political parties can run in
next year's presidential election, skirting a constitutional rule
in an apparent effort to show willingness to allow contenders.
	   Ben Ali, speaking on the 11th anniversary of his accession to
power, said that the only stipulation is that the party heads have
held the office for at least five years.
	   Ben Ali was the lone candidate in presidential elections in 1989
and 1994, winning the latter with 99 percent of the vote.
	   The constitution calls for presidential candidates to be backed
by elected officials. But currently, only the ruling Constitutional
Democratic Rally, the party of the president, can come up with
enough backers.
	   Six opposition parties are recognized in this small North
African nation, four of which are represented in parliament,
sharing some 20 seats -- not enough to back a candidate.
	   Ben Ali, a former interior minister, came to power in a
bloodless coup in 1987 that deposed Habib Bourghiba who had run the
country since independence from France in 1956.
	   Tunisia, a westward looking Muslim nation, has come under
consistent criticism from human rights groups for failing to ensure
basic freedoms.
	   Last week, Amnesty International reported that, while
authorities work to improve their image with web sites and other
cosmetics, human rights activists are often imprisoned or harassed
with increasingly sophisticated methods of intimidation.

Iranian and Saudi foreign ministers discuss Egypt and Iraq

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Talk focused on Iran's wish to
improve relations with Egypt and the Iraqi-U.N. standoff when
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi met his Saudi counterpart,
Prince Saud al-Faisal, here Saturday, Saudi officials said.
	   Prince Saud, who was scheduled to travel to Egypt Sunday for
talks with President Hosni Mubarak, told reporters he hoped Iran
and Egypt would upgrade their relations. The two states broke ties
after Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979.
	   ``There are no obstacles to high-level relations between the two
sides,'' the prince said.
	   Officials said the object of Prince Saud's trip to Cairo was
``to mediate and improve relations between Iran and Egypt.''
	   Kharrazi, who flew home late Saturday at the end of a two-day
visit to Saudi Arabia, held separate meetings with King Fahd and
Crown Prince Abdullah, handing over letters from President Mohammad
Khatami, Saudi officials said. They did not reveal the contents of
the messages.
	   In his comments to reporters, Kharrazi did not mention Egypt. He
spoke about the Iraqi showdown with the United Nations, saying that
a political solution should be sought.
	   The Iranian ambassador to Riyadh, Mohammed Nouri Shahroudi, said
Iran and Saudi Arabia were opposed to a military strike against
Iraq _ as the United States has threatened _ but also believed that
Baghdad should abide by U.N. resolutions on its disarmament.
	   ``The two sides are in complete agreement,'' Shahroudi told The
Associated Press.
	   On Oct. 31, Iraq halted all work by the U.N. inspectors
responsible for overseeing the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction, a process Baghdad must complete to obtain the lifting
of the sanctions imposed after its forces invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Although officials did not say oil was on the agenda, Kharrazi
is expected to have discussed with the Saudis how to deal with
falling oil prices.
	   Oil is the main source of income for Iran and Saudi Arabia, but
the two states disagree on how to resolve the problem. Iran has
supported additional production cuts to boost the world price,
while Saudi Arabia has called for an extension of previous cuts
until the end of 1999.
	   Saudi Arabia used to be extremely wary of Iran, owing to
Tehran's stated policy of exporting its Islamic revolution. The
kingdom, a Sunni Muslim state, also disapproved of citizens from
Iran, a Shiite Muslim state, holding demonstrations during the
annual pilgrimage to Mecca.
	   But relations began to improve after President Khatami, a
political moderate, took office last year. The ties received a
boost in February when Iran's former president, Hashemi Rafsanjani,
visited the kingdom.
	   In May, the two countries signed a wide-ranging agreement on
trade, exchanges of academics and students, and technological
cooperation.

Bordeaux, Rennes win to keep up challenge at top
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Early season pacesetter Bordeaux kept in touch with
leader Marseille on Saturday with a 3-1 win over Toulouse, while
Rennes kept up its surprise challenge with a 4-0 hammering of lowly
Sochaux.
	   The results mean that Bordeaux, which led the table till
mid-October, stays in second place on 28 points, two behind
Marseille, with Rennes in third place on 26 points.
	   Monaco stays in fourth place with 20 points.
	   Bordeaux's goalscoring hero was again Sylvain Wiltord, who
scored in the 19th and 90th minutes - his eighth and ninth goals of
the season - to secure the win.
	   Ali Bernarbia, who has been in fine form since moving from
Monaco in pre-season, made it 2-0 just before halftime, but Cruz
Oceano scored in the 57th minute for the visitors to set up a close
finish.
	   Hard up Rennes continued its challenge at the top.
	   Cedric Bardon scored twice while Shabani Nonda and Edouard Cisse
also found the net as third-placed Rennes thumped
bottom-of-the-table Sochaux.
	   Auxerre and Nantes played out a 1-1 draw, meaning that both
teams slipped further behind the leaders.
	   In other games Saturday: Le Havre 3, Lens 1; Metz 3, Lyon 2;
Montpellier 2, Paris Saint-Germain 1; Strasbourg 1, Nancy 2.
	   In Friday's games league leader beat Monaco 1-0 thanks to a
dramatic injury time winner from Florian Maurice, while Bastia beat
Lorient 2-1.

	   OPTERUSHA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The bullet holes and blood stains
in two cars at a roadside and Milazim Krasniqi's black eye bore
testiment Saturday to the lack of security in this shattered
central Kosovo village.
	   Five ethnic Albanian guerrillas were riding in the cars Friday
when Serb police opened fire and killed them, Krasniqi said. He
also claimed that police beat him and other residents last week
when they tried to return to their homes in Opterusha.
	   Like ethnic Albanian refugees elsewhere, he said ``there's no
way'' he would spend the night in his village until Serb police
withdrew completely from Kosovo
	   Violence in Kosovo has flared this week despite a de-facto peace
treaty designed to end bloodshed in the turbulent Serbian province
and set the stage for a political agreement between Serb
authorities and the province's majority Albanians.
	   Seven ethnic Albanians, all believed to be guerrilla fighters,
have been killed since Thursday afternoon. The Serb Media Center, a
mouthpiece for Serb officials, reported that the deaths occurred in
a series of attacks by guerrillas on police. No police were
reported killed or injured.
	   Such continued violence in Kosovo undermines the Oct. 12
agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke, reached under the threat of NATO
airstrikes on Yugoslav and Serb forces in Kosovo.
	   While Milosevic has complied with some aspects of the agreement,
complaints of attacks by Serb police on some of the tens of
thousands of refugees trying to return to their homes have
continued. The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army also has launched
attacks, mostly on police targets.
	   Despite the sporadic incidents, international relief and
observer officials in Kosovo say the overall situation has improved
considerably in the past month.
	   On Saturday, two blood-stained, bullet-riddled cars of the slain
rebels sat on the roadside near Opterusha, 55 kilometers (35 miles)
southwest of Pristina. Both cars appeared to have been shot at
head-on.
	   The Serb Media Center report said the rebels fired first on a
police patrol, and a foreign observer team that came upon the
incident by chance reported a similar account, a diplomatic source
said Saturday.
	   But Krasniqi disagreed.
	   ``The police ambushed them as they drove down the road,'' he
said. ``There's no chance they could have survived.''
	   Krasniqi said police beat him and other residents when they
tried to return to their homes this week. His right eye was
bruised.
	   ``They beat me just because I'm Albanian,'' he said. ``Now,
everyone is staying away.''
	   The Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement calls for setting up a 2,000
strong verification mission of unarmed observers run by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Until it begins operating, unlikely before next month, a
previous observer mission started in July will continue to operate
patrols throughout Kosovo.
	   Richard Huckaby, the spokesman for the U.S. sector of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, said an advance team for 74 more
American observers was coming to Kosovo on Saturday. The new
observers were contracted privately from DynCorp, a U.S. company of
military specialists.
	   The KDOM mission eventually will be absorbed into the larger
OSCE mission.
	   Also Saturday, KDOM chief Shaun Byrnes met with Adem Demaci, the
political spokesman for the guerrilla KLA, at Demaci's headquarters
in Pristina. No details of the meeting were immediately available.
	   It was unclear if Saturday's meeting was connected to talks that
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill held Friday with KLA figures in
Dragobilje, a village 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina.
	   Hill is working on a political settlement for Kosovo that would
restore the self-rule for the ethnic Albanian majority that
Milosevic stripped in 1989. But most Albanians, especially the KLA,
want full independence.
	   Showing its dissatisfaction with the Kosovo peace process, the
KLA said Friday it intends to establish its own civilian rule in
territory it controls.
	   Also Saturday, Kosovo Serbs protested against the possible
political deal, saying it would result in Milosevic effectively
handing Kosovo to the ethnic Albanians.
	   A gathering of the Serbs in Pristina _ including Serb leaders,
opposition politicians and Serbian Orthodox Church dignitaries _
said they opposed having Milosevic's regime sign any agreement on
Kosovo on their behalf.
	   In a unanimously adopted charter, the Pan-Serb Convention warned
the international community of a likely ``massive exodus of Serbs''
if ethnic Albanians come to power in Kosovo.

Belgrade war crimes debate: Yugoslavia must cooperate on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia must cooperate with a
U.N. war crimes panel investigating allegations of atrocities in
the rebellious Yugoslav province of Kosovo, a U.S. official said
Saturday.
	   ``In the U.N. Security Council, there is unanimous consent of
all its members that investigators ... have full authority to do
their job in Kosovo,'' said David Scheffer, the State Department's
war crimes envoy at a panel discussion held in Belgrade.
	   President Slobodan Milosevic has defied international pressure
to allow prosecutors from the Netherlands-based tribunal to enter
Kosovo, where hundreds have died in fighting that erupted in
Februrary between separatist ethnic Albanians and Yugoslav forces.
	   Tribunal investigators have said they want to look into claims
on atrocities on both sides.
	   Speaking at the round-table discussion organized by the
Belgrade-based nongovernmental Humanitarian Law Center, Scheffer
said there were reasons to believe that ``serious violations of
international law'' were committed in Kosovo.
	   Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and a team of
investigators planned a weeklong mission in Kosovo to begin last
Wednesday but were refused visas.
	   Arbour and Scheffer have threatened Yugoslavia with U.N.
sanctions if the authorities continue to defy demands for unlimited
access.
	   ``Since February this year, between 600 and 1,000 people died in
Kosovo, many more were wounded,'' Scheffer said.
	   The tribunal maintains it has a legal right to carry out
investigations throughout Yugoslavia.
	   The wars in the former Yugoslav republics prompted the Security
Council to create the tribunal in 1993 with a mandate to prosecute
breaches of international humanitarian law committed anywhere in
the former Yugoslavia since 1991. Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the
largest of Yugoslavia's two remaining republics.

Newspaper: Pinochet says he feels betrayed by Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet says
he feels betrayed by Britain, in his first public statement since
his arrest in a London hospital last month, a newspaper reported.
	   ``I am saddened that the experience of my arrest has shaken my
belief in Britain ... I did not believe that I would be the subject
of spurious attempts by foreign prosecutors to convict me on
unproven charges,'' early editions of The Sunday Times quoted
Pinochet as saying in a four-page statement.
	   The newspaper said it received the statement Saturday from a
public relations company acting as an intermediary for the general.
A copy of the statement was sent to The Associated Press.
	   British police arrested Pinochet, 82, on Oct. 16 at the
instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him on
charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. Chile's secret police
are accused of committing the crimes after Pinochet seized power in
1973, toppling President Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to
include some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his
17-year-rule.
	   Pinochet's statement said that his arrest would undermine
attempts to achieve reconciliation within Chile, and it compared
the South American country's predicament with that in Northern
Ireland and South Africa.
	   ``Today, we understand that reconciliation is essential to
peace. That is the lesson that we have learned from two world wars
and from numerous other conflicts this century,'' the statement
said. ``In challenging Chile's reconciliation, Spain ignores it own
past,'' the statement said, referring to the 1939-1975 fascist
regime of late Gen. Francisco Franco in Spain.
	   ``Chile deserves the same rights as any other country,'' the
statement said.
	   Pinochet stepped down in 1990, but remained commander-in-chief
of the army until March as part of compromises in Chile's
transition to democracy.
	   In the statement, Pinochet said that he would fight extradition
to Spain ``with all my spirit,'' adding, ``a show trial in a
foreign land is not justice. It is certainly not British justice.''
	   Pinochet was recovering Oct. 9 from back surgery when his wife,
Lucia Hiriart, explained to him the reasons for his arrest. ``She
was in tears as she tried to speak. I was hurt, and bewildered,''
Pinochet's statement said.
	   Pinochet's legal fate in the hands of Britain. The English High
Court has ruled that Pinochet's arrest was illegal because he is
entitled to immunity as a former head of state. A five-judge panel
from Britain's House of Lords is hearing an appeal.
	   The general remains under police guard in a north London
hospital.
	   Pablo Longueira, a right-wing Chilean congressman who visited
Pinochet on Saturday, told Radio Cooperativa of Santiago by
telephone that he found the former general to be ``in a much better
mood ... but he is indeed worried about what comes next week.''

Bermuda holds general elections Monday

	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ Less than two years after Bermuda's
first woman premier took power, another woman is trying to lead an
opposition party to its first victory when Bermudans go to the
polls Monday.
	   Both the ruling United Bermuda Party and the opposition
Progressive Labour Party say their polls show them winning by a
slim margin.
	   But a victory by Progressive leader Jennifer Smith would widely
be considered an upset. The United Bermuda Party has been in power
since 1968, with Pamela Gordon as premier since then-Premier David
Saul retired from politics 18 months ago.
	   In play in Monday's elections are the 40 seats in the
British-style Parliament.
	   The parties are split along racial lines. Seventeen of the
Progressive Party's 18 members in Parliament are black. Meanwhile,
the United Bermuda Party is generally seen as a closer ally of the
minority whites and the islands' business interests, even though
Gordon herself and most of her Cabinet members are black.
	   Bermuda, a cluster of islands in the Atlantic about 650 miles
(1,000 kilometers) off the coast of North Carolina, traditionally
has had one of the world's highest standards of living and low
crime rates.
	   But tourism has declined and the success of Bermuda's offshore
banking and insurance businesses has eroded in recent years,
prompting many of Bermuda's 58,000 residents to worry about the
future.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo accused political
opponents of damaging Mexico's economy by blocking a dlrs 55
billion bank rescue program, newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Opposition parties have sought to get the bank bailout program
declared unconstitutional, impeach financial officials and publish
names of millionaire businessmen whose unpaid loans would be passed
on to taxpayers under the rescue program.
	   The parties say financial officials failed to adequately
supervise private banks, and then assumed their bad debts without
congress's approval.
	   Under the rescue program, submitted by Zedillo to congress
earlier this year, taxpayers would pay for bad loans absorbed by a
government agency after the 1994 peso devaluation forced many
debtors to go into arrears on their loans.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A boat sank off Colombia's Pacific
coast, killing at least four people and leaving four others
missing, the coast guard said Saturday. Twenty people were rescued.
	   The boat went down Friday evening after leaving the port city of
Buenaventura, 225 miles (360 kilometers) west of the capital,
Bogota. The exact cause of the accident was not immediately clear.
	   Thirteen passengers were taken to hospitals in Buenaventura for
treatment, said Lt. Alberto Garcia, a coast guard spokesman. .

<TEXT>
	   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) _ Amid doubts about rebel
intentions, a government troop pullout went into effect Saturday in
this and four other war-wracked southern towns where peace talks
are set to begin by December.
	   The concession by President Andres Pastrana, removing 2,000
soldiers and police from a region of foothills and savannahs the
size of Switzerland, is the boldest ever in efforts to end a
34-year civil war.
	   ``We're creating stage where there is no armed conflict,''
presidential peace envoy Victor G. Ricardo said in a ceremony in
San Vicente on Saturday where children danced, a choral group sang
and white doves were released into a steamy breeze.
	   ``Our forces have been moved out, but the authority of the state
remains,'' Ricardo said. The troops were redeployed along the
perimeter of the 16,200-square-mile (42,000-square-kilometers)
pullout zone.
	   The region is a stronghold of the 15,000-member Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, of FARC, who have been fighting since the
1960s and hold the battlefield advantage over a dispirited
military. With the soldiers gone, the rebels _ who already rule the
surrounding countryside _ are expected to waltz into town centers
across the demilitarized zone.
	   The process is moving forward despite growing doubts _ fueled by
recent rebel attacks_ about the guerrillas willingness to make
peace.
	   A week ago, the FARC overran a remote state capital in
southeastern Colombia, raining homemade missiles on an outmanned
police barracks and killing at least 57 people.
	   The FARC may just be flexing muscle, hoping to strengthen its
hand in the talks, ``but that's the most benign hypothesis, and
there aren't many who agree with it,'' said former foreign minister
Augusto Ramirez Ocampo.
	   Perhaps as a goodwill gesture, rebels on Saturday freed the
mayor of Milan, a town 78 miles (125 kilometers) southwest of San
Vicente, held since April to protest elections.
	   At a Friday news conference, Ricardo said the pullout would not
disrupt everyday life. The national cattlemans' association said,
however, that rebels have already expropriated 8,000 steers from
the area.
	   Courts were closed and shifted to nearby towns, although banks,
schools and hospitals and transportation would function normally,
Ricardo said. Civilians are to be deputized as temporary police,
but they will not carry arms.
	   ``So far there's an apparent calm,'' said 49-year San Vicente
car wash owner Urbano Silva Rojas. ``We hope it continues that
way.''
	   Ricardo said ... picks up 14th grf pvs

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Heeding warnings of epidemics of
hepatitis, malaria and other diseases, Hondurans trying to put
their lives back together lined up Saturday amid the debris left by
Hurricane Mitch for vaccinations.
	   Across flooded Central America, health authorities warned that
outbreaks of water-related diseases such as malaria and cholera
could emerge in the week to come. To stem a rampage of disease,
international relief flights delivered the first water purification
plants and needed medicines.
	   Dozens of taxi drivers took a break from shoveling tons of
debris in Tegucigalpa's devastated Comayaguela market district to
line up for tetanus and malaria shots Saturday. Army troops stood
watch nearby, wearing face masks to ward of the stench of the
blocks of muck and garbage, where it was feared more bodies were
still buried.
	   ``They say there likely are more people in there,'' said
Felicito Sorido, 51, who with hundreds of fellow drivers
volunteered for the massive cleanup in hopes of reaching their cabs
buried several blocks away.
	   Juanita Aleman, 30, a health ministry nurse, filled syringes,
rolled up the drivers' sleeves and administered shots from a small
desk on a dusty sidewalk.
	   ``The military first asked for these shots for their soldiers,''
she said. ``Now the taxi drivers. Aside from conjunctivitis there's
no epidemic yet but we expect it to come.''
	   Twenty-five case of cholera have been reported in Guatemala, the
Public Health Ministry there reported Friday. The Guatemalan
government has increased water-treatment efforts to prevent the
disease from spreading.
	   Throughout Central America, the storm killed an estimated
10,000.
	   More than 6,000 people were killed in Honduras by the hurricane
and hundreds of thousands were left homeless. Each day, dozens more
bodies are found throughout the nation, including 15 in the town of
Kabor in western Intibuca province.
	   U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera inspected storm damage in
Honduras and met with President Carlos Flores Saturday. He said
U.S. soldiers have saved more than 700 lives in Honduras in rescue
missions, using helicopters to pluck some victims from rising
floodwaters.

Iranian and Saudi foreign ministers discuss Egypt and Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Talks Saturday between the Iranian
foreign minister and his Saudi counterpart focused on Iran's wish
to improve relations with Egypt and the Iraqi-U.N. standoff, Saudi
officials said.
	   The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, who was
scheduled to travel to Egypt Sunday for talks with President Hosni
Mubarak, told reporters he hoped Iran and Egypt would upgrade their
relations. The two states broke ties after Iran's Islamic
revolution in 1979.
	   ``There are no obstacles to high-level relations between the two
sides,'' the prince said.
	   Officials said the object of Prince Saud's trip to Cairo was
``to mediate and improve relations between Iran and Egypt.''
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who flew home late
Saturday at the end of his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia, held
separate meetings with King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah, handing
over letters from President Mohammad Khatami, Saudi officials said.
They did not reveal the contents of the messages.
	   In his comments to reporters, Kharrazi did not mention Egypt. He
spoke about the Iraqi showdown with the United Nations, saying that
a political solution should be sought.
	   The Iranian ambassador to Riyadh, Mohammed Nouri Shahroudi, said
Iran and Saudi Arabia were opposed to a military strike against
Iraq _ as the United States has threatened _ but also believed that
Baghdad should abide by U.N. resolutions on its disarmament.
	   ``The two sides are in complete agreement,'' Shahroudi told The
Associated Press.
	   On Oct. 31, Iraq halted all work by the U.N. inspectors
responsible for overseeing the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction, a process Baghdad must complete to obtain the lifting
of the sanctions imposed after its forces invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Although officials did not say oil was on the agenda, Kharrazi
is expected to have discussed with the Saudis how to deal with
falling oil prices.
	   Oil is the main source of income for Iran and Saudi Arabia, but
the two states disagree on how to resolve the problem. Iran has
supported additional production cuts to boost the world price,
while Saudi Arabia has called for an extension of previous cuts
until the end of 1999.
	   Saudi Arabia used to be extremely wary of Iran, owing to
Tehran's stated policy of exporting its Islamic revolution. The
kingdom, a Sunni Muslim state, also disapproved of citizens from
Iran, a Shiite Muslim state, holding demonstrations during the
annual pilgrimage to Mecca.
	   But relations began to improve after President Khatami, a
political moderate, took office last year. The ties received a
boost in February when Iran's former president, Hashemi Rafsanjani,
visited the kingdom.
	   In May, the two countries signed a wide-ranging agreement on
trade, exchanges of academics and students, and technological
cooperation.

	   KLAGENFURT, Austria (AP) _ The United States, Austria and
Ukraine all assured their place in the Pool A World Ice Hockey
Championship on Saturday, winning to clinch three of four spots in
next year's tournament.

7-1 victory over Estonia; Dieter Kalt had two goals and an assist
to give Austria a 6-2 victory over Kazakstan 6-2; and Oleksandr
Zineyvich and Dmitri Markovsky scored to lift Ukraine over Germany
2-1.
	   The victories left all three 2-0-0 records and four points with
one game remaining each. The United States faces Austria on Sunday.
	   Estonia and Kazakstan, playing in the one of two qualifying
groups with the Americans and Austrians, both dropped to 0-0-2 in
Group B will fall to the Pool B championship.
	   Ukraine moved two points ahead of France and three ahead of both
Slovenia and Germany.
	   France beat the Slovenes 5-2 in the only other game Saturday.
	   The results mean France heads into the final day of play with
the advantage over the Germans and Slovenes for the final remaining
berth in the Pool A championship.
	   The French play Germany while Slovenia and Ukraine on Sunday.

 &UR; Netanyahu: building will proceed at controversial site &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Saturday that Israel would continue to build Jewish
neighborhoods throughout Jerusalem, including at a controversial
site in the traditionally Arab sector of the city.
	   ``We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in every part
of Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu told a crowd of political supporters in
Jerusalem, ``By 2000 there will be homes at Har Homa.''
	   Har Homa is the site of a planned Jewish neighborhood in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Groundbreaking at the site led
to angry Palestinian protests and a breakdown of peace talks in
March 1997.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet delayed action on the new peace accord
following Friday's suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market, and his
remarks about building on Har Homa may be seen as a provocation by
the Palestinians at a politically sensitive moment.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expects Israel's
Cabinet to ratify the new peace accord within a few days despite
the market bombing, a television report said Saturday.
	   ``The United States understands the delay by a day or two but
expects the agreement to be approved soon,'' Albright told Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone, Channel Two reported.
	   The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday
for the market bombing and vowed more attacks to try to block the
new peace accord.
	   ``This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the
last,'' the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organizations.
``We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the
Zionist enemy.''
	   An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of Damascus
confirmed that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed
responsibility for Friday's bombing in an interview with the
Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo.
	   Palestinian security sources and the families of the dead
bombers had already identified them as Islamic Jihad activists. At
least half a dozen other Islamic activists have been rounded up
since the bombing, the sources said.
	   Palestinian political leaders said Israel should not use
Friday's suicide bombing, which killed the two assailants and
wounded 21 Israelis, as an excuse to stop the peace process.
	   One of Israel's key demands is that the Palestinians do more to
fight attacks by Islamic militants against Israeli targets. The
Palestinians, however, said the two bombers had come from
Israeli-controlled areas and that Israel thus bore at least part of
the security responsibility for the attack.
	   The Israeli military said it could not confirm the suicide
bombers' identities and hometowns, but they were disclosed by
Palestinian security officials and also reported by Palestinian
media.
	   One lived near the Anata refugee camp, north of Jerusalem, and
the other lived in the West Bank village of Silat al Harithiya,
outside the town of Jenin.
	   Both families held so-called mourning houses on Saturday, but
not actual funerals, since Israeli authorities still have their
bodies.
	   ``I didn't raise him to lose him like that,'' said Mohammed
Zughayar, the 54-year-old father of Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar,
22. ``I'm proud, but I'm sad because I loved my son.''
	   The family of Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 24, said he had been
married for three months to Zughayar's sister, Basma. They met when
she was visiting her brother, who was in prison with Dahayneh, the
family said.
	   At the market, some 200 observant Jews gathered Saturday night
near the site of the bombing to offer prayers of thanks that no
lives other than those of the assailants were lost.
	   A ring of young men wearing skullcaps joined hands and danced,
and rabbis spoke of the ``miracle'' that had saved those shopping
in the market at the time of the attack.
	   Although Hamas initially claimed responsibility through
anonymous phone calls to the police for Friday's attack all sides
now have agreed that it was Islamic Jihad that carried it out.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Six days after divorcing his
wife of 38 years, former President F.W. de Klerk on Saturday
married his Greek-born sweetheart, a Johannesburg newspaper
reported.
	   De Klerk, who presided over the end of apartheid and shared the
1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, wed Elita Georgiades in
a private Greek Orthodox ceremony near Hermanus on the south coast,
according to an early edition of the Sunday Times.
	   De Klerk, 62, confirmed his marriage to Georgiades, 46, the
newspaper said.
	   ``We had planned a very private place and we didn't want it
public,'' De Klerk was quoted as saying.
	   De Klerk announced earlier this year that he had been in love
with Georgiades for many years. She was divorced in August.
	   The former president has largely stepped back from politics, but
last week successfully blocked the publication of negative findings
about his role in apartheid-era human rights abuses.
	   Through legal action, De Klerk forced the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission to excise references to the former
president before releasing its historic report last month.

Tway takes one-stroke lead after third round

<TEXT>
	   BRASELTON, Georgia (AP) _ Bob Tway shot a flawless 6-under 66
Saturday and took a one-stroke lead over fellow American Dudley
Hart after the third round of the Sarazen World Open.
	   Hart fired a tournament-record 62, including a 28 on the front
nine.
	   Tway, who began the round two shots behind second-round leader
English-born American resident Edward Fryatt, was at 14-under 202
going into Sunday's final round for the dlrs 320,000 top prize.
	   Hart, seven shots back starting Saturday's round, was at 203.
His 62 matched the record set last year by defending champion Mark
Calcavecchia in the dlrs 2 million tournament at the par-72,
6,993-yard Legends at Chateau Elan course.
	   Fryatt slumped to an 11-over 83 after consecutive 67s, and was
far back at 217.
	   Ricardo Gonzalez of Argentina was third at 207 after a 70.
Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain was another stroke back after a 67,
which included nine birdies. He was tied with Greg Turner of New
Zealand (68).
	   Two-time U.S. Masters winner Bernhard Langer of Germany and
American Bob Friend were at 209. Each shot 69.
	   Tway, who has seven U.S. PGA Tour victories but hasn't won since
the 1995 MCI Classic at Hilton Head, South Carolina, had six
birdies without a bogey.
	   He was eighth last week in the U.S. Tour Championship and was
24th on the American PGA Tour money list with dlrs 1,073,447 in one
of his best years since 1986 when he won four times, including the
U.S. PGA Championship.
	   Fryatt, 10-under entering the day, fell apart early. The
five-time winner on the Asian tour shot opened with a double-bogey
at No. 1, bogeyed the second, had another double-bogey at No. 5 and
closed out his front nine with a triple-bogey for a 44.
	   Hart, whose only victory was the 1996 Canadian Open, had a round
that included nine birdies, an eagle, seven pars and a bogey at No.
18.
	   He opened with birdies at the first two holes. He then parred
the next two holes before going on a binge that began with an eagle
at the par-5, fifth and was followed by six consecutive birdies. He
added his final birdie at No. 16.
	   Calcavecchia shot a 70 and was 14 back at 216 in the tournament
that brings together the past two champions from open tourneys
around the world, as well as several Sarazen selections.
	   Two-time winner Frank Nobilo of New Zealand (1995-96) had a 78
and was at 226.
	    &UR; Divots &LR;  Sweden's Sven Struver had an ace at the par 3, 185-yard
(167-meter) third hole and a 71, but it still left him out of
contention at 219.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Saturday that Israel would continue to build Jewish
neighborhoods throughout Jerusalem, including at a controversial
site in the traditionally Arab sector of the city.
	   ``We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in every part
of Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu told a crowd of political supporters in
Jerusalem, ``By 2000 there will be homes at Har Homa.''
	   Har Homa is the site of a planned Jewish neighborhood in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, which Palestinians want to have
as the capital of their hoped-for independent state. Groundbreaking
at the site led to angry Palestinian protests and a breakdown of
peace talks in March 1997.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet delayed action on the latest
Israeli-Palestinian accord following Friday's suicide bombing at a
Jerusalem market, and his remarks about building on Har Homa may be
seen as a provocation by the Palestinians at a politically
sensitive moment.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Netanyahu by
phone that she expects Israel's Cabinet to ratify the new peace
accord within a few days despite the market bombing, Channel Two
television reported Saturday.
	   The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday
for the market bombing and vowed more attacks to try to block the
new peace accord.
	   ``This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the
last,'' the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organizations.
``We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the
Zionist enemy.''
	   An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of Damascus
confirmed that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed
responsibility for Friday's bombing in an interview with the
Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo.
	   Palestinian security sources and the families of the dead
bombers had already identified them as Islamic Jihad activists. At
least half a dozen other Islamic activists have been rounded up
since the bombing, the sources said.
	   Palestinian political leaders said Israel should not use
Friday's suicide bombing, which killed the two assailants and
wounded 21 Israelis, as an excuse to stop the peace process.
	   One of Israel's key demands is that the Palestinians do more to
fight attacks by Islamic militants against Israeli targets. The
Palestinians, however, said the two bombers had come from
Israeli-controlled areas and that Israel thus bore at least part of
the security responsibility for the attack.
	   The Israeli military said it could not confirm the suicide
bombers' identities and hometowns, but they were disclosed by
Palestinian security officials and also reported by Palestinian
media.
	   One lived near the Anata refugee camp, north of Jerusalem, and
the other lived in the West Bank village of Silat al Harithiya,
outside the town of Jenin.
	   Both families held so-called mourning houses on Saturday, but
not actual funerals, since Israeli authorities still have their
bodies.
	   ``I didn't raise him to lose him like that,'' said Mohammed
Zughayar, the 54-year-old father of Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar,
22. ``I'm proud, but I'm sad because I loved my son.''
	   The family of Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 24, said he had been
married for three months to Zughayar's sister, Basma. They met when
she was visiting her brother, who was in prison with Dahayneh, the
family said.
	   At the market, some 200 observant Jews gathered Saturday night
near the site of the bombing to offer prayers of thanks that no
lives other than those of the assailants were lost.
	   A ring of young men wearing skullcaps joined hands and danced,
and rabbis spoke of the ``miracle'' that had saved those shopping
in the market at the time of the attack.
	   Although Hamas initially claimed responsibility through
anonymous phone calls to the police for Friday's attack all sides
now have agreed that it was Islamic Jihad that carried it out.

Trawler capsizes off South African coast, 16 missing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Sixteen seamen were missing on
Saturday after their trawler capsized off the Indian Ocean coast of
South Africa, an Air Force spokeswoman said.
	   One survivor of Greek nationality was found on the beach and is
being treated for mild injuries, Lt. Col. Laverne Machine said.
	   The trawler, Daniela, registered to a Greek company in Durban,
was travelling from Maputo, Mozambique to Durban when the accident
happened on Friday.
	   Search efforts on Saturday were called off as visibility faded,
but would start again on Sunday, Machine said.

Morgan jumps to lead of Senior Tour Championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina (AP) _ Defending champion Gil
Morgan, who stayed in the shadows the first two rounds, surged to
the front Saturday in the U.S. Senior Tour Championship.
	   Morgan's 68 gave him a three-round total of 8-under 208, a shot
better than Hale Irwin, Jim Albus and Ray Floyd. Jay Sigel, the
1996 champion, was another stroke behind after a 66.
	   Despite 12 victories and more than dlrs 4 million in earnings in
two full years on the American Senior Tour, Morgan has often been
lost behind Irwin's charisma.
	   It looked that way again this week when Irwin's opening 66 put
him four strokes ahead of Morgan. Even when Floyd muscled past
Irwin for the halfway lead, Morgan was three shots down and in
danger of falling from contention.
	   But after seven pars _ and several missed birdie chances _
Morgan got going with a birdie on No. 8. Consecutive birdies on the
14th and 15th holes put him in front for the first time in the
tournament.
	   ``It was kind of a little depressing early, but finally I got
the ball up there,'' Morgan said.
	   He'll go off Sunday with Floyd, the 1994 champion who shot a 72,
and Albus, who lost a five-hole playoff to Floyd that year. He
carded a 71 Saturday.
	   Right ahead of them are Irwin, after a 70, and Sigel. All have
played well at The Dunes.
	   ``I don't think you can ever be very comfortable in this
situation,'' Morgan said. ``You're going to have to play to up to
snuff, or you're going to get beat is the bottom line.''
	   Early on, of the leaderboard changed often. Floyd took bogey on
the first and third holes, tying him with Albus and Irwin.
	   Albus threw a sand wedge 15 centimeters (6 inches) from the cup
at No. 7 to take the lead.
	   Floyd tied Albus with an eighth-hole birdie. Albus went ahead
again after Floyd's bogey on No. 11, then retied it two holes
later.
	   Meanwhile, Irwin fought back from a double bogey 7 on No. _ the
wedge master flopped on two consecutive shots inside 90 yards (81
meters) _ to take a shot off the lead with consecutive birdies on
the ninth and 10th holes.
	   By that time, Morgan had rolled in a 1-meter (3-foot) birdie on
No. 12, an 5-meter (18-foot) putt at No. 14 and a 4 1-2-meter
(15-foot) try at No. 15 to move in front.
	   ``It's the top dogs this year that are right there,'' Albus
said. ``This week is new to me. It's been a while since I've been
in the hunt.''
	   Morgan said he could have lost his round with his inconsistent
play the first seven holes.
	   He reached the par-5, 505-yard (455-meter) fourth hole in two
and was thinking eagle or birdie. Instead, he three-putted. Then he
stubbed an 2 1-2-meter (8-foot) birdie try on No. 5. When he skyed
a 4-wood 27 meters (30 yards) over the par-5 eight hole, Morgan
thought he was going to lose another opportunity, but got within a
meter (3 feet) for a birdie.
	   ``I thought if I make another par I'm really dragging,'' he
said. ``But that turned me around a little bit.''

No end in sight for NBA lockout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW throughout with Saturday's developments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American National Basketball Association club
owners and players appeared in no hurry to end the league's
four-month lockout as the two sides made no effort to resume
negotiations Saturday.
	   The 130th day of the lockout passed without either side making
contact about when to resume stalled negotiations. It could be at
least another week until owners and players return to the
bargaining table, raising the specter that the season might not
begin until 1999.
	   ``The way it was left yesterday, there probably won't be any
contact for at least a few more days,'' union spokesperson Dan
Wasserman said.
	   The owners ended the most recent talks on Friday after 1 1-2
hours when the union was unwilling to back off its proposal of
keeping 60 percent of the revenue. Players received 57 percent of
revenue last season, prompting the league to reopen its labor
contract.
	   The owners, who wanted to pay no more than 51.8 percent last
season, want the percentage scaled back to 50 percent.
	   Union director Billy Hunter was angered Friday by the owners'
move to contact players about the league's latest proposal in an
attempt Hunter described as trying to divide the union. Hunter
claimed efforts were under way in Boston, Cleveland, Miami and
Milwaukee to get players to support the NBA's latest plan.
	   The union will spend the next few days contacting players to
keep them abreast of developments. The negotiating committee will
probably meet this week to discuss making a new proposal to the
league.
	   The start of the season has already been pushed back to
mid-December at the earliest. In the first regular-season work
stoppage in NBA history, 11 more games were lost Saturday,
increasing the total to 45.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.

Awesome Again Upsets Skip Away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (AP) _ Awesome Again lived up to his name
while Skip Away failed to earn anything for a hard day's work at
the Breeders' Cup at Churchill Downs.
	   Trainer Bob Baffert, winner of the last two Kentucky Derbies,
scored a 1-2 finish with Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting in
the Juvenile Fillies. But he had to settle for second with Silver
Charm in Saturday's marquee race _ the dlrs 5.12 million Classic.
	   It appeared Silver Charm was going to win, but Awesome Again
shot between Charm and Coronado's Quest and nailed the dlrs
2,662,400 first-place price and remained unbeaten in six starts
this year.
	   Awesome Again and Silver Charm will return to the racing wars
next year, but it was a sad farewell for the 5-year-old Skip Away
and the 6-year-old Gentlemen.
	   Skip Away staggered home sixth and failed to become the first
American horse to earn dlrs 10 million. Skippy leaves with dlrs
9,616,360, second to Cigar, the earning leader with dlrs 9,999,815.
	   ``I knew 50 yards in the race I was in trouble,'' said Jerry
Bailey, Skip Away's rider. ``He just could not handle this track.''
	   It was the first time in 27 races dating back to a 12th-place
finish in the 1996 Kentucky Derby that Skip Away has finished worse
than third.
	   Gentlemen, whose owner R.D. Hubbard paid dlrs 800,000 to
supplement because neither the horse nor his sire had been
nominated, finished last in the 10-horse field.
	   Awesome Again's victory, worth a winning mutuel of dlrs 11.40,
was accomplished in 2 minutes, 2.16 seconds and was the 10th
Breeders' Cup victory for Day, the most for any jockey. It was his
third victory in the Classic.
	   Bob Barnett, a former D. Wayne Lukas assistant, won the Juvenile
with Answer Lively, his first starter in a Breeders' Cup race,
while Lukas failed to get his sixth Juvenile victory with five
starters.
	   Answer Lively took the lead in the upper stretch and held on for
a head victory over 70-1 shot Aly's Alley. The Lukas-trained Cat
Thief was third in a 13-horse field.
	   In a remarkable comeback, Da Hoss, who was racing for only the
second time since winning the 1996 Mile because of injuries, won
the Mile again in a breathtaking stretch duel with Hawksley Hill.
Da Hoss, ridden by John Velazquez and trained by Britain's Michael
W. Dickinson, got up in the final stride and won by a head in
1:35.27 on grass. Labeeb finished third in the 14-horse field.
	   Favorite Trick, the 1997 Juvenile winner, finished eighth in a
bid to become the first winner of two different Breeders' Cup
races.
	   Reraise won the Sprint, giving jockey Corey Nakatani his third
straight win in the race. Escena won the Distaff and Buck's Boy won
the Turf.
	   Answer Lively, owned by John Franks, gave jockey Jerry Bailey
his second Juvenile victory in a winning time of 1:44 over 1.7
kilometers (1 1-16 miles). Aly's Alley paid dlrs 40 to place on a
dlrs 2 wager.
	   The order of finish for Lukas' other starters was Tactical Cat
(eighth), Mountain Range (ninth), Yes It's True (11th) and Time
Bandit (13th).
	   Reraise, a 3-year-old gelding, who was supplemented for dlrs
120,000, took charge with 800 meters (a half mile) to go and won
the 1.2-kilometer (six-furlong) Sprint by two lengths over Grand
Slam in 1:09.07.
	   Buck's Boy, ridden by Shane Sellers, won the turf by 1 1-4
lengths over Yagli in a dawdling time of 2:28.74. Dushyantor
finished third and defending champion Chief Bearheart was fourth in
the 13-horse field. None of the six European-based horses in the
race made a serious bid for victory.
	   It was the third victory in four starts for Buck's Boy.
	   The Distaff had a dlrs 2 million purse. The Sprint was worth
dlrs 1.1 million; the Mile and the two 2-year-old races each were
worth dlrs 1 million.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Saturday that Israel would continue to build Jewish
neighborhoods throughout Jerusalem, including at a controversial
site in the traditionally Arab sector of the city. ``We will build
also in Har Homa as we will build in every part of Jerusalem,''
Netanyahu told a crowd of political supporters in Jerusalem. Har
Homa is the site of a planned Jewish neighborhood in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem, which Palestinians want to have as the capital
of their hoped-for independent state. Groundbreaking at the site
led to angry Palestinian protests and a breakdown of peace talks in
March 1997. Netanyahu's Cabinet delayed action on the latest
Israeli-Palestinian accord following Friday's suicide bombing at a
Jerusalem market, and his remarks about building on Har Homa may be
seen as a provocation by the Palestinians at a politically
sensitive moment. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Heeding warnings of epidemics of
hepatitis, malaria and other diseases, Hondurans trying to put
their lives back together lined up Saturday amid the debris left by
Hurricane Mitch for vaccinations. Across flooded Central America,
health authorities warned that outbreaks of water-related diseases
such as malaria and cholera could emerge in the week to come. To
stem a rampage of disease, international relief flights delivered
the first water purification plants and needed medicines.
Twenty-five case of cholera have been reported in Guatemala, the
Public Health Ministry there reported Friday. The Guatemalan
government has increased water-treatment efforts to prevent the
disease from spreading. Throughout Central America, the storm
killed an estimated 10,000. More than 6,000 people were killed in
Honduras by the hurricane and hundreds of thousands were left
homeless. (MITCH)
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) _ U.S. Senator John Glenn returned
to Earth on Saturday as exuberant as when he set out on his
historic rocket ride, a journey of nearly 4 million miles (6.4
million kilometers) that took him four decades to achieve. Five
minutes after space shuttle Discovery safely touched down, Glenn
called out that he felt fine. When it came time to stand up and
walk, however, the world's oldest space traveler was visibly weak.
Holding on to both banisters, Glenn moved slowly and stiffly as he
emerged from an airport-style people-mover that had been hooked up
to the shuttle. He joined his six crewmates in the traditional walk
around the shuttle, then was whisked to a space center clinic for a
series of medical tests. Doctors want to see how his body
readjusted to gravity after nine days of weightlessness.
(US-GLENN-SHUTTLE)
	   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) _ Amid doubts about rebel
intentions, a government troop pullout went into effect Saturday in
this and four other war-wracked southern towns where peace talks
are set to begin by December. The concession by President Andres
Pastrana, removing 2,000 soldiers and police from a region of
foothills and savannahs the size of Switzerland, is the boldest
ever in efforts to end a 34-year civil war. ``We're creating stage
where there is no armed conflict,'' presidential peace envoy Victor
G. Ricardo said in a ceremony in San Vicente on Saturday where
children danced, a choral group sang and white doves were released
into a steamy breeze. The region is a stronghold of the
15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, of FARC, who
have been fighting since the 1960s and hold the battlefield
advantage over a dispirited military. With the soldiers gone, the
rebels _ who already rule the surrounding countryside _ are
expected to waltz into town centers across the demilitarized zone.
(COLOMBIA-PEACE PULLOUT)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Faced with their worst defeat in postwar
German elections, the conservative Christian Democrats chose a new
leader Saturday to guide them into a future without Helmut Kohl.
Kohl gave up his grip on the party chairman's job in a tearful
farewell, the last act of an era that ended when voters dumped him
as chancellor on Sept. 27 after 16 years in power. Party delegates
elected his hand-picked successor, Wolfgang Schaeuble, to the
chairman's post that Kohl held for a quarter-century. Earlier,
tears glistened on Kohl's jowls as a close aide, former Labor
Minister Norbert Bluem, praised his greatest success _ German
unification in 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Schaeuble,
56, faces the tough task of modernizing the party's image,
something Kohl hindered. (GERMANY-CONSERVATIVES).

Shirley Temple as star of 'The Wizard of Oz'?

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Imagine Shirley Temple as Dorothy, Buddy
Ebsen as the Tin Woodsman, W.C. Fields as the Wizard. Would ``The
Wizard of Oz'' still have become an enduring classic?
	   Nobody knows, because those early castings did not pan out.
Somehow MGM came up with the perfect ingredients to create one of
the most beloved movies of all time.
	   Most people have enjoyed ``The Wizard of Oz'' only on
television. Now they will be able to view it as it was meant to be
seen: on big screens in theaters _ well bigger screens, anyway.
	   Warner Bros., which acquired the film with its purchase of Ted
Turner's MGM library, is betting that millions will want to
experience the film on the big screen. A restored, enhanced version
is expected to reach 1,800 theaters in the United States this
month. That's an amazing figure for a 59-year-old movie.
	   Oddly enough, ``The Wizard of Oz'' didn't seem to have much of a
future when it was released in August 1939. It had cost dlrs 2.8
million _ a whopping amount in Depression years.
	   According to Aljean Harmetz's well-researched book, ``The Making
of 'The Wizard of Oz,''' MGM suffered a million-dollar loss in the
movie's first release. It didn't show a profit until it began
appearing on television, more than 15 years later.
	   The history of ``The Wizard of Oz'' goes back to 1899, when an
actor, playwright and former chicken farmer named L. (for Lyman)
Frank Baum wrote a children's fantasy called ``The Wonderful Wizard
of Oz.'' It proved an immediate success, and he turned it into a
Broadway musical.
	   Film versions appeared in 1910 and 1925, and by the 1930s, the
rights belonged to independent producer Samuel Goldwyn. He sold
them to MGM for dlrs 50,000, a reasonable amount for a literary
property at the time (David O. Selznick paid the same amount to
Margaret Mitchell for ``Gone With the Wind,'' which also was
released in 1939).
	   MGM executives, especially Nicholas Schenck, president of the
parent company, wanted Twentieth Century Fox star Shirley Temple
for the role of Dorothy, reasoning that a top name was needed for
marquee value.
	   The film's producer, Mervyn LeRoy, and his associate, Arthur
Freed, preferred a 16-year-old contract player with a loud voice,
Judy Garland.
	   The arguments went on for weeks but proved to be moot because
Fox studio production boss Darryl Zanuck refused to lend Shirley _
his studio's greatest asset.
	   Judy got the part, but other talent problems followed.
	   Broadway and radio star Ed Wynn was first choice for the
charlatan Wizard. He declined. W.C. Fields was sought for the role.
Even at dlrs 5,000 a day, he refused such a small part. Another MGM
contract player, Frank Morgan, was chosen.
	   Two gangly hoofers had been selected for Dorothy's companions:
Ray Bolger as the Tin Woodsman and Buddy Ebsen as the Scarecrow.
But Bolger had his heart set on playing the Scarecrow, and his
insistence prompted the studio to switch roles.
	   Makeup artists painted Ebsen's face white and sprinkled him with
aluminum dust. ``I worked in the picture about 10 days before I got
sick'' from aluminum poisoning, Ebsen recalled in a 1985 interview.
``I think in some of the long shots that's me, because they didn't
reshoot those.''
	   So Jack Haley inherited the Tin Woodsman role, and aluminum
paste was used to avoid poisoning. The trio was completed with
Broadway comic Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion.
	   There were complications behind the camera, as well.
	   Four directors worked on ``The Wizard of Oz.'' Richard Thorpe
was fired after two weeks. George Cukor filled in for three days,
then Victor Fleming directed for four months. When Fleming was
summoned to replace George Cukor on ``Gone With the Wind,'' King
Vidor agreed to complete the final 10 days.
	   Filming was tough on the actors, especially Lahr, Haley and
Bolger, who were covered with heavy makeup. The Technicolor film _
using a new, more vivid process for the time _ required huge banks
of arc lamps to illuminate the big sets, quickly turning them into
ovens.
	   Judy Garland, who was paid dlrs 100 a week when she started her
contract with MGM at 12, had risen to dlrs 500 a week by the time
``The Wizard of Oz'' started filming on Oct. 12, 1938. She had been
a vaudevillian herself, but she hadn't learned ``upstaging'' as had
her companions on the Yellow Brick Road.
	   ``I was supposed to be up front with the three of them,''
Garland was quoted as saying by her fifth husband, Mickey Deans, in
his book, ``Weep No More, My Lady, ``but I always trailed after
them because they managed to push me in the back.
	   ``I was too scared to complain. But Victor Fleming, sitting on
the boom, yelled, 'Hey, you three dirty hams, let's have the little
girl in there.'''
	   The Munchkins _ 124 little people, mostly recruited from the
vaudeville act Singer's Midgets _ proved to be a headache. They
were housed in the Culver City Hotel, which became the site of sex
orgies and drunken brawls. Almost nightly the police had to be
called. Their shenanigans were depicted in a 1981 flop movie,
``Under the Rainbow,'' starring Chevy Chase and Carrie Fisher.

	   During the 1930s, studios previewed their new films in outlying
Southern California towns to assess the reaction of a more typical
audience. The MGM brass traveled to San Bernardino for the first
screening of ``The Wizard of Oz.''
	   The audience responded enthusiastically, but one producer
commented, ``That 'Rainbow' song is no good; it slows the picture
down.'' Several others agreed with him, but LeRoy argued that
``Over the Rainbow'' was needed for a sentimental interlude. Studio
boss Louis B. Mayer allowed the song to remain in the film.
	   The reception of ``The Wizard of Oz'' in its first release
proved disappointing, partly because children comprised much of the
audience and they were admitted for an average of 10 cents a
ticket.
	   Another factor: 1939 saw the greatest outpouring of quality in
Hollywood history. ``The Wizard of Oz'' was up against such films
as ``Gone With the Wind,'' ``Wuthering Heights,'' ``Stagecoach,''
``Goodbye Mr. Chips,'' ``Gunga Din,'' ``Love Affair,'' ``The
Women,'' ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' and ``Ninotchka.''
	   Judy Garland won a special Academy Award for performance by a
juvenile. Other Oscars went to Herbert Stothart for his score and
to ``Over the Rainbow'' as best song.
	   The film made Garland a star, and she appeared in hit musicals
with Mickey Rooney. Her adult life was filled with personal
turmoil, slumps and comebacks. She died of an accidental overdose
of sleeping pills in London in 1969. She had just turned 47.
	   Except for television, ``The Wizard of Oz'' might have
languished in the MGM vaults as a half-remembered movie. The
repeated showings on home screens established it as a shining
example of what a big studio with vast resources could contribute
to American culture.

A new look at a giant of the monster genre, director James Whale
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo LA300 &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ By the time director James Whale took his own
life, drowning himself in the shallow end of his pool in 1957,
Hollywood had mostly forgotten him.
	   His death at age 67 warranted only a couple of paragraphs in
Variety and his funeral took place in a small Westwood chapel.
	   But in the 1930s, this stage-trained Englishman had directed a
trio of horror pictures that would influence generations of
filmmakers and shape popular culture to this day: ``Frankenstein,''
``The Invisible Man'' and ``The Bride of Frankenstein.''
	   The recognition that long eluded this complex, contradictory man
came just months after his suicide, when millions of people saw his
work anew in the first television airings of ``Frankenstein'' and
``The Invisible Man.''
	   Film festivals and movie historians later afforded Whale his
place in history as the man who perfected the horror genre, by
humanizing the monster and using humor. His own life was rich with
tragedy and metaphor, and critics still debate whether his
homosexuality influenced his work and his bitter departure from
Hollywood.
	   This year, Whale is receiving the biggest jolt of attention
ever. ``Frankenstein'' made the American Film Institute's
much-debated list of greats, at No. 87; a biography was released;
and, last week, the movie ``Gods and Monsters'' arrived in
theaters, offering a fictional account of his tragic final days.
Ian McKellen plays Whale in an Academy Award-caliber performance.
	   All this comes as the horror genre enjoys another resurgence
with the successful release of ``John Carpenter's Vampires.''
McKellen's other film this fall, ``Apt Pupil,'' about an old Nazi
discovered by a high school kid, owes much to horror film
techniques as well.
	   Universal Pictures, which produced the Whale classics during its
horror heyday, has rediscovered its monster treasure and is
mounting a new Frankenstein movie in an expensive computer
animated-live action combination.
	   How Whale would have reacted to all this is, like most things
are about him, debatable. Aloof and private, he didn't help people
understand him.
	   Even his death was a mystery: A man notoriously afraid of water
ended up drowning. The death was questionable until a Whale
biographer, James Curtis, acquired the suicide note from Whale's
lover, David Lewis.
	   ``The future is just old age and illness and pain,'' Whale
wrote. ``Good-bye all and thank you for all your love. I must have
peace and this is the only way.'' It was signed, ``Jimmy.''
	   At the time, Whale hadn't worked in Hollywood for 13 years. He
was suffering from the effects of strokes and taking medication. By
all indications he was battling depression.
	   In an interview, Curtis said the ill health was the primary
cause of the suicide, followed by the loss of film-making as an
avenue of expression. ``There was an element of boredom. He should
have been making films and he wasn't.''
	   Whale's journey to Hollywood success began in the English mining
town of Dudley, where he grew up poor. He served in the trenches in
World War I and was captured by the Germans. Spending the rest of
the war in a prisoner's camp probably not only saved his life, but
introduced to him the wonders of theater.
	   In the camp, he staged little productions. After the war, he
made a career in the theater, working himself up to London
productions as a director, actor and set designer. His ticket to
Hollywood was his direction of the realistic World War I drama,
``Journey's End,'' that went to Broadway after becoming a hit in
England.
	   Paramount Pictures put Whale under contract, and his first
directing job was eccentric millionaire Howard Hughes' notorious
airplane epic, ``Hell's Angels.'' He later went to Universal, which
offered him wide latitude as a director. There, in 1931, he turned
a middle-aged actor named Boris Karloff into the original
bolt-necked Frankenstein monster.
	   The film broke with tradition by making the monster sympathetic,
which only intensified the horror. He also brought dry humor to the
genre, as in ``The Invisible Man'' (1933) when Claude Rains pulls
off his nose and puts it on a table or when the perverse Dr.
Pretorius of ``Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935) suggests that to
create a woman would be ``REALLY interesting.''
	   Whale pioneered a choppy, fast-cutting style that disoriented
the audience and heightened the fear. Frankenstein's bride is
created with 175 ragged edits.

	   Horror, as Whale would often point out, wasn't his only forte.
He did well with the melodramatic ``The Old Dark House'' in 1932,
and the musical ``Show Boat'' in 1936.
	   But it was horror for which he was remembered and horror that
helped bring him down. A management change at Universal robbed him
of his autonomy just as he hit a creative slide. His traditional
fallbacks _ horror movies _ were losing favor with audiences.
	   And so Whale retreated to his painting and to an increasingly
hedonistic lifestyle, marked by his all-male pool parties. He
separated from his longtime lover Lewis and suffered a couple of
strokes.
	   Much has been made of Whale's sexuality. It's not much of a
stretch to see his horror movies, about misunderstood outsiders, as
metaphors for his own life. Some have pointed to Whale's campy
characters or even his awkwardness with love scenes as evidence of
his sexuality influencing his work.
	   Others, however, such as Curtis, have a more subtle reading.
While Whale never hid his homosexuality, he never flaunted it, and,
Curtis contends, ``I don't think that he would have consciously put
signals or content into his films that could be construed as gay
content.''
	   And certainly, Curtis insists, Whale was not as sexually
aggressive as McKellen's character in ``Gods and Monsters,'' who
pursues the beefcake gardener (Brendan Fraser). Nor was Whale as
haunted by war as the film suggests, Curtis believes.
	   The film, a modest production shot in just a few weeks, focuses
on a small time period, with Whale's past covered in brief
flashbacks.
	   ``This man was an outcast,'' said ``Gods and Monsters'' director
Bill Condon. ``And we take him at the point where he is most
interesting. We have an identification with the outcast, with the
outsider. He never lived to see the new interest in his films.''

An American favorite may finally be seen as an American master

<TEXT>
	   ARLINGTON, Vermont (AP) _ Can it be that America's most popular
painter at last is being ushered into the pantheon of the fine
arts?
	   After decades of wallowing in the critical rut reserved for
commercial illustrators, Norman Rockwell's reputation seems to be
gliding along as merrily as the Christmas sleigh rides he once
painted.
	   ``We have a newborn Rockwell, who can no longer be looked at
with sneering condescension and might well become an indispensable
part of our history,'' says art scholar Robert Rosenblum. ``To
enjoy his unique genius, all you have to do is look and relax.''
	   Paul Johnson, the provocative British historian, put it more
pugnaciously in a recent issue of the Spectator, a London weekly.
	   ``People do not like Picasso, they just feel they ought to,''
declared this conservative curmudgeon, ``but they genuinely love
Rockwell's painting.''
	   Young and old the world over, he argued, revel in the details of
the 321 covers Rockwell did for the long-extinct Saturday Evening
Post. ``They look at their favorite ones again and again, enjoying
the combined luxury of familiarity and surprise as fresh
discoveries are made.''
	   John Updike confesses to enjoying that luxury several times
daily. A poster-size print of ``Shuffleton's Barbershop,'' regarded
by aficionados as Rockwell's masterpiece for its intricate lighting
effects, hangs ``over the water closet'' in his writing den. When
nature calls, the novelist notes, ``I am still finding new things
to see in it.''
	   Rockwell's low esteem among the cognoscenti belies his
uncontested ranking as the most popular American artist of the 20th
century. While absent from the museums and galleries, his work was
lovingly hung in millions of homes as posters, Christmas cards, Boy
Scout calendars and Saturday Evening Post covers that invariably
boosted the magazine's press run by 250,000 copies.
	   While Rockwell's appeal endures, even continues to grow since
his death in 1978, his prestige in the higher echelons of fine arts
only lately shows signs of outlasting the snubs and sneers heaped
on the 4,000 paintings and drawings he produced in six decades of
productivity.
	   Now art students from around the world are among 35,000 visitors
a year at the tiny Arlington Gallery and the 200,000 who annually
call at the sprawling Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge,
Massachusetts, where 172 of his large-scale oils and some 400
sketches and studies are on display.
	   Rockwell's place as an important chronicler of American life in
this century soon will be up for critical re-evaluation in a
touring exhibit of more than 70 of his oils at six museums across
the country. The tour begins at Atlanta's High Museum of Art in
November 1999, and continues to Chicago Historical Society, the
Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., the San Diego Museum of Art
and the Phoenix Art Museum before winding up at the Stockbridge
museum.
	   Ann Knutson, curator at Atlanta High Museum of Art said one goal
of the nationwide tour ``is to get the critics as well as the
public to re-look at Rockwell as an important fine artist whose
visual narratives have a complexity and depth that have not been
appreciated.''
	   Cathy Osman, professor of fine arts at Marlboro College,
Vermont, admits to never having seen a Rockwell original or given
much thought to his ``position among the masters, if we still use
that term.'' She concedes that the art community tends to favor
``the grittier, dark side of American life'' as depicted by Hopper
and her favorites in the Ashcan School, like John Sloan.
	   In Japan, Rockwell's reputation has never been in doubt. They
compare his painstaking technique, his humor and celebration of
family life with the best of their scroll painters. Part of the
Stockbridge collection has just returned from a six-month tour of
Japan.
	   Collectors of Rockwell paintings include the late Andy Warhol,
Ross Perot and Steven Spielberg, who owns 14 originals and was a
major donor to the dlrs 9.4 million museum at Stockbridge.
	   Ironic in the light of British historian Johnson's comment,
Rockwell greatly admired Pablo Picasso long before it was
fashionable. He was in awe of the artist's originality and
imagination, but wary of the sudden onslaught of the avant-garde.
``They scared the devil out of me,'' he told his friend Donald
Walton. ``I was afraid there'd be no market in another few years
for what I was doing.''
	   He went to Paris in 1923 to learn the cubism preached in paint
by Picasso and Georges Braque. An attempt at an abstract cover
brought his first rejection slip from Post editor George Lorimer.
	   Determined to master the technique, he returned to Paris in 1932
for an extended stay, but lost heart when his teachers, who made
less in a year than he did for a single cover, kept begging advice
on how to become successful magazine illustrators. ``My best
efforts looked like lousy Matisses,'' he admitted.
	   Rockwell paid homage to Picasso by pinning the artist's
self-portrait near the top of his easel in his famous ``Triple
Portrait, which showed Rockwell peeking in a mirror to capture his
likeness on canvas. In ``The Connoisseur,'' a 1962 Post cover, he
imitated the dribble and drip style of Jackson Pollock, whom he
also admired.
	   The last Rockwell to come on the market sold for dlrs 914,000 at
Sotheby's. Several Rockwell fans point out that ``Le Peintre,'' the
Picasso thought to have gone down Sept. 2 when Swissair Flight 111
crashed into the sea off Nova Scotia, brought less _ dlrs 887,000 _
at a London auction.
	   But then there are still some hereabouts who remember when you
could pick up a Rockwell original for a dollar: On one day every
summer he set up his easel on the town green and joined local
artists doing caricatures to benefit the community house.

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Was Ray Charles out to change the
world when he first breached the white bastion of country music 36
years ago? Was he making a political statement? Was he trying to
help end discrimination?
	   ``Oh no!'' Charles, now 68, shouts during a telephone interview.
``My God! What? Oh no! I don't think like that. My mind never goes
there. I think only music, my friend. And I'm not being ridiculous,
I'm being honest with you.''
	   Still, intentionally or not, Charles showed the world something
that was far from obvious in 1962: that music is colorblind. And
measured against that triumph, his own blindness seems almost an
afterthought.
	   Now music lovers have a chance to reflect on Charles'
achievement through ``The Complete Country and Western Recordings
1959-1986,'' a four-CD boxed set from Rhino Records that documents
how the celebrated singer put his inimitable stamp on 92 country
songs.
	   It begins with ``Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music,'' a
landmark recording that helped country music gain a national
audience.
	   When Charles recorded an album of country music songs in 1962,
he introduced vast numbers of blacks to country-western, and many
whites to rhythm 'n' blues. Almost everybody loved his ``Modern
Sounds in Country and Western Music.''
	   At the time, the 31-year-old Charles had been known primarily as
a rhythm 'n' blues star with a largely black following. He had
risen to stardom after a string of hits, including ``I've Got a
Woman,'' with the release of his first album, ``Ray Charles,'' in
1957. A year later, he appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival and
released what became his signature song, the very popular ``What'd
I Say.''
	   But it was ``Georgia on My Mind,'' the soulful Hoagy Carmichael
tune that Charles recorded in 1960, that lured many whites and
blacks to his music. The tune won Charles two Grammy awards, for
best vocal performance by a male and best performance by a pop
artist.
	   Clearly, he had journeyed beyond rhythm 'n' blues and tapped
into the mainstream. Country music, though, was not a genre readily
embraced by urban whites or many blacks.
	   Charles broke new ground with his country interpretations. The
sound appealed to whites who didn't think they liked rhythm 'n'
blues, and blacks who didn't think they could enjoy country. With
country music, he became a huge star with an enormous following
among all people.
	   His brilliant arrangements started with his always soulful voice
and piano, and were helped along by a healthy dose of jazzy horns.
And then the most surprising touch: string sections and lush
background vocals that would be at home on ``The Lawrence Welk
Show.''
	   Charles' pleading version of Don Gibson's ``I Can't Stop Loving
You'' was the No. 1 pop record in the United States for five weeks
of the summer of 1962. It remains his biggest hit to date.
	   ``What we have to remember is that country in the early 1960s
was still very much a regional music and not in everybody's home,''
said Paul Kingsbury of the Country Music Foundation. ```Modern
Sounds in Country and Western Music' played an enormous role in
popularizing country music.''
	   Willie Nelson goes further.
	   ``With his recording of `I Can't Stop Loving You,' Ray Charles
did more for country music than any other artist,'' he says in a
quote included in the box set.
	   ``Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music'' was an immediate
hit. A sequel followed later the same year.
	   ``It's an idea as corny as any country song you can think of,
and one that Charles knew to be true: music unites people. It just
really does,'' Daniel Cooper writes in the liner notes of ``The
Complete Country and Western Recordings 1959-1986.''
	   Charles didn't suddenly discover country music. Growing up in
Greenville, Florida, the only reason he was allowed up past 9 p.m.
was to listen to the Grand Ole Opry.
	   ``I'd be listening to people at the time like Ernest Tubb,
Little Jimmy Dickens, that guy Eddy Arnold _ people like that,''
Charles said. ``I loved that kind of music. I had a feel for it. It
was very straightforward music, just like the blues. That's what
attracted me to country and western music.''
	   Charles played regularly with country bands early in his career.
It was a pragmatic move: Country bands got lots of work. Still,
executives at Charles' record company weren't thrilled when he told
them he wanted to record country songs.
	   Sam Clark, president of ABC at the time, ``thought I would lose
a lot of fans,'' Charles said.
	   ``I said to him, `Sam, chances are you might be right. But I
feel that I'll gain more fans than I'll lose, IF I can do it the
proper way.'''
	   He was bluffing.
	   ``I didn't know what I was talking about,'' Charles said,
laughing. ``But I wanted to do it, so that's what I said to him.''
	   Things worked out just as Charles had told Clark. White fans
started buying his music and coming to his concerts in droves.
	   ``What you call `the popular market' opened up,'' Charles said.
``I think everything went up from that. Obviously, my fans went up.
My concerts changed. My financial situation changed. So everything
improved.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joan Allen is sitting in an upper Westside diner
not far from the Manhattan apartment she retreats to when not
before the camera.
	   She is calm and thoughtful as she discusses over breakfast a
luminous career that has found her forever cast as a ... wife. And
perhaps the one role that will always define her on-screen brittle
vulnerability is that of Pat Nixon, the former first lady, a
portrayal that won Allen an Academy Award nomination.
	   Her latest role has her once again cast as a wife. This time,
she's a June Cleaver clone in the magical ``Pleasantville,'' a
woman who doffs the grayness of her life and blossoms in living
color.
	   ``Yeah, they're all married, but the characters in and of
themselves are pretty fascinating,'' says Allen. ``If you're going
to play wife roles, these are pretty good wife roles to play.''
	   The 41-year-old Allen exudes the warmth of a respected talent
who can still ride the Manhattan subways and buses unhassled but
has earned enough clout to be able to take most of this year off.
	   Her approachability and calm won the role for which she was
first nominated for an Oscar, playing a Pat Nixon with reserves of
steel opposite Anthony Hopkins' crazed and tortured former
president in Oliver Stone's ``Nixon.''
	   The next year, Allen was nominated for another Oscar as the
nobly aggrieved Elizabeth Proctor _ wife to Daniel Day-Lewis'
martyred John Proctor _ in Nicholas Hytner's film version of the
Arthur Miller play, ``The Crucible.''
	   On the screen, Allen can project a sense of control waiting to
crack, as in last year's ``The Ice Storm,'' playing the upper-crust
Connecticut swinger-and-sometime-shoplifter who is married to Kevin
Kline.
	   Immediately before that film, Allen had probably her greatest
popular success as John Travolta's wife in the 1997 summer thriller
``Face/Off.''
	   In ``Pleasantville,'' she gets to act a composite of all those
TV moms so beloved in the 1950s and '60s, from Donna Reed in ``The
Donna Reed Show'' to Barbara Billingsley in ``Leave It to Beaver.''
	   If the film stopped there, it would be no more than a caprice,
however delightful. Instead, ``Pleasantville'' goes much further.
The tale of two contemporary teen-agers sucked into a safe,
predictable and bygone black-and-white TV world becomes an
alternately hilarious and haunting piece about imaginative rebirth
and our need to live rich, complicated lives _ lives, in other
words, of color.
	   By the end of the movie, screenwriter-director Gary Ross has
dared to suggest something quite radical given society's nostalgia
for a gentler, simpler past. Perhaps, the film says, our own times,
for all their chaos and craziness, are still preferable to the
idealized, ordered world that an earlier generation grew up
watching on TV.
	   ``We are a variety of feelings,'' says Allen, picking up on a
central theme of the movie. ``To homogenize them is not very real;
to stifle them can be dangerous.
	   ``What choice do we have? We are three-dimensional.''
	   Allen's ``Pleasantville'' mom is told by her daughter of the
pleasures of sex, but it isn't until well into the movie that she
discovers them for herself. The seduction comes not from her
ever-polite, if experience-challenged, husband (played by W.H.
Macy, of ``Fargo'') but from the local soda shop owner (a
heartbreaking supporting turn from Jeff Daniels), who finds a new
career as an artist.
	   Allen recalls being perplexed at first by the ``facts-of-life''
scene in Ross' script.
	   ``I said to Gary, `The character doesn't even know what sex is?'
I was confused by that,'' she says. ``I mean, how does she have two
children? Gary said, `They were in the pilot; that's all you know.
You married a man who walks out the door carrying a briefcase and
mows the lawn on Saturdays.' ''
	   In real life, Allen is married to theater actor Peter Friedman,
whom she met in the early 1980s when they were both appearing in
the Lincoln Center Theater production of the English play ``And a
Nightingale Sang.'' They have a daughter, Sadie, 4 1-2 .
	   That was the period during which Allen was making her name on
Broadway. She won a Tony Award as the calming force to a volatile
John Malkovich in ``Burn This,'' and received a nomination the
following season for her role as the single mother whose
self-assuredness spoke for a generation in Wendy Wasserstein's
``The Heidi Chronicles.''
	   But Allen, a founding member of Chicago's noted Steppenwolf
Theater Company, hasn't done a play for more than seven years, when
she returned to her Chicago theater roots to star in a stage
version of Anne Tyler's ``Earthly Possessions.''
	   The theater ``feels like kind of another life to me,'' says the
actress, who seems quietly to delight in her new life on film.
	   ``I'm not interested in doing something night after night as I
was 8 to 10 years ago. It just doesn't interest me as much,'' she
says. ``The last few years, I've begun to feel I've really found my
legs on film. I understand it better.''
	   A native of Rochelle, Illinois, Allen studied drama at two
Illinois universities before working with Steppenwolf. Her first
major film was in 1985, when she was featured in ``Compromising
Positions,'' which starred Susan Sarandon and Raul Julia. The next
year, she appeared in three movies, including ``Peggy Sue Got
Married,'' and went on to star in such films as ``In Country,''
``Searching for Bobby Fisher'' and ``Ethan Frome.'' She almost
always played someone's wife.
	   Before Christmas, Allen expects to reteam with Daniels on a new
film called ``All the Rage,'' an indictment of America's gun laws
involving several of the creators behind the 1994 documentary
``Hoop Dreams.'' And in the winter, she hopes to travel to Ireland
to star in a film about Veronica Guerin, the Irish crime reporter
murdered in a gangland-style hit.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Who says big things don't come in itty-bitty
packages?
	   No one who has watched Danny DeVito enter a hotel room like a
boll weevil, hop up onto a sofa and just sit there grinning, an
unlit cigar clamped to his jaw.
	   ``So,'' he says, in his heavy New Jersey accent. ``What's goin'
on?''
	   As he speaks, DeVito fishes through the pockets of his
boy's-size jacket and pulls out pairs and pairs of eyeglasses, like
a circus car unloading clowns. Not one. Not two. But three pairs
come tumbling out.
	   ``These are for short,'' he says, stabbing a finger at the
clunky reading glasses in faux tortoiseshell. As for the gunmetal
frames, he reports, ``These are for seeing far.''
	   What about the third, a pair of ultra-cool Hollywood shades?
``Those?'' he says, smiling like the Cheshire Cat. ``Well, those
are for seeing even farther.''
	   Could be that there's a pair of glasses for each of DeVito's
Hollywood roles: actor, director and producer.
	   DeVito has quietly gone from goofing around in the 1970s as the
obnoxious Louie DePalma on TV's ``Taxi'' to being executive
producer of ``Pulp Fiction'' and director of such acclaimed films
as ``Hoffa'' and the ``War of the Roses.''
	   Potbellied and balding, with tufts of hair sprouting over each
ear, DeVito walks with a waddle, sports a hideous mustache and has
no discernible neck. He is barely 5 feet tall (1 1-2 meters) and
his legs dangle above the floor when he sits. There's no escaping
it: Danny DeVito is the most unlikely movie star to emerge in an
industry where looks are the measure of all things. He is
Hollywood's frog, the toad prince, and people are enchanted.
	   Now, a few weeks before his 54th birthday, and after more than
two dozen films _ including four he directed and 11 he helped
produce _ DeVito is publicizing his next role as _ get this: a
lover.
	   ``I always found him beautiful,'' says Richard LaGravenese, who
wrote and directed ``Living Out Loud,'' which pairs a neurotic
Holly Hunter with DeVito, a set-upon working stiff.
	   ``There's something beatific about his face. It's very sensuous,
in a way,'' LaGravenese says. ``I know that sounds weird. But I've
always felt that when he smiles, and he's got that charm, I'd do
anything that he says.''
	   Few pint-size moguls can rival DeVito, the son of an Asbury
Park, New Jersey, luncheonette owner who once studied to be a
hairdresser and never listened to people who said his height would
be an impediment in show biz.
	   True fans will remember his role as an asylum inmate in ``One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' but stardom came with a TV sitcom,
``Taxi,'' that was the first to exploit DeVito's wicked side.
	   Perched in his dispatcher's cage, Louie took great pride in
humiliating each of his drivers, zeroing in on their weaknesses _ a
sadistic, self-hating monster set loose among the prime-time
innocents.
	   ``Louie is an extension of Danny,'' DeVito says. ``Every
character you play is basically 75 percent you. You have choices
that you add as traits. But underneath, I believe, if you're doing
it right, you're drawing from your own feelings and emotions.''
	   Except for a small part in ``Terms of Endearment,'' DeVito
quickly cornered the market on lovable, wild-eyed rascals like
Louie _ as if nature itself had predestined him to play the
blackest of comedies.
	   ``If you're a piano, that's who you are,'' he says. ``If you're
a violin, you're a violin. You could probably play a guitar part or
the piano part but you still have to embrace that instrument.''
	   DeVito did more than embrace his odd size. When Billy Crystal
called him ``a little troll who should be hanging off a rearview
mirror,'' DeVito wasn't just playing along. He was behind the
camera, making his directorial debut in ``Throw Mama From the
Train.''
	   He parodied his shortness to extremes opposite the gigantic
Arnold Schwarzenegger in ``Twins,'' And he parodied his stardom as
a self-absorbed Hollywood actor in ``Get Shorty.''
	   Sure, DeVito can do crass and profane. Yet isn't there something
appealing, even earthy about him on screen? From ``Romancing the
Stone,'' to ``Get Shorty'' to ``L.A. Confidential,'' he is always
the regular guy trapped in an out-of-control script.
	   ``I always think about this image I read about years and years
ago: It's a Zen image,'' he says. ``You're looking at a lake and it
begins to have waves _ ripples in it. And in order to calm the
lake, you go down to the water's edge and you start trying to calm
the water. But what do you really do? You create more waves.
	   ``That's what these characters wind up doing: They wind up going
to the water's edge and trying to pat the water. It's a classic
noir thing. You're escalating,'' he says, becoming more animated.
	   ``You've killed that guy, but now you've got to kill that one
and that one in order to cover it up. And it's only making it
worse! I see it in my life and you certainly see it in the world
out there. There's always somebody trying to do something to remedy
some mistake and it always backfires on them!''
	   The solution, he freely admits, is something he's never
mastered. Just before he scooches off the sofa, tucking away his
assembled eye wear, DeVito offers these words of wisdom:
	   ``Sometimes,'' he says ``it's better to just sit back, clam up
and hope for the best.''

Edward Zwick: TV shows with ambivalence, films with clear-cut
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: 'The Siege' opened Friday &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo NY351 &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUGLAS J. ROWE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Director Edward Zwick always admired the work of
Costa-Gavras, best known for ``Z'' and ``Missing'' _ the kind of
political thrillers ``where you grip the arms of your chair and
suddenly it's two hours later.''
	   That's a big reason why Zwick, whose films include ``Glory,''
``Legends of the Fall,'' and ``Courage Under Fire,'' wanted to make
``The Siege,'' about the government invoking martial law in New
York after a terrorist campaign runs rampant.
	   Striving to make a movie peculiarly American in its ``theme or
contemplation,'' the 46-year-old filmmaker was intrigued by the
premise of testing democracy, of finding out whether the
Constitution _ with its guarantees of tolerance, freedoms and
rights _ could crumble.
	   ``The ability to absorb the blow and to carry on in the face of
that kind of intimidation is what defines a society. I felt
ultimately that's what this movie could be about,'' says Zwick, who
co-wrote and co-produced the film. ``Terrorism can't defeat a
democratic society. Only a democratic society can do that to
itself.''
	   The movie's obvious springboard is the Feb. 23, 1993 bombing of
the World Trade Center. Taking it a step further, Zwick enhances
his movie's ripped-from-the-headlines feel by basing a character on
the phenomenon of ``blowback'' _ an intelligence community term for
U.S.-trained foreign operatives who use their new talents for
espionage and explosives on American soil.
	   While producer Lynda Obst calls ``The Siege,'' which stars
Denzel Washington, Annette Bening and Bruce Willis, a
``thinking-man's thriller,'' Zwick concedes that action and ideas
don't mesh much in Hollywood, unlike, say, in Costa-Gavras' films.
	   ``That is a staple of a more European tradition,'' he says,
adding that he was striving for that, too. ``Why not try to do
something that cross-pollinates the genre? Why can't there be a
movie that can be entertaining and smart? I don't think they have
to be mutually exclusive.''
	   A writer and editor for The New Republic and Rolling Stone
magazine before earning a master's degree from the American Film
Institute in the mid-1970s, Zwick cottons to
military/historical/political themes. ``Glory'' told of the first
all-black regiment to fight for the North in the Civil War, while
``Courage Under Fire'' focused on the probe into whether a woman
should be awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery during the Gulf
War.
	   ``It's a very time-honored tradition actually,'' the
Harvard-educated Zwick explains. ``How to say this without sounding
terribly pretentious? But that's what Homer did, and that's what
Tolstoy does, and that's what Shakespeare does constantly.
	   ``It's often in time of extreme stress on a society ... that
(the) role of the government, the military, is very much central to
drama. I think it's a way of drama cutting to the bone, getting rid
of all the niceties of self-consciousness and more neurotic kinds
of behavior, because issues become very core ... stripped down to
conversations about responsibility, conversations about
accountability, duty, honor. Those words can rise up. Choices are
more clear.''
	   Yet, the Emmy winner has done a lot of television work that's
just the opposite _ ``thirtysomething,'' ``My So-Called Life'' and
``Relativity.'' He concedes that those shows were all about
ambivalence, ambiguity, ``a dialectic of experience where people
are trying to inhabit two points of view simultaneously.''
	   The differing qualities of his films versus his TV work simply
bespeak balance, he says, one having ``a nice leveling effect'' on
the other. And he'll continue to go between movies and television
to keep balance in his life in another way, too.
	   ``It has to do with trying to have a family and have a life,
where I can be home and see my kids, and coach soccer and do all
those things,'' says Zwick, who's married and has a 12-year-old boy
and a 5-year-old girl.
	   Zwick, who recently signed a deal with partner Marshall
Herskovitz to create four new television series, says TV is more of
a family-friendly 9-to-5 gig, while moviemaking is more disruptive.
	   ``The analogy is to that of a sea voyage,'' he says. ``You're
going off in some ship with these people, and they're all very
hardy, and they're all committed to your ephemeral cause but you're
isolated among them in a sort of monomaniacal quest, going toward
this thing that you know not what.''

Five Questions with Jason Marsalis: all in the family
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By CHARLES J. GANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ His father says 21-year-old Jason Marsalis shows
more musical talent than any of his older brothers did at his age.
That's saying a lot, when your family is New Orleans' first family
of jazz.
	   The Marsalis family includes Delfeayo, a trombone player and
record producer; Branford, the saxophonist who formerly headed the
``Tonight Show'' band; and Wynton, a trumpeter and Pulitzer
Prize-winning composer who has spearheaded the current
neotraditional movement in jazz.
	   Like Wynton, Jason has a solid classical background, performing
as a symphony percussionist and majoring in music performance at
Loyola University in New Orleans. But the young drummer also shares
Branford's eclectic tastes, playing with fusion, Afro-Cuban,
Brazilian and Celtic bands in New Orleans clubs.
	   Proud father Ellis Marsalis, a pianist and one of the country's
pre-eminent jazz educators, says Jason has ``great potential to
make a statement on his instrument.'' During the past seven years,
Marsalis has matured into a sensitive accompanist in his father's
straight-ahead trio. It was Jason who produced the Ellis Marsalis
Trio CD ``Twelve's It'' (Columbia), released earlier this year.
	   ``The trio was really set up for me to learn how to play. ...
and we weren't thinking about recording,'' Marsalis said. ``But I
did more listening as the years went on and it felt like a trio
with people really playing together. I was thinking we should do
the trio as a record.''
	   For the past three years, the young Marsalis has also performed
with innovative pianist Marcus Roberts, stretching out beyond the
drummer's traditional timekeeping role on such albums as ``Blues
for the New Millennium'' (Columbia).
	   ``I think one thing I learned from my father is how important it
is to really study music,'' Marsalis said. ``And there's also the
importance of learning older, standard songs. A lot of younger
musicians don't do that. There are a lot of older standard songs
that my father plays. Sometimes he'll start playing songs that I
don't even know, and I'll have to start listening.''
	   Marsalis is making his recording debut as a leader on ``The Year
of the Drummer'' for Basin Street Records, a New Orleans label.
	   1. Did you feel any pressure to follow in the Marsalis family
tradition by becoming a jazz musician?
	   Marsalis: There was definitely not any pressure. ... It was
something I loved doing. My parents bought me this toy drum set
that I used to just bash on when I was 3 or 4. Then I remember
listening to jazz records and being attracted to the drums. And it
probably dawned on me, 'Hey, I think I may want to really start
playing this instrument for real.'
	   2. What were some of the most valuable lessons you learned from
your father?
	   Marsalis: Even though my father is not a drummer, he's had many
experiences with drummers. He understands the drums and knows how
to listen to them. My father worked with the two greatest New
Orleans drummers: James Black and Ed Blackwell. ... I've learned
about drums from him through them so to speak.
	   3. What's the significance to you of the trio recording you did
with your father, ``Twelve's It''?
	   Marsalis: I see the record as the documentation of the many
years that my father and I have been playing together. This is the
first recording we've made together as a trio, the whole record.
... I had a lot of input on 'Twelve's It.' ... The record gave me a
good opportunity to do something on my own. I had to put all the
songs together, sequence everything and produce it.
	   4. What aspects of your music are you trying to present with
your quintet on ``The Year of the Drummer''?
	   Marsalis: The first thing that I had in mind to showcase was my
compositions. I have 10 original compositions on the album and each
has a different personality. One of the things I tried to achieve
on a few tunes was to take older concepts of music and use them in
a modern context. ... The second thing was the drum solos. Each
drum solo that I played was different. They showcase different
styles, different timbres.
	   5. Most teen-agers don't think it's too cool to hang out with
their parents. Why did you spend so long playing with your father's
trio?
	   Marsalis: I have a high level of respect for my parents,
especially my father. I think we relate on a musical level. He's
supported me with music for a long time. I spent a lot of time with
him because I learned so much. ... I wasn't really the rebel kind
of person that most teens are. That's not in my personality. ...
But I've actually stopped playing with him now. ... because I'm
basically moving on. I'm going to be living on my own and taking a
semester off. The next goal is to develop a great trio with Marcus
Roberts _ we're trying to figure out a new way of playing trio _
and eventually I'm going to do something on my own as a leader.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ At 17, Anoushka Shankar has studied sitar for
more than half her life.
	   Ravi Shankar is her father and teacher.
	   She practices three or four hours a day on weekends and two
hours on school days. It was Anoushka's mother, Sukanya, who
suggested sitar lessons when her daughter was 9.
	   ``It wasn't my choice to do at first,'' Anoushka said. ``Once I
actually started playing, I grew to enjoy it.''
	   She made her performing debut at her father's 75th birthday
celebration in New Delhi, India, in February 1995. Since then,
she's played with him at all his concerts.
	   ``It's always so much fun and exciting being on stage with my
father. I love it,'' she said. ``When I watch him do something
particularly amazing, it is incredible. If I do something I think
is good, it's a good feeling.''
	   Her father said, ``For me, it is a great joy to teach her and
guide her toward the heights and depths of our music. I have many
students and very talented ones, some already famous all over the
world, four or five in their late 60s. Anoushka is my latest, from
the start of holding the sitar. When you get a clay vase which is
soft, you can mold it so much.''
	   Her first solo recording, ``Anoushka,'' was released in October.
When Angel Records suggested it, she was surprised and excited.
``My parents asked if I wanted to do it,'' she said. ``I wanted to.
I didn't think anyone would want it.''
	   She recorded the CD's five pieces of music during a three-day
weekend, then went back later and redid one small part.
	   Anoushka wears Indian dress when she plays the sitar in public,
sitting on a flat floor cushion. But, in San Diego, California,
where the family lives, she usually wears Western clothes. And, as
a senior in high school, she is careful to keep a balance in her
life.
	   ``I go pretty crazy with my clothes sometimes,'' she said. ``I
love to write and do creative writing and poetry. I'm in a feminist
club at school. I'm not big on sports.''
	   She hangs out with her friends at coffee shops or at the beach.
``They keep me normal, pretty much.''
	   The Shankar family was in New York recently for a Carnegie Hall
concert.
	   While Anoushka was being photographed, her father explained:
``Our music is not written-down music. What we do is learn from the
guru by imitating, by listening, and it takes years to assimilate
the whole thing. That is a special ability Anoushka has since her
childhood. I guess it is in her blood or genes.''
	   He identified three Western musicians as having the
understanding and potential to be great sitar players: classical
violinist Yehudi Menuhin, the late jazz saxophonist John Coltrane
and Beatles guitarist George Harrison, whom Anoushka refers to as
``Uncle George.''
	   ``He says he's president of my fan club,'' Anoushka said,
referring to Harrison.
	   She always knew her father had greatness. ``But I think I was
too young to be intimidated by that. I'd watch my cartoons, then
take half an hour out and play. By the time I was 12, I knew it was
something I wanted to do as a career.''
	   Anoushka has taken piano lessons since she was 12. But she
suffers from tendinitis, which is aggravated by playing both
instruments.
	   ``Piano was almost like sharing something personal with the
public,'' she said. ``I wasn't comfortable with that. I enjoy
performing sitar a lot more. I'll keep piano as something I enjoy
for myself.''
	   For Anoushka, improvisation is the most difficult part of
playing sitar.
	   ``I'm getting better,'' she said. ``You have to understand the
ragas to be able to improvise. Some people find improvising easier
than learning the ragas. I'm lucky to have a really good memory.
It's easy for me to remember and play a long composition.''
	   Anoushka hasn't played a solo concert and she's nervous about
doing it, finding it safer and more comfortable to watch her father
while he plays and then respond with her sitar when he cues her.
	   ``When my father and I play together, it's like I'm assisting
him. He is the main artist. If he is improvising, he'll stop and
I'll pick up. It is based on interaction, it's entirely fun. In the
middle of concert, he has me play a solo.''

Five Questions with Toni Collette: she's amazing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: 'Velvet Goldmine' opens in theaters nationwide on Nov. 6 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Amazing.
	   The word pops up about a dozen times during a 30-minute
conversation with Toni Collette, one of the stars of the new film,
``Velvet Goldmine.''
	   ``Velvet Goldmine'' is director Todd Haynes' fictional
re-creation of the '70s British rock scene. It also stars Ewan
McGregor, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Christian Bale.
	   Talking about the director and working on the film, Collette
says:
	   ``He gave me the most AMAZING opportunity.''
	   ``I was desperate to do it, and AMAZING as the script was, and
that's of course why I would want to do it, I couldn't really quite
understand why I was just so determined to do it.''
	   ``I didn't want 'Velvet Goldmine' to end. It had the most
AMAZING, palpable, brilliant energy. I had so many great mates, and
I want to work with Todd forever.''
	   AMAZING is one of the words to describe Collette, 25, who got
her start as a teen-ager playing opposite Anthony Hopkins in Mark
Joffe's ``Spotswood.''
	   Born in Sydney, Australia, in 1972 _ ``the more time I spend
away from Australia, the more I realize how AMAZING it is'' _ she
portrayed an awkward girl who turns into a beauty in the 1994 film,
``Muriel's Wedding.''
	   ``There are two films which have changed my life,'' she says.
``'Muriel's Wedding,' but that was more about what occurred after
the making of the film. The actual making of 'Velvet Goldmine' made
me grow so much and that's what I think life is about. So it really
made me very aware, and I really didn't want the film to end.''
	   ``Velvet Goldmine'' shows the underbelly of the glam rock era.
	   ``It was glamorous, but it was a total sham,'' Collette says.
``The way the film is shot, it's so gritty and so ugly and so real.
And you see the running mascara, and you see the rips in their
clothes, and you see that they've been dyeing their hair and that
they're all cruddy from taking too many drugs.''
	   Collette plays Mandy Slade, wife of pop star Brian Slade (Rhys
Meyers), who set the singer on the road to stardom only to find
herself cast aside in the wake of his ego and his infatuation with
American rock star Curt Wild (McGregor).
	   In one of the film's best scenes, set in 1984, Mandy sits in a
bar, telling a reporter (Bales) how her relationship with Slade
ended after he faked his death at a London rock concert.
	   Mandy has been stripped bare, revealing the person beneath the
artifice.
	   ``We shot that scene at the very end of the film, so we had the
potency of the entire shoot to be able to draw upon,'' Collette
says.
	   ``I find Mandy in the 1984 style, even though she appears to be
a little sad and washed up, she's so strong and so accepting of
herself, at such a comfortable place, and so truthful and so
honest, more than any other character in the film,'' she says.
	   Collette reflects on the film and her character as she sits in a
midtown hotel room. In the film, she is dressed in the threads of
the glam rock era, wearing layers of makeup and wigs of varying
styles and colors. She is strikingly different _ if not
unrecognizable _ in her three-quarter length jacket and sneakers,
with her minimal makeup and her '90s spiked reddish-gold hair.
	   There's not a feather, bead or sparkle of glitter in sight.
	   In just a few hours, she'll attend the New York premiere of
``Velvet Goldmine.''
	   ``Tonight is like waving goodbye to the film,'' she says. ``I
don't even think I'm going to watch it, because it's too hard to
watch. It's really hard, it's really emotional. As important as
that period was to Mandy, the making of this film was like that to
me.''
	   1. How did you feel about your role as Mandy Slade?
	   Collette: I was petrified to do it.
	   1 1-2 . Why?
	   Collette: It's very sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll and I'm not
like that. And I leapt into somewhere else and didn't come back for
a few months (laughs).
	   2. What about director Todd Haynes?
	   Collette: I'll always appreciate that Todd cast me from the
inside out in such an aesthetically based industry. He really went
for a feeling and trusted me to kind of catch up with the physical
transformation and I love him for that.
	   3. How would you describe Mandy?
	   Collette: She was the reigning queen, she was at the center of
it for so long. She helped create the upsurgence of the glam rock
era. She helped create Maxwell Demon.
	   4. Were you worried that the music and costumes would grab all
the attention?
	   Collette: No. I think I have the most emotionally present and
identifiable part, so I was always really aware of it. I can't
watch the movie any more because my emotions are too entangled and
intertwined in it. So I was very aware of the sadness of the tale
and how unglamorous it was, with all of the shiny, camp,
hedonistic, glitterized style of it, there is a very serious and
very complex emotionally potent tale to be told.
	   5. What was it like to attend the VH1 Fashion Awards and see
Iggy Pop perform in the glam rock segment?
	   Collette: Wasn't Iggy AMAZING? You know what I love about him?
He has the most beautiful energy. He's like a child. I think it's
really important to keep a sense of innocence, you know, because
we're all walking around thinking that we know what we're doing on
the planet and we have absolutely no idea.

Olympic medals winner feels `perfect' ahead of 100th birthday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARIBOR, Slovenia (AP) _ It's been three-quarters of a century
since he won his first gold medal. But Leon Stukelj, winner of six
Olympic medals in gymastics, still uses the rings hanging in the
doorway of his home.
	   Not bad for someone about to turn 100.
	   ``Well, not every day,'' admits Stukelj, the oldest living
Olympic champion.
	   ``I guess it is rather rare to find a man almost 100 years old,
happily married for 65 years and also a winner of three Olympic
gold medals,'' he said without a trace of arrogance, only a nod of
pride and pleasure.
	   Stukelj turns 100 on Thursday, but he's not showing his age.
	   His hair is thin, his hands are covered with spots and he weighs
only about 45 kilograms (99 pounds). Still, he jumps from the chair
to answer the phone and takes long walks each day in a nearby park.
	   Stukelj's blue eyes glitter as he passionately discusses sports,
politics in neighboring Croatia, the pros and cons of autocracy
versus democracy, and what Slovenia should do to preserve its
identity once it joins the European Union.
	   ``I feel just perfect,'' Stukelj says, clad impeccably in a gray
suit, looking cheerfully at his great-grandchildren, 2-year-old
twins Helena and Andrej.
	   He exercises regularly but admits he has to be careful: ``My
muscles are 100 years old and too much pressure could strain
them.''
	   Born in Novo Mesto in 1898, Stukelj discovered his talent for
gymnastics as a teenager, joining the Sokol (Hawk) amateur sports
association.
	   In 1924, just a few weeks after graduating from the Law
University in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana, the then 25-year-old
Stukelj was atop the podium at the Paris Olympic Games, winning
Yugoslavia's only two medals _ golds in the horizontal bar and
all-round competition.
	   At the Amsterdam Games in 1928, he won gold in the rings and
bronze medals in the all-around and team exercises. He took silver
in the rings in Berlin in 1936.
	   As a cherished memory of the Berlin Olympics, staged by Hitler's
Nazi Germany, Stukelj points at a photograph displayed in the
living room cabinet, showing him talking to American sprinter Jesse
Owens.
	   Just beside that photo is a picture of a young woman, inscribed:
``Fuer Leon, Leni Riefenstahl.''
	   Stukelj met the notorious Hitler propaganda film director in the
Olympic village in Berlin, too.
	   ``I wanted to have photos of both of them,'' he said. ``I felt
they were making history, one way or another.''
	   There's a picture of fellow gymnasts like Alfred Schwarzmann and
Peter Frankel, as well as Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the
International Olympic Committee. Also displayed are photos of
Stukelj as a strong young gymnast working on parallel bars or on a
strength move on the rings _ a move that became known as the
Stukelj cross.
	   Stukelj quit gymnastics at age 38, devoting his energy to his
professional work as a judge in Maribor. He retired in 1963, but
continued to aid an attorney and wrote a few books on gymnastics.
	   Stukelj's recipe for long life could be a model for modern
generations: a healthy life.
	   ``Above all, it's sports.''
	   ``The basis is probably in the genes,'' he said, adding that
both of his sisters lived beyond 90. ``There's also the fact that I
was always intellectually active.''
	   But the sports activity that he began as a young boy and has
continued in different forms ``was essential for me to stay in
shape. And, if I wanted to be in shape, I have had to live
healthy.''
	   That meant no cigarettes and no alcohol, ``but I never liked
that either.''
	   Discipline must have played a role too. He wakes up exactly at 8
a.m. each day, has breakfast and goes for a walk.
	   ``It's 12:30 _ lunch time,'' he exclaims during the interview.
	   And there's also Stukelj's joy of living.
	   ``I had many struggles in my life, but also a lot of
happiness,'' he said. ``I look forward to each new day.''
	   Stukelj danced his way up a long flight of stairs at the 1996
Atlanta Games opening ceremony.
	   How about a repeat at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney?
	   ``I don't know _ 2000 is still far away,'' he said. ``And the
flight to Australia takes 24 hours _ a long trip for an old man.
We'll see.''

	   In the spotlight: Neil Young, urban cowboy
	    &UR; Image: Neil Young's signature raw nasal tone, shrill guitar
playing, highly personal lyrics and hippie-cowboy loner stance
helped shape rock 'n' roll as it advanced from adolescence into
maturity.
	    &UR; Personal stats: Born in Toronto, Canada, on Nov. 12, 1945, his
first musical inklings were encouraged when his father gave him a
ukulele for Christmas in 1958.
	   Young moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, with his mother in 1960. He
dropped out of high school to concentrate on his band, Neil Young
and the Squires.
	   He joined the seminal folk-rock band Buffalo Springfield. During
the band's two-year existence, Young recorded three successful
albums and a retrospective.
	   Young signed a solo record deal. His debut album, ``Neil
Young,'' was poorly received. His second album, ``Everybody Knows
This Is Nowhere,'' was recorded with his new backing band, Crazy
Horse. The album went platinum with songs such as ``Cinnamon
Girl,'' ``Cowgirl in the Sand'' and ``Down by the River.''
	   He joined David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash in 1969,
just in time to appear at the historic Woodstock Festival. Crosby,
Stills, Nash and Young released three albums, with classic songs
like ``Helpless,'' ``Country Girl'' and ``Ohio.''
	   In the 1980s, Young jumped wildly among genres: country,
retro-rockabilly, soul and hard rock. He won MTV's Video of the
Year award in 1988 for ``This Note's for You,'' which lampooned the
commercial state of rock. ``Freedom,'' powered by the single,
``Rockin' in the Free World,'' was praised by the critics.
	    &UR; Back to his roots: In recent years, Young has gone back to his
roots with several rock-based albums and the soundtrack to ``Broken
Arrow.'' His latest album is ``Year of the Horse.''
	   His rediscovery of electric guitar feedback has earned him the
nickname, ``Godfather of Grunge.''
	    &UR; Quote: ``Songs work as long as I'm talking about something I
believe in. If I believe in it, and I sing it with conviction and
the pictures work for me, then it's going to work for someone else,
too.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ They can be more powerful than governments.
They distribute more aid than the World Bank or any country. Some
have bigger budgets than large corporations. A few readily put
themselves at higher risk than the world's greatest armies.
	   In dealing with global crises, big business and big government
are often left in the dust by big nonprofit, which now spends more
than dlrs 1 trillion a year. The movement, if viewed as a nation,
would rank eighth in economic power, according to a study to be
released Sunday.
	   Named for what they're not _ not business and not part of any
government _ thousands of nonprofit, non-government organizations,
or NGOs, are booming around the globe.
	   NGOs _ the only way to pronounce it is one letter at a time _
have played key roles in negotiating trade and environmental
treaties and now sit in on government and corporate
decision-making.
	   They tread where government and business cannot, dare not or
will not go, into the world's hottest trouble spots and biggest
disasters _ Kosovo, Honduras, Bosnia, Somalia, Chechnya,
Afghanistan _ and often suffering more casualties than the
government agents and soldiers they precede.
	   ``Nonprofit aid organizations do the hardest work for the
littlest pay under the greatest risks with the least support,''
said Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, in a call for greater
protections for private aid workers.
	   Casualties among aid workers rarely have the political impact of
military deaths, said Jim Moody, head of InterAction, a coalition
of 150 nonprofit groups.
	   ``We go where governments are often loath to see official
persons in harm's way,'' Moody said. ``It's sort of ironic that NGO
workers are seen by governments as more expendable.''
	   NGOs often clash with governments, even democratic governments.
In South Africa, U.S. support for NGOs was criticized because
Nelson Mandela's government wanted direct aid. Other governments
accuse nonprofits of stirring up trouble or spying.
	   China has welcomed some NGOs but still views religious groups
and strong advocacy organizations such as Greenpeace with
suspicion. North Korea, Mynmar and Cuba are all tough places for
NGOs to work, although they often are the only foreigners on the
ground where diplomats are unwelcome.
	   The end of the Cold War has changed the climate for nonprofit
organizations. The need for a nuclear deterrent, secrecy and close
government control, Moody said, is replaced by a need to ``mobilize
any significant resources we can, involve as many people as
possible, be as open as possible.''
	   It's a climate in which NGOs thrive. With rapidly expanding
communications media, including the Internet, nonprofit groups now
have highly effective way of sharing their goals, multiplying,
organizing and mobilizing across borders.
	   In addition to dispensing charity, NGOs take surveys, dig wells,
fix bad teeth, stop epidemics, house refugees, protect natural
resources, lend money, sue polluters and sometimes demonstrate
against governments. They range from huge operations like the
Nature Conservancy, which buys and protects vast acreage, to
one-issue groups like Solar Cookers International.
	   They often set the agenda in world conferences. The World Bank
and International Monetary Fund now look to them for advice, as do
private corporations.
	   ``Nonprofits are a way to avoid over-reliance either on the
state or the market. They have this wonderful way of tapping
individual initiative, but they do it for public purpose,'' said
Lester M. Salamon, co-author of a new report for Johns Hopkins
University that details rapid growth of the movement worldwide.
	   Once viewed primarily as ``do-gooders'' and religious groups
trying to ``save the world,'' NGOs have evolved into a movement of
liberals and conservatives. British Prime Minister Tony Blair calls
it the ``third way'' in world affairs. German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder dubs it the ``new middle.'' To academics it's an emerging
``civil society.''
	   Salamon's study of 22 countries, including the world's richest,
dispels any notion the movement is dominated by Americans. Western
Europe emerges as a seedbed of nonprofit activity.
	   NGOs employ scientists, social workers, researchers and
professional campaigners of all nationalities, often paying highly
competitive salaries to attract the best in a variety of fields.
	   In the countries studied, 19 million people draw salaries from
nonprofits, and the number is growing four times faster than
overall employment.
	   The largest nonprofits in the United States operate on budgets
approaching dlrs 500 million.
	   More than 7 percent of the U.S. workforce is with nonprofits,
and the Johns Hopkins study estimates 28 percent of people in the
countries studied either do volunteer work or are employed by
nonprofits.
	   They handle 30 percent of all U.S. foreign aid, and Vice
President Al Gore predicts that will soon rise to 40 percent.
	   ``The growth of NGOs is one of the most positive phenomena that
has occurred in the world,'' said Brian Atwood, head of the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
	   Charles Lichenstein, alternate U.N. ambassador under President
Ronald Reagan and now a fellow at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, said, ``I think the proliferation of NGOs is, on
balance, a healthy sign of pluralism in human societies. I don't
want governments to decide who can ride the horse and who can't
ride the horse.''

Emerging Sector Revisited,'' a report published Sunday by Johns
Hopkins University:
	   HOW MUCH THEY SPEND: Nongovernment organizations doing volunteer
and nonprofit work are a dlrs 1.1 trillion industry in 22 countries
studied, including the world's major industrialized nations and a
sampling of countries in all regions.

Rivals hunt votes in battle to succeed Gingrich
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, adding details, quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN FRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The men who would be speaker engaged in a
frantic telephone duel for support a day after Newt Gingrich
stepped down and left shocked House Republicans searching for a
winning message.
	   Gingrich said he decided to leave Congress rather than ``allow
the party to cannibalize itself.''
	   On Saturday, a day when Capitol Hill was mostly empty except for
tourists, the two top contenders for Gingrich's job feverishly
worked the phones from their offices. Another possible candidate
withdrew from consideration.
	   ``It's sort of like an Easter egg hunt,'' said Rep. Christopher
Cox, a Californian Republican, one of the two leading candidates,
as he emerged briefly from his office in a white cardigan and brown
corduroy pants. ``It's whoever gets the Easter egg first.''
	   Down the same corridor, perceived front-runner Rep. Bob
Livingston of Louisiana telephoned House Republicans to seek their
support, glued to his desk and wearing a blue ``USS Boxer''
baseball cap for the amphibious assault ship where he once served.
	   ``To us right now, getting votes is more important than getting
press,'' said spokesman Mark Corallo, explaining why Livingston
would not grant an interview. Livingston did plan to appear on a
Sunday morning news show, however, and Cox scheduled appearances on
two others.
	   Livingston supporters, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he had 80 or more of the 112 votes that will be needed when House
Republicans vote for new leaders on Nov. 18. Such pledges of
support can be tenuous, however, because the vote is by secret
ballot.
	   The next Congress will have 223 Republicans, 211 Democrats and
one independent who usually votes with Democrats.
	   Livingston got a boost when House Whip Tom DeLay of Texas
announced he would support his quest for speaker. DeLay, the No. 3
House Republican, is considered the safest of the top four House
leaders and is the only one not now being challenged.
	   Gingrich, meanwhile, spoke publicly for the first time since the
astonishing announcement Friday evening that his 20-year House
career _ including four meteoric and frenzied years as speaker _
was over.
	   ``I think as a practical matter for me to stay in the House
would make it impossible for a new leader to learn, to grow, to do
what they have to do,'' Gingrich said outside his home in Marietta,
Georgia. He will resign not just his speakership but also his seat
in Congress, he said.
	   Gingrich's decision came just days after House Republicans saw
their majority reduced to the point that just six defections by
Republican lawmakers would cost them defeats, instead of the
11-vote margin they have had. Not long ago, party leaders had hoped
to win 30 to 40 seats.
	   Since then, the Republican Party has been convulsed with
infighting over who was to blame, with most fingers pointed at the
current House leaders.
	   Gingrich urged the Republicans to unite, saying, ``The prospect
of Al Gore as president and a Democratic Congress should be enough
to focus every Republican in the country.''
	   Also considering a run at the speakership was Rep. James Talent
of Missouri, 42, the chairman of the House Small Business Committee
and a three-term House veteran who gets along with conservatives
and moderates alike.
	   Gingrich said he was examining the legalities of resigning from
the House. He is expected to leave before the new Congress is sworn
in Jan. 3.

As aid offers pour in, little agreement on whether Russia needs
</HEADLINE>
food &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Across the frozen sweep of Russia this winter,
poor people will stock their cupboards with food bearing the
distinctive stamp of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
	   Wheat, corn, pork, beef _ a cornucopia of American farm products
will be headed to Russia under an agreement signed Friday. In all,
3.1 million tons of U.S. food will be shipped, more than half of it
an outright gift.
	   It won't be the first time that American farmers have sent
surplus grain, meat and other goods to a needy Russia. Grain
shipments have been a regular feature of U.S.-Russian relations,
and many Russians still joke about ``Bush legs,'' the shipments of
American chicken legs donated by former President George Bush in
the early 1990s.
	   What is unclear this time is how badly Russians need the food.
	   This has been a disastrous year for Russia. The economy
collapsed in August, and food imports practically ceased. The ruble
was devalued and inflation soared. Many Russians continued to go
without regular paychecks, giving them little ability to buy food
at any price.
	   To top it all off, cycles of drought and floods helped produce
the worst grain crop in 40 years.
	   Despite all that, top Russian officials were insisting until a
few weeks ago that they had plenty of food to get through the
winter and no need for donations from other countries.
	   Even after Russia began negotiating with U.S. officials for food
shipments, Agriculture and Food Minister Viktor Semyonov said there
was ``no threat of food shortages, no grounds for the threat of
food shortages today.''
	   It's hard to tell whether that was pride or reality talking.
	   True, grain production slumped as much as 45 percent this year.
But the biggest shortage was in forage wheat for livestock. Russian
farms, notoriously unproductive and unprofitable, have drastically
trimmed their livestock herds in recent years and have less need
for grain.
	   Elena Tyurina, marketing director for the Institute for Agrarian
Market Trends, said Russia has actually produced more grain for
human consumption than it needs.
	   Dairy production is up, and Russia continues to export large
quantities of the seeds used to make vegetable oil, she said.
	   On the other hand, meat production is down. And while Russia
exports the seeds, it doesn't produce enough actual vegetable oil
for its own needs and must rely on imports.
	   In fact, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov warned last
week that while Russia remains heavily dependent on food deliveries
from abroad, food imports have plunged 85 percent in the past two
months.
	   ``Such is the scale of the existing threat,'' he said.
	   The United States is not the only potential donor responding.
The European Community has been discussing the possibility of
supplying food aid this winter. The International Federation of the
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has launched a campaign to
feed 1.4 million Russians this winter in the 12 most distressed
regions.
	   U.S. officials were reluctant to discuss the reasoning behind
their decision to offer aid, although it would obviously benefit
American farmers and reduce unneeded U.S. surpluses.
	   Christopher Goldthwait, who led a U.S. delegation on food aid
and is general sales manager for the USDA's Foreign Agriculture
Service, called it a ``win-win situation'' for Russians and
American farmers.
	   Officials with both the EC and the Red Cross conceded that it
was not easy to determine whether the food is truly needed.
	   ``It is very difficult to make our own judgment,'' said Bertrand
Soret, a spokesman for the EC office in Moscow. ``We have to rely
on statistics provided by the Russian government.''
	   And despite the Red Cross' ambitious plans, Peter Kurlandsky,
the official in charge of its Russian winter aid program, conceded:
``We don't have any direct information about whether there will be
a dire food shortage in the country.''
	   As aid officials note, it is better to err on the side of
caution than face the consequences of widespread malnutrition and
starvation.
	   Last year, the Red Cross gave food to 800,000 Russians. ``In
some cases, I have no doubt, people would not have had food without
our food parcels,'' spokeswoman Caroline Hurley said.
	   In particular, she said, the Red Cross worries about people
getting too little protein, and hopes to lard its shipments with
plenty of canned meat and fish this winter.
	   Even if Russia has enough food, it has two large problems
preventing people from getting it: a poor distribution system that
may fail to reach the farthest flung parts of the world's largest
country, and the simple fact that many people lack the cash to buy
food.
	   ``In any famine, there tends to be enough food available,'' said
Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist who was among the architects of
Russia's transition to a market economy.
	   The problem, he said, is that people can't afford the food, or
can't get access to it. He suggested both factors are likely at
play in Russia this year. But, like most people, he stressed that
he doesn't really know whether there's a need for aid or not.
	   In a recent poll, 74 percent of Russians surveyed nationwide
said they were not worried about getting enough food this winter.
But 14 percent did feel threatened by hunger _ a small percentage,
but a lot of people.
	   Uncertainty, and an unwillingness to be tragically wrong, may
ultimately be the most persuasive reasons for the West offering _
and Russia accepting _ food aid.
	   ``It would be a sin to refuse humanitarian aid,'' observed Pavel
Yemelen, a member of the Russian parliament and spokesman for the
rural-based Agrarian faction.
	   Russian agriculture ``has reached the breaking point,'' he said.
``Now we are forced to stretch out our hands for assistance.''

French territory casts ballots in referendum toward independence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTIAN TORTEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) _ Amid social tension, New
Caledonians were choosing Sunday whether to accept a plan that in
two decades could lead this French Pacific territory to
independence.
	   Some 107,000 New Caledonians are being asked to decide whether
to accept a transition period of ``shared sovereignty'' for the
archipelago that is 20,000 kilometers (12,430 miles) from France.
	   If they agree to that, a new referendum will be held in 15-20
years to decide on total independence after 150 years as a French
Overseas Territory.
	   But apathy was the chief concern of the two sides -- the Rally
for Caledonia in the Republic -- the RPCR -- and the Kanak and
Socialist National Liberation Front -- the FLNKS, which led a
bloody struggle in the 1980s for independence.
	   There has been little evidence of interest in the referendum,
with low attendance at political meetings held over the past six
months.
	   The focus has been on social tension, due in part to the
plummeting price of nickel -- the main resource in New Caledonia,
which has an estimated 30 percent of the world's nickel reserve.
	   Tension has led to strikes. Angry dockers last week blocked the
Noumea port to press demands for improved indemnities as part of a
plan to let go workers. Workers from an adversary union countered,
threatening a general strike if access to the port was not assured.
	   Elsewhere, small-time miners, threatened by large mining groups
and diminishing incomes, blocked the main island road to press for
guarantees that would assure their survival.
	   Residents 18 and older are being asked if they approve the
Noumea Accord signed May 5 providing for the transition period
toward independence.
	   The accord, concluded between Paris, the FLNKS and the RPCR,
followed a decade of violence in the Pacific island marked by
fierce riots and political killings in the 1980s that stunned the
French and galvanized the search for a peaceful solution.
	   If accepted, the accords provide for a large transfer of powers
from Paris to Noumea during a transition period.
	   New Caledonia is about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) east of
Australia. Nearly half of the archipelago's population are native
Kanaks or Melanesians, and about one-third are of European origin.
The rest are from other parts of Polynesia.

Central Americans dig out from hurricane damage, wait for aid

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Central Americans battled to get
roads, water supplies and health care working again, to reach flood
victims and avoid the outbreak of diseases after the region was
battered by Hurricane Mitch.
	   Across flooded Central America, health authorities warned
Saturday that diseases such as malaria and cholera could spread in
the weeks to come.
	   Twenty-five cases of cholera have been reported in Guatemala,
the Public Health Ministry there reported Friday. The Guatemalan
government has increased water-treatment efforts to prevent the
disease from spreading.
	   International relief flights delivered the first water
purification machines and needed medicines.
	   ``We have supplies, but everything is going very slowly. The
situation is very serious and there is a lot of concern there could
be many more deaths,'' Tom Turley of the Connecticut-based aid
group Americares said Saturday.
	   Throughout Central America, the storm killed an estimated 10,000
people, 6,000 of them in Honduras. Turley said that many roads in
Honduras may not be passable for four to seven more days.
	   Until roads are re-established, aid workers will probably depend
largely on helicopter deliveries.
	   The United States plans to send 12 helicopters to join 20
already there, U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera said during a trip
to inspect storm damage and meet with Honduran President Carlos
Flores on Saturday.
	   He said U.S. soldiers have saved more than 700 lives in Honduras
in rescue missions, using helicopters to pluck some victims from
rising floodwaters.
	   ``From day one, the soldiers who have been stationed here were
out saving lives,'' he said.
	   U.S. military engineers arrived Saturday and more were on the
way to help repair roads and bridges, and 3,000 National Guardsmen
will be in the country between January and June for repair work,
Caldera said. U.S. forces also will help transport pipes into
Tegucigalpa to repair the water network, now running at 25 percent
capacity, Caldera said.
	   Over the long term, Caldera said, ``it is clear that rebuilding
Honduras and ... these countries of Central America is going to
require a sustained effort.''
	   Caldera announced the additional aid before flying to Guatemala
and Nicaragua to evaluate storm damage and relief efforts in those
countries. An estimated 4,000 died in flooding and mudslides in
Nicaragua, and hundreds more died in Guatemala and El Salvador.
	   United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced that top
U.N. officials will begin a tour of the disaster area aimed at
assessing relief needs starting Nov. 9.
	   Former President Carter visited Nicaragua on Friday, and former
President Bush was due to visit Honduras on Sunday. Carter took a
flight over Nicaragua's disaster zone, warning that ``the worst is
yet to come _ cholera and dengue.''
	   Already strained to near-capacity, Tegucigalpa hospitals expect
a swarm of storm-related patients as the government patches up
roads. Workers hastily constructed a temporary connection between
the capital and San Pedro Sula to the north, allowing the first
shipments of gasoline to Tegucigalpa.
	   In the south, three children contracted hemorrhagic dengue, and
one died, said Elliethe Giron, a government vice minister.
Thousands of respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia, have been
reported, while 17 cases of hepatitis A occurred in the northern
town of Pena Blanca, she said.
	   Giron urged residents to stay clear of muddy rivers that may
carry human and animal remains and to filter, chlorinate and boil
water before drinking it.
	   Still, many in Tegucigalpa _ where water service has been
severely disrupted _ failed to heed the warnings, washing clothes
or salvaging possessions in mud-ridden rivers or drinking untreated
water.
	   Dozens of taxi drivers took a break from shoveling tons of
debris at Tegucigalpa's devastated Comayaguela market district to
line up for tetanus and malaria shots Saturday. Army troops stood
watch nearby, wearing face masks to ward off the stench exuded by
blocks of muck and garbage, where it was feared more bodies were
still buried.
	   ``They say there likely are more people in there,'' said
Felicito Sorido, 51, who with hundreds of fellow drivers
volunteered for the massive cleanup in hopes of reaching their cabs
buried several blocks away.
	   Juanita Aleman, 30, a Health Ministry nurse, filled syringes,
rolled up the drivers' sleeves and administered shots from a small
desk on a dusty sidewalk.
	   ``The military first asked for these shots for their soldiers,''
she said. ``Now the taxi drivers. Aside from conjunctivitis,
there's no epidemic yet but we expect it to come.''

	   LOS OLVIDOS, Honduras (AP) _ Even as she lay in her mud-stained
coffin, Kayli Rakel Puerto looked like a doll with her chubby
cheeks and frilly white dress. Her mother hesitantly placed a teddy
bear by the child's feet and her aunt closed the lids of her eyes.
	   Seven-month-old Kayli became one more victim of Hurricane Mitch
last week. Although she died a week after the storm passed and days
after floodwaters receded, the hurricane was responsible for her
death, just as surely as if she'd been swept into a river or washed
into the sea.
	   With hunger, dehydration and disease, Hurricane Mitch continues
to kill in Honduras, pushing the death toll in the region well past
10,000.
	   Many villagers are desperate for food, water and medicine, but
with roads and bridges shattered, helicopters are often the only
way to get aid to them. Despite help from the United States and
other nations, there simply aren't enough helicopters or aviation
fuel to go around.
	   In Kayli's case, she survived three days without food or water,
separated from her mother as villagers scrambled onto roofs and
trees to escape rapidly rising floodwaters in the Aguan River
valley, one of Honduras' worst-hit regions. On the fourth day, she
was reunited with her mother and breast fed, but she still became
ill.
	   After two days of coughing and diarrhea, she died. There was no
hope of getting her to a hospital _ floods wiped out the road.
Nobody could call for help _ the phone lines were down.
	   Now the 700 villagers in Los Olvidos _ which, roughly
translated, means forgotten or neglected _ worry that more children
will die if they don't get help soon.
	   ``More than anything, water is needed here,'' said one resident,
Juan Ramon Gutierrez.
	   Desperate villagers are boiling water left standing after the
flood and are eating bananas off plants washed into town with other
flood debris, Gutierrez said. The risk of contamination is high.
	   They wait for a helicopter to bring aid, but so far, none has
arrived.
	   ``There's nothing, nothing. Not even a pound of butter,'' said
Amanda Martinez, whose 7-month old child was suffering from
diarrhea.
	   Some residents blame the U.S. fruit company Dole, which owns
much of the town and employs many of the residents, for not helping
them.
	   Dole has rescued villagers and delivered aid. But like the
government, it is overwhelmed.
	   ``We have one helicopter to attend to 20,000 people,'' said
Elias Lizardo, head of Dole's medical operations in the area.
	   The devastation in Los Olvidos is painfully similar to that in
other communities in the Aguan River valley. Mud covers houses at
least halfway up the front door, and in some cases covers almost
the entire house.
	   Families sleep on the roof or in second-floor bedrooms. They
enter through a second-floor window without needing a ladder.
Mattresses, furniture and clothing are left outdoors in the hope
that they can be used after they dry.
	   Walking across the street is often a challenge. The mud is so
thick, it is difficult to take more than a step or two without
sinking knee deep.
	   As he tried to clean up around his house, the local pastor,
Cecilio Escobar Gallindo, looked around the village.
	   ``All this here _ before the tragedy _ was rather beautiful,
really lovely,'' he said. ``It had a wide, panoramic view. And for
the children and everyone it was peaceful. Everything was pretty.''

Local Mexican elections viewed as test of major party strength

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Local elections in three Mexican states
Sunday are viewed as an important barometer of the strength of the
country's three major political parties ahead of the 2000
presidential elections.
	   The race for governor in the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa
appears too close to call between the candidates of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, and the
conservative National Action Party.
	   The PRI _ which has held the presidency and most statehouses for
69 years, and which has won five of seven gubernatorial elections
so far this year _ appears likely to hold on to a key governorship
in central Puebla state.
	   And the left-center Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, appears
to have a chance of gaining its second governorship in the small
central state of Tlaxcala.
	   ``These elections will reflect on an important battle still to
be fought among presidential candidates,'' columnist Salvador
Garcia Soto wrote in the newspaper La Cronica on Saturday.
	   Sinaloa is the most closely watched of the three races, and the
most hotly contested. The state is plagued by drug-trafficking and
high unemployment that has forced many residents to move _ some to
the United States _ in search of jobs.
	   The PRI hopes internal reforms like the primary elections used
to choose candidate Juan S. Millan will keep Sinaloa's 1.44 million
voters loyal to the party. Prior to this year, the PRI chose such
candidates in back-room deals at state assemblies.
	   Millan has built his campaign on stronger anti-drug efforts.
	   Many of the leaders of Mexico's largest drug cartels were born
or lived in Sinaloa, including deceased drug lord Amado Carrillo
Fuentes and the Arrellano Felix brothers, now reputedly the
country's top traffickers.
	   National Action candidate Emilio Goicochea has focused on
discontent with the state's continuing problems of low economic
growth, crime and drugs.
	   Everyone agrees the state's image needs a boost.
	   ``To guarantee jobs, investment, and education, we must change
the state's image as soon as possible, there's no other way. We
can't allow for the name of Sinaloa to be immediately associated
with drug trafficking,'' Millan said recently.
	   The political fortunes of three men widely seen as potential
presidential candidates in 2000 could be affected by the results of
the state races, which also include elections for the local
legislature and mayorships in the central state of Michoacan.
	   The three states with governorship races will also vote for
local legislatures and mayorships.
	   Old guard Gov. Manuel Bartlett could see his presidential
prospects boosted by a PRI victory in Puebla, whose governorship he
will be leaving after the elections.
	   Interior Minister Francisco Labastida, also of PRI, could be
helped by a ruling-party victory in his home state of Sinaloa. And
Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas would get a boost from PRD
victories in Tlaxcala or Michoacan, a state he once governed.

Minchin urges staying on trade timetable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Industry Minister Nick Minchin has
urged Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) partners to stay on
course to abolish regional trade barriers by 2010.
	   ``International free trade is the greatest way to enhance the
prosperity, not only of Australians, but of people all over the
world and that's got to be in our interests,'' Minchin told
Australian television Sunday.
	   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer met his Japanese counterpart
Masahiko Komura in Canberra last week ahead of the APEC group
meeting in Malaysia this week and next, but failed to persuade
Japan to reduce trade barriers on forestry and fisheries.
	   Australia is worried that Japan's stand could prompt other
leaders to seek exemptions for sensitive sectors of their
economies, wrecking the momentum for free trade.
	   Minchin said Australia would be pressing at the meeting for
maintaining the free trade timetable.
	   ``Obviously, some of the Asian economies have been saying
they're not so sure they want to move at quite that pace,'' Minchin
said. ``No-one's saying go backwards. Some are worried about the
pace of reform. But it's our task to go in and argue as strongly as
we can for maintaining those objectives because that really is in
the interests of the whole of the Asian community.''

French territory casts ballots in referendum toward independence

	   NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) _ Amid social tension, New
Caledonians were choosing Sunday whether to accept a plan that in
two decades could lead this French Pacific territory to
independence.
	   Some 107,000 New Caledonians are being asked to decide whether
to accept a transition period of ``shared sovereignty'' for the
archipelago that is 20,000 kilometers (12,430 miles) from France.
	   If they agree to that, a new referendum will be held in 15-20
years to decide on total independence after 150 years as a French
Overseas Territory.
	   But apathy was the chief concern of the two sides -- the Rally
for Caledonia in the Republic -- the RPCR -- and the Kanak and
Socialist National Liberation Front -- the FLNKS, which led a
bloody struggle in the 1980s for independence.
	   There has been little evidence of interest in the referendum,
with low attendance at political meetings held over the past six
months.
	   The focus has been on social tension, due in part to the
plummeting price of nickel -- the main resource in New Caledonia,
which has an estimated 30 percent of the world's nickel reserve.
	   Tension has led to strikes. Angry dockers last week blocked the
Noumea port to press demands for improved indemnities as part of a
plan to let go workers. Workers from an adversary union countered,
threatening a general strike if access to the port was not assured.
	   Elsewhere, small-time miners, threatened by large mining groups
and diminishing incomes, blocked the main island road to press for
guarantees that would assure their survival.
	   Residents 18 and older are being asked if they approve the
Noumea Accord signed May 5 providing for the transition period
toward independence.
	   The accord, concluded between Paris, the FLNKS and the RPCR,
followed a decade of violence in the Pacific island marked by
fierce riots and political killings in the 1980s that stunned the
French and galvanized the search for a peaceful solution.
	   If accepted, the accords provide for a large transfer of powers
from Paris to Noumea during a transition period.
	   New Caledonia is about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) east of
Australia. Nearly half of the archipelago's population are native
Kanaks or Melanesians, and about one-third are of European origin.
The rest are from other parts of Polynesia.

Top-ranked Ohio State upset by Michigan State in U.S. college

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Once again, a team from Michigan ruined
Ohio State's perfect record. This time, though, the spoiler wasn't
the Michigan Wolverines.
	   Julian Peterson forced three fumbles and Renaldo Hill
intercepted Joe Germaine's pass at the goal line with 1:12 left as
Michigan State shocked the top-ranked Buckeyes 28-24 in U.S.
college football action Saturday.
	   Ohio State (8-1, 5-1 Big Ten), which was No. 1 in both major
polls and the Bowl Championship Series standings, was undefeated in
1995 and 1996 before losing its final regular-season game to
Michigan.
	   This one was even more shocking.
	   Michigan State was a four-touchdown underdog playing on the road
against a team that had won all its games by at least 17 points.
	   The Spartans also trailed 24-9 early in the third quarter after
Ohio State's Damon Moore picked off Bill Burke's pass and returned
it 73 yards for a touchdown.
	   The Spartans rallied to a 25-24 lead on Sedrick Irvin's 3-yard
TD run early in the fourth quarter, then padded the margin on Paul
Edinger's fifth field goal of the game with 9:26 left.
	   Ohio State drove to the Michigan State 15 in the closing
minutes, but three straight incompletions left the Buckeyes facing
a fourth down. Under pressure from a blitz, Germaine lobbed the
ball to the left corner, but it was underthrown and Hill picked it
off.
	   It was the first time an unranked team beat No. 1 since Michigan
State upset Michigan 28-27 in 1990.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was No. 2 Tennessee 37,
Alabama-Birmingham 13; No. 4 Kansas State 49, Baylor 6; No. 5

	    &UR; No. 6 Florida St. 45, No. 12 Virginia 14 &QC; 
	   At Tallahassee, Florida, Dexter Jackson made two of Florida
State's four interceptions that set up touchdowns as the Seminoles

Devils subdue the Panthers 4-3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUNRISE, Florida (AP) _ Jay Pandolfo deflected in the winning
goal with 9:11 left in the third period to lift the Devils to a 4-3
victory over the Florida Panthers, extending New Jersey's road and
overall winning streak to four games in the North American National
Hockey League.
	   In a wide-open game Saturday afternoon between two
defensive-minded teams, Brian Rolston's shot from the blue line was
deflected by Pandolfo past Panthers goaltender Sean Burke at 10:49
of the third for his third goal of the season.
	   Scott Mellanby scored a goal and an assist for Florida. The
Panthers almost tied the game in the final minute, but Martin
Brodeur made a lightning-quick glove save on Mark Parrish's
point-blank shot.
 &UR; Bruins 0, Penguins 0 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Boston's Byron Dafoe stopped 26 shots and
Pittsburgh rookie Jean-Sebastian Aubin earned his first NHL
shutout.
	   Aubin, making his third career start, stopped 18 shots. The
Bruins had two power play opportunities in the game's first 10
minutes but generated just one shot on goal in those two chances.
	   Dafoe has three shutouts in 11 games this season and nine for
his career as the Bruins played their first scoreless tie on the
road since March 11, 1970 at Chicago.
 &UR; Sabres 2, Flyers 2 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Dominik Hasek turned away 34 shots and Geoff
Sanderson and Brian Holzinger scored second-period goals, extending
Buffalo's unbeaten streak to five games.
	   Hasek was spectacular in the third period when the Flyers
outshot the Sabres 12-2. In the final four minutes of regulation,
he stopped six Philadelphia chances including successive shots by
John LeClair, Rod Brind'Amour and Eric Lindros on a power play and
raised his record overall to 6-3-2 on the season.
	   Brind'Amour and LeClair scored for the Flyers, who are winless
in their last five (0-4-1).

Central Americans dig out from hurricane damage, wait for aid

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Central Americans battled to get
roads, water supplies and health care working again, to reach flood
victims and avoid the outbreak of diseases after the region was
battered by Hurricane Mitch.
	   Across flooded Central America, health authorities warned
Saturday that diseases such as malaria and cholera could spread in
the weeks to come.
	   Twenty-five cases of cholera have been reported in Guatemala,
the Public Health Ministry there reported Friday. The Guatemalan
government has increased water-treatment efforts to prevent the
disease from spreading.
	   International relief flights delivered the first water
purification machines and needed medicines.
	   ``We have supplies, but everything is going very slowly. The
situation is very serious and there is a lot of concern there could
be many more deaths,'' Tom Turley of the Connecticut-based aid
group Americares said Saturday.
	   The first shipments of dlrs 20 million in food being sent by the
U.S. Agency for International Development arrived aboard three
cargo jets in Tegucigalpa Saturday evening.
	   ``We wanted to send a signal that the United States is committed
to helping the people down there,'' said Hugh Parmer, head of
disaster relief for the agency, who rode on one flight. ``This is a
fairly dramatic signal.''
	   Throughout Central America, the storm killed an estimated 10,000
people, 6,000 of them in Honduras. Turley said that many roads in
Honduras may not be passable for four to seven more days.
	   Until roads are reestablished, aid workers will probably depend
largely on helicopter deliveries.
	   The United States plans to send 12 helicopters to join 20
already there, U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera said during a trip
to inspect storm damage and meet with Honduran President Carlos
Flores on Saturday.
	   He said U.S. soldiers have saved more than 700 lives in Honduras
in rescue missions, using helicopters to pluck some victims from
rising floodwaters.
	   ``From day one, the soldiers who have been stationed here were
out saving lives,'' he said.
	   U.S. military engineers arrived Saturday and more were on the
way to help repair roads and bridges, and 3,000 National Guardsmen
will be in the country between January and June for repair work,
Caldera said. U.S. forces also will help transport pipes into
Tegucigalpa to repair the water network, now running at 25 percent
capacity, Caldera said.
	   Over the long term, Caldera said, ``it is clear that rebuilding
Honduras and ... these countries of Central America is going to
require a sustained effort.''
	   Caldera announced the additional aid before flying to Guatemala
and Nicaragua to evaluate storm damage and relief efforts in those
countries. An estimated 4,000 died in flooding and mudslides in
Nicaragua, and hundreds more died in Guatemala and El Salvador.
	   United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced that top
U.N. officials will begin a tour of the disaster area aimed at
assessing relief needs starting Nov. 9.
	   The dlrs 20 million worth of food aid from the U.S. AID agency
brings the American government's total relief package to dlrs 70
million.
	   Eight air shipments arriving over the weekend were to carry 300
tons of canola oil, rice, beans, soy meal and other food. The 13.5
tons of rice alone could feed 1,000 people for a month, Parmer
said.
	   A quarter of the agency's food aid package will be delivered by
air over the coming week and the rest sent on a freighter ship,
Parmer said.
	   Former President Carter visited Nicaragua on Friday, and former
President Bush was due to visit Honduras on Sunday. Carter took a
flight over Nicaragua's disaster zone, warning that ``the worst is
yet to come _ cholera and dengue.''
	   Already strained to near-capacity, Tegucigalpa hospitals expect
a swarm of storm-related patients as the government patches up
roads. Workers hastily constructed a temporary connection between
the capital and San Pedro Sula to the north, allowing the first
shipments of gasoline to Tegucigalpa.
	   In the south, three children contracted hemorrhagic dengue, and
one died, said Elliethe Giron, a government vice minister.
Thousands of respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia, have been
reported, while 17 cases of hepatitis A occurred in the northern
town of Pena Blanca, she said.
	   Giron urged residents to stay clear of muddy rivers that may
carry human and animal remains and to filter, chlorinate and boil
water before drinking it.
	   Still, many in Tegucigalpa _ where water service has been
severely disrupted _ failed to heed the warnings, washing clothes
or salvaging possessions in mud-ridden rivers or drinking untreated
water.
	   Dozens of taxi drivers took a break from shoveling tons of
debris at Tegucigalpa's devastated Comayaguela market district to
line up for tetanus and malaria shots Saturday. Army troops stood
watch nearby, wearing face masks to ward off the stench exuded by
blocks of muck and garbage, where it was feared more bodies were
still buried.
	   ``They say there likely are more people in there,'' said
Felicito Sorido, 51, who with hundreds of fellow drivers
volunteered for the massive cleanup in hopes of reaching their cabs
buried several blocks away.
	   Juanita Aleman, 30, a Health Ministry nurse, filled syringes,
rolled up the drivers' sleeves and administered shots from a small
desk on a dusty sidewalk.
	   ``The military first asked for these shots for their soldiers,''
she said. ``Now the taxi drivers. Aside from conjunctivitis,
there's no epidemic yet but we expect it to come.''

UN chief to pay personal visit to disputed Western Sahara
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABDELHAKIM YAMANI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAAYOUNE, Western Sahara (AP) _ Kofi Annan's trip Sunday to the
Western Sahara gives the U.N. general-secretary a firsthand view of
the U.N. mission that has been pushing for seven years to resolve a
once-bloody territorial dispute with a referendum.
	   Annan's tour also includes stops in Morocco, Mauritania and
Algeria, each of them countries that are directly or indirectly
concerned by the quarter-century-long dispute, which at one point
almost led to war between Morocco and Algeria.
	   The high-level trip here could serve as a leveler in a
highly-charged dispute over the future of the mineral-rich desert
territory claimed by Morocco since 1975, when Spain abandoned it.
	   For years, Morocco battled the Polisario Front, seeking
independence for the Western Sahara. Algeria long openly backed the
Polisario, and still harbors Polisario refugees in camps in the
south.
	   A U.N. proposal to decide the territory's future by referendum
was accepted by both sides in 1991, but critical differences over
how to identify those eligible to take part in the referendum have
brought the process to a halt countless times.
	   Former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker was called in as
mediator to unblock the impasse.
	   Annan last month suggested the referendum, originally set for
December, be held in December 1999.
	   A U.N. military observer team here, known as Minursa, is
identifying those eligible to vote.
	   ``The identification process is extremely technical,'' said
Minursa spokeswoman Patricia Tome. ``At each step of the process,
the two parties must cooperate fully with the U.N. plan.''
	   To date, 147,249 people have been declared eligible to take part
in the referendum. But another 65,000 are contested.
	   Annan's visit here comes two days after Morocco celebrated the
23rd anniversary of its so-called Green March on the Western Sahara
when, in 1975, tens of thousands of Moroccans marched into the
territory and began developing an infrastructure.
	   The Moroccan monarch, marking the occasion in a speech Friday
night, blamed the numerous delays in organizing the referendum on
``the maneuvers of our adversaries.''
	   But the king added that Morocco, like Kofi Annan, is ``armed
with patience.'' Annan is to meet Hassan in Marrakech on Monday.
	   The last visit to the Western Sahara by a U.N. chief was by
Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in November 1994.

Liashenko continues comeback with gold medal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMLOOPS, British Columbia (AP) _ Elena Liashenko, who has been
erratic in recent world championships, won the Sun Life Skate
Canada International women's event Saturday.
	   The 22-year-old Ukrainian continued her comeback with the gold
medal and top prize of dlrs 30,000.
	   Fumie Suguri of Japan was second and top-seeded Irina Slutskaya
of Russia was third.
	   Liashenko was pegged by some as a future world champion after
placing sixth in her first world championships in 1994. That was to
be her best finish, however, as she was ninth in 1995, 12th in
1996, failed to qualify in 1997 and the finished a solid seventh
this year.
	   The Skate Canada is the second international win of her career.
	   ``I was hoping to win here,'' Liashenko said through an
interpreter. ``I really wanted to win this time.''
	   In the short program Friday, Suguri was first, Liashenko second
and Slutskaya third. With the free skating worth two-thirds of the
total mark, any of the top three could have finished first overall
by winning the free skate.
	   Suguri landed five triple jumps and stepped out of two others.
Her technical marks ranged from 5.3 to 5.7 out of the possible 6.0,
and her artistic marks were 5.5s and 5.6s.
	   Liashenko followed and also landed five triples, doubling out on
two others. Six of the nine judges had Liashenko first and Suguri
second.
	   ``I started training earlier this season because I wanted to
skate at a meet in Oberstdorf in September,'' she said.
	   A groin injury ruined that plan, and the injury healed in plenty
of time for Skate Canada.
	   ``It was one of the best,'' she said when asked how she would
rank Saturday's performance.
	   Slutskaya skated last and the title was hers for the taking, but
she could land only four triple jumps cleanly.
	   ``I was not ready for this competition,'' she said. ``It is the
first meet for me this season and I need more practice.''

Hong Kong gang boss could set record for netting largest ransom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A reputed Hong Kong mobster and his gang
members, who are awaiting verdicts on charges of kidnapping, murder
and arms smuggling, could make the Guinness Book of Records for
netting the largest-ever ransom, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   ``Big Spender'' Cheung Tze-keung and his gang allegedly received
a total of 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in
ransom after kidnapping two wealthy Hong Kong businessmen.
	   That would surpass a U.S. dlrs 34.3 million ransom in 1975 paid
to a guerrilla group in Argentina, the Sunday Morning Post said.
	   Cheung alone could break the record with his share of the ransom
allegedly totaling 660 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 84.6
million).
	   The gang members were tried behind closed-doors across the
border in southern China, where they were arrested and reportedly
plotted most of the crimes. They are awaiting verdicts on charges
that could carry the death penalty.
	   Their lawyers want the case transfered to Hong Kong, which has
no death penalty and has an open court system.

Government closes beaches hit by red tide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Six popular beaches were closed Sunday due to a
massive attack of oxygen-zapping algae in Hong Kong waters, seven
months after it wiped out large stocks of fish.
	   The water at the territory's southern coast has appeared reddish
in recent days because of the spreading algae, or red tide, which
depletes the water of oxygen.
	   A government spokesman said the type found in recent days is not
toxic and is not harmful to humans or marine life, and is expected
to subside in a few days.
	   The closed beaches include the famous Repulse Bay and Stanley
beach.
	   In March, an invasion of toxic red tides killed 1,400 tons of
fish, resulting in losses of 80 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs. 10.2 million).
