<HEADLINE> Fewer New Products for 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of new products
reaching U.S. supermarkets, pharmacies and health food stores last
year decreased by 13 percent, compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the trade magazine New Product
News, it is the largest year-to-year drop since the magazine began
tracking new-product introductions -- from beverages to pet foods
-- 23 years ago.
</P>
<P>
New food products took the biggest hit -- down 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The magazine attributed the decrease to companies' downsizing
and focusing on core brands. After a record 22,572 new product
introduced in 1995, the number went down to 19,572 last year,
according to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
When some food companies merged each other, the new owner would
try to figure out which products are worth keeping. And they
concentrate more on cost cutting, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Some companies, such as the cereal maker of General Mills, put
their focus on a small range of "new blockbusters" instead of lots
of new products, it said.

<HEADLINE> (Correction) Garments, Textile Spinning Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's garments and textile
spinning exports increased by 16 and four percent respectively in
1996 compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
The garments exports recorded 211,000 U.S. Dollars in the
first 11 months of 1996, up from 181,000 Dollars in 1995,
according to the lastest data from the Export Board of Zambia
(EBZ).
</P>
<P>
The textile spinning sector in the same period brought in 37.2
million Dollars, compared to the previous year's 35.9 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The boom is due to the development of free market economy in
the southern African country, which succeeds in stirring
competition, EBZ Director Mwansa Musonda said.
</P>
<P>
Reinvestment in Zambia's textile sector was estimated to hit a
record high of no less than 40 million Dollars by the end of
1996, predicting a more significant hike in 1997, the local press
said.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Output Falls 0.5 Percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturing output in Britain
fell 0.5 percent unexpectedly in November compared with October,
giving a year-on-year rise of 0.2 percent, according to figures
released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Friday.
</P>
<P>
This follows a rise of 0.5 percent in October and also a 0.5
percent rise in the year to October.
</P>
<P>
The figures were against economists' expectations of an
increase of 0.3 percent monthly and a 0.9 percent rise annually.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production rose by 0.4 percent in November following
a stagnant October, taking the annual increase to 1.3 percent
after a rise of 1.4 percent in the year to October.
</P>
<P>
The rapid rise in the value of sterling is blamed by some
analysts for the surprise fall in manufacturing output.
</P>
<P>
"It may well be that the appreciation in sterling is having an
impact on manufacturing output much earlier than most of had been
expecting," said one economist.
</P>
<P>
However, Treasury officials said that monthly figures could be
erratic and the underlying trend in manufacturing and industrial
output was upward.

<HEADLINE> More Companies Liquidated in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Despite Zimbabwe's improved
economic performance in 1996, 73 companies were liquidated due to
mismanagement and lack of accounting skills, a national commercial
debt collector said here today.
</P>
<P>
Dun and Bradstreet Ltd Managing Director Fernando Alexio said 63
companies were liquidated in Harare and 10 in Bulawayo, the country's
second largest city.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the book-keeping part is very important if companies
are going to continue being viable. Having 73 companies go down in
one year is too much.''
</P>
<P>
An encouraging development, he said, was that a number of
companies had tightened credit control regulations to improve on debt
collection techniques.
</P>
<P>
He added, it was disappointing that small companies continued
to ignore this aspect.
</P>
<P>
''If small companies are properly trained and managed,'' he said,
''we would not be having the problems we are experiencing today.''

<HEADLINE> US Unemployment Rate Steady at 5.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate held
steady at 5.3 percent in December, the U.S. Labor Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department also revised down the U.S. jobless rate in
November to 5.3 percent from the 5.4 percent announced a month
earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to the revised figures, the unemployment rate in U.S.
hit a seven-year low of 5.2 in August and remained at that level
through October, before edging up to 5.3 percent in November and
December.
</P>
<P>
It reported that the businesses added 262,000 workers to their
payrolls in last December.
</P>
<P>
The employment in the U.S. grew by 2.6 million in the whole
year of 1996, the best showing since a gain of 3.8 million jobs in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The December's increase in payroll jobs, which was led by a
surge in employment in service industries, was the largest
one-month increase since August.
</P>
<P>
Service jobs increased by 112,000 workers in the month, the
strongest advance in this sector since last May.
</P>
<P>
Factory employment rose by a strong 19,000 in December, led by
strength at aircraft plants but with widespread gains in a number
of industries.
</P>
<P>
Employment in construction industries was up by 23,000.
</P>
<P>
U.S. analysts said that the report provided further evidence
that the economy ended 1996 at a faster clip than they had
expected.
</P>
<P>
The overall U.S. economy, as measured by the gross domestic
product, slowed dramatically in the July-September quarter to 2.1
percent after an quick expansion of 4.7 percent in the second
quarter.

Athens, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Greek municipal workers continued
their strike for the fourth day today by marching through downtown
Athens to press their demands for financial and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
Their main demands are that the employment contracts of workers
hired by the municipalities on a temporary basis should be
converted to indefinite duration, a doubling of the lump sum
payment given on retirement from the present 1,300,000 drachmas
(about 5,600 U.S. dollars) and the lowering of the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the striking workers met with Interior, Public
Administration and Decentralization Undersecretary Lambros
Papadimas, who acknowledged that their demand for a conversion of
seasonal contracts to ones of indefinite duration was just but
said he could do nothing before all the political parties in
parliament reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The workers later announced that they would continue their
strike until their demands have been met.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Accused of Beef Blackmail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government has been
accused of consistent "negligence" over mad cow disease and
attempting to "blackmail" Europe into lifting the ban on British
beef exports, according to a report of the European parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the report due to be published later this month, a
cross-party committee of the European parliament charges the
British government with bad faith in handling the beef crisis,
according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The 18-member committee has been taking evidence about the BSE
or mad cow disease over the past four months and has made it no
secret that its report will be critical of Britain's blocking
strategy in handling the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The report alleges that London's attempt to force a lifting of
the beef embargo last summer by refusing to co-operate in European
Union (EU) affairs was "an abuse of its rights and blackmailing of
community institutions."
</P>
<P>
"The problem does not reside in the lack of appropriate
legislative measures, but in the attitude of the Government, which
has not guaranteed their correct application or carried out the
necessary checks," it says.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the critical report, British Agriculture Minister
Douglas Hogg, who is accused by the report of refusing to give
evidence on the issue, was quoted as saying earlier today that "I
am not prepared to to comment until the UK has formally received
it (the report)."
</P>
<P>
However, some media reports said that the British government
was privately scornful of the draft report, hoping that the final
version of the report would be watered down.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a global ban on British beef exports last March
when the British government admitted possible links between BSE
and its human equivalent Creudzfelt-Jacob Disease.

ADDIS ABABA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Airlines said
here today that it has plans to import modern passenger aircraft
which will enable it compete successfully in the fast growing
international market.
</P>
<P>
Kinfe Kahsay, Manager of the Fleet and Equipment Planning
Division of the airlines told reporters that in accordance
with its five-year market forecast, it will buy modern passenger
planes as part of its modernization scheme now underway.
</P>
<P>
Kinfe said, it will also lease two 234-seat passenger planes
in the coming six months.
</P>
<P>
He said the airlines has also a plan to add to its fleet big
aircraft which can accomodate simultaneously many passengers and
a large quantity of cargo as the capacity of the existing Boeing
757 aircraft is low.
</P>
<P>
He said, a study is also underway to open new routes to Asia,
Europe, Africa and the United States in the coming three years,
adding that the airlines will start flights to Lusaka, Tel Aviv
and Paris in the current and next year.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Airlines, founded in 1946, is one of Africa's
longest-established airlines. It serves a total of 44 international
and 39 domestic destinations with its fleet of more than 50 aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Private Business Schools Flourish in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Private business schools
flourish in Ukraine as more and more young people, seeking
high-paying jobs during the country's transition to a market economy,
became wary of overcrowded state-owned institutions.
</P>
<P>
There were 127 private schools offering business programs by the
end of 1996, although only six guaranteed to issue
nationally recognized diplomas to every graduate, and could therefore
operate according to the Ukrainian law.
</P>
<P>
But people seemed to care less about that, and
the costs ranging from 2,000 dollars to 7,000 dollars,
than about the contest for a space in state-owned institutions
among five to seven applicants.
</P>
<P>
Yelena Taran, a student at the private Economics and
Management and Managerial Law Institute, said her parents preferred
to pay 7,000 U.S. dollars for five years of study at the institute of
Economics Department rather than a 4000-dollar bribe to study
in a similar department at a state university.
</P>
<P>
"In my institute we seriously study foreign languages and are
able to get experience abroad."
</P>
<P>
"The money from the budget is barely enough to survive as we
are, let alone increase the number of students," Vitaly Babak,
deputy education minister, said on Friday. "As a result, many
young people choose private business schools."
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the level of professionalism in the private
schools was low.
</P>
<P>
Liubov Bohynia, deputy director of the Kiev Economic Management
Institute, retorted,"Our professors have had teaching students
abroad and they are very familiar with the western standard in
management."
</P>
<P>
But the Education Ministry did not welcome the trend to copy
international standards, citing concerns about losing Ukraine's
traditions.
</P>
<P>
"Western economic experts don't fully understand our
difficulties during the transitional period," Babak said.

<HEADLINE> Four-Year Trade Secret Feud between G.M,VW Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The four-year-long trade
secret feud between the General Motors Corporation of the United
States and Volkswagen of Germany, two of the world's largest
companies, have been settled with Volkswagen agreeing on Thursday
to pay 100 million U.S. dollars to the General Motors Corporation.
</P>
<P>
In the settlement, one of the largest in a corporate espionage
case, Volkswagen also agreed to buy at least one billion U.S.
dollars worth of auto parts from the General Motors Corporation
during the next seven years, according to a report of the New York
Times today.
</P>
<P>
Both companies agreed to drop their civil suits against each
other. But VW did not admit any wrongdoing, only "acknowledges the
possibility that illegal activities" by some executives who
defected from G.M. to VW may have occurred.
</P>
<P>
On-again off-again settlement talks had been held during last
several months, but hard-line remarks by G.M. executives in
Europe, as well as VW's refusal to issue an outright apology,
fueled tensions between the two companies. The settlement talks
began in earnest on Monday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The central figure in the case is Jose Ignacto Lopez de
Arriotua, a Spaniard who specialized in one of the most mundane

members engaged in in a conspiracy with Lopez, and planned to file
countersuit, accusing G.M. of defamation.

<HEADLINE> 6 to 7 Percent Growth Rate Forecast in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's economy is expected
to grow by six to seven percent in 1997, according to a forecast
made by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
This would be one of the best economic performances since
Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, the bank's resident
representative in Zimbabwe, David Cook, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that agriculture and tourism are expected to
contribute to the growth.
</P>
<P>
"We have had an excellent start in the rainy season. And if
this continues and we have a normal season, then there are good
prospects for the high growth of 1996 to continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate reached nearly eight percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Cook said in 1996, it was evident that Zimbabwe had benefited
from the revival of the agricultural sector where production was
estimated to have risen by 40 percent following unusually heavy
rains during 1995/1996.
</P>
<P>
Key performers in the agricultural sector were the
horticulture and tobacco, which were estimated to have earned 800
million U.S. Dollars of foreign currency for the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
And tourism, one of the fastest growing industries in
Zimbabwe, also benefited from increased international arrivals,
earning over 130 million U.S. Dollars for the country.
</P>
<P>
"Another positive factor in favor of the Zimbabwean economy is
the fall in inflation, which reached 14 percent in November 1996
on a year-on-year basis. This was in turn due to the fall in food
prices," said Cook.
</P>
<P>
"Interest rates are coming down, and investment is beginning
to pick up. Therefore, so far the economic performance has been
the best in the post-independence era," said Cook.
</P>
<P>
He said it was important to sustain the economic growth by
ensuring that the macro-economic environment is kept stable
through further reductions in government spending.
</P>
<P>
"I think the challenge is to sustain the high growth rates in
the future. That means we have to bring the problem of the fiscal
deficit under control, which in turn will ensure lower inflation
and interest rates, and further increase in investment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Expected to Build Market Economy With Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Delegates at a preparatory
meeting for the third donor conference for Bosnia which ended here
today agreed that Bosnia should begin to transit from post-war
recovery to construction of a modern market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the two-day meeting stressed that the emphasis
of assistance for Bosnia should gradually be shifted from aid for
reconstruction to support for economic reforms to facilitate
Bosnia's self-sustaining growth.
</P>
<P>
"We need to work together to ensure that Bosnia and Herzegovina
moves from reconstruction to a macroeconomic framework worthy of a
modern European state in transition to a market economy," said
Francois Lamoureux, deputy director general with responsibility
for Bosnia at the European Commission (EC).
</P>
<P>
The delegates including officials from more than 50 countries
and 30 international organizations also underlined the need to
continue the emergency recovery program started in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the third donor conference for Bosnia
scheduled to be held in Brussels early March will appeal for
donation of 1.4 billion U.S. dollars for 1997.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto hoped that
ASEAN-Japan relations would be expanded in facing with the
challenges in the 21th century, a Japanese official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a news briefing, a Japanese spokesman
accompanying Hashimoto on a three-day visit to Indonesia said the
two leaders had wide-ranging talks this morning on bilateral,
regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, he said, President Soeharto expressed his
appreciation of Japan's support to the members of Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in various forms, especially in
the economic field.
</P>
<P>
Japan agreed to strengthen cooperation with ASEAN countries in
trade and investment and it will join ASEAN's environmental
protection programs, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also hoped to intensify cooperation between ASEAN
and Japan at regional and international forums, such as within the
World Trade Organization, the ASEAN Free Trade Area and the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, the two leaders also discussed the situation
and new developments in Asia. They held that Asian countries,
especially the developing countries, will face new challenges on
the eve of the 21th century.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, both sides hoped to increase dialogues
between officials of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Namibia May Withdraw from COMESA: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A Namibian senior
official said today that his country would not rule out the
option of pulling out of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Wilfred Emvula, Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry, was
quoted by the Southern African Broadcasting Association as saying
in Windhoek that other countries of the 12-member Southern
African Development Community (SADC) were also weighing the
options.
</P>
<P>
Emvula said Namibia had signed the COMESA treaty but had not
yet ratified it. COMESA was formed in 1993 to promote trade and
economic integration in the sub-region. It is currently made up
of 23 member states in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said COMESA had been "inactive" compared
with SADC, which has made significant development in the
integration and cooperation among the sub-regional economies.
</P>
<P>
SADC was formed in 1992. Most of its member states also belong
to COMESA. But the two groupings have been at loggerheads for a
long time over alleged duplication of services.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, two SADC members, Lesotho and Mozambique,
announced that they would soon withdraw from COMESA.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said his country
intended to pull out of COMESA at the end of this year,
explaining his country felt that COMESA and SADC perform similar
functions.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rejects to Submit to Israeli Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz reiterated here today his country's rejection to
submit to Israel's pressure, and repeated a call for a complete
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"No Israeli pressure, no temptation and no intimidation could
make Lebanon change its position," the foreign minister said in
an interview with the Paris-based Radio Orient.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz's remarks came as a relative calm has returned to the
Lebanese-Israeli border following a spate of violence in south
Lebanon earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is still clear and explicit, and we are
demanding an implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution
425 and a complete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Lebanese
territories to beyond the internationally-recognized border,"
Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Lebanon is not ready to negotiate with Israel
outside the framework of the peace process inaugurated in the
October, 1991 Madrid conference on the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister emphasized Lebanon's demand for resuming
the peace talks from where they stopped and its refusal to go
backward to what was before the Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to a recent series of terrorist activities in Syria
and Lebanon, Boueiz accused the Israeli right-wing government
of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of "creating a kind of
internal disturbance" in the two countries in order to force
them to accept Israel's peace conditions.
</P>
<P>
Twelve people were killed and 41 others wounded in a bus
bombing in Damascus on December 31.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified gunmen sprayed machine gun fire at a van carrying
Syrian workers in Tabarja, 25 kilometers north of Beirut, on
December 17, killing the Syrian driver and wounding another
passenger.
</P>
<P>
Damascus and Beirut blamed the Jewish state for being behind
the two deadly terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister also accused the Israeli prime
minister of "blowing up" the peace process with four no's: no
withdrawal from the West Bank, no negotiations on Jerusalem, no
independent Palestinian state and no withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu blew up the peace process with his four no's, so
Madrid collapsed, but at the same time he failed to put forward
acceptable substitutes," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "all what he has done is to put obstacles to the
peace process without putting forward another possible and
rational peace process."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retailers End 1996 with Flat Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retailers reported
generally lower-than-expected sales for December, indicating a
sour note for the holiday shopping season.
</P>
<P>
Department stores fared poorly, with same-store sales virtually
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Sales of consumer electronics and computers fell sharply. Best
Buy Inc.'s same-store sales declined 13 percent, while Tandy
Corp.'s sales fell 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sales of apparel rebounded, and Sears, Wal-Mart and Kmart
reported strong sales. But plenty of other retailers are still
loaded with unsold winter goods, which left much room for shoppers
to bargain, but much headaches for retailers.
</P>
<P>
Sears had a 9.5 percent jump in December after its sales
declined in November. Overall sales at sores open at least a year
rose 6.2 percent in December, said Salomon Brothers. Some of the
better sales increases came from companies that sell goods for
the home.

WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Ten passengers on board an
American Airlines plane were injured today when the plane dropped
about 100 meters during turbulence over the Pacific, authorities
said.
</P>

the Associated Press quoted airline spokesman Chris Chiames as
saying. It began to drop when it was flying at about 10,000 meters
and about 90 minutes from the California coast.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
was given a red-carpet welcome when arrived here tonight on a
three-day official visit to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Major was greeted at the Zia International Airport by his
Bangladeshi counterpart, Sheikh Hasina, her cabinet ministers and
other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
The visit is the first by a British prime minister since 1978
when the then Prime Minister James Callagham came to Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Major flew in from Calcutta, India, on the second leg of his
three-nation South Asia tour. He will proceed from here to
Islamabad, Pakistan on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the agenda, the prime ministers of the two
countries will have official talks Saturday, covering bilateral
matters, particularly trade and technical and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the two leaders will also sign an agreement
on gas purchase and sales from the Sangu Gas Field, Bangladesh's
first offshore gas field explored and to be developed for
commercial production by the British company the Cairn Energy.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of 1996, British exports to Bangladesh
totaled 58.9 million British pounds while Bangladesh's exports to
Britain amounted to 238.6 million pounds, a 30.7-perceent increase
over a year earlier.

Major is accompanied by a delegation of the country's leading
traders and industrialists on his current visit.

<HEADLINE> Tuberculosis Spreads in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The tuberculosis epidemic is
dramatically spreading in a war-torn Mogadishu, especially in a
refugee camp accommodating hundreds of Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
One out of every five children under the age of five here was
hit by TB or other respiratory diseases, including lung TB, bones
TB and bronchitis, said Sadaq Yussuf Khasaro, a pediatrist at the
SOS hospital in southern Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The SOS hospital has treated more than 2,554 children
suffering from TB since October, Khasaro said.
</P>
<P>
The American Mercy International Agency also said that its
hospital, near the green line dividing Mogadishu, treats 200
patients every six months on the average.
</P>
<P>
The agency said it is planning to reopen the former TB
hospital in northern Mogadishu with the help of the World Health
Ogranization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Poverty and hungry are reportedly the major sponsors
for the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The spread is also partly due to the negligence of the
parents, who failed to send their kids to the treatment centers
just at the beginning of the disease, Khasaro said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many families cannot afford expensive
antibiotics which should be used to cure their children.
</P>
<P>
Most of the TB victims under five years were not
vaccinated, and many parents even do not believe the vaccine.
Instead, they chose traditional therapy which was no use for
curbing the spread, local doctors said.

<HEADLINE> Design Flaw May Threaten Canada's Nuclear Industry, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The discovery of a design flaw
at a nuclear power plant in New Brunswick Province may threaten
Canada's entire nuclear-energy industry, newspaper reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
"Corrosion problems at the Point Lepreau plant in southern New
Brunswick and its sister reactor in Gentilly could be endemic to
all of Canada's 22 Candu reactors," an official with Canada's
Atomic Energy Control Board was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If the corrosion cannot be corrected, it could mean an early
death for some, if not all, of Canada's nuclear reactors," said
Iain Lee, the board's on-site inspector at Lepreau.
</P>
<P>
The problem lies at the heart of the Candu plant - in its
reactor, where feeder pipes carry radioactive heavy water from
fuel channels to boilers to produce steam.
</P>
<P>
There are 380 feeder pipes in the Lepreau reactor, one for each
fuel channel.
</P>
<P>
The New Brunswick government reported Thursday that 13 of these
pipes are thinning because of unexpected corrosion.
</P>
<P>
"At last measurement, it had reached about 30 percent of the
pipes' thickness," Energy Minister Albert Doucet told the
provincial legislature.
</P>
<P>
"To stay within the safety standard, we can still operate the
plant another three or four years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The operating life of the 1-billion-U.S.-dollar is expected to
be 30 years. It hasn't reached the halfway mark, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Point Lepreau is the only nuclear plant in Atlantic Canada and
it provides nearly one-third of New Brunswick's energy needs.
</P>
<P>
The plant has come under close scrutiny in recent months
because of a series of shutdowns due to leaks.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Ebola Cause 43 Deaths in Gabon Since Last July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- There have been 58 cases of
Ebola-caused fever in Gabon since its outbreak in July 1996,
taking 43 lives, the World Health Organization (WHO) said here
today in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The majority of cases and deaths have occurred in the area of
Booue, 470 kilometers east of Libreville, capital of Gabon, but
there have also been cases in Libreville itself, said WHO.
</P>
<P>
The most recent case died in a Libreville hospital on January
8, 1997. As of that date, 167 people who have had possible
physical contact with Ebola patients remain under daily
surveillance for symptoms of Ebola virus infection in the cities
of Libreville and Booue, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
"All recent cases in Libreville belong to the same household
and occurred following close contact with Libreville inhabitants
at the burial of a relative who died from Ebola in a village near
Booue," WHO noted in its press release. It has sent protective
medical clothing to the health care professionals treating the
Ebola patients.
</P>
<P>
Ebola haemorrhagic fever is characterized by the sudden onset
of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, weakness, conjunctivitis,
vomitting and headache, suggestive of severe gastroenteritis, with
or without bloody diarrhoea, WHO introduced. The incubation period
is two to 12 days.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that there is no specific treatment or vaccine
available for Ebola, one of the most virulent viral diseases known
to medical science. Death occurs in 50 percent to 90 percent of
infected cases. In the current out break in Gabon, 77 percent
died.

<HEADLINE> UN/ECE: China Ranks First in Global Crude Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China has become the world
largest crude steel producer for the first time with its 100
million tons of crude steel in 1996, the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) said here today.
</P>
<P>
China, with an annual production of 100.35 million tons, is
also the only country to exceed the 100 million ton level in 1996,
said the Working Party on Steel of the Geneva-based ECE in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the former largest producer of crude steel, lagged
behind China in 1996 with a lower production of 98.8 million tons
than 101.6 million tons in 1995, and dropped to the second in the
world ranking.
</P>
<P>
The third to the sixth positions in the world ranking for
global crude steel production in 1996 are the United States (94.4
million tons, +0.9 percent), Russia (49.074 million tons, -4.4
percent), Germany (39.825 million tons, -5.3 percent) and South
Korea (39.03 million tons, +6.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
The total world crude steel production is 750.828 million tons
in 1996, 0.2 percent lower than that in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The ECE said the main cause of the overall decline was stock
reductions and weakening economic activity in the European Union
countries and Japan. Central European transition countries and the
CIS also experienced declines, with drops of 9.8 percent and 3.3
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Soeharto, Hashimoto Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto today
agreed to expand the existing relations between the two nations, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the results of the two leaders' talks here,
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said they agreed that the
relations should be focused not only on economy but also on other
sectors like culture.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two leaders touched on bilateral,
regional and international issues, Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto expressed Japan's wish to share its experience with
Indonesia in regard to its environmental management.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed that the manufacture of a national
car by Indonesia would not strain the two countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto explained to Hashimoto the background of the
manufacture of the national car.
</P>
<P>
In February last year, the Indonesian government ruled that
producers of a national car would be exempted from duties and
luxury taxes. These taxes normally increase the price of cars by
about 60 percent in the country.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the United States and the European Union are protesting
the national car policy which they say violates international
rules.
</P>
<P>
The national car program was drafted with the aim of realizing
Indonesia's self-sufficiency in transportation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters about how Hashimoto reacted to Soeharto's
explanation, Moerdiono said Japan could understand and support the
national car program.
</P>
<P>
"However, Japan believes that the making of the national car
needs to be conducted in line with international agreements in the
framework of the World Trade Organization," Moerdiono said,
quoting Hashimoto's statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at a news briefing here, a Japanese spokesman said the
two leaders have expressed the hope that ASEAN-Japan relations
should be deepened in various fields.
</P>
<P>
On Hashimoto's proposal for holding regular dialogues between
leaders of ASEAN and Japan, the spokesman said, Soeharto agreed to
contact other ASEAN leaders on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
To expand the existing ASEAN-Japan ties, they held, the two
sides should have top-level consultations and dialogues, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto arrived here on Thursday for a three-day visit and
will leave here on Saturday to visit Vietnam and Singapore.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- As the Security Council
is set to have another round of consultations on a draft resolution
of sending 155 military observers to Guatemala, Chinese U.N. envoy
Qin Huasun warned Guatemala against misjudging China's Positions
and determination.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting held on Friday with President of the Security
Council Hisashi Owada of Japan, Ambassador Qin said that although
China had given Guatemala opportunities to correct its mistakes on
the issue of Taiwan, the Guatemalan side had up to now failed to
acknowledge and correct these mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"They still hold illusions with regards to Chinese position,"
said Ambassador Qin. "There is definitely no way out if they
continue acting like this."
</P>
<P>
He said China is waiting for the removal by Guatemala of
obstacles that have been preventing China from approving the 155
military observers.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Cyprus' Purchase of Missiles Draws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' arms deal to
buy Russian-made S-300 missiles has drawn strong opposition from
Turkey and might lead to a conflict between Turkey and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkish leaders have issued several strongly-worded
statements, warning that Turkey would take necessary actions to
protect Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus if the situation on
the eastern Mediterranean island continues to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Russia concluded an agreement in Nicosia recently for
the purchase of 150-kilometer-range S-300 surface-to-air missiles
from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
On the decision of the Greek Cypriots to deploy the missiles
on the island, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has said that
his country was determined to protect Turkish Cypriots in the
region, adding that the arms deal would only make the situation
more complicated.
</P>
<P>
Demirel warned that the Turkish government would not allow
any developments which would threat the Turkish Cypriots on the
island.
</P>
<P>
In her first open threat of war against Cyprus, Turkish Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller told reporters
today that Turkey is ready to strike at Cyprus if the Greek
Cypriot government goes ahead with the arms deal between Cyprus
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ciller held the urgent press conference in the Foreign
Ministry following her secret meeting with Chief of the General
Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces Ismail Hakki Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi informed Turkish Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan Thursday that the missiles, which are scheduled to be
brought from Russia and to be deployed in the Greek Cypriot
sector of the divided island, constitute a threat to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that this event is "most serious", warning that the
Turkish Armed Forces are ready to take necessary measures in a
bid to protect the Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since the Turkish troops landed
on the island in 1974 to protect the Turkish Cypriots following
a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Cyprus' Purchase of Missiles Draws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- After receiving American
Ambassador to Turkey Marc Grossman, Erbakan said that Greek
Cypriots' deployment of missiles on the island was unacceptable
because the purchase of the missiles was aimed at launching
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Ciller also said at today's press conference that Turkey will
not watch the arms accumulation in Cyprus as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
She said that "there is no way that we allow the missiles to
be placed in Cyprus. If the missiles are deployed on the island,
Turkey is ready to do everything to protect the security of
Turkish Cypriots, including striking at Greek Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
She accused Greece of "encouraging and guiding" the Greek
Cypriots, saying that Athens should bear responsibility for
Cyprus' attempt to use Greek Cypriots to threaten Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said earlier that "the armament of southern Cyprus
does not make us worry because we are powerful enough to protect
northern Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has long been a thorny issue in blocking the
normalization of the bilateral ties between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
As Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus, Greece
and Greek Cypriots also have a joint defense pact and the
missiles will be deployed to protect an air and navy base under
construction on the island's western coast.
</P>
<P>
Athens has threatened Ankara with war if it advances further
south on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Turkish Defense Minister Turhan Tayan said that
Turkey will do its best to prevent the deployment of the
missiles on the island, adding that all sides in Cyprus, Turkey
and Greece should help bring about a stable peace.
</P>
<P>
Tayan, however, pointed out that the joint defense doctrine
between Greece and Cyprus, as well as the missile purchase
from Russia, did not help the peace efforts on the island.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here hold that the Turkish government would exert
diplomatic pressure on the Cypriot government to cancel
its decision to deploy the missiles on the island. If the
pressure on Cyprus produces no results, then Turkey's striking at
Cyprus is possible, said the diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Anti-European Mood Gathering Momentum in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The anti-European mood is
gathering greater momentum in Britain, while the vast majority of
Germans want a national referendum on the single European
currency, according to an opinion survey in four European
countries published in today's Daily Telegraph newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The poll, the first to ask the citizens of Britain, Germany,
France and Italy to identify questions about the single European
currency and the future of the European Union (EU), was jointly
conducted by Britain's Daily Telegraph and the French newspaper Le
Figaro, the German business newspaper Handelsblatt and the Italian
news magazine L'Espresso.
</P>
<P>
The survey suggests that 42 percent of Britons questioned would
want to stay in the EU and 38 percent would vote to quit the
15-nation block, signaling a marked increase in anti-EU feelings
over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
A similar survey in June 1995 showed that 61 percent of Britons
wanted to stay in the EU, with only 29 percent wanting to pull
out.
</P>
<P>
While large majorities in France and Italy continue to favor
the European economic and monetary union, the citizens of Germany,
the driving force of the European integration, cast deep doubts
over the single currency.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 79 percent of Germans would like to have
a referendum on the single currency, much higher that of Britain,
which has until now been regarded as the most reluctant
participant.
</P>
<P>
The poll also suggests that the outcome of such a referendum
would be extremely close in Germany, with 43 percent saying that
they would vote in favor of abolishing the Deutsche mark and 44
percent against.
</P>
<P>
A mere 16 percent of Germans believe their country would be
better off as a result of a single currency and a clear majority
of Germans opposed handing over control of German monetary policy
to an independent European central bank.

<HEADLINE> Optimism Among UK SMEs Reflects Strengths of Its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A survey revealing that optimism
among British owner-managed businesses is unrivaled in Europe was
a proof of the strengths of Britain's economy, said Ian Lang,
President of the Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary findings form the Grant Thornton International and
Business Strategy limited's fifth European Business Survey, which
surveyed small and medium firms (SMEs) in 19 European countries,
show that British SMEs remain consistently more optimistic than
their European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The survey which released today shows: 66 percent of British
SMEs expects turnover and output to rise while a quarter of
respondents in Germany and 22 percent in France anticipate reduced
turnover and output.
</P>
<P>
-- 91 percent of British SMEs expect employment to rise or
remain the same, compared to 81 percent across Europe (and 20
percent of German respondents which forecast job losses).
</P>
<P>
-- 83 percent of British SMEs expect investment in new plant
and equipment to rise or remain constant compared with 71 percent
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that the survey provides a clear indication
of the strength of Britain's small and medium sized business
sector and of British industry as it enters the New Year in
confident mood, anticipating larger turnover, more jobs, improved
profitability and greater investment.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the findings, Lang said: "This buoyant optimism
among British SMEs is unrivaled in Europe and is in marked
contrast to the pessimism prevalent among Europe's owner-managed
businesses."
</P>
<P>
"It proves the value of an economy based on flexibility and
voluntarism, with minimum burdens imposed on industry," he added.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the important role the UK's SMEs are playing, Lang
said: " Small and Medium sized firms are the lifeblood of our
economy. British firms must have the flexibility to adjust to
changing circumstances and economic conditions if we are to remain
a land of enterprise."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the restrictions imposed by unnecessary
social legislation could only damage competitiveness and jobs.
</P>
<P>
"The Government is committed to ensuring that the SME business
community has the freedom to grow, to compete and to continue to
play a central role in Britain's economy," Lang said.

WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A commuter plane crashed
shortly after taking off in a snowstorm at the Bangor
International Airport, Bangor, Maine, this morning, injuring two
of the 11 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Boston-bound USAir Express plane reached about 100 meters
before crashing on the runway at about 9:25 a.m. (1425 GMT), an
Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
Airport administrator's office said it was snowing at the time
of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The airport was closed after the crash.
</P>
<P>
The Beechcraft 1900 is a turbo-propeller plane with a capacity
of 19 people.
</P>
<P>
It was the second airplane crash in two days in snowy weather
in the Unites States. On Thursday, a Comair commuter plane crashed
near Detroit, killing all 19 people on board. Investigation was
underway and experts said the accident might be caused by ice on
the plane that unbalanced the craft.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Airlines Begins Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- In a symbolic effort to
assert statehood, the Palestinian Authority has inaugurated its
national carrier, Palestinian Airlines, today.
</P>
<P>
A Dutch-made Fokker 50 took off from Port Said of Egypt on the
maiden flight, carrying 48 passengers to Jiddah, Saudi Arabia,
for a pilgrimage to Islam's holy sites in Mecca and Medina,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian passangers were transported from the border
between Egypt and Gaza to Port Said, a distance of about 200
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft is marked by "Palestinian Airlines" on its
side in English and Arabic. On the tail and along the side
are red, green, black and white stripes to demonstrate the
colors of the Palestinian national flag.
</P>
<P>
The company has two Fokker jets donated by the Dutch
government. The two planes will make four flights once a week.
</P>
<P>
The first flight of the airlines was supposed to have got
off the ground from the Rafah International Airport in the
Gaza Strip, which was built last year. But the flight was
blocked due to disagreement with Israel over security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has repeatedly
declared that Israel does not allow the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state. But the Palestinians vow to have
their sovereign state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations on partial Israeli troop withdrawal
from the West Bank city of Hebron, the Palestinian Authority
has demanded that such an agreement should also include other
major issues defined in the Oslo 2 Accord signed in Washington
September 28, 1995. The opening of the Rafah airport is one
of them.

LUANDA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Friends of Environment
Youth Association has planned to plant 4,000 trees on the

It was also aimed at preventing potential disasters caused by

The project would be started soon.

<P>
Meanwhile, ecological organisations of the two countries are
also planning to meet next Monday to iron out another plan to
plant in the area more trees that adapt to the local climate.
</P>
<P>
The desertification in the region was partly owing to the
discriminate felling of trees by local peasants, apart
from the expansion of the Kalahari Desert.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry this
evening lodged a note of protest to Russia over selling S-300
missiles to Cyprus which has drawn strong opposition from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen summoned
Russian Ambassador to Turkey Vadim Igorovic Kuznetsov to the
ministry and handed over the note of the protest.
</P>
<P>
The 150-kilometer-range missiles are reportedly scheduled to
be deployed on eastern Mediterranean island which has remained
divided since 1974.
</P>
<P>
Turkey asked Russia not to sell the surface-to-air missiles to
Cyprus, which will greatly "destroy the atmosphere of peace and
security on the island".
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller
said that Russian leaders had promised Turkey not to export
Moscow's offensive weapons to the Cyprus during Ciller's visit to
Russia last December.
</P>
<P>
Turkey believed that the missiles had advanced a step not only
to change the military balance in Cyprus, but also in the whole
region, said Oymen during his one-hour meeting with Kuznetsov.
</P>
<P>
After being summoned to the ministry, Kuznetsov told
reporters that the Russian-made S-300 missiles are aimed at
defense.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the missiles will not totally change the
military balance in quality in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador expressed his hope that Turkey will
never hit Cyprus, adding that such an operation is contrary to
the international law.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Igorovic, Oymen received American
Ambassador to Ankara Marc Grossman.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said at an urgent press conference earlier today that
Turkey is ready to strike at Cyprus if the Cypriot government
goes ahead with the arms deal.
</P>
<P>
She said that Turkey will not watch the arms accumulation in
Cyprus as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since the Turkish troops landed on
the island in 1974 to protect the Turkish Cypriots following a
short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece. The northern part of the island is now controlled by
Turkish Cypriots supported Turkish troops.

Cyprus has long been a thorny issue in blocking the
normalization of the bilateral ties between Turkey and Greece,
both member states of the NATO.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibari Presdent Salmin
Amour today cautioned the people to avoid confrantations, saying the
rule of law will be strengthened to contain friction in the society.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally organised by ruling Revolutionary Party
(CCM) supporters at Malindi Grounds in Zanzibar, Amour said his
government was serious to sustain the prevailing peace and unity
in the isles.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here from Zanzibar, President
Amour warned that the government would take action against any
party aimed at disrupting the islands stability regardlss of
the party's political inclination.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people to shun away from party politics that meant to
sow seeds of division between the people of Unguja and Pemba.
</P>
<P>
Amour, who is also CCM Vice-Chairman, insisted that his
government would deliver goods to the people of Unguja and Pemba
irrespective of their party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
"I am the President of all the people and I am obliged to serve all
without discrimination," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He reassured that Zanzibar's political situation was calm but
there was a group of people who want to erode peace to suit their
personal interest.
</P>
<P>
The president thanked the people for observing tolerance and unity
in the last year despite provocations from different corners.
</P>
<P>
Amour was elected President of the isles during the first
multi-party democratic elections in October, 1995. However,
the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) has always refused to accept
Amour as the Zanzibar President because of what it claimed that the
result of the presidential election "has been rigged". enditem

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Warned against Misjudging China's Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- As the Security Council
is prepared to have another round of consultations on sending
military observers to Guatemala, Chinese U.N. envoy Qin Huasun
warned Guatemala on Friday morning against any misjudgement of
China's positions and determination.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with President of the Security Council Hisashi
Owada of Japan, Ambassador Qin said that although China had given
Guatemala opportunities to correct its mistakes committed on the
issue of Taiwan, up to now they had failed to acknowledge and
correct them.
</P>
<P>
"The Guatemalan side still hold illusions with regards to
Chinese positions," said Ambassador Qin. "There is definitely no
way out if they continue acting like this."
</P>
<P>
"We still hope the question can be solved in a proper way," Qin
said. "But if requested before Guatemala can remove the obstacles,
China is also ready to take part in a voting of the draft
resolution," hinting that he may exercise veto power that China
has not used since the end of Cold War.
</P>
<P>
In elaborating Chinese positions on the issue, Qin said that
China has always supported the peace process of Guatemala. The
Chinese delegation has no objection to the draft resolution
itself on sending military observers to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the actions of Guatemala in the U.N. have
violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China by
supporting the admittance of Taiwan into the world body. That has
damaged the basis of cooperation between China and Guatemala and
created barriers for China to support sending the military
observers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only when Guatemala recognizes its mistakes
and takes specific measures to correct them can the issue be
solved.
</P>
<P>
The idea of sending 155 military observers to Guatemala was
raised by both the former secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali
and friends of Guatemalan peace process, the United States, Spain,
Sweden, Mexico and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria
Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) signed a final peace agreement on
December 29, 1996. But the government, ignoring China's repeated
warnings, invited the "foreign minister" of Taiwan to attend the
signing ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Accuses Netanyahu of Sabotaging Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
autonomous authorities Yasser Arafat today accused Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of "sabotaging the peace process" by asking for
a delay of Israeli troops withdrawal from the West Bank for two
years.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here this morning, met with President
Jacques Chirac at the Elysee presidential palace this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that Palestinians did not "have any relation
with the bombing attack" on a bus station in Tel Aviv Wednesday,
in which 13 people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
"This is an attack which concerns the internal events in
Israel," said Arafat, who spoke in Arabic and was translated by
the representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
in France, Leila Shahid.
</P>
<P>
"The demand of Mr. Netanyahu literally sabotages all peace
agreements," he said. "The act to build new settlements and
confiscate new (Arab) lands also sabotages the peace process."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinians are not asking for "the
impossible" and are only asking for the application of the
agreements signed with Israel under the auspices of the United
States and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows to Hit Greek Cypriot Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish armed forces have
to destroy Greek Cypriots' surface-to-air missiles to be bought
from Russia if the diplomatic efforts failed to produce results,
Turkish military sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources from the office of chief of the general staff of
the Turkish Armed Forces said that Turkey should do its best to
prevent the 150 kilometer-range S-300 missiles from being
dispatched to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, they admitted that it was unlikely to persuade
Russia to cancel its arms deal with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey would continue its diplomatic efforts and only use
military action against Cyprus as a last option, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are in close contact with the Turkish Foreign Ministry,
but we are not sure that the current policies will be
effective," added the military sources.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller told
an urgent press conference today that Turkey would not watch the
arms build-up in Cyprus as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
"If the missiles are deployed on the eastern Mediterranean
island, Turkey is ready to do everything to protect the security
of Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus, including striking at
Greek Cyprus," she said.
</P>
<P>
Some Turkish political party leaders also said that Turkey
should use military means to protect Turkish Cypriots in
northern Cyprus and itself if the situation became even worse.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in parliament today,
Democratic Left Party Chairman Bulent Ecevit, who ordered the
Turkish troops to land on the island of Cyprus when he was the
prime minister in 1974, said: "Action was more effective
than words."
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister stressed that the missiles to be
purchased from Russia were not for defense purposes, on the
contrary, they were aimed at launching attacks against the
Turkish Cypriots on the island and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Kamran Inan, a Motherland Party deputy, said that Cyprus
would pay price for its decision to purchase the
250-million-dollar Russian-made S-300 missiles.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Exports rise, Imports Drop Last December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's exports in
December 1996 recorded an increase of 19.9 percent over November
while its imports declined, official figures showed today.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Zubair Khan said today that exports amounting
to 800 million US dollars in December showed encouraging signs.
</P>
<P>
"Development both in exports and imports reflects the impact of
the exchange rate action and changes of the government's
management policies, particularly the sharp reduction in
government expenditure and monetary restraints."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani rupee has been devalued against most of the hard
currencies by about 15 percent since July last year.
</P>
<P>
According to figures issued by the Federal Bureau of Statistics
(FBS), exports in December registered an 11.6 percent increase
over the same period of 1995, which totaled 717 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that imports in December amounted to 960
million dollars, a drop of 0.7 percent as compared with November.
</P>
<P>
December's imports fell by 0.3 percent compared with the same
period in 1995 when imports were worth 963 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The balance of trade recorded an improvement as the
exports-imports difference declined from 1.99 billion dollars in
July-December, 1995 to 1.67 billion dollars during July-December,
1996.
</P>
<P>
The commerce minister said that with two textile packages
coming into full play in the coming months, exports, two-thirds of
which are cotton products and textiles, are likely to grow at an
accelerated pace and meet the annual target of 10 billion dollars.

support for the central government's recent decision to allow four
foreign bank branches in Shanghai's Pudong New Area conduct
Renminbi yuan business.

The four banks are City Bank NA, the Hong Kong and Shanghai

</P>
<P>
Xu said that his bank plans to strengthen its cooperation with
the four foreign yuan dealers, including setting up bank
consortium or offering joint yuan loans to clients, making

foreign banks, and helping to train staff from the foreign banks
to handle yuan business.

<HEADLINE> Iran Invites Taleban to Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that
Tehran has offered to host an Afghan reconciliation conference and
called on all groups in the war-torn country including Taleban to
participate.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said:"We are ready to hold
an inter-Afghan conference in Iran and invite Afghanistan's
legitimate government and all other groups including Taleban to
attend this conference to reach national reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
The statement by the foreign minister, broadcast by the
state-run Tehran Radio, is regarded here as a shift in Iran's
policy on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Velayati's statement is the equivalent
 of a recognition of Taleban, even though he was quick to say
that in his opinion Afghan's legitimate government was Burhanuddin
 Rabbani's.
</P>
<P>
Taleban forces succeeded in pushing the government troops out
of Kabul last year. Fighting still goes on north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that official invitation has not yet been
extended to Taleban. "We have not made any specific invitation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry came under fire last week in the
Iranian press for giving the green light to Taleban, after Afghan
Islamic Press reported that a delegation from Taleban, headed by
Mulla Ghowth, was planning to visit Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The rightist Jomhuri Islami wrote that Taleban's "mercenaries
had violated Iran's territory" during the first week of 1997 and
lamented that the Foreign Ministry was willing to talk to
Taleban.
</P>
<P>
The daily said: "Some officials of Iran's Foreign Ministry
have shown that they are not reluctant to hold talks with the
representatives of this group."
</P>
<P>
Last October, Iran hosted a conference on Afghan
issue. Velayati announced three-point framework for the settlement
of Afghan crisis, stressing that the would-be Afghan government
should be broad-based and made up of various ethnic and religious
groups.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran's proposal has the following components:
</P>
<P>
-- The Afghan people and factions should decide about the
future of Afghanistan;
</P>
<P>
-- Other countries should not meddle in the international
affairs of Afghanistan;
</P>
<P>
-- The would-be government of Afghanistan should be broad-
based and made up of various ethnic and religious groups.

MOSCOW, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Foreign Ministry has
lodged a strong protest with the United States over the action of
two New York policemen against one of its diplomats to the United
Nations, last week.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sidorov called the
action of the two New York policemen against the diplomat a
flagrant breach of international law on the inviolability of
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Sidorov, who is in charge of Russia's U.N. affairs, said Russia
was awaiting official apologies from the U.S. authorities for the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Russia also demanded that the United States take effective
measures to prevent similar incidents in the future, Sidorov added.
</P>
<P>
According to reports of the Interfax news agency, Boris
Obnossov of Russia's U.N. mission and Yuri Orange of Belarus' were
dragged from their parked car on December 29 by two policemen who
ignored their diplomatic credentials.
</P>
<P>
The policemen took them to a nearby police station in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
During 30-minutes in custody, Obnossov's arm was injured and
his glasses were broken and clothes torn.
</P>
<P>
Sidorov said Russia denied the U.S. charges that Obnossov
attacked the policemen and tried to drive away while
intoxicated. He said the charges were fabricated.
</P>
<P>
Obnossov has submitted a report to a U.N. committee on
relations with the host country on the incident.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey Tries to Block Cyprus' Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is trying everything,
from diplomatic efforts to a threat of military action, to block
Cyprus' decision to buy Russian-made S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen Friday night
informed Dutch Ambassador to Turkey Nikolaus Van Dam about the
latest developments of the tension caused by the
250-million-U.S.-dollar missile deal.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is the current chairman of the European Union
(EU), to which Turkey is eager to become a full member.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday that the
EU is ready to make contributions to a settlement to the Cyprus
issue as the tension on the divided island is rising.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since the Turkish troops were
stationed on the island in 1974 to protect the Turkish Cypriots
following a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' purchase of the 150-kilometer-range missiles has drawn
strong opposition from Turkey, the only country in the world that
recognizes the self-proclaimed "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
The northern part of the island is now controlled by Turkish
Cypriots with the stationing of 35,000-strong Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
Oymen has also met with Frank Ricciardone, counselor of the
U.S. embassy to Turkey, on the Cyprus-Russia missile deal. The
U.S. official said both the Turkish and Greek Cypriot sides on the
eastern Mediterranean island should act cool-headedly.
</P>
<P>
Before his meetings with the Dutch and U.S. diplomats in
Ankara, Oymen had summoned Russian Ambassador to the country Vadim
Igorovic Kuznetsov and handed over to him a note of protest
over the sale of S-300 missiles to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey urged Russia to boycott the surface-to-air missiles deal
to Cyprus, saying the sale will greatly "destroy the atmosphere of
peace and security on the island."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller said at an urgent press conference Friday that Turkey
is ready to launch a strike at Cyprus if the Cypriot government
goes ahead with the arms deal.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will not take a wait-and-see attitude towards the arms
build-up on the island, she said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the office of the Turkish Armed Forces Chief of
General Staff explained that the military action against Cyprus
will only be taken as the last option.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador, claiming the missiles on deal are only
for defense purpose, has expressed the hope that Turkey will not
attack Cyprus, adding that such an operation is contrary to
international law.
</P>
<P>
At Friday's press conference in Ankara, Ciller also accused
Greece of "encouraging and guiding" the Cypriot government, saying
that Athens should bear responsibility for Cyprus' attempt to use
Greek Cypriots to threaten Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The divided Cyprus has long been a thorny issue in blocking
the normalization of the bilateral ties between Turkey and
Greece, both member states of the NATO.

elected through partyless polls, authorizes the president to
dissolve national assemblies and governments at a time when the
governments cannot rule the country properly.
</P>
<P>
Shah said the amendment has tilted some of the powers to the
president, making it a mixture of parliamentary and presidential
form of government.
</P>
<P>
He said the Supreme Court can look into amendments, if there is
any doubt over the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has to examine whether a body elected through
a partyless election can make amendments to the constitution,
which was worked out by the elected members of all political
parties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the attorney general of Pakistan, Shahzad Jehangir,
said the court cannot declare any part of the constitution
invalid.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Articles 238 and 239 of the constitution which
deal with the process of making amendments to the constitution,
Jehangir said, "No one other than the legislature can bring about
any change in the constitution."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that after the eighth amendment three elections
were held and that a party which managed to get a two-thirds
majority in parliament did nothing to repeal the eighth amendment.
</P>
<P>
"It means the general public and politicians have accepted the
eighth amendment as part of the 1973 constitution," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, four elected governments have been dismissed by
presidents invoking the eighth amendment.

<HEADLINE> Ross: Egyptian Peace Role Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis
Ross today underlined the importance of Egypt's role for pushing
forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Ross
said that the parties concerned share the idea of giving a
push to the stalled Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy added that there are still some issues that
Israelis and Palestinians disagree on but they continue to work to
find a solution.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived here this morning from Tel-Aviv, briefed
Mubarak on the development of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
and the progress achieved regarding the Israeli partial
redeployment from Hebron, the only West Bank city still under
Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
"The thrust of the negotiations is Hebron together with some
other topics," he said. However, he declined to comment on the
Israeli proposed delay of pullout from the West Bank for two years.
</P>
<P>
Ross' intense shuttle mediations nearly sewed up the Hebron
part of the deal before Israel proposed the putoff early this
week. The Palestinians rejected the proposal, prompting Ross to
dish out a compromise date of September 1998.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Ross' talks with President Mubarak focused
on the U.S.compromise timetable, but little has been made known
about Egypt's response.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo II accords, Israel should complete three
pullbacks from the West Bank in September 1997. The Palestinians
want things to go as planned, but the Israelis insists on changes.
</P>
<P>
Asked what he might propose during a meeting with a Palestinian
negotiator here later today, Ross said he is trying to hammer out
a common agreement and narrow the gap between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ross said that considerable progress has been made but the
Palestinians and Israelis failed to overcome all points of
difference.
</P>
<P>
Tonight Ross may also meet with Palestinian Authority leader
Yasser Arafat, who returned to Gaza after a brief meeting with
Mubarak here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has urged the U.S. to lead a "fair" role,
especially as President Bill Clinton himself co-signed
the Oslo II peace agreements in Washington in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with the
Jewish state, has been a strong advocate of the Palestinian cause
and a key partner in Israeli-Arab talks.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislator Calls for Faster Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China should further speed up
the pace of its reforms in 1997, especially the restructuring of
state-owned enterprises, a top Chinese legislator said during a
recent inspection tour of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, Chairman of National People's Congress Standing
Committee, made the call during his visit from January 4-10, which
covered a number of industrial and agricultural projects in
Jiangsu, one of the well-developed coastal provinces.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who is also a member of Communist Party of China Central
Committee Politburo Standing Committee, praised the province for
its efforts over the past year to deepen the reforms and open
wider to the outside world and its notable achievements made in
both the industrial and farming sectors.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should take bolder and speedier steps in
reforms, Qiao urged.
</P>
<P>
"Time waits for no one," he said. "We are pressed for time, as
there is not much time left before the end of this century."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Chinese firms should work diligently to
produce their own brand-name products and to compete on the world
market.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi, British Firms Sign Gas Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi and British companies
today signed an agreement on purchase and sales of gas from the
South Asian country's first offshore gal field of Sangu.
</P>
<P>
No details about the agreement were available, but the British
company the Cairn Plc has reportedly already invested hugely for
the exploration of the gas field and will sell gas to Bangladesh
after production on terms to be finalized by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Cairn Plc and Petrobangla, a Bangladeshi state-run petro
company, signed the agreement at a brief ceremony here, which was
witnessed by visiting British Prime Minister John Major and his
Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
The American company "Hallidurtion" and the Dutch company "Sea
Searcher" are also involved in the agreement under arrangement
with the British company.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the accord, Major told newsmen that it
marked big British investment in Bangladesh which is poised to
make tremendous progress in the field of gas through the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Hasina also expressed her satisfaction over the deal, saying it
showed foreign investors are being attracted to the country.
</P>
<P>
Major arrived here last night for a three-day official visit.
He had nearly one hour of wide-ranging talks with Hasina this
morning, which covered bilateral political and economic ties and
multilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Major is the first British prime minister to visit Bangladesh
in 18 years. Economic and trade relations between the two
countries were progressing satisfactorily, he said.
</P>
<P>
Several British trade and other delegations will visit
Bangladesh soon to expand their relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Major delivered a speech to members
of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(FBCCI), pledging that Britain was keen to work together with
Bangladesh as a partner in key areas of trade, investment and
development.

<HEADLINE> Japan Takes Home Reprocessed Nuclear Waste from France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan will take home next Monday 40
containers of nuclear waste reprocessed by a French plant at Cape
Hague, in the English Channel, the French nuclear authority,
Compagnie Generale des Matieres Nucleaires (COGEMA), said today.
</P>
<P>
The radio-active materials would be loaded onto a British ship,
Pacific Teal, at the French port of Cherbourg, said COGEMA.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Teal, which belongs to British Nuclear Fuel Limited,
has already left the British port of Barrow and could be waiting
on the high seas, Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Greenpeace
France as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Patrick Lederman, the director of a nuclear processing
factory at Cape Hague, said in a written statement: "The Pacific
Teal, with its two cargoes onboard containing 40 containers of
vitrified (nuclear) residues, will leave the port of Cherbourg
Monday, January 13, for the destination of Japan."
</P>
<P>
The COGEMA announced in December that the cargo's way of
leaving France would be announced one or two days in advance.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported last year that nuclear leakage from Cape
Hague, where there are stocks of French waste, is causing serious
environmental problems in the English Channel.

<HEADLINE> China Curbs Quality Fall in Machinery Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China has over the past year
made a good start in the drive to revitalize its machine-building
industry by improving product quality, optimizing its setup and
increasing the capacity for product development.
</P>
<P>
Deterioration in the quality of China's machinery products has
been curbed, according to a national working meeting on
machine-building industry which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey of 29 machinery products by 536 enterprises,
conducted by the State Bureau of Technological Supervision during
the first three quarters of last year, showed that the
qualification rate reached 75.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The quality of machinery products has stabilized and even
improved for products turned out by some key enterprises, a
meeting source said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said in a letter of congratulations to
the meeting that he extends his regards "to all the workers at the
front of the machine-building industry, for you managed to
overcome all the difficulties and successfully met the sectoral
targets."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that through joint efforts, the central government's
goal to revitalize the machine-building, automobile and other pill
industries will certainly be accomplished," said Wu, who is also
a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Rapped for Economic Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- India's economy has started
showing "distinct signs of slowing down" following faulty measures
taken by the seven-month-old United Front government, a panel of
the Congress party has said.
</P>
<P>
The censure was made by the Manmohan Singh Committee set up by
Congress Party President Sitaram Kesri to monitor the economic
policies of the government, the Indian express said today.
</P>
<P>
Former finance minister Manmohan Singh was the real figure
behind India's economic liberalization initiated by the former
Congress government in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The committee said there is a widespread feeling that the
fiscal deficit will be much higher than the budgeted figure of
five percent because of the slowdown in industrial growth, decline
in the import growth rate and uncertainty over the privatization
of public enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Higher spending on defense, food and fertilizers subsidies, and
failure to appoint an expenditure commission as announced in the
budget of the government are the other reasons cited by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Kesri might have brought this to the notice of Prime Minister
H.D. Deve Gowda during their meeting a few days ago, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party, which lends outside support to the minority
United Front government, has adopted a policy to periodically
review the performance of the government.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Set up Coffee Sampling Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Coffee
Exporters Association said today it will set up a coffee sampling
center in a bid to improve coffee's quality and earn more money
from coffee exporting.
</P>
<P>
Although the country plans to export 108,000 tons of coffee in
1996-97, up six percent from the previous fiscal year, the value
of coffee exports is estimated to fall 18 percent to 236 million
U.S. Dollars due to the lower price on world markets.
</P>
<P>
Aschenaki Gebrehiwot, the secretary of the association, said
that coffee exporters are expecting to get more money through the
new scheme in a belief that sampling is the best method for
enhancing coffee quality and value.
</P>
<P>
The association, founded 30 years ago, provides its members
with fresh market and financial information from world business
hubs including New York and London.
</P>
<P>
About one-fourth of Ethiopians are involved in coffee
business, whose export volume makes for more than a half of
the country's total export earnings.

</P>
<P>
But it is not clear whether he will also meet with President

<P>
This is Aziz's third visit to Paris since 1990. It follows a
French decision to withdraw from an allied air reconnaissance
operation over Kurdistan in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here said the visit shows that the relations
between Iraq and France have further improved since the 1990 Iraqi
invasion of its neighbor Kuwait.

NEW DELHI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- India is set to become the
top milk producer in the world with production this year expected
to exceed 70 million tons as against the United States' 68 million
tons milk per year, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said today.
</P>
<P>
Last year India produced 64 million tons from a cattle herd
comprising 15 percent of the world's cows and 55 percent of the
world's buffaloes, PTI quoted Director of the National Dairy
Research Institute O.S. Tomar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tomar said India's milk production has the potential for
further increases.
</P>
<P>
Despite the large herd size, Indian cattle produced a mere
one-eighth of milk produced by cattle in the West which are fed
predominantly on grain concentrates, he said, adding that Indian
cattle are fed on grain residue and vegetable waste.
</P>
<P>
To increase the milk production by Indian cattle, the institute
has developed two new breeds by crossing certain Indian native
breeds with brown Swiss cows, the director said.
</P>
<P>
The new breeds have the disease resistance of the Indian
varieties and the increased milk production capacity of the
Western breeds, he added.

<P>
CAIRO, January 11 (Xinhua)-- U.S. Mideast peace mediator Dennis
Ross will hold talks with a Palestinian negotiator to probe ways
to bridge the gap between the Palestinian and Israeli stances on
Israeli force redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's Political Advisor Osama
al-Baz made the statement to reporters after the meeting between
Mubarak and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) leader Yasser
Arafat, who arrived here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who also arrived here this morning from the Israeli
capital of Tel-Aviv, briefed Mubarak on the latest development of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Ross, who has been shuttling on an intense
mediating mission between the Palestinians and Israelis, had all
but sewn up the Hebron part of the deal, but the Palestinians have
turned down a U.S. compromise date of 1998 for completing further
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
Arafat insists Israel respect the original timetable under
which the three pullbacks should be finished by September.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks, which is expected to clinch a

the Israelis proposed to postpone the completion of further
withdrawals from the rest of the West Bank until 1999 spring.

<P>
Arafat is scheduled to meet Ross tonight but whether the
meeting will take place here is still unknown.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Residents Support Wall-Repairing Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Bai Hua, a student from Beijing
Normal University, gave her father an unusual 60th birthday
present today: instead of buying a big birthday cake for her dad,
she donated 2,000 yuan of her savings to help repair the old
Beijing Wall.
</P>
<P>
Director Shan Qixiang from the State Bureau of Relics today
thanked 158 individuals, including Bai, as well as 19 institutions
for supporting the Beijing Municipal government program to rebuild
a section of the wall that has guarded Beijing for hundreds of
years.
</P>
<P>
The wall was built to protect the ancient capital city during
the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), but
most of the length of the wall has been demolished over the past
decades to make way for urban expansion.
</P>
<P>
Only a small part of the wall has survived, standing not far
from Beijing Railway Station in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, local people have speedily responded
to the Bureau of Relics' call for the return of old wall bricks
that have been scattered around the city for years. Nearly 30,000
of the bricks have been collected by the Beijing Ancient
Architectural Engineering Company, which is responsible for the
maintenance project.
</P>
<P>
Many of those who can't give bricks have given cash instead,
according to Shan.
</P>
<P>
At today's gathering, Shan said he hopes that the section of
wall will become a symbol of the city, and so the repair project
is of great cultural value to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The program has helped recapture local residents' enthusiasm
for relics protection, he noted.

<HEADLINE> China's Nuclear Industry Makes Significant Breakthrough in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China's nuclear industry has
made significant breakthroughs over the past year, You Deliang,
spokesman for the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), said
at a press conference Friday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"In 1996, China's nuclear industry was marked by the
advancement of key projects," You said. "It has been a busy and
fruitful year for China's nuclear industry."
</P>
<P>
In the past year -- the first year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan
Period (1996-2000) -- all of the four nuclear power projects
planned for this time have been carried out, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China started construction on the main structures of
the second phase of the Qinshan nuclear power project, with two
600,000-kw generating units, located in east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
The country also signed commercial contracts and made
preparations for the third phase of the Qinshan project -- a
Sino-Canadian heavy water reactor nuclear power plant, with two
700,000-kw generating units.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary design of the Ling'ao Nuclear Power Plant in
booming Guangdong Province in south China has been approved by
experts.
</P>
<P>
He added that the State Council, China's highest governing
body, decided last year to shift the site of a Sino-Russian
cooperative nuclear power plant, taking into account the change in
China's energy structure.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear power project, originally planned for construction
in Wentuozi, in northeast China's Liaoning Province, will be built
in Lianyungang, in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
CNNC and Jiangsu Province have jointly set up an office for the
Lianyungang project, he said. During a visit to Russia last year,
Chinese premier Li Peng signed a framework agreement with Russia
on the project, to be equipped with two Russia-made VVER-1000
reactors, each with an installed capacity of one million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's two functioning nuclear power plants,
Qinshan and Daya Bay, were operating stably. The Qinshan plant
operated to full capacity for a record 188 consecutive days. The
steady operation of the plants has built up China's confidence in
building more nuclear power plants in coastal areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Installation of the 300,000-kilowatt Chashma Nuclear Power
Plant, a project exported from China to Pakistan, is well
underway. The nuclear reactor vessel has been positioned in the
plant, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, China's renovation of nuclear fuel factories
and mining of uranium mineral have also made notable progress, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Meet on Peace Stalemate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) leader Yasser Arafat today held a meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni on the stalled peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, PNA Minister of Local
government Saeb Erikat and other senior officials attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also scheduled to meet U.S. envoy Dennis Ross in Gaza
tonight. Ross, who has been intensely mediating between the
Palestinians and Israelis, also arrived here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's MENA news agency today quoted U.S. officials as saying
Ross has nearly sewn up the Hebron deal but Palestinians have
turned down a U.S compromise date of 1998 for completing the last
three Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks on Hebron stalled again when Israel proposed to
putting off the completion of the redeployment until 1999 spring.
</P>
<P>
Arafat insists on strict abidance by the Oslo II accords that
stipulates next September as the final deadline.
</P>
<P>
An previously scheduled meeting between Ross and Arafat on
Friday was canceled after 13 people were wounded in Thursday
night's bomb explosions in the Israeli capital Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has vowed to apply
"extreme severity" if it is confirmed that the two bombs were
planted by guerrillas from the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Arafat fears that Netanyahu will cite violence as a reason for
delaying the transfer of more of the West Bank to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
condemned the blasts and said "We stand by Israel."
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here enroute to Gaza from a few hours' visit to
France where he met with President Jacques Chirac and Former
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres on the sidelines of a ceremony
in memory of late French President Francois Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said in Paris that the Middle East peace process
initiated since 1991 is "on the verge of total collapse" and
feared that the land for peace principle, the basis for the
Arab-Israeli talks, would degenerate into "an empty slogan."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said Israel "literally sabotages the
whole peace accord" by delaying redeployment and creating new
settlements.
</P>
<P>
He said Palestinians are not asking for "the impossible," but
precise execution of the Oslo II peace accords signed in
Washington September 1995.

the first Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with the Jewish
state, has been a strong advocate of the Palestinian cause and a
key partner in the Israeli-Arab talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel has accused Egypt of prompting the Palestinian
uncompromised position in the ongoing talks for a deal on
implementing Israeli partial redeployment from Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Japan to Cooperate in Palm Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian plantation
sectors and Japanese conglomerates are looking into the
possibility of forming a consortium to invest in oil palm
plantation and refinery and distribution of palm oil in the third
world.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Primary Industry Minister Lim Keng Yaik said today
that several Japanese firms had indicated their interest in
financing the consortium with local companies which have cloning
technology and marketing knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after opening a seminar here today, he
said companies in the third world which has vast land and labor
resources would also be asked to join the consortium.
</P>
<P>
Lim said the tripartite arrangement, with huge Japanese fund
and new planting resources, would allow the Malaysian plantation
sectors to invest in oil palm plantation in a big way.
</P>
<P>
Some of the countries the proposed consortium is looking at as
investment opportunities are in South East Asia, the South
Pacific, Latin America and Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that the world's edible oil and fats consumption now
stood at 95 million tons yearly while palm oil occupied 40 percent
of the total edible oil and fats traded.
</P>
<P>
With demand at 50 million tons annually, it has been projected
that another 25 million tons of palm oil will be needed for world
consumption by the year 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would take a lot of effort to produce the extra demand,"
Lim said, adding that Malaysia took more than 30 years to produce
about eight million tons yearly now.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia could only increase its production of palm oil to
about 10 million tons by the next century through improved cloning
technology for higher yields and productivity, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lim also said the government had in the past three years tried
unsuccessfully to gain a foothold in big consuming countries by
relocating the country's refinery overseas and investing in oil
palm plantation in areas where production was between five to six
tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that through investments in oil palm plantation
overseas and the competitiveness of palm oil against other edible
oil, Malaysia was poised to become the number one player in the
edible oil and fats market by the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deplores Bomb Blasts in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States has deplored
the recent blasts in Nigeria and the perpetrators, noting it
"condemns terrorism in all its forms," the New Nigerian newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The United States remains concerned about the dangers posed to
both Nigerians and American citizens by acts of terror and violence,"
said a statement released here on Friday by the U.S. Information
Service.
</P>
<P>
It condemned the perpetrators of the three bombing incidents
in Lagos since December 16, 1996, which have "resulted in at
least six deaths and 29 injured," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, only one death of an army sergeant in Tuesday's
explosion has been officially acknowledged. The Tuesday blast
occurred in one of the busiest commercial areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. statement came following a recent diplomatic row
between the U.S. and Nigeria over the bombing issue, said the
governmental newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was triggered by a U.S. State Department warning
on December 17 that American citizens traveling to or from
Nigeria between December and January 16 should "exercise
caution," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Then U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria Walter Carrington was summoned
to Abuja, Nigeria's capital, by Foreign Affairs Minister Tom
Ikimi for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi was quoted as saying that Carrington's invitation became
necessary for Nigeria to understand what the statement portends.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was worried by the statement which is from such an
important country, said Ikimi, adding that the statement has
driven fears into Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
Carrington, however, said at a press briefing in Lagos that
the safety of U.S. nationals was the sole reason for the issue of
the warning, which had in the past been issued whenever security
situation affected Europe, Asia, Latin America or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
It would be a misunderstanding to interpret it as implying
U.S.'s hostility to the Nigerian government, said the ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Insectarium Opens to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Members of the public will be
presented with a diverse world of insects as Hong Kong's first
insectarium opened today.
</P>
<P>
Located at the Lions Nature Education Center in Sai Kung, the
6-million HK dollar insectarium is one of the very few similar
facilities in Southeast Asia designated for the display of insects
of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
The insectarium composes of an indoor display hall of 1,700
square feet and a net house of 2,000 square feet which provides a
semi-natural environment for live insects.
</P>
<P>
It houses exhibits of over 1,000 species. Exhibits also include
live insects, specimens as well as descriptive panels and
interesting games.
</P>
<P>
There are also a number of enlarged models, showing rate
species of those important insects which are hard to be seen in
the natural environment due to their small size.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Lawrence Lee, director of Agriculture
and Fisheries, said that the insectarium will serve as a catalyst
which could arouse more public interest and concern on the study
and conservation of the mysterious and extremely important group
of creatures.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a very rich insect fauna although it is a
highly-urbanized commercial city, he said, adding that Hong Kong's
country parks and conservation program have preserved a wide
range of indigenous insects.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, part of the information and specimens are
contributed by museums of over 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Northwest Agricultural University, Shanghai
Entomology Research Institute, Nanjing Institute of Termite
Control, South China Agricultural University and Guangdong
Entomological Institute have all contributed to the success of the
insectarium through their valuable advice and assistance in
various aspects.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Reiterates Opposition to Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today reiterated
its opposition to the continued United Nations-imposed economic
sanctions on Iraq, Iraqi National Assembly Chairman Saadoun Hamadi
said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama, Saadoun, who arrived here yesterday for a six-day visit,
said Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told him of the
Malaysian stand during their meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
Saadoun said Mahathir told him that Malaysia also opposed the
unilateral imposition of the "no fly zone" by the United States
and Britain to bar the flight of Iraqi warplanes in certain parts
of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Dr Mahathir also gave the assurance that Malaysia would do her
best to participate in Iraq's oil development program," said
Saadoun who had a 30-minute discussion with Mahathir, according to
Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said Saadoun briefed Mahathir on the current
situation in Iraq, the effects of the sanctions on the Iraqi
people and economy and efforts towards lifting the ban.
</P>
<P>
Saadoun said there was no justification for the UN to continue
the embargo as Iraq had adhered to all the world body's
conditions, including international inspection of Iraqi armaments.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time for the US and the UN to lift the embargo and
there is no excuse left," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that world opinion agreed that it was now the
obligation of the UN to lift the sanctions after Iraq had
fulfilled the conditions.
</P>
<P>
Saadoun said the "oil for food" program, following partial
relaxation of the sanctions, has not fully materialized yet as
Iraq needed some time to receive revenue from the sale of the oil
to buy food.
</P>
<P>
Saadoun described the present health and food conditions in
Iraq as catastrophic because of the embargo which caused a severe
shortage of food and medicine, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 770,000 Iraqis have died up to November last
year due to the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Saadoun believed every state, including small nations, could
help influence the superpowers on removing the sanctions by taking
up the issue and applying pressure at various international fora.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan governmental army
has uprooted rebels in Kampasa, western Kasese District after a
two-week mop-up operation, the local newspaper New Vision
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government troops has now taken a full control of Kampasa,
the former base of the rebel Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The government troops, estimatedly 3,000-strong, and some
local defense units, were involved in the operation in the
Kampasa mountain area, some 40 kilometers northwest of the
border town of Bwera.
</P>
<P>
The battle in Kampasa, regarded by military sources in Bwera
as the last battle with the ADF rebels, cost far more time because
of hard weather and terrain, said the report.
</P>
<P>
There was snow in the equatorial bamboo forest where the
battle was continuing, the report added.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources in Bwera said some ADF rebels have
escaped to the deeper mountain area on the Ugandan-Zairean
border. enditem

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The conflict between Switzerland and world Jewish
organizations is worsening after Avraham Burg, president of the
Jewish Agency, a liaison organization between Israel and Jews in
diaspora, refused to meet with a Swiss envoy charged with
negotiations over the Jewish properties deposited in Swiss banks
before and during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government regards the present crisis as the most
serious since the end of the war, and is highly suspicious about the
intention of Jewish organizations to destroy the image of Swiss
banks.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli police are more and more inclined to a hypothesis of
criminal activity over Thursday's two bombing attacks in Tel
Aviv. The bombs used in the attack were more intended to make a big
sound than cause injuries, said police. Moreover, the explosion took
place in a neighborhood of poor foreign immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- South Korea is paying the price for its success, as tens of
thousands workers of the country are shaking the country with a
two-week long strike which brought the Hyundai automobile production
line to a break-down on Friday. With its per capita income doubling
in every five years, the 13th largest economy of the world can no
longer take advantage of the cheap labor which have let it maintain
the enterprises of old Europe over the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
-- French Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre announced on Friday
that the Vigipirate anti-terrorist operations had been reinforced,
with 1,000 more police and soldiers joining the 2,120 security force
already deployed in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Paris Police Commissioner Philippe Massoni justified the
strengthening of security measures by citing escalating terrorist
activities in some foreign countries, and the condemnation of a
Moroccan terrorist by a Paris court earlier this week.

<HEADLINE> International Oral Implantology Conference Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The third Conference of the
International Congress of Oral Implantologists (ICOI) opened here
today with the participation of experts and scholars from 22
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
As the first oral implantology meeting held in Hong Kong, the
meeting aims to present many new oral implant technologies and
innovations with 19 exhibitors, representing the most
sophisticated manufacturers of oral implants and related products.
</P>
<P>
Co-hosted by the ICOI's Asia-Pacific Section and the Hong Kong
Society of Oral Implantology (HKSOI), the three-day meeting also
consists of lectures and hands-on training courses conducted by
international eminent implantologists.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Yit, representative of HKSOI, said that the meeting is
the golden opportunity and the most convenient venue for the local
professionals as well as those from the countries and regions to
advance themselves in this special field.
</P>
<P>
According to Yit, oral implantology is rapidly developing as
the preferred modality of treatment in Dentistry, but Hong Kong is
still relatively slow in picking up the advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong people are getting more aware of this treatment
option compared to two or three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believes the event will definitely have a
significant impact on the future development of Implant Dentistry
in the Asia-Pacific Region.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Army Chief to Visit Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Ismail Hakki Karadayi, chief of
the general staff of the Turkish Armed Forces, is scheduled to
visit northern Cyprus Monday to pressurize Cyprus into canceling
its deal to buy Russian-made S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued today by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said
that at the invitation of northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktas,
Karadayi will head a delegation of Turkish military officers to
pay a two-day visit to northern Cyprus, which proclaimed itself
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Karadayi informed Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan that the surface-to-air Russian missiles, with a
range of 150 kilometers and to be deployed in the Greek Cypriot
sector of the eastern Mediterranean island, will constitute a
threat to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that this event is "most serious," warning that the
Turkish Armed Forces are ready to take necessary measures in order
to protect the security of the Turkish Cypriots on the island.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000-strong Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus to protect Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Following her meeting with Karadayi Friday, Turkish Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said at an
urgent press conference here that Turkey is ready to attack Cyprus
if the Cypriot government goes ahead with the
250-million-U.S.-dollar deal.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into two parts since the Turkish
troops landed on the island in 1974 to protect the Turkish
Cypriots following an abortive coup by some Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Ministry Spokesman On Guatemala Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen
Guofang said in Beijing today that China voted against a relevant
draft resolution of the UN Security Council concerning the issue
of Guatemala for the sake of defending the "UN Charter" and
safeguarding the legitimate interests of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan government should be held fully responsible for
what has come on, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China has always supported the peace
process of Guatemala as well as relevant resolutions passed by the
UN General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, it is regrettable that the Guatemalan
government has been engaged in activities aimed at creating "Two
Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan" for four consecutive years at
the United Nations, undermining China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the Guatemalan government insisted on inviting the
Taiwan authorities to attend the signing ceremony of the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The action taken by the Guatemalan government had trampled on
the purpose and principles of the "UN Charter" and violated the UN
resolution No. 2758, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
It had also undermined China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, interfered in China's internal affairs and hurt the
national feelings of the Chinese people. "China can not accept it
definitely," He said.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the all the actions taken by the Guatemalan
government which were harmful to China's interests, China has
adopted a constructive and forward-looking attitude towards the
matter, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China had put forward reasonable suggestions
on the settlement of the issue, and expressed the hope that the
Guatemalan government would take practical actions to correct its
fault. However, the Guatemalan government obstinately sticked to
its wrong stand.
</P>
<P>
"The Guatemalan government should not, on the one hand, expect
co-operation from China at the UN Security Council while on the
other, its actions are detrimental to China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"To defend the 'UN Charter' and safeguard the legitimate
interests of the Chinese people, we had to vote against a relevant
draft resolution of the UN security Council. Obviously, the
Guatemalan government should be totally responsible for this," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He used a Chinese saying "let him who tied the bell on the
tiger take it off" (whoever started the trouble should end it) to
urge the Guatemalan government to take actions as soon as possible
to create conditions for the proper settlement of the issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
returned to the golf course here today, 19 days after a surgery in
his right carotid artery to remove a cholesterol lump.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, clad in his favorite mint green shorts and striped green
golf shirt, played nine holes of golf starting at hole No.9 at the
Philippine Navy Golf and Country Club in Manila for two and a half
hours this morning, the presidential palace said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Ramos had a score of 42.
</P>
<P>
Ramos later told reporters that he was given the go-signal to
play golf by his physicians during a medical check-up at his
residence Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was his second check-up since December 23,1996,
immediately before the surgery, at the Makati medical Center here,
and that he is scheduled to undergo another medical check-up next
week at his residence.
</P>
<P>
"The prognosis is very good. That's why I was given the
clearance to play golf this morning," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that his cholesterol count was below 200, which, he
said, is already at the lower limit.
</P>
<P>
Two days before the Christmas, Ramos underwent the surgery to
remove the carotid blockage, which could lead to a stroke.

as "homicide maniac" and eight of his accomplices were executed here
today for killing 17 people including a New Zealander and wounding
five others over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
During the period between October 1994 and August 1996, Zhang
Zhicheng and a dozen of his accomplices from Mayang county, Hunan
province, carried out a series of armed robberies and killings in
Guangzhou and the area of Pearl River Delta, Guangdong provincial
Higher People's Court said in a final verdict today.

<P>
Zhang Zhicheng and his accomplices were convicted of killing 14
people and wounded five others in 18 killing cases, the court said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 10 (Xinhua) -- It is fascinating to know a
country by statistics. A look at the report of Istat (Italy's
statistics bureau) won't be boring.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, the south European nation has had more
divorces and fewer children, more students but jobless as well,
lived longer and spent more.
</P>
<P>
Enjoying an average life expectancy surpassing 80, more Italian
women may be wondering: who will accompany them to the end, since
the average expectancy of the other sex is only 73?
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, to live longer means to spend more. Italy
currently grants more than 20 million pensions at a cost of
240 trillion lire (approximately 150 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Babies seem reluctant to be born to the boot-shaped country.
Its birth rate, the lowest in Europe, is outstripped by its
mortality, which raises concerns.
</P>
<P>
Perceived as party-goers, Italians spent more than one billion
lire on hosting dancing balls in 1994. The total spent on social
activities reached 4.4 billion lire.
</P>
<P>
Italy also appears to be a nation of television fans, with 15.8
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Not everything rings favorable. Although more Italians are
staying in schools and universities to improve their job
prospects, the number of unemployment has risen to 2.7 million, a
6 percent increase over 1994.
</P>
<P>
And the crime rate is going up: in 1994 it rose 40 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Interested? You can find more numbers in Istat's report
entitled "Introducing Italy."

capital, as the starting place.
</P>
<P>
This year will be a significant year for China, which resumes
exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, and the
China National Tourism Administration has designated 1997 "China
Tourism Year".
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region will also develop 10 national-level
scenic sites and 20 other sites with Xinjiang's unique
characteristics, and will hold a grape festival in Turfan in
August.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has opened 30 counties and cities, 11 mountains, and
15 border towns to foreign tourists.
</P>

discounts (20 percent during peak periods and 30 percent in the
off season) to overseas tourist delegations.

<HEADLINE> Thai Hotel Operators to See More Dim Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai hotel operators are
expected to face at least two more years of difficulties with room
supply outpacing tourist arrivals, President of the Thai Hotels
Association Praphansak Bhatyanond said Friday.
</P>
<P>
No improvement was seen in the industry's average occupancy
rate, which has been hovering around 60 percent for three years,
Praphansak was quoted as saying by today' newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok now has more than 65,000 hotel rooms, Praphansak said,
attributing the oversupply to fast-growing new hotels.
</P>
<P>
Many hotels are looking for new management approaches and
cost-cutting campaigns and employment in the industry will be
affected, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that, to tide over the tough years, hotels should
employ more part-time staff and train the existing hotel staff to
handle more responsibilities to help cut costs.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Peace Talks to be Held in Islamabad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The UN-brokered peace talks
between the Afghan Taliban militia and the anti-Taliban alliance
will begin here on Monday, an Afghan party official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, Ral Painda, the
residential representative of Afghan Uzbek Militia led by Rashid
Dostum in Pakistan, said that he will represent Dostum to attend
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the talks included ceasefire, demilitarization of
Kabul, exchange of POWs, formation of a joint security forces and
establishment of a commission for further negotiation on setting
up a government, Painda said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Taliban captured the capital city of Kabul on
September 27, 1996, the ousted government troops led by Ahmad Shah
Masood, the Hezb-i-Wahdat (Khalili group) and the Uzbek Militia
have joined hands against the rising student militia.
</P>
<P>
As the severe winter came, the fighting near Kabul and in
western Afghanistan came to a stalemate, which provided an
opportunity for both sides to sit down and talk.
</P>
<P>
However, local press reported here today that the talks will be
attended by the second-ranking representatives from the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Wakil Ahmad, Masoom Afghani and Abdul Wahab will represent the
Taliban leadership, it said, adding that Rasool Talib will
represent Khalili and Mohammad Ishaq will represent Masood.
</P>
<P>
The talks starting on Monday may last three to four days,
depending on the progress at the table, Painda said.
</P>
<P>
It was worth mentioning that similar talks between the two
sides had been held in Islamabad last November.
</P>
<P>
But that talks ended in failure due to no compromise was made
from the two sides on the power distribution in any future setup.

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Minister Promises Austere Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Amnuay
Virawan has promised that the government's 1998 budget would be an
austere and balanced one, according to local reports today.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay, who is also a deputy prime minister, said Friday the
1998 budget will be based on the government's ability to collect
tax revenue. Thailand's fiscal 1998 begins October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
There has been concern that there may be less tax revenue
because of signs of an economic slowdown resulting partly from
efforts to bring down the current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has decided to slash both the 1997 and 1998 budgets
by 50 billion baht (2 billion US dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said that all cabinet members, the prime minister, as
well as the chiefs of the Armed Forces, are well aware of the
country's current account deficit problem, which is undermining
confidence in the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
He said all ministries are cooperating in reviewing their
spending plans for the new budget, which is to be released in one
month.
</P>
<P>
While this year's budget cuts will affect some major arms
purchases and plans to buy new aircraft for Thai Airways
International (Thai), projections for 1998 are still vague because
of uncertainty surrounding the economy's future.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay has also urged the private sector to be austere as 80
percent of the country's foreign debt is the private sector's.
</P>
<P>
He wanted the private sector to invest in productive industries
so that they can be competitive.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) market ended steadier this week which saw the
benchmark breaking its strong 1,240-resistance twice and interests
spurred after a sharp-correction on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index (CI) added 0.93 of a point to end the week
at 1,232.38, the Emas Index gained 3.09 points to 349.59 while
the Industrial Index was 38.76 points higher at 2,391.80.
</P>
<P>
The week saw retail interest well-spread among main board
lower- liners and second-board counters whose index maintained a
comfortable position above the 600-mark to end the week at 607.01.
</P>
<P>
The market opened Monday on a steady note with the second-board
index climbing the 600-mark after dangling below that level for a
month and the benchmark breaking the 1,240-mark.
</P>
<P>
The better sentiment also paved the way for the main board
counters to outperform the second-boarders after playing
second-fiddle to the much smaller-capitalized stocks for quite
sometime.
</P>
<P>
Sentiment remained intact in the days that followed as
reflected by the swelling volume despite a 51-point fall on Wall
Street on Thursday. A 76-point rebound on the Dow Jones on Friday
helped the local bourse to recover and prepare itself for an
anticipated pre-Chinese New Year rally.
</P>
<P>
The CI on the local front reached its high of 1,243.4 this week
and analysts were convinced that it has more grounds to touch the
1,280- level next month.
</P>
<P>
On the KLSE, the main board volume was 766.343 million shares
worth 4.443 billion ringgit (about 1.78 billion US dollars) from
375.071 million shares valued at 2.41 billion ringgit (about 960
million dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover stood at 327.085 million shares
valued at 3.767 billion ringgit (about 1.51 billion dollars)
against 168.921 million shares worth 1.873 billion ringgit (about
750 million dollars) previously.
</P>
<P>
Off market deals amounted to 237.291 million shares worth 1.329
billion ringgit (about 530 million dollars) compared with 175.705
million shares valued at 1.192 billion ringgit (about 480 million
dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
One counter, Evermaster Group, made its debut on the second
board and four counters suspended during the week.

Crude palm oil (CPO), tin and rubber closed the week mixed with
CPO physicals higher and both tin and rubber lower.

On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), tin price ended the week
lower on lack of buying interests.
</P>
<P>
At the week's close, the metal fell 8 sen to 14.37 ringgit
(about 5.75 dollars) per kg compared with last week's closing of
14.45 ringgit (about 5.78 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
From Monday until Wednesday tin price was in the downtrend in
tandem with the weak performance of the London Metal Exchange
(LME) and heavy offerings, but it rebounded on Thursday following
improved performance of the LME.
</P>
<P>
However, tin price fell again on the closing day as there were
lack of buying interests on the local market despite the better
performance of the LME.
</P>
<P>
Turnover for the week rose to 456 tons from 377 tons the
previous week and transactions on the local market this week was
mainly dominated by European and local players.
</P>
<P>
The premium between the KLTM and that of the LME widened to 90
dollars per ton from 55 dollars per ton last week.
</P>
<P>
And the Malaysian rubber market also closed the week lower in
quiet trading as foreign buyers shied away from the local market
due to the strengthening of ringgit against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
February RSS One closed the week 9.5 sen lower to 306.50 sen
(about 122.6 US cents) per kg while SMR 20 dipped 6.5 sen to
304.00 sen (about 121.6 US cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit stood at 2.4847/54 on Friday compared to 2.5240/50
the previous Friday.
</P>
<P>
The close of the Tokyo and Kobe rubber futures this week left
most of the local players without clear market direction.
</P>
<P>
Dealers hoped that the market would improve next week as they
anticipated foreign players to return to cover their positions
while the Tokyo and Kobe rubber futures, which would be opened
next week, would provide a better market direction.

<HEADLINE> Italian Bankers' Chief Calls For Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Italian Bankers
Association, Tanoredi Bjanchi, called for lower interest rates
today.
</P>
<P>
The bankers' chief said, "The reduction of the cost of money is
decisive for participation in the European Monetary Union" while
calling on the government to boldly pursue the privatization
process.
</P>
<P>
In a New Year's message sent out to the nation's bankers,
Bjanchi said another reason for lowering interest rates is to
avert a "budget policy which is so rigid as to arouse fears of an
economic recession in our country."
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, the association leader cited important
developments such as "monetary policy and the international trend
on the money and financial markets (which) have brought the
country close to achieving three of the five Maastricht
parameters" for joining European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Also figuring in is "the new exchange rate of the lira fixed at
a ratio which is more favorable than that requested by other
countries," when the Italian currency returned to the European
Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism in November last year.
</P>
<P>
Looking back to 1996, Bjanchi said it was a year which was
"substantially lost" as far as the privatization process was
concerned. "Italy's eventual participation in EMU cannot be
separated from a privatization process which is not timid, one
which cannot be delayed or braked." he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada is likely to nudge
Thailand to set up a space agency when Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien leads a huge delegation to the country next week, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
That would be part of Canada's efforts to expand its
cooperation on space research with Thailand after the two
countries signed a memorandum of understanding in the area in
October 1994 when then Thai prime minister Chuan Leekpai visited
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Virasakdi Futrakul, Thai ambassador to Canada, said on Friday
that Canada has conducted the feasibility of establishing the
agency and it is likely to present a proposal to Thailand to
establish the agency next week.
</P>
<P>
Canada has expertise in remote sensing technology and it would
help Thailand to start a small satellite project to survey natural
resources, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is scheduled to lead a 500-member delegation,
including all provincial governors and some 300 businessmen to
visit Thailand from January 16 to 20.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are expected to sign six agreements,
including one on quality control of Thai fisheries products.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that Canada was also interested in bidding
in construction and telecommunication projects in the greater
Mekong subregion scheme.

<HEADLINE> Panama Insists Antidrug Center Be Headed By Civilian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Panama today insisted that
a civilian be the head of the proposed multinational anti-drug
center in Panama.
</P>
<P>
Oyden Ortega, president of the Legislative Assembly
International Affairs Commission and former foreign minister, made
the statement when referring to a proposal for setting up an
anti-drug center in U.S. Howard Air Base, the biggest U.S.
overseas base in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was put forward last October when U.S. General
Barry McCaffrey met Panamanian President Ernesto Baladares.
</P>
<P>
The coordinating agency for Panamanian promoting organizations
pointed out that such a center, if led by a military officer,
would imply permanent U.S. military presence in Panama and could
be used as "a center of regional espionage."
</P>
<P>
Under the Torrijos-Carter Treaty, U.S. troops should completely
withdraw from the Canal Zone and return all its military bases to
Panama before December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and
late Panamanian Prime Minister Omar Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
The United States has rejected the request of the Panamanian
government for compensation for any extension of its military
bases in Panama. It maintains a force of 7,000 military personnel
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Panama Canal, about 81 kilometers long, is a waterway
connecting the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific. It is capable of
making a voyage from Europe to Asia about 10,000 kilometers
shorter than traveling around the southernmost tip of South
America.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition MPs Warned for Continued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi opposition members of
parliament (MPs) have been warned that by-polls would be held if
they failed to return to the house in 90 days.
</P>
<P>
The warning was sent by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is
also president of the ruling Awami League, at a meeting here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
has been abstaining from parliament sessions since last November.
It placed a 10-point demand including neutrality of the speaker,
neutral coverage of the proceedings of the house by the state-run
Bangladesh television (BTV) and release of arrested party workers.
</P>
<P>
"I personally communicated with both the opposition chief whip
and the BNP secretary general, invited them to return to the house
and resolve grievances through discussions. If they don't return,
by-elections will become inevitable and that's the provision,"
Hasina warned.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, a member of parliament shall
vacate his seat if he is absent from parliament, without the leave
of parliament, for 90 consecutive sitting days. It means that a
by-poll shall be held for the vacated seat.
</P>
<P>
"Return to the house. let's discuss how we can make the
parliament more effective. If necessary, we will arrange a second
channel of the BTV for wide coverage of proceedings," the prime
minister urged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BNP chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia Friday said that
her party is the strongest political force to protest the
activities of the present government and urged the partymen to
organize the people from all walks of life to prepare for a
greater movement.

CARACAS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Venezuela

government's efforts to establish macroeconomic balance in the
country, said a financial daily today.
</P>
<P>
The deficit left from the previous year was reverted by the
short term capital account, because of the input of 600 million
dollars of private capital in 1996.

This contrasts with a 2.48 billion dollar deficit registered in
1995 after the government abolished control on foreign exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government will try
to improve its ailing agriculture in 1997 by increasing investment
in this sector, Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko said today.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko made the statement at the National Conference on
Agriculture, which was also attended by President Leonid Kuchma
and Parliament Speaker Alexander Moroz.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural recession has posed a major threat to the
former Soviet republic in recent years. Its grain output totaled
only 24-26 million tons last year, a record low in five years.
</P>
<P>
The government has carried out many reform measures in the
countryside, but little progress was made because of a tight
financial policy.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko said that the 1997 budget will allocate one billion
hryvnas (about 541 million U.S. dollars) to the agricultural
sector. An extra 550 million hryvnas (about 297 million dollars)
will go to livestock husbandry.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Debts Amount to 110 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign debts had
reached 110 billion US dollars at the end of 1996, Governor of
Bank Indonesia J. Soedraddjad Djiwandono said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor was quoted as saying by today's local
press that out of the debts, 56 billion dollars, or 51 percent are
consisted of government loans.
</P>
<P>
The government loans in 1996 declined by 2.9 billion dollars
compared with that in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The decline was caused by the depreciation of the Japanese yen
against the US dollar and the shortened period on the payment of
the government's high-interest loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, while the government's loans have declined,
the debt service ratio in 1996/97 was estimated to be still high,
reaching 31.7 percent, slightly lower than the previous year's
32.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The still high debt ratio has something to do with a drop in
the country's export rate of increase, the increase in the
offshore loans of private companies and the shortened period of
the payment of government offshore loans, he added.
</P>
<P>
In line with an increased role of private businesses in the
government's national development, the offshore commercial loans
incurred by private companies have been increasing, reaching 54
billion dollars in 1996, said the governor.

<HEADLINE> China Vetoes Resolution on Guatemala Military Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China today vetoed a
United Nations draft resolution authorizing military observers for
Guatemala after the Central American country refused to correct
its mistakes on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
The draft would allow 155 military observers to go to Guatemala
for three months to monitor the implementation of a U.N.-brokered
peace agreement signed on December 29, 1996 in Guatemala city.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a situation we would like to see," said Chinese
Ambassador to the U.N., Qin Huasun, after casting the only
negative vote against the draft resolution. "It is caused entirely
by the erroneous acts of the government of Guatemala," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that China has used its power of veto as
one of the five permanent members of the Security Council since it
regained its post in the U.N. in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, any authorization of the council should
obtain concurrent agreement of the five countries, which are
China, France, Russia, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said, "China has all along supported the peace
process in Guatemala and the relevant resolutions adopted by the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, however, the government of Guatemala has, for
four consecutive years, unscrupulously supported activities aimed
at splitting China in the U.N., which flagrantly violated the
Purposes and Principles of the U.N. Charter in disregard of
repeated exhortation of the Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Qin pointed out, the Guatemalan government was
bent on inviting, in disregard of the solemn warnings of the
Chinese government, the Taiwan authorities to the signing ceremony
of the Peace Agreement in Guatemala, thereby providing them with a
venue for secessionist activities against China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Guatemalan envoys have been negotiating on the
issue for the past month. Although Guatemala said in a letter to
the Security Council that it "respects the contents of Resolution
2758 of the General Assembly," it neither made any apology for its
mistakes on Taiwan issue nor any substantive move to improve its
relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 2758 adopted in 1971 recognizes the People's
Republic of China as the sole legal government representing the
entire Chinese people. Any trample of the resolution is considered
by China as infringement upon its sovereignty and territorial
integrity and interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The Guatemalan authorities," said Ambassador Qin, "can not
expect to have the cooperation of China in the Security Council
while taking actions to infringe upon China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
"No country's peace process should be at the expense of another
country's sovereignty and territorial integrity," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
But he said if the Guatemalan government indeed treasures its
peace process and makes sincere moves toward removing the
obstacles, China may reconsider the authorization of the
deployment of military observers in Guatemala by the Security
Council.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Opposition Walks Out of Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Parliament members of Bulgaria's
opposition party, Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), walked out of
the National Assembly on Friday to join a street protest against
the government.
</P>
<P>
UDF deputies in the assembly joined demonstrators outside the
parliament building after they announced their decision to walk
out of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Kostov, the opposition leader, told reporters that the UDF
could no loner stay in parliament due to the recent conflict with
the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BPS).
</P>
<P>
Kostov said his party would call a nation-wide strike to
boycott the government.
</P>
<P>
The UDF accused the government of mis-handling the economy and
initiated a "salvation declaration," calling for early elections
in March and all-party negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank on economic programs.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Zhan Videnov resigned on December 21 amid
criticism, but the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BPS) rejected
UDF's "salvation declaration." It nominated Interior Minister
Nikolai Dobrev as new prime minister on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government denounced the street protests, saying
that they would only intensify the tension. It warned that the
government will take measures against illegal actions.
</P>
<P>
The UDF has been organizing nationwide demonstrations and
protests since the beginning of this year, pressing for an early
election.

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Dutchman Ids Postma claimed a
gold medal in the 500me and a silver in the 5,000 Friday to help
him a commanding lead in the all-round European Speedskating
Championships in Heernveen, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Emese Hunyady took the women's 500m gold, the first,
clocking 41.20 seconds. Dutchwoman Tonny de Jong was second with a
personal best 41.35, which boosted her campaign to unseat German
ice queen Gunda Niemann.
</P>
<P>
Niemann, who has won seven European all-round titles in the
last eight years, was below peak fitness and came in 0.69 seconds
slower than De Jong to be tied for seventh place.
</P>
<P>
Niemann must skate 2.07 seconds faster than De Jong in
Saturday's 1,500 meters to catch up with her Dutch rival.

in 37.51 and defending all-round champion Rintje Ritsma third in
37.91.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Calls for Lawful Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of Home
Affairs Yogie S. Memet has called on all parties competing in the
May 29 general election to abide by all the rules, according to
local reports today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 24th anniversary celebration of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) Friday in Tentena, central Sulawesi, Yogie
said that the three political groupings, the public and the
Election Committee needed to understand all the recent regulations
issued by the government to avoid committing either criminal,
administrative or political offenses.
</P>
<P>
The three officially-recognized parties, the ruling Golkar, PDI
and the United Development Party (PPP) will compete in the
forthcoming elections for 425 seats in the parliament.
Seventy-five other seats are to be filled by members of the
Indonesian Armed Forces appointed by the president.
</P>
<P>
The government last month issued a presidential decree which
recommended each contestant only allowed to campaign via public
assemblies, media broadcasts, leaflets, flyers and other printed
matter during the official campaign period from April 29 to May
23.
</P>
<P>
The government insisted that mass rallies during past elections
frequently turned into brawls.
</P>
<P>
The government-backed PDI chief Soerjadi celebrated the its
24th anniversary Friday in central Sulawesi and ousted chief
Megawati Soeharnoputri at her residence in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Enlivening Soerjadi's party were chief of the armed forces
General Feisal Tanjung and the minister of home affairs while
Megawati's guests were Abdul Madjid and Sabam Sirait, aging
politicians who help found the party in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Soerjadi ousted Megawati in a government-backed congress in
Medan, north Sumatra, in June last year. But Megawati insists the
maneuver was illegal and maintains she is still the legitimate
leader.

<HEADLINE> Panucci Says Good-bye to Sacchi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 10 (Xinhua) -- AC Milan defender Christian
Panucci had bitter words for coach Arrigo Sacchi as he said
farewell to his club here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Considered a casualty of the new coach's promise to get the
team back to its winning ways, Panucci will sign his new contract
with Spain's Real Madrid, where he will be reunited with former
Milan coach Pabio Capello.
</P>
<P>
"I am sad, but I was favored to leave," the 23-year-old
defender told reporters upon leaving Milan's training facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should be allowed to say we are not professionals,"
said Panucci, referring to Sacchi's harsh criticism following last
Sunday's 3-0 loss to Lazio.
</P>
<P>
Sacchi also accused some players of "not trying hard enough"
and of "not being professionals."
</P>
<P>
"I am going to a club that appreciates me and which has a coach
that likes me," Panucci said. "My relationship with Capello was
not always great. There were times when we got mad at each other,
but after five minutes we calmed down.
</P>
<P>
"But (with Sacchi) the relationship was no longer good. Sacchi
is an outstanding coach, and at first things were going well
between us. But then, in this difficult period, things just
degenerated.
</P>
<P>
"He told me that there are many defenders here, that must mean
that he will make own decisions. He is someone who believes first
in his game plan, then in the players."
</P>
<P>
Milan defender Billy Costacurta, one of the players observers
have blamed for the team's woes, told reporters: "You have to ask
(club management) why Christian left. All I can say is that
Panucci is one of the best outside defenders in Europe. He
received a great offer and he decided to take it."
</P>
<P>
Costacurta said he took exception to Sacchi's criticism, saying
the coach should have named names. "I do not agree with Sacchi
when he generalizes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Striker Roberto Baggio agreed with Costacurta.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it would have been better if he had named some names
because now we are preparing for a very difficult game with
Vicenza," Baggio said.
</P>
<P>
The former European footballer expressed his surprise at
Panucci's departure. "At the start of the season, this was the
last thing I would have imagined," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Builds Eco-agriculture Belt Along Taihu Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- An eco-agriculture belt is to be
established along the Taihu lake, in southern part of east China's
Jiangsu Province, a traditionally advanced region of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou city governments have devoted
efforts to ensuring that all the counties in the Taihu lake region
are built into eco-agriculture areas by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Taihu lake region will become an example of eco-agriculture
with higher agriculture production and lower pollution, helping to
protect the lake resources.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the water of Taihu lake comes within the
jurisdiction of Suzhou city. The city government has spread the
technology of applying biological pesticide, and put 50 million
yuan into the basic facilities of an experimental eco-agriculture
system along Taihu lake. As a result, 90 percent of plant diseases
have been erased.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou government has also spread the use of compound
fertilizers with rationable proportions of nitrogen, phosphorus
and potassium.
</P>
<P>
The "Ten Eco-agriculture Projects" executed by Changzhou
government include an eco-agriculture construction project, which
is designed to transform 17,000 hectares of low yield grain field,
build a combination system of agriculture and forest with Chinese
chestnuts, tea plantations and ginkgo fields, and construct 86
eco-agricultural villages.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazil registered a 10.5
billion U.S. dollar trade surplus in agricultural produce at the
end of 1996, the Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The surplus, a 10.9 percent increase over the previous year,
was achieved after Brazil exported 12.80 billion dollars of farm
produce while importing only 2.30 billion dollars of agricultural
products, the ministry's Economic Policy Secretariat said in a
report.
</P>
<P>
Soybean, tobacco, orange juice, and meat contributed most to
the growth in the country's produce exports, which were valued at
4.4 billion dollars last year and 3.79 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that Brazil's agricultural produce exports
will reach 13.64 billion dollars in 1997, a 10.7 percent growth

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Turns to Internet for Technology Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China's largest city of
Shanghai plans to load its technology export information onto the
Internet later this year in an effort to boost exports, according
to a city official.
</P>
<P>
Other immediate measures for technology exports are setting up
a special fund for the development of new and high technology and
launching a technology exhibition fair in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai's technology export recovered from its doldrums last
year and is expected to bring in 500 million US dollars in hard
currency this year," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Shanghai made a record 400 million US dollars
from technology exports in 1996, up 64 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Normally, over 300 Shanghai units export each year a total of
200 items of new and high technology, which the official said has
emerged as a driving force for Shanghai's technology export.
</P>
<P>
Some of the items were valued at more than 10 million US
dollars each, the official said, adding that the export market has
expanded to some developed countries in Europe and America from
mainly developing countries in Southeast Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
As China's largest economic and industrial center, Shanghai is
poor in natural resources but rich in scientific and technological
talent.
</P>
<P>
The city, with a population of well over 10 million, has more
than 1,300 research institutes and produces over 2,000 scientific
and technological results each year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Shanghai will make a greater effort to
boost technology export during the ongoing Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The annual growth for technology export earnings has been set
at around 40 percent for the five years, to a target of one
billion US dollars for the year 2000, with 20 percent of the
amount expected to come from the exports of new and high
technology.

<P>
HEFEI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite heavy natural disasters,
east China's Anhui Province has maintained a rapid development
pace over the past year, according to a local government official.
</P>
<P>
People in the province overcame flooding in 1996, turning
out a record 13.5 billion kilograms of grain and high yields of
edible oil and cotton.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province produced 2.15 million tons of meat,
up 8.7 percent on an annual basis, one million tons of aquatic
products, up 33 percent, and 600,000 tons of fruits, up 13.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises have maintained a strong momentum,
generating a turnover of 365 billion yuan (about 44 billion US
dollars) in 1996, a rise of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output value has also increased. From January to
November last year, enterprises at township level and above
generated an output value of 145.1 billion yuan (about 17.5
billion US dollars), rising 19.3 percent from the corresponding
period in 1995. This increase rate ranks third in the country.
</P>

reforms have occurred in 44.7 percent of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that from January to November, imports
volume totalled 780 million US dollars, up 30.4 percent, and

investment.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hagi Takes FIFA and UEFA to Court, Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Louis Dupont, the lawyer
who changed the soccer history in the Bosman case, wants to beat
FIFA, UEFA and Barcelona on behalf of Romanian midfielder Gheorghe
Hagi, according to reports reaching here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The action is designed to allow players from countries with
special treaties with the European Union to be treated on a par
with EU players, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Xavier Anoveros, a lawyer who is working alongside Dupont,
outlined his client's case on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"After the Bosman sentence no fee can be charged for a transfer
if a player is out of contract...and players from countries which
have labor equality agreements with the EU can have the same
treatment as if they were community players," Anoveros was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona had asked Galatarasay for 241 million pesetas ($1.84
million) as a fee for Hagi's transfer in the summer and have
retained part of his final pay-check after both the club and Hagi
refused to make the payment.
</P>
<P>
The case involving Belgian player Jean-Marc Bosman led to a
rewriting of the rule-book a year ago concerning players' rights
after a Brussels court outlawed quotas that limited the number of
EU players in sports sides within the Union. It also changed the
laws on players' transfers.
</P>
<P>
Bosmans's lawyer, Dupont, argues further that Barcelona, the
European soccer body UEFA and the world body FIFA should not be
allowed to endanger Hagi's professional relationship with
Galatarasary, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Hagi also points to the fact that he had signed for Real Madrid
in 1990 and had played in EU countries for six years before moving
to Turkey, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Experts consulted by the Barcelona-based daily Sport prior to
Friday's press conference said that Hagi could only have taken
advantage of the EU legislation if he had signed for a club within
the Union.

<P>
The industry conducted 2.9 billion yuan-worth of exports last

boost to manufacturing capacity of some products which were
formerly in short supply, such as urea and radial tires.
</P>
<P>
The industry added 11 enterprise groups in 1996, bringing the
total to the current 40. Some local chemical factories raised
funds on the stock markets, gaining more than 400 million yuan for
production expansion in 1996.

<HEADLINE> IAAF to Hear Capobianco Case Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- An arbitration panel of the world
athletics governing body next month will hear the case of the
Australian sprinter Dean Capobianco, who faces a four-year ban
after a positive test for anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF announced in Monte Carlo on Friday the panel would
meet on February 8-9 to discuss the sprinter's claims that a
positive dope test in Hengelo, the Netherlands, in May last year
could have been caused by eating contaminated meat.
</P>
<P>
"I have irrefutable scientific evidence showing the IAAF have
known for years that athletes can test positive for some of their
banned drugs simply by eating meat contaminated by the same
drugs," Capobianco said recently.
</P>
<P>
Among the evidence Capobianco will present is the fact that the
European Community have banned the use of anabolic agents on
livestock because of fears it may be transmitted through the food
chain.

<HEADLINE> US: Briefing on 4-Party Talks Probably at Month's End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A U.S.-South Korea
briefing for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on
proposed four-party talks is expected to take place towards the
end of January, a U.S. State Department spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"Arrangements for the upcoming joint briefing on the four-party
talks are under discussion, and I think the joint briefing will
probably be held towards the end of this month," Nicholas Burns
told reporters at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said David Straub, deputy director of the State Department's
Korea Office, met DPRK officials in New York Thursday. But the
meeting failed to pin down details of the joint briefing, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"What we need to work out with the North Koreans is where that
will take place, who will attend, and a specific date. We don't
have that worked out yet," Burns said.

<HEADLINE> US to Send Envoy to Cyprus to Defuse Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
is sending a senior official to Cyprus this weekend to scale down
rising tensions on the Mediterranean island following disputes
over the Cypriot government's military deal with Russia and
Turkey's threat of attack, the U.S. State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters that
Carey Cavanaugh, U.S. envoy for southern Europe, who is meeting
with European leaders at the Hague this week for talks on the
situation in Cyprus, would head to the island Sunday for talks
with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh will also head to Greece Monday and to Turkey
Wednesday for talks with foreign ministry officials from those two
countries, who have long been at odds over the issue of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We've been concerned by the escalation of rhetoric in the
eastern Mediterranean over the last couple of days," Burns said.
He said Cavanaugh's mission was "to talk to the Greeks and Turks,
to the Cypriot government, to the other parties on Cyprus about
this situation in an attempt to see if we can revive some momentum
towards discussions concerning the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Tensions have heightened on the divided island this week
following the Cypriot government's announcement that it would
deploy Sa-10 anti-aircraft missiles if purchased from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Over the past days, Burns said, the United States objected
strongly to the missile deal, saying it could escalate the arms
build-up in the already extremely militarized island. It also
criticized Turkish officials for threatening a possible military
strike against Cyprus if the SA-10s were deployed.
</P>
<P>
At today's news briefing, Burns reiterated, "Any threat of the
use of force, any decision to use force, is absolutely beyond the
bounds of acceptable international behavior."
</P>
<P>
"We think that everyone in the eastern Mediterranean -- Turks,
Greeks, Cypriots, the parties on Cyprus -- should draw back from
this type of aggressive public rhetoric," he added.
</P>
<P>
Burns said Cavanaugh was "going to be urging the parties to
implement concrete actions that will reduce tensions immediately,"
including "eliminating some of the provocative military exercises
that we've all seen in the eastern Mediterranean (and) taking
steps to reduce overall military activities and to improve safety
along the cease-fire lines on Cyprus itself."

<HEADLINE> Quebec Executives Pessimistic About Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Business leaders in the Canadian
province of Quebec remain highly pessimistic about the province's
economic and political climate more than a year after the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Only 2 percent of the 136 executives surveyed in December
considered economic conditions in Quebec to be "very good."
Another 36 percent said they are "good."
</P>
<P>
And 75 percent of the respondents said they do not expect the
province's economic climate to improve during the first half of
this year despite Premier Lucien Bouchard's pledges to slash the
deficit.
</P>
<P>
As to the province's political situation, business leaders are
even more gloomy. Only 8 percent described it as "good" while
almost two-thirds said it is "poor" or "very poor."
</P>
<P>
A third of those surveyed by the Conseil du Patronat group said
they expect it to deteriorate further during the first half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The findings are based on the responses of leading executives
in the province whose companies employ 117,500 Quebeckers, the
Globe and Mail newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, business leaders are increasingly concerned about
the labor relations climate in the province even though there were
fewer strikes last year than during all but one of the past 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Some one-third of the respondents said they expect the labor
relations to deteriorate this year.

<HEADLINE> American, British Airways Request US Permission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- American Airlines and
British Airways applied today for the U.S. government's permission
to create the world's largest airline alliance for competing in
the trans-Atlantic market.
</P>
<P>
However, a U.S. spokesman for the Transportation Department
made it clear that the government wouldn't approve unless Britain
agreed to an open-skies accord with the United States to ease
restrictions on rival carriers, which could suffer from such a
transportation giant.
</P>
<P>
British Airways and American Airlines, which announced the
proposed alliance last June, applied with the U.S. Transportation
Department for antitrust immunity to permit them to coordinate
their passenger and cargo activities between the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The proposed alliance between the two big airlines, which could
take a firm control of 60 percent of the British-U.S. market, even
though the two airlines claimed they are not merging and will only
maintain separate corporate identities in a partnership.
</P>
<P>
But rival airlines complained that the American-British Airways
alliance is a bigger threat to competition than previous deals
because the routes involved are major U.S. gateways to England and
the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The United States has open-skies agreements with a dozen
countries and air transportation pacts with nearly 30 others. The
next round of open-skies talks between the United States and
Britain is set for February 4 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the U.S. Justice Department opened an antitrust
investigation into the proposed British Airways-American alliance.
Virgin Atlantic Airways, the main rival to British Airways, filed
an antitrust lawsuit in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Corrosion Not Posing Safety Problem: AECL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The corroded pipes at the Point
Lepreau nuclear power plant in New Brunswick and its sister
reactor in Gentilly, Quebec, don't pose a safety problem, Atomic
Energy of Canada Ltd. (AECL) said today.
</P>
<P>
Even if the pipes did leak, they would only release steam, not
radioactive material, the crown agency stressed.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported today the discovery of a design flaw
at the New Brunswick Candu nuclear plant, where the feeder pipes
of the reactor are thinning because of unexpected corrosion.
</P>
<P>
"Corrosion problems... could be endemic to all of Canada's 22
Candu reactors," said an official with Canada's Atomic Energy
Control Board.
</P>
<P>
"If the corrosion cannot be corrected, it could mean an early
death for some, if not all, of Canada's nuclear reactors," Iain
Lee, the board's on-site inspector at Lepreau, noted.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by the media, AECL spokesman Ed Price insisted that
these claims are "incorrect."
</P>
<P>
The rate of corrosion in pipes at some reactors can probably be
slowed by changing the coolant to make it less alkaline, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
AECL is responsible for almost all the nuclear-energy research
and development here in Canada to support the design and
construction of Candu nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
The corrosion of pipes is occurring at the rate of about 0.1 to
0.15 millimeters a year, Price said, adding that at that rate it
would take four or five years before pipes need to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
"This allows time to research the problem. I am quite confident
that we can find a solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Price, the reactors would have to be shut down for
some two months if the pipes had to be changed.
</P>
<P>
Pipe replacement would probably cost 18 million U.S. dollars
per reactor, he added.

<HEADLINE> French Police Arrest Suspect of Group Rape of Woman Cop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- French police arrested earlier
this week a 19-year-old man of North African origin who was
accused of being involved in a group rape assault against a woman
cop in October on an underground train in the Paris suburb.
</P>
<P>
Djamel Eddouibi, a cook being on military service in a cadet
school in Yvelines outside Paris, was formally recognized by the
assaulted woman cop, according to the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old woman cop, whose name is not disclosed, was
assaulted when she was finishing one day's work as a security
guard at an underground train station in the suburb of Paris on
October 25, 1996.
</P>
<P>
She said that she was abducted by five young men aged from 16
to 20, four of them North Africans and one black, to a car of a
train, in which she was brutally beaten up, injured and raped.
</P>
<P>
Police are now hunting down the other four suspects, after
arresting Eddouibi in Evry, 50 kilometers south of Paris,
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The far right National Front party today congratulated the
police for having arrested the suspect, and expressed its hope
that his accomplices would be arrested soon.
</P>
<P>
Police have accused the suspect of "group rape, carrying out,
accompanying or following tortures or acts of barbarity, voluntary
violence and robbery."
</P>
<P>
The woman cop said that when the assault took place, one man
was sitting in the car and did nothing to stop the assaulters.
Police have so far failed in finding the man.

<HEADLINE> Dow Surpasses 6,700 Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 10 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rallied today,
boosting the Dow Jones industrials above 6,700 for the first time
despite another strong economic report which sent interest rates
soaring.
</P>
<P>
The Dow gained 78.12 points to close at 6,703.79. The Dow,
which broke above 6,000 for the first time less than three months
ago, gained 159.70 for the week.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues had trailed decliners by more than a 5-to-1
margin near the open on the New York Stock Exchange, but finished
with a narrow lead.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 545.75 million shares, slightly down from
554.10 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader market measures also jumped to new highs, turning
positive in the afternoon despite the sharp drop in bonds, which
sent long-term interest rates to their highest level since
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list and the NYSE composite
index both closed at record highs for the first time since
November 25. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 4.59 to 759.44, and the NYSE
composite rose 2.18 to 400.76, its first finish above 400.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.59 to 1,329.26, its third
record high this week, and the American Stock Exchange composite
index jumped 4.30 to 586.04.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 list of smaller companies, which in Thursday's
advance hit a new high for the first time since May 22, padded
that record by 0.50 to set a new mark at 366.09.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were dragged lower at the open after bonds plunged on a
government report showing that businesses added a surprising
262,000 jobs in December, well above analysts forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The increase, which held the unemployment rate steady at 5.3
percent, indicated that the economy closed out 1996 at a
surprisingly quick, and potentially inflationary, pace.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices sank, the yield on the 30-year Treasury jumped
as high as 6.90 percent from late Thursday's 6.76 percent.
</P>
<P>
Heavy industrial issues, whose fortunes are dependent on the
health of the economy, were among the Dow's strongest issues. The
Dow also drew another big boost from Texaco and Exxon, which have
benefited from the recent jump in oil prices.

<HEADLINE> UN Official: Situation in Prevlaka Basically Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official said here
today that the situation in the demilitarized zone of Prevlaka, a
controversial peninsula on the Yugoslav-Croatian border, is
basically stable despite the constant tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Susan Manuel, spokeswoman of the U.N. liaison office in
Belgrade, said at a press conference that the U.N. Security
Council would decide next week on the extension of the mandate of
the international military observers, which expires on January 15
of this year, on Prevlaka.
</P>
<P>
Prevlaka is a strategic peninsula on the Adriatic coast where
28 unarmed U.N. monitors are stationed to ward off any potential
military conflicts between Yugoslavia and Croatia. The two
neighboring countries clashed in 1991 over the tiny peninsula but
the fighting was stopped a few months later when the U.N.
intervened and sent military observers to the disputed place.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest political crisis in Yugoslavia, Manuel
said the U.N. secretary general's spokesman Fred Eckhard had told
the Belgrade U.N. office Wednesday that the law and democratic
processes in the country must be respected.
</P>
<P>
But Eckhard had also underscored the importance of free and
fair elections and expressed the hope that the interested parties
would reach a satisfactory solution, Manual added.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian opposition coalition Zajedno has organized daily
demonstrations over the past 54 days to protest the annulment of
November 17 election results by the government. The opposition's
protest rallies continued today to demand the recognition of the
opposition's victory in local elections in most large cities in
Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Jobless Rate Drops Slightly to 9.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in Canada
dropped slightly to 9.7 percent in December 1996 after two months
of being at 10 percent, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
An increase in adult employment and a decline in the number of
youths in the labor force combined to bring the rate down, the
federal fact-gathering agency noted.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Calls for Maximum Restraint in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today expressed concern over the growing tension
between the two communities in Cyprus and urged all parties
concerned on the eastern Mediterranean island to "exercise the
maximum restraint."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief's statement was issued through his acting
spokesman Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general believes that the events of the past week
on the divided island "once again underline the inherent
instability of the status quo and add urgency to the concerted
efforts to achieve an overall political settlement through
negotiations," Eckhard said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that the U.N. Security Council "has
expressed grave concern about the excessive levels of military
forces and armaments" in Cyprus and "the rate at which they are
being expanded, upgraded and modernized, including the
introduction of sophisticated weaponry."
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general reminded all sides that the United
Nations Charter forbids the threat or use of force, and
underscored the importance of "carefully prepared face-to-face"
talks between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
communities.

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Monitors Confirm Katyusha Attack on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A five-nation committee
monitoring a limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli border
confirmed tonight that "at least one Katyusha rocket" was fired
into northern Israel from south Lebanon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement following a meeting in the south Lebanese
border town of Naqoura, the cease-fire monitoring committee said
that the committee "unanimously accepted it as a fact that at
least one Katyusha rocket was fired into Israel from Qleileh
area in Lebanon on January 8."
</P>
<P>
The committee comprising U.S., French, Syrian, Lebanese and
Syrian delegates held the meeting in the headquarters of the
U.N. peacekeeping forces in south Lebanon, to discuss a
complaint by Israel against Lebanon over the Katyusha
offensive.
</P>
<P>
It said in the statement that it regarded the event as a
"violation of the April understanding," a cease-fire agreement
brokered by the United States and France to put an end to a
17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the Lebanese government, in line with its
commitment to the understanding and its responsibility on its
obligations, has done what was needed in order to guarantee its
adherence to the understanding.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which was set up in August under the April
understanding, welcomed the tangible measures taken by the
Lebanese authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Foreign Ministry, on the other hand, issued a
statement tonight, welcoming outcomes of today's meeting of the
cease-fire committee.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the committee did not "hold Lebanon
responsible" for Launching Katyusha rockets into northern Israel
but agreed that Lebanon's handling of the issue guaranteed a
continuous respect of the April understanding.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the official Lebanese National News
Agency (LNNA) confirmed tonight that the Lebanese authorities
arrested two Palestinians for an alleged link with the Wednesday
Katyusha offensive, the second in less than one month.
</P>
<P>
The state-run LNNA quoted judicial sources as saying that the
two men detained by the security forces were members of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, two Damascus-based radical
Palestinian organizations strongly opposed to the current peace
talks between Israel and the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese leaders had called for an careful investigation into
the event in order to find out who was behind it.
</P>
<P>
President Elias Hrawi said that "there is no military value
in such attacks which do not hurt Israel and only undermine
Lebanon."

<HEADLINE> Canadian Gov't Lends Handsomely to Aircraft Engine Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is
lending 107 million U.S. dollars to Pratt and Whitney Canada in
support for the aerospace firm's engine research and development
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Aerospace is a crucial sector for Canada's economy with
exports growing at a rate of 10 percent per year," Industry
Minister John Manley said today while announcing the loan at
Pratt's headquarters in Longueuil, Quebec.
</P>
<P>
"The government's investment in these projects will help
increase the global competitiveness of this industry, while
supporting jobs in Montreal, Halifax and across the country,"
Manley was quoted by media reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 70 million of the money will help finance development of
the company's turboprop engine for de Havilland Inc.'s new Dash-8
400.
</P>
<P>
The rest will fund other research and development projects in
the Canadian plants of Pratt, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
United Technologies Corp. of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The government investment comes from the
182-million-dollar-a-year Technology Partnerships program.
</P>
<P>
Under this program, companies can receive up to one-third of
their research money for new products from the government.
</P>
<P>
They must agree to repay the money based on royalties from
sales, without any interest.
</P>
<P>
"The program is intended to try to keep aerospace companies in
Canada," a government source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign-owned aerospace companies have threatened to move
their research and development arms out of Canada if they didn't
get subsidies, arguing that other countries provide the help to
their industries, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> France Strengthens Security After Condemnation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- France has strengthened security
measures in railway stations, subway and underground train
stations and airports after 28 North African youths were given
jail sentences Thursday by a Paris court.
</P>
<P>
The number of policemen and soldiers deployed in Paris has
increased by one-third since Thursday, under the Vigipirate
operation resumed by the French government after the terrorist
bombing on a Paris RER underground train at the Port Royal station
in downtown Paris in early December.
</P>
<P>
About 300 members of the Foreign Legion troops units are
deployed in Paris, raising the number of security troops in the
capital to 3,000, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted officials
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight Moroccan youths were given various jail sentences,
in a trial which began last month by the Paris Correctional
Tribunal, for organizing terrorist attacks in Morocco from the
suburbs of Paris in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre and Paris Police
Commissioner Philippe Massoni said that "the situation abroad"
and the approach of the Muslim festival Ramadan are two other
reasons for resuming the operation.
</P>
<P>
The minister and the commissioner were apparently referring to
the escalation of violence in Algeria, where hundreds of people
were killed by Islamic extremists over the past few weeks in bomb
attacks in cities and massacres in villages.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian extremist group, the Armed Islamic Group,
threatened to destroy France on the Christmas eve and asked
President Jacques Chirac to intervene with the Algerian government
for the release of their leaders given death penalties.
</P>
<P>
"Some people could have the will to seriously disturb through
criminal acts this respectable religious festival (of Ramadan),"
said the Paris police commissioner, adding that France should
"accustom itself to living with a permanent threat of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The French authorities have asked people taking public
transportation vehicles to be vigilant against any suspicious
situation, and inform police immediately after seeing bags left
behind on trains and buses.
</P>
<P>
Police in the central city of Lyon arrested three men in a
Muslim neighborhood Thursday for suspected involvement in
terrorist attacks in the city in the autumn of 1995.
