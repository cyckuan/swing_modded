<HEADLINE> New film traces history of New York, America along Hudson,Mohawk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Washington felt the outlandish proposal to build a
canal across New York state, at three times the cost of the War of 1812, was
just crazy.
<P>
	   Albany knew better.
</P>
<P>
	   The result was a revival of the state's 19th century economy and a major
step toward New York's rise to a global commercial player, and fueled America's
western expansion, according to the film "The Natural Corridor: New York's
Transportation History."
</P>
<P>
	   That's one of many anecdotes in the that will be sent to 3,000 schools
statewide by the end of the month. The 90-minute film about transportation
through New York's history has won five documentary awards and cost the state
$269,000, said Michael Fleischer, spokesman for the state Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The intent was to tell the story of transportation and how New York state
transportation really transformed the nation," Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   From footpaths of the Iroquois to global airports around New York City to
the promise of high-speed rail, the film about New York transportation history
is as much a story about New York history through transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of the road systems followed these water routes," said labor and
business history Professor Gerald Zahavi of the state University at Albany. "I
think we're rediscovering rivers as industry has pulled out."
</P>
<P>
	   Zahavi, who wasn't involved in the documentary, said New York's Erie Canal
and then rail systems helped turn cities like Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo
into important hubs. The path of the Mohawk and Hudson river and significant
waterways in other states like the Connecticut and Chesapeake rivers provided a
natural lowland for travel.
</P>
<P>
	   "Early America owed its existence to these rivers and they established
regional economies," Zahavi said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   That's a debt the documentary considers closely through rich photography and
analysis by historians, writers, artists and engineers mixed with dramatic
readings of historic speeches.
</P>
<P>
	   A 22-page teachers' guide identifies themes and context for the film along
with a list of books, authorities and Internet sites for further study.
</P>
<P>
	   The documentary begins at the beginning, with the ancient geological forces
that created the Hudson and Mohawk valleys critical from post-Colonial
settlement to the rise of railroads and the state Thruway.
</P>
<P>
	   When America was developing, an accessible trade route from cities as
far-flung as Manhattan and Buffalo was unheard of, especially because mountains
at that time might as well as been 500 miles high because of a lack of
technology to overcome them, said private sector engineer Frank Griggs.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, this is a transportation documentary presented with the hubcaps off.
Several speakers address the destruction expanding highways have had on the
environment, on the rise of suburbs and a lost sense of community, and of the
neglect of inner cities and their people too poor to leave or "unwelcome" in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The film is peppered with anecdotes, like the federal government's refusal
to help pay for the Erie Canal that would open up the country's West in the 19th
Century. President Thomas Jefferson in 1809 called the idea "little more than
madness," in part because the canal was projected to cost three times the price
of the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City's contributions to American transportation was a study of its
own. The first mass transit was born there, first horse drawn and later powered
by trains, which for the first time allowed people to live further than walking
distance from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   This created America's first suburb, what the Dutch called "broken land" and
New Yorkers later called Brooklyn Heights.

<HEADLINE> Politicians waging war against New York educational establishment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - It's tough to be an education official right now.
<P>
	   Not only are there cheating and attendance controversies in New York City
and low scores on standardized tests around New York state, but now the two most
powerful Republicans have education bureaucracies square in their sights.
</P>
<P>
	   But is it politics or progress? Depends on who you ask.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York City, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani wants to boot the city's Board of
Education out of its current building since he can't get it abolished.
</P>
<P>
	   The city will sell the board's Brooklyn headquarters and put the board in a
much smaller facility in order to force it to reduce the size of its
bureaucracy, Giuliani threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   In Albany, frustrated because he can't abolish the Board of Regents - the
statewide equivalent of the city's Board of Education - Gov. George Pataki wants
the Regents directly under his control. He wants to pick the Regents, the
Regents' chancellor, the state education commissioner, move the Education
Department's charter school money to the State University of New York - which he
already controls - and take over control of the State Library, State Museum and
State Archives.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither plan is likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state Legislature, and they elect the
Regents. Those Democrats are unlikely to approve any changes in the command
structure of the Regents and the state Education Department they oversee,
especially not at the behest of a Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
	   And the city Board of Education would have to approve the sale of its
building, and is highly unlikely to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Is this just about politics, the executives' urge to control everything they
can get their hands on or genuine concern about the educational systems of New
York City and New York state?
</P>
<P>
	   "Governors always want control over what they don't control," Education
Commissioner Richard Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pataki and Giuliani can point to recent test scores as reasons they
should be in control instead of their respective education boards.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half the fourth grade students statewide did not pass the Regents'
new English test, a third failed the fourth-grade math test and a quarter of
those who took the senior English exam needed to graduate have to take it again.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost 80 percent of New York City's eighth graders were categorized as only
being able to use "simple" math or "basic reasoning" on the new statewide test.
</P>
<P>
	   These mediocre test results have come despite record state educational
funding increases in the past three years, the two politicians argue.
</P>
<P>
	   "We haven't seen the results from the schools that we should have expected
when you pour this amount of money into them," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The system doesn't work," Giuliani said. "It hasn't worked in a long time,
and it's about time we moved on to a more accountable system."
</P>
<P>
	   Both men talk about bloated education bureaucracies they would like to
eliminate. For example, Pataki's budget proposal says he wants to cut 10 percent
of the Education Department's staff.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked, however, Pataki's budget officials admitted that the cuts would
be through attrition and be only be 18 of the 180 people that state taxpayers
fund in the Education Department. But still "we would rather spend general fund
dollars on the classrooms, not on the bureaucracy," Joe Conway, a spokesman for
Pataki's Budget Division, said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York isn't the first place where a mayor and a governor have tried
taking over the state's educational system, said Kathy Christie, policy analyist
for the Education Commission of the States. Governors and mayors around the
country have tried the same things, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's normal for them to want control," said Christie, who studies education
trends for the nonprofit, nationwide organization whose mission is to help state
leaders improve the quality of education. "That's been an ongoing discussion and
has been for years."
</P>
<P>
	   Education is an easy target of politicans because it relates to all of their
constituants, Christie said. "It's a focus," she said. "Among politicans, it's
something they feel that they need to control."
</P>
<P>
	   In places like Chicago, where the mayor has direct control over the city
education system and Wisconsin, where the state Board of Education has been
abolished, the education system has gotten better, Christie said.
</P>
<P>
	   "My question about this always is: Is it the change in the people or is it
the change in the structure?" Christie said.
</P>
<P>
	   In other words, did the person in charge just pick better people to run the
educational system or did the actual systematic change make a difference, she
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can argue it both ways," she said. "I guess time will tell."

<HEADLINE> New, supposedly improved Lobbying Commission underfunded, groups  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Nine people. More than 2,000 agencies. Government
watchdog groups said that, despite the recent political rhetoric, there will be
no increased scrutiny of lobbyists in Albany until the state Lobbying Commission
gets the resources it needs.
<P>
	   The Common Cause and the League of Women Voters want Gov. George Pataki to
increases funding for the commission in the 30-day amendments he will file next
month to his 2000-01 state budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   "It cannot be expected to do the job that is expected of it with its current
resources," said Barbara Bartoletti of the League of Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission has nine people reviewing more than 2,000 agencies, said
Executive Director David Grandeau. The new law doubles the amount of paperwork
and the commission will need more staffers to review it.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki didn't mention any increase for the commission in last week's budget
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Conway, a spokesman for the state's Budget Division, said it was
premature to discuss the contents of the 30-day amendments.
</P>
<P>
	   The need to reform the state's lobbying laws was brought home last fall,
when Sharon Portnoy, lobbyist for tobacco giant Philip Morris, admitted she
manipulated documentation to hide thousands of dollars she had spent wining and
dining lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Her techniques included falsely submitting the names of people attending
receptions and nights out with lawmakers in order to keep individual meal costs
down overall. It is illegal in New York to give lawmakers and officials any
gifts worth more than $75 if they are intended to influence their official
duties.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris was fined $75,000, which the Lobbying Commission said was the
maximum it could impose under state law. Portnoy was also fined, banned from
lobbying in New York for three years and she faces a possible criminal
investigation in Albany County for her activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The highly publicized incident helped spur passage of a law that began Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to random audits, lobbyists are required to file reports far
more frequently and could be subject to fines of up to $25 a day for late
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Lobbyists are also required to list the bill, rule, or regulation they are
discussing with legislators. In addition to civil penalties, lobbyists who fail
to file timely statements or reports, submit false information, or exceed the
$75 gift limit may be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor charge for the first
offense and a Class E felony for subsequent offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The law also extends the "temporary" commission's term for eight years,
rather than the two-year reprieves that had been typical during the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Erik Joerss, a spokesman for Common Cause, said his organization had
advocated a law that covered state agencies such as the Office of General
Services, which issues statewide contracts on items including police cars and
computer systems. The proposal would also cover local governments as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the organization welcomed the changes.
</P>
<P>
	   "But for this to be an effective agency with expanded powers it needs more
money," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, lobbyists are grumbling about some of the new law's requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of what we do is not bill related," said Mary Downes, of the
Syracuse-based Dairylea Cooperative. She said a Dairylea lobbyist might be
discussing ways to help the state's agriculture industry that had nothing to do
with a pending bill or regulation. "We won't be able to put that down," she
said.

<HEADLINE> State Department Security Said Lax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An inspector general's audit found State Department
security officials failed to sweep scores of rooms for bugging devices and
repeatedly failed to account for highly classified documents, The Washington
Post reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The IG report said lax security procedures plagued the department's handling
of the government's most sensitive intelligence reports and that 140 offices
handling those materials had never been swept for listening devices, the paper
said in Monday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   It also said 239 of 1,890 ``sensitive compartmented information''
intelligence reports -- called SCI -- from the National Security Agency's
Cryptological Support Group had not been returned to the group's secure facility
inside the State Department between August and October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In one case, a pouch was returned empty; another was returned open with the
key in it, the Post quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Department is substantially not in compliance with the director of
central intelligence's directives that govern the handling of SCI,'' the
inspector general, Jacqueline Williams-Bridger, concluded in the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post noted that all of the incidents cited in the IG report occurred
before FBI agents discovered a Russian spy lurking outside the State Department
building, leading to discovery of a listening device placed in a conference room
on the seventh floor of the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general's report, completed in September but kept largely
confidential, was ordered by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 1998
after an earlier security breach.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, a man walked into the executive secretary's office, six doors down
from Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's, took classified briefing
materials in view of two secretaries and walked out. The man was never
identified and the materials were never recovered, a senior State Department
official told the Post said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper quoted a senior State Department official as saying the House and
Senate intelligence committees will receive a full report on planned security
upgrades by Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The Associated Press reported earlier on other sections of the IG report
that said thousands of authorized visitors, including hundreds of foreign
government officials, had enjoyed unescorted access throughout headquarters once
they were cleared by the main security desk.
</P>
<P>
	   In one two-day period in September 1998, the inspector general found, 1,726
visitors, including 326 foreign officials, entered the building and most moved
``about the building unescorted.''
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department stopped allowing authorized visitors unescorted access
to its sprawling headquarters last summer.

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Head, Wife Aboard Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By ERIC NUNEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Former CIA director Adm. Stansfield Turner was
among 17 people injured in a weekend airplane crash that killed his wife, a U.S.
couple and a Spaniard, Costa Rican authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner, CIA director under President Carter, was in a San Jose hospital
Sunday. No details on his condition were available.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife, Eli Karen, was killed Saturday afternoon when their Taxi Aereo
Centroamericano flight crashed into a home shortly after taking off in San Jose,
U.S. Embassy spokesman David Gilmour said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also killed in the crash were Siegfried and Therese Richert of San
Francisco, and Spaniard Antonio Sanchez Diaz, according to Gilmour and Javier
Montero, chief of operations for Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner and 16 other people, most of them Spaniards, were injured when the
Czech-built LET 410 plowed into a house in an upscale neighborhood near the
Tobias Bolanos airport, Red Cross officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people were in the house, including a Nicaraguan housekeeper who
suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like a bomb. Pieces of cement, wood and even a wall fell on top of
us,'' the housekeeper, Yamileth Saenz, told the daily La Nacion.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Turner, the injured passengers and crew included nine
Spaniards, two French citizens, one Salvadoran and three Costa Ricans, the Red
Cross said. Most were in stable condition in San Jose hospitals Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Costa Rican pilot was seriously injured, according to Pamela Villalta,
spokeswoman for the San Juan de Dios Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane had been destined for the Tortuguero national park on Costa Rica's
Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the accident was under investigation. It was unclear whether
heavy winds at the time played a role.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was coming up the street when suddenly I saw the plane start to
fishtail,'' one witness, Pedro Chinchilla, told the daily La Republica. ``It
fell, and then I heard a loud noise, like a hurricane. When I reached the site I
could hear screams coming from inside the house.''

<HEADLINE> Civil rights leaders blast Wallingford for not celebrating MLK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - National civil rights leaders say Wallingford is
showing disrespect by not closing government offices today to honor Martin
Luther King Jr. Day.
<P>
	   "Maybe the nation needs to know that in a state that is usually given a
liberal image, there's this pocket that hasn't joined the 21st century," the
Rev. Al Sharpton said after addressing a Hartford church congregation Sunday.
"This one particular community and some others around the North are making an
absolute decision to say that they do not adhere to the principles that Dr. King
stood for."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton echoed some of the comments made Saturday by the Rev. Joseph
Lowery. Speaking at a state workers' union and state NAACP news conference,
Lowery urged town business and religious leaders to press government to close on
the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they are spitting in the face of all the sacrifices of all the
people in this country who tried to bring about racial brotherhood and an end to
discrimination," Lowery said. "This seems to be more akin to Mississippi than to
the great state of Connecticut."
</P>
<P>
	   Town officials said Lowery's words will do little to help Wallingford
resolve the controversy. Wallingford is the only town in the state that keeps
its government offices open on the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the government is racist," Town Councilor Tom Zappala said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lowery, 78, founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King
and the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy in 1957. He also played a major role in
ending segregation in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   He ended his 20-year tenure as president of the SCLC last week and was
succeeded by Martin Luther King III.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expected the climate to be cold, but I did not expect the spirit of the
people to be cold," Lowery said at the annual United Auto Workers dinner
honoring King.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallingford Mayor William W. Dickinson Jr. wants the town's unionized
workers to swap the King holiday for another holiday, saying it would allow
workers to honor King without costing taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he admires King, but his position requires him to get the best deal
for taxpayers and to avoid giving away benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The $32,000 it would cost the town to close for the day is a small sacrifice
to honor King, said Roger Vann, president of the Connecticut chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP has tried to give town and union negotiators time to work out
their differences over the holiday. But Vann said the issue may be an indication
of a "larger problem in Wallingford."
</P>
<P>
	   The organization will address the town's poor minority hiring record and
other issues if progress is not made, Vann said.

<HEADLINE> More high-schoolers working longer hours  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - With a worker shortage in a service-oriented
economy, businesses are attracting Connecticut high schoolers and offering them
chances to make extra money.
<P>
	   Although most students workers make the state minimum wage of $6.15 an hour,
that's about $500 a month for teens willing to work 20 or more hours a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Data released yearly by the state Department of Education show an increasing
number of students are swelling the ranks of the work force and working longer
hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Statewide, 31.3 percent of 11th- and 12th-graders say they work at least 16
hours a week, compared to 28.4 percent five years ago.'
</P>
<P>
	   More than 50 percent of vocational school students around the state report
working more than 16 hours a week compared to 41.5 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Department of Labor sets the limit for minors at 32 hours per
week, a high threshold when combined with the 30 hours of class time and an
average of two to three hours a night of homework, educators said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Certain students are spending time at school and then participating with
clubs and sports, it's hard to imagine how they can be working a lot and getting
enough sleep," Jane Baljevic, principal at Milford's Joseph A. Foran High School
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra work though can also have its positive side because of the
discipline, responsibility and time-management skills students learn during
their after-school pursuits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Research seems to show that students who work 15 to 20 hours a week ...
tend to be motivated about school and learn to manage their time," Baljevic
said. "But more than that can be detrimental to their school work."
</P>
<P>
	   West Haven High School Principal Ron Stancil said that despite his school's
ballooning numbers of working students, the honor roll has relatively consistent
over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
	   "I walk into stores all over town and they're just mobbed with our kids,"
Stancil said. "And I enjoy that, I enjoy seeing kids who are working in good
jobs or any jobs."

<HEADLINE> Officials call for shutdown of UConn hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) - Eliminating inpatient care at the University of
Connecticut's John Dempsey Hospital is one way to save the health center's
medical and dental schools, officials say.
<P>
	   The health center has been running up millions of dollars in deficits and
the 204-bed hospital is the open wound.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Gorman, commissioner of the state Office of Health Care Access, is
preparing a report for state legislators for next week which lends support to
the idea of closing Dempsey.
</P>
<P>
	   The report follows two months of meetings in which the Hartford area's
hospitals - including Hartford Hospital, St. Francis Hospital and Medical
Center, New Britain General, and Connecticut Children's Medical Center - were
asked by Gov. John G. Rowland to consider ways to safeguard UConn's future in
terms of regional health care.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a strong sense among the area hospitals that they would not
participate in anything that subsidizes inpatient care at John Dempsey
Hospital," said Gorman.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Gorman said the area hospitals are committed to the survival of
UConn's medical and dental schools and have offered to further subsidize their
academic programs and provide more training opportunities for students.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are now saying we are responsible for the medical school, not the
hospital," said Kevin Kinsella, vice president of Hartford Hospital and a
participant in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical and dental schools, a research center and John Dempsey Hospital
make up the UConn Health Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Affiliation with another hospital was among several recommendations made by
a consultant last year as one may of helping the health center emerge from a $21
million deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   However, that idea has lost support.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any hospital affiliation with Dempsey to subsidize Dempsey, that's a dead
issue,"' Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman's report will be delivered to leaders of the legislature's public
health committee, where it is expected to set a framework for discussions about
the health center and other hospitals in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not going to recommend that we close Dempsey this year," said state
Sen. Toni N. Harp, D-New Haven, the committee co-chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
	   Harp and public health co-chairwoman Mary U. Eberle, D-Bloomfield, said they
hope to appoint a panel to map out the future of hospital services and
facilities in the Hartford region.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter J. Deckers, dean of the UConn medical school and interim head of the
health center, said he can foresee Dempsey's mission changing as a result of
regional planning, but not the hospital closing.
</P>
<P>
	   Deckers said the hospital is the only place where faculty members can teach
and students can practice, unconstrained by the financial pressures of managed
care.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't believe for a minute that closing John Dempsey Hospital is a viable
option at all," Deckers said. "In a very short time, you would have a very
mediocre medical school."

<HEADLINE> Scientists plan pre-emptive strike on mosquitoes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - The state Department of Environmental
protection is reviewing a $2 million proposal to kill mosquitoes and combat West
Nile encephalitis.
<P>
	   Included in the plan is mosquito surveillance and the application of
larvacide in 20 towns along a 62-mile stretch from Greenwich to Madison.
</P>
<P>
	   The larvacides, which would be deposited in selected catch basins in each of
those cities and towns, would kill up to 90 percent of the mosquitoes before
they hatch and can transmit the virus.
</P>
<P>
	   Several agencies as well as environmentalists believe the application of
larvacides presents the best way of quashing or containing the threat of West
Nile.
</P>
<P>
	   "Larvacides are not totally safe for the environment, but they are less
damaging to human and animal health. They are more specific than pesticides,"
Diane Lauricella, chairwoman of the Sierra Club's Fairfield County chapter.
</P>
<P>
	   Since last fall's outbreak of West Nile encephalitis, state officials have
been concerned about preparing for the coming mosquito-biting season.
</P>
<P>
	   If the pre-emptive strike fails or additional communities discover bird
kills connected with West Nile, a contingency fund of $800,000 is built into the
proposal for larvaciding additional towns and for spraying adult mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
	   Stamford officials are coming up with their own plan of action. Stamford
officials want to set up surveillance and prepare an arsenal of chemical agents
to ward off any public health threat from mosquitoes that bear the West Nile
encephalitis virus.
</P>
<P>
	   The city's Department of Health and Social Services wants companies to
submit proposals for a comprehensive mosquito-control program that could be
enacted quickly if mosquito-borne illnesses appear to pose a threat to public
health this season, said Director of Public Safety, Health and Welfare John
Byrne.
</P>
<P>
	   Ted Andreadis of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment station in New
Haven has been testing mosquitoes to see if they carry West Nile encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
	   So far none of the 178 insects he has collected were infected with West
Nile.
</P>
<P>
	   The insects collected are helping state scientists develop a profile of
where mosquitoes go to survive the winter. Experts say that information will
help them devise strategies for the anticipated return of West Nile virus in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, seven people died of West Nile encephalitis in New York and at
least 59 others, who experienced high fevers and brain swelling, were stricken
with the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   In Connecticut, there were no human cases of West Nile virus. But the
disease was linked to the die-off of hundreds of birds, primarily crows.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now the question is what do you do about it to lower the risk and prevent
it from transmitting to people?" said Michele Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the
state Department of Environmental Protection.

<HEADLINE> Dave Nilsson Signs With Japan Team  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN WALKER AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Free agent Dave Nilsson signed a one-year contract to join Japan's Chunichi
Dragons, clearing the way for the All-Star catcher to play for his native
Australia in the upcoming Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a dream come true for me. This is what I wanted," Nilsson said
after agreeing to terms Monday in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
	   Nilsson, 30, hit .309 with 21 home runs and 62 RBIs for the Milwaukee
Brewers last year and was a member of the NL All-Star team. The left-handed
hitter missed September because of a broken right thumb.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota, Florida and Kansas City had talked to Nilsson about a new
contract. Agent Alan Nero said he also spoke to the New York Yankees and
Cleveland, but their interest was based on making trades to open room for
Nilsson.
</P>
<P>
	   Nilsson, who made nearly $5.7 million last season in Milwaukee, will get a
salary of about $2 million in 2000 and become a free agent after the season.
</P>
<P>
	   As for a future return to the majors, "there might be places that might make
it hard for him to say no," Nero said from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
	   Nilsson said all along he wanted to play in the Summer Games -- they start
in September, in the middle of the pennant race. This is the first time American
professional teams will let players compete in the Olympics, but clubs are not
expected to permit their top stars to take part.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's pro league, however, will let a lot of its top talent play in the
Olympics. Nilsson plans to return to Chunichi after the Games for the remainder
of the Dragons' season.
</P>
<P>
	   "The addition of Nilsson will give our batting order a different look and we
have very high expectations of him," Chunichi president Tsuyoshi Sato said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nilsson will be the first Australian major leaguer to play in Japan, Dragons
spokesman Tetsuo Ishiguro said. Chunichi used to hold its spring training in
Australia, and Nilsson recalled watching those workouts as a minor leaguer.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the deal, the Dragons signed a three-year working agreement with
the Australian Baseball League, a professional circuit that Nilsson bought last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Building a bridge from Japan to Australia was an important part of this,"
Nilsson said.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Nilsson played for the Australian national team and was MVP of
the Intercontinental Cup, a four-nation tournament in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
	   Nero said Nilsson had considered signing a long-term contract with a major
league team and missing the Olympics, and also taking a year off from pro ball.
</P>
<P>
	   "Chunichi was very aggressive in its approach, and made the opportunity
available for him to play in the Olympics," Nero said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nilsson is a lifetime .284 hitter with 105 homers. He has spent his entire
eight-year career with Milwaukee and received a standing ovation from Brewers

<HEADLINE> Dark past brings down South Beach's 'dangerous darling'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Until last month, Chris Paciello confidently reigned
over a South Beach nightclub regime catering to the see-and-be-seen set.
<P>
	   Madonna, Donald Trump, Jennifer Lopez - all hung out at Paciello's clubs,
lounging in black leather booths, sipping Dom Perignon and schmoozing with the
beefy, dark-haired owner.
</P>
<P>
	   But authorities claim a truer picture of Paciello emerged years earlier in a
more mundane setting: the middle-class home of Staten Island housewife Judith
Shemtov. It was there, they say, that Shemtov took a bullet in the head - part
of an evil past that has finally caught up to Paciello.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 1, the Brooklyn native surrendered in Miami on murder and robbery
charges after he was named in a New York indictment accusing him of being a
former member of the violent Beach Avenue Crew.
</P>
<P>
	   The goon squad, authorities say, provided muscle and money for the Bonanno
organized crime family by going on a crime spree that left a half-dozen bodies
in its wake. They claim Paciello, whose legal name is Christian Ludwigsen, was
known as "the Binger" because he liked to binge on crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal case could force Paciello, 28, to forfeit his
multimillion-dollar enterprise and put him behind bars for life.
</P>
<P>
	   The mercurial rise and fall of the man a Miami alternative weekly, New
Times, calls "the dangerous darling of the SoBe nightlife set" has both
enthralled and stunned his supporters and associates.
</P>
<P>
	   Gerry Kelly, owner of the new nightclub Level, learned from authorities last
week that Paciello once discussed responding to the competition by having him
"whacked."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is definitely a 'Jekyll and Hyde' situation," said Kelly, Paciello's
onetime marketing director. He recalled Paciello as a kind boss who began each
day with a two-hour workout.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never, ever even heard him raise his voice," he said. "I thought he was
my friend. ... It's scary as hell."
</P>
<P>
	   Ingrid Casares - Paciello's partner in the trendy dance club Liquid and
close friend of Madonna - and other South Beach glitterati have rallied behind
Paciello. Insisting Paciello is a legitimate entrepreneur and community leader,
several wealthy backers have put up personal property to secure a $15 million
bail bond.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello's attorney, Roy Black, has sought to portray the graduate of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School in Bensonhurst as a "young man who's
turned his life around." He notes that Paciello - despite growing up with known
criminals and having several previous arrests - has never been convicted of a
felony.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, the way our society works is when someone becomes successful
or a high-profile person, they become a target," Black told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   South Florida friends say Paciello's success sprang from a shy charm and
knack for drawing black-clad beautiful people to his nightspots dotting South
Beach's Art Deco District.
</P>
<P>
	   Before his arrest, Paciello himself responded to mob rumors, saying, "It
doesn't make me a gangster because I hung out on the corner with people while I
was growing up."
</P>
<P>
	   He has said he began using his mother's maiden name, Paciello, because his
parents broke up - not to escape his past.
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutors call the portrait a sham. They say Paciello led a double
life after he went south, switching his allegiance to the Colombo crime family
and settling scores with assaults and death threats.
</P>
<P>
	   In one incident noted in gossip columns, Paciello allegedly decked a former
football player at a South Beach club in a fight over a supermodel. A lawsuit by
a former Mr. Universe accuses him of breaking the plaintiff's face with a beer
bottle.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a character trait of Mr. Ludwigsen to resort to violent activity,"
said Assistant U.S. Attorney James Walden.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities allege Paciello first gravitated to the mob in the late 1980s,
after moving to Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Accomplice witnesses have told investigators that as part of the Bonanno
holdup crew, Paciello was both mastermind and lookout for the 1992 robbery of a
branch bank in a Staten Island mall. Armed bandits smashed out windows with a
sledgehammer before making off with $300,000.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 18, 1993, the crew struck again, this time ringing the doorbell at
the home of Staten Island home of Shemtov, 46, on a tip that her businessman
husband had $200,000 stashed in a safe. Within minutes, a gunman had shot and
killed her; Paciello allegedly drove the getaway car as they fled, empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello made enough money to reinvent himself in South Beach by opening a
club called Risk in 1994, investigators say. The name was apt: Risk was
destroyed by fire in what authorities now suspect was an arson-insurance scam
that helped Paciello raise enough money to start Liquid.
</P>
<P>
	   Teaming with Casares - a member of a rich Cuban family that credits him with
helping her kick a drug habit - Paciello also opened the celebrity hangout Bar
Room and a restaurant, Joia, held fund-raisers and bought a pricey beach-front
home. As his profile rose, so did stories linking him romantically to the likes
of Niki Taylor and Daisy Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
	   But authorities say Paciello also had another acquaintance - an undercover
agent posing as a corrupt narcotics officer. The agent was making secret
recordings of their phone calls, evidence that prosecutors say exposes the
defendant as a career thug.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got to get him beat up," Paciello allegedly said of Kelly. "I got to get
him whacked."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, he warned that he would have to "come out of retirement. I've become
a big (sissy) down here. A big sucker."
</P>
<P>
	   About the same time, Paciello was observed introducing the undercover agent
to Alphonse Persico, then the acting boss of the Colombo crime family,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting has raised suspicions Paciello was laundering mob money through
his clubs. Prosecutors also allege that he allowed Liquid to become a haven for
dealers peddling the designer drug Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
	   The combination of Paciello's violent background and newfound fame would
make him "a commodity to the Colombos," said Jerry Capeci, a crime expert
tracking the Mafia on his Ganglandnews.com Web site. "He's willing to break
heads to make money, and he's an entree to celebrities with lots of cash."
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys have denied their client has any mob ties. And they
complain that the recorded conversations were taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's unfair to suggest that Chris Ludwigsen was plotting to kill anybody,
because that's nonsense," said attorney Howard Srebnick.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello is expected to be released from a Brooklyn jail by the end of the
month. But he will remain under house arrest until his trial in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the party goes on at Paciello's Bar Room. Madonna and Gwyneth
Paltrow were spotted dancing on tabletops there at 4 a.m. New Year's Day.

<HEADLINE> Candidates on Internet Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press asks the presidential candidates a
question on the issues. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Internet Sales Tax
</P>
<P>
	   Should Internet commerce remain exempt from sales taxes to encourage the
growth of online business or should it be subject to the same taxation faced by
storefront companies?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``I supported the moratorium on taxation of electronic
commerce and I support the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce's efforts
to develop a tax policy which encourages the astonishing growth of the Internet
and electronic commerce, but is fair to bricks-and-mortar companies and doesn't
erode the state and local revenue stream.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``I supported the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which President Clinton
signed into law. The act imposed a three-year moratorium on state and local tax
and trade issues associated with electronic commerce and comparable sales
activities. I do not want to prejudge the work of the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce, but I will tell you that I am committed to finding a
solution to this issue that will allow the Internet and e-commerce to flourish,
but without stripping states and localities of the revenue they need to educate
our children and fight crime. Additionally, I support making cyberspace a
'duty-free' zone internationally.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``We should have a five-year moratorium on federal taxes on
Internet sales and e-commerece to let this business develop. Today, as a share
of retail sales, Internet sales are tiny. Let them grow.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``Internet commerce should remain exempt from sales taxes. This
will ensure continued growth of the most dynamic sector of our economy, but we
should also work at providing tax relief to non-Internet outlets.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``I support the current moratorium on Internet sales taxes
and would extend it for several more years to determine the full impact of
e-commerce on our society.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``Politicians see the Internet as another source of government
cash. As a conservative business leader, I know e-commerce is a new frontier
giving families more control over their lives, creating new jobs and boosting
economic growth. That's why a critical part of my 'New Economy Plan' for the
21st century is a permanent ban on special, new Internet taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Orrin Hatch: ``I have repeatedly opposed various proposals to tax the
Internet or e-commerce. In fact, I have advocated making the current three-year
federal moratorium on Internet taxation permanent. This new economy is still in
its infancy. Its promise is great, but its potential will never be realized if
the federal government hinders its development with taxes and regulation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``I sponsored the law in the Senate that put in place the
current moratorium on Internet taxation. The Internet continues to be the
greatest engine of economic growth in America today, and we must not strangle it
with new taxes. Online sales totaled $40 billion in 1999, that if taxed would
have taken $2 billion from hard-working American families. As President, I will
keep the Internet a tax-free zone. Studies show that taxing the Internet would
reduce e-commerce by 75 percent -- a blow that would limit growth and kill
jobs.''

<HEADLINE> Jessye Norman: performing a musical hard-sell - for Girl Scout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - She's the diva of Girl Scout cookies.
<P>
	   Opera star Jessye Norman sold more than 2,000 boxes in the past year, "my
best year ever!
</P>
<P>
	   "I get the chipmunk and the stuffed bear and the patch and everything - just
like the 10-year-olds," says the 54-year-old soprano about her sideline from
"that night job" - a career as a concert artist with a goddess-like aura.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will sell cookies to anybody, anywhere, on the street, to people out of
the back of my car" - a chauffeured one, that is. And she's an honorary lifetime
Girl Scout, attached to a troop in, of all places, Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   Nothing odd about that. After all, the Georgia-born singer first became a
musical icon in France. Her following was so over-the-top that the 1980s film
"Diva" was based on a real-life, obsessive admirer who planned his life around
her concerts.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, her first solo recording in three years is of French music and -
surprise - it's not classical.
</P>
<P>
	   "I Was Born in Love With You" is an album of cabaret songs by the Grammy
award-winning songwriter Michel Legrand, to be released Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a sexy switch from the formidable operatic heroines that won Miss
Norman fame.
</P>
<P>
	   To lyrics in both French and English, "I'm dying of love from beginning to
end of the album, which is just fine!" says the newly minted chanteuse,
releasing an exuberant peal of laughter that erupts like Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
	   On Valentine's Day, she's bringing the songs to Manhattan's Studio 54 for a
show benefiting God's Love We Deliver, which delivers free meals to homebound
people with AIDS. It's one of dozens of charities to which she volunteers her
time.
</P>
<P>
	   "On Feb. 14, we are so occupied with romantic love, we forget there are
other kinds of love, too," she says. "The love of one's community, and the love
that we need to put into that to make it all a bit better, is something that I'd
like us to focus on this first Valentine's Day of the new century."
</P>
<P>
	   Offering love to strangers doesn't quite fit Miss Norman's cliched public
image - that of a bigger-than-life star, ready to dazzle. That's the woman
viewers saw on worldwide television in 1989 singing for the bicentennial of the
French Revolution, standing by the Arc de Triomphe draped in the tricolor flag,
and again in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, and in 1997 for President
Clinton's inaugural.
</P>
<P>
	   They were media spectacles, featuring a public figure emanating supreme
control and elegance in both dress and bearing, along with a voice that's an
opulent force of nature.
</P>
<P>
	   During a recent interview in a Manhattan hotel suite, a far more
down-to-earth, even vulnerable, woman emerged.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wouldn't like to completely disillusion people who think I wear a tiara
all day," she jokes.
</P>
<P>
	   Still elegantly dressed, she sits quietly on a sofa, occasionally wringing
her hands as she ponders aspects of her seemingly glamorous life.
</P>
<P>
	   "What IS a diva, anyway?" she asks suddenly, backing the question with her
disarming style - a simple, short manicure and no eye-popping jewels.
</P>
<P>
	   She often putters around her suburban Westchester County home in sweatshirts
and baggy pants: "Sometimes I look down and say, 'Did I get dressed today, or
what?"'
</P>
<P>
	   And this diva doesn't do her hair every day. "Oh no! You'd be shocked," she
says.
</P>
<P>
	   To fans, however, she is a diva in the true sense of the Italian word that
describes an ancient goddess praising Achilles in Homer's "Iliad."
</P>
<P>
	   For decades, Miss Norman has vocally personified the doomed characters
created by composers like Wagner, Berlioz and Strauss, prompting The Washington
Post to dub her "a virtual incarnation of the mask of tragedy."
</P>
<P>
	   Her vocal outpouring has been accompanied by the world's premier orchestras,
and she's filled concert halls with art songs and churches with gospel music.
She was soloist with the Chicago Symphony for Bela Bartok's "Bluebeard's
Castle," which won a Grammy in 1998 for best opera recording.
</P>
<P>
	   But for now, she's into jazz and cabaret - and she likes it that way.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone might get up in the middle of the song and that's just sort of the
way it goes. It's a different format," she says of her upcoming Studio 54
appearance. Besides, being shortsighted, she's closer to the audience, "and I
can see them."
</P>
<P>
	   In March, she's up for a series of U.S. recitals starting at Carnegie Hall,
where she is to premiere a piece by composer Judith Weir, with texts by Toni
Morrison, Maya Angelou and Clarissa Pinkola Estes.
</P>
<P>
	   But whether in concert hall or cabaret, Miss Norman can't seem to get far
from one thing: "I'm dying always!"
</P>
<P>
	   There's another constant: "It's the same vocal chords. The change takes
place here," she says, pointing to her head. "Singing happens very much in the
mind, as well as in the rest of the body."
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Norman wraps her rich voice around the English language with
ever-varying inflections, depending on where she's been living most recently.
</P>
<P>
	   "I sound like a Southern girl who's spent many, many years working in
Europe, who's lived in Germany. So that is - that's a mess!" she says with a
hearty laugh. "I'm all of that. It confuses people; they say, 'Where do you come
from?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Actually, she's very much at home in Paris, where nobody addresses her by
her last name, she says.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love it if I'm walking through the Gare de Lyon," a Paris train station,
"and somebody who's in charge of the luggage says, 'Bonjour, Jessye!"' -
pronounced "Zhecee."
</P>
<P>
	   The admirer who follows the singer in "Diva" was a Paris messenger who would
travel all over Europe, by third-class train when available, to hear Miss
Norman. He has since died.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was one of these people that one thinks about on a concert day when,
really, you're not quite sure how you're going to be able to get out of bed,
much less perform, one is feeling so unwell," she says. "But one thinks that,
'Alain is going to be there,' so I'm going to make an effort."
</P>
<P>
	   He would almost never come backstage, she says, but "he was very important
to me. ... He would come to the foot of the stage and either say hello, or let
me know that he was there, or hand me up some flowers."
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Norman has a passion for flowers - orchids, in particular. One is named
after Jessye Norman, and her management company is called L'Orchidee.
</P>
<P>
	   She has many other interests outside music, from making Chinese food to
reading the novels of Tolstoy. But her biggest passion is medicine; becoming a
doctor was her dream when she was growing up in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sure that I dispense as much medical advice as most people who get paid
for it - to my friends," she says proudly. "And they know to ignore me
completely!"
</P>
<P>
	   But does she really know anything about medicine? "Of COURSE I do, I don't
make it up!" she exclaims.
</P>
<P>
	   She has a hobby known to few opera singers: reading the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
	   And then there are the Girl Scout cookies.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not exactly door-to-door sales, but she's gotten her sales pitch down
cold.
</P>
<P>
	   During dinner at one of Manhattan's great private clubs, "there's a lull in
the conversation," Miss Norman explains. "And I say, 'Well, you KNOW, it's Girl
Scout cookie time. I bet you've been dreaming about some of these Thin Mints.
Here I am."'

<HEADLINE> Streisand Says No More Concerts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Barbra Streisand says her record-breaking New Year's Eve
concert in Las Vegas was the last of her career.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the last time I'm going to do any kind of concert," Streisand told
TV Guide following the show. "I don't like performing. I feel like I'm in a
beauty pageant, like I'm 18 and strutting around on stage."
</P>
<P>
	   Fans paid a total $14,694,750 to hear Streisand ring in the new year, an
all-time single concert box-office record, according to the host, MGM Grand
hotel-casino.
</P>
<P>
	   The actress, singer and producer said over the years the media and celebrity
rumors have added to her frustrations about taking the stage.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're making me into a diva, and I'm like this normal person. I do my own
makeup. My hairdresser's been with me for 20 years. I don't know why it is that
we need to denigrate, to knock down. It's so sick," she said in the Jan. 22
issue.

<HEADLINE> Quest for Hardier Chicken  </HEADLINE>
    By JEFFREY BAIR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Chicken soup might make a person feel better when ill,
but what about the chicken?
</P>
<P>
	   A common parasite found in the birds can make them too scrawny for market,
prompting poultry farmers to spend millions each year in drugs and vaccines.
Now, two companies are trying to build a better chicken.
</P>
<P>
	   Demegen Inc. of Pittsburgh and Avigenics Inc. of Athens, Ga., announced
plans last week for joint research on chickens with a genetic trait that allows
them to resist the parasite coccidiosis.
</P>
<P>
	   The parasite, which does not affect humans, irritates the intestines of
chickens and interferes with the absorption of food. That can hinder growth in
the six to eight weeks from birth to slaughter, said Yvonne Vizzier, a poultry
science professor at Mississippi State University.
</P>
<P>
	   Demegen and Avigenics estimate that $600 million is spent by the poultry
industry annually on penicillin and other antibiotic drugs that keep the bug at
bay. Vizzier said the cost is probably much higher.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been a chronic problem in the poultry industry, and it would be
wonderful if someone could do something about it," she said Friday. "Anything
that would reduce those costs would have to be looked on favorably."
</P>
<P>
	   Another problem is that the drugs are having less effect as the birds become
resistant to them.
</P>
<P>
	   Several other companies are already in the hunt for hardier chickens, said
Hans Cheng, a U.S. Agriculture Department poultry researcher in East Lansing,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's premature to talk about their prospects, but it is good to see
companies developing compounds that would work much quicker than traditional
breeding," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists say chickens, unlike plants, are difficult to breed naturally to
make them resistant to disease. Early success can easily be reversed, and
erratic mating "makes it hard to keep the gene pool stable," Vizzier said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Michigan scientist, Lyman Crittenden, already has made chickens
genetically resistant to a type of cancer, but Cheng said no one has yet
announced success in fighting off the more common parasite.
</P>
<P>
	   Demegen already has a patent for getting disease-fighting genes into plants
such as tobacco and cotton. Avigenics has been attempting to improve chickens
and eggs and is trying to clone a chicken, said Carl Marhaver, the company's
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The partners hope to sell their hardier birds to U.S. poultry producers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Chickens are bred for different markets, whether for Kentucky Fried Chicken
or to be sold at the grocery store, but generally the bigger the better," said
Richard Ekstrom, Demegen's president.
</P>
<P>
	   His company's scientists used 200 disease-fighting molecules previously
identified in frogs, bugs and other animals as models. Then they fashioned a
man-made molecule that resists the parasite and can be attached to chicken
genes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekstrom said coccidiosis (pronounced coc-seh-dee-OH-sis) is the researchers'
priority, but they also want to develop chickens resistant to salmonella and
Campylobacter. Neither germ harms the chicken, but both can sicken humans.
</P>
<P>
	   The germs spread from chicken organs to meat during slaughter and can cause
diarrhea, fever and cramps in humans.

<HEADLINE> Play Offers Political Lesson  </HEADLINE>
   By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- What would happen if a hugely successful military figure
wanted to be president but didn't want to go through the indignities of a
political campaign?
</P>
<P>
	   Washington's Shakespeare Theatre is exploring that question in a
modern-dress production of the Bard's rarely staged ``Coriolanus.'' The Roman
general of 2,500 years ago thought he deserved election but hated working for
it, and he came to a bad end. Performances start Tuesday and will run through
March 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Director Michael Kahn calls it an especially appropriate play for the
presidential primary season, although he insists he has no particular candidate
in mind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's about a candidate's personal and family relations, the changeability
of the mob and how it can be swayed -- all very contemporary issues,'' Kahn said
in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
	   America's top generals haven't wanted the job all that much.
</P>
<P>
	   Colin Powell said before the 1996 election that he didn't have the passion
for politics that he had for soldiering and would not run. William Bennett, who
had been President Reagan's education secretary, commented that Powell didn't
want to endure ``this malarial swamp that we have created.''
</P>
<P>
	   George Washington initially didn't want the presidency either, although he
served two terms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I should receive the appointment,'' he wrote, ``and if I should be
prevailed upon to accept it, the acceptance would be attended with more
diffidence and reluctance than I have experienced before in my life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower had to be pushed into accepting
the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP convention of 1884 wired an appeal to William Tecumseh Sherman. He
wired back: ``I will not accept if nominated, and will not serve if elected.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Roman general Caius Marcius was less decisive. Fellow aristocrats in the
Senate named him Coriolanus because of his victory over a city called Corioles.
He had plenty of political passion but not much sense.
</P>
<P>
	   A Roman election wasn't exactly like a presidential contest. Instead of a
president, the Senate named two leaders to share executive power. It offered
Coriolanus one of the jobs. But representatives of the lower classes had a veto
over the nomination and they called the general arrogant. He gave them plenty of
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
	   In Shakespeare's opening scene, Coriolanus addresses some Romans
demonstrating against high food prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's the matter, you dissentious rogues ...?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
	   Replies one demonstrator, sarcastically:
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have ever your good word.''
</P>
<P>
	   A.L. Rowse, an historian of the 1500s and 1600s, notes in his edition of
Shakespeare that this isn't helping Coriolanus politically. But the general
still can't get the message.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring,''
Coriolanus tells the demonstrator.
</P>
<P>
	   That is: Anybody who would say anything nice to you would be a loathsome
flatterer.
</P>
<P>
	   Coriolanus then turns to the other demonstrators:
</P>
<P>
	   ``What would you have, you curs ...?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
	   But he complies with the Roman political custom of donning a white robe,
which makes him a ``candidatus,'' standing in the forum, showing off his wounds
and begging for votes. When the voters change their minds about approving him,
he calls them ``the mutable rank-scented many.''
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate gets so angry that he goes over to the enemy in Corioles and
attacks Rome. Only pleas by his mother, wife and son keep him from destroying
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in Corioles, he tries to justify his restraint and -- putting the other
foot in his mouth -- recalls to a crowd how he once conquered their city. They
can't stand him either and stab him to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Coriolanus' dubious political savvy was almost matched by Adm. George Dewey,
who destroyed a Spanish fleet in Manila Bay a century ago. He destroyed his
brief political career with less spectacular results, not with a bang but a
whimper.
</P>
<P>
	   Without disclosing a party or platform, Dewer told a reporter:
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since studying the subject, I am convinced that the office of the
president is not such a very difficult one to fill, his duties being mainly to
execute the laws of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   A few weeks later he gave up and told another interviewer:
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know how I got the idea in the first place.''

<HEADLINE> Power Outages in Pacific Northwest  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WELLS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- A fierce windstorm swept through the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday, killing two people in Washington state and leaving hundreds of thousands
of customers without power.
</P>
<P>
	   Hien Nguyen, 19, of Lacey, was killed around noon when a 120-foot fir tree
blew down on his pickup truck, crushing the cab, Lt. Matt Koehler said.
</P>
<P>
	   A 50-year-old Seattle architect died in an avalanche at the Crystal Mountain
ski resort, about 65 miles southeast of Seattle near Mt. Rainier. He and another
skier had hiked into a closed area when the avalanche struck at about 1:30 p.m.
His identity was not released.
</P>
<P>
	   Interstate 90, running between Seattle and Spokane, was shut down
periodically Sunday as crews set smaller avalanches to remove the danger of
large ones sweeping down onto the roadway, said Clarissa Lundeen, spokeswoman
for the state Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The snow that has already fallen is being weighted down by rain and wet
snow'' creating high danger of avalanches, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interstate 90, running between Seattle and Spokane, was shut down
periodically Sunday as crews set smaller avalanches to remove the danger of
large ones sweeping down onto the roadway, Lundeen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blown-down trees and limbs caused most of the power outages, utility
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather service reported sustained winds of 25 to 35 miles per hour. The
highest gusts reported by the National Weather Service were 115 mph at
midmorning at Cannon Beach, Ore. Gusts of 81 mph at Netarts, Ore., knocked a
house 12 feet off of its foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 5,000 Seattle City Light customers remained without power in the
greater Seattle area late Sunday evening -- down from a high of 36,000.
</P>
<P>
	   There were about 300,000 customers without power in western Washington and
about 100,000 in the dark in western Orgeon.
</P>
<P>
	   The winds forced the precautionary closure of the floating bridge linking
Seattle and its eastern suburbs. An estimated 100,000 cars use the 520 bridge
each day. The outage left the Interstate 90 floating bridge, three miles to the
south, as the only cross-lake span.
</P>
<P>
	   Puget Sound Energy spokeswoman Kremiere Boone said that most of the people
living the Olympia, Puyallup and Enumclaw areas were without power.

<HEADLINE> Saving Flag for Another Millennium  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lying on their stomachs in a dust-free lab, a squad of
conservators armed with surgical tweezers advance thread by thread across the
wool and cotton flag Americans know as the original Star Spangled Banner.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight team members, all women, are engaged in a prolonged, $18 million
effort to stabilize and strengthen the flag. The work includes the exacting,
eye-straining and tedious work of removing the 1.7 million knotted threads added
in 1914 to anchor the flag to a now-weakening linen backing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The estimates are, if we can stabilize the environment (surrounding the
flag) and protect it from light, that it will last for a very long time,'' said
Suzanne Thomassen-Krauss, chief conservator at the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History. ``The conservative estimate is 500 years
and the optimistic estimate is 1,000.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's good news for a flag that was pierced by bomb fragments in the
British attack on Baltimore's Fort McHenry in 1814. In the 185 years since that
25-hour engagement the flag has been rolled and unrolled for countless displays,
and endured long exposure to sunlight, pollution and gnawing insects.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the decades a full eight feet of its original 42-foot length was
snipped away for relic hunters.
</P>
<P>
	   Lonn Taylor, the museum's exhibits historian, was researching the banner's
history in a New England library when he opened a book ``and a fragment of the
flag literally fell out in my lap.''
</P>
<P>
	   The flag now measures 30 by 34 feet but is still as tall as a three-story
building.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Americans know the Star Spangled Banner story.
</P>
<P>
	   In September 1814, Washington lawyer Francis Scott Key boarded a British
warship in Chesapeake Bay to negotiate the release of a prisoner taken when
British forces burned the Capitol in August.
</P>
<P>
	   Detained aboard ship while the fleet turned its attention to Baltimore, Key
witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry beginning on the morning of Sept. 13,
1814, It continued through the day and most of the night before the British
abandoned their attack and withdrew.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after dawn on the 14th, the morning mists parted and Key saw that
the flag had survived its night of bombshells and rockets. Its ``broad stripes
and bright stars'' were ``gallantly streaming.''
</P>
<P>
	   An amateur verse writer, Key jotted down the words that entered history as
``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' Set to the music of an 18th century drinking song,
the tune was increasingly played by military bands until Congress acted in 1931
to make it the official national anthem of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   That was 117 years after Key witnessed ``the bombs bursting in air.''
</P>
<P>
	   An American soldier estimated that 1,800 shells had exploded in or near the
fort. ``We were like pigeons tied by the legs to be shot at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Historian Taylor is just as interested in the story of the flag before and
after the bombardment as in story of Key.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fort McHenry flag, which originally measured 30 by 42 feet and was flown
from a 90-foot pole, was made at a cost of $405.90 by seamstress Mary
Pickersgill, who laid it out in a Baltimore brewery.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after the bombardment the flag became the personal property of the
fort's commander, Maj. George Armistead. It descended in his family for nearly a
century after he died in 1818.
</P>
<P>
	   In an 1873 letter, Georgina Armistead Appleton, the commandant's daughter,
called the flag ``my treasure'' and explained that one of its 15 stars and much
of its leading edge had been clipped for souvenirs. ``Indeed, had we given all
that we have been oportuned for, little would be left to show,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She wrote that year that while she had long thought of the flag as a family
heirloom she had come to realize that ``this time honored relic'' should not
remain in private hands forever ....'' It was transferred to the Smithsonian in
1907.
</P>
<P>
	   For the conservators in the history museum's super-clean, low-light flag
lab, the objective is not to restore the banner to as-new condition but to
stabilize it as is, a patched, bomb-torn piece of American history.
</P>
<P>
	   Completion is set for 2002. So far, there is no final plan for how the flag
will be displayed. But it is hoped it can be backed with a light, sheer material
so that both sides can be viewed.
</P>
<P>
	   Visitors to the museum on the National Mall can view the operation through a
50-foot glass wall. In an adjacent exhibit they can trace the history of the
banner and listen to the words of ``To Anacreon From Heaven,'' the drinking song
Key adapted for his anthem.
</P>
<P>
	   There are two lines at which Key might nod in agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Voice, fiddle and flute, no longer be mute,'' the old song goes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll lend you my name and inspire you to boot.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Biomedical Funding  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for $1 billion more
for biomedical research in his upcoming budget and try to loosen congressional
restrictions on $4.3 billion more in research money, White House officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will propose $19 billion for the National Institutes of Health in
his fiscal 2001 budget, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It'll mean that the NIH budget will have gone up 80 percent since he's
come into office'' in 1993, Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta, said on
ABC's ``This Week.'' ``We're at the cusp, I think, of breakthroughs in medical
technology.''
</P>
<P>
	   A White House statement said the increase, if approved, would provide ``new
funding for research on every major disease,'' including AIDS, cancer, heart
disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's. It will continue work on decoding the human
genome and help turn research into real-world practice.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, a $20 million Center for Research on Minority Health would be
established to examine why some racial and ethnic groups experience high infant
mortality rates, low rates of childhood immunization and greater incidence of
many diseases, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   On another issue, Podesta said he would meet Thursday with representatives
of the drug industry to explore its offer for compromise on a prescription drug
benefit for Medicare. Clinton plans to address the issue in his State of the
Union speech Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hope to push forward with a comprehensive solution to the Medicare
problem, to deal with the baby boom generation,'' Podesta said. ``Front and
center in that will be a prescription drug benefit, which we think the American
people want and the American people need.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the industry ran a television ad campaign sharply critical of the
administration's proposal, which bogged down on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   The purpose of Thursday's meeting is ``to see if we can make some progress
on this and see if we can find some common ground,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug companies continue to support improved prescription coverage for
the elderly through the private sector. Clinton has proposed having a Medicare
drug benefit run by the government by contracting with companies used by many
private health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta outlined several other White House legislative priorities as
Congress prepares to return to the Capitol next week. They include:
</P>
<P>
	   --Gun control initiatives, including money in the 2001 budget to develop a
``smart gun'' that only the weapon's owner would be able to use and money for
law enforcement to crack down on a small percentage of gun dealers who sell
large numbers of firearms used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   --A balanced budget that would pay off the national debt by 2015 while
providing new spending on Medicare, Social Security, education and the military
-- but may not adhere to previous spending caps.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget agreed to last year by Clinton and congressional Republicans
surpassed those caps, which few of either party believe are realistic in an era
of huge budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not sure I can tell you what the budget caps are right now,'' Podesta
said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Orchestrating Anti-US Protests  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. MANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cuba's government is orchestrating anti-American
demonstrations demanding the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez largely to
protect U.S. property and diplomats in Havana, a top Cuban official says.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly, said Sunday that
anger over Elian's continued presence in the United States is so real and
widespread among Cubans as to pose a potential danger to American interests.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled the boy, rescued at sea
by the Coast Guard after his mother drowned Nov. 25 trying to reach the United
States, must be returned to his father in communist Cuba. But last week,
Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the INS' deadline to give Elian's relatives
in Miami a chance to fight a federal court battle to keep the boy with them.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban-American and other members of Congress have demanded at least that
remedy. Some have suggested congressional action to give Elian permanent
residency or even American citizenship to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are behind the protests because everybody in Cuba is protesting, from
the government to the last citizen,'' Alarcon said on ``Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because of that, he said, the government's only options are either to let
protesters vent their anger ``completely spontaneously'' -- potentially
targeting American interests -- or ``to channel them in a way to permit you to
ensure the safety of the U.S. diplomats'' and other Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Alarcon, President Fidel Castro's top adviser on U.S. matters, derided the
suggestion of a special congressional grant of citizenship to the boy.
``Congress is supposed to be a serious institution and not an instrument to
permit what amounts to a kidnapping of a small boy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The citizenship idea is ``absolutely nonsense,'' Alarcon added on NBC's
``Meet The Press.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, said last week he feels like
``breaking the neck'' of politicians fighting the boy's return and has no
intention of coming to Miami to pick up his son. ``Miami Cubans would just
entangle me in their political games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sunday, U.S. politicians repeatedly demanded that he come.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let the father come to the United States, bring his family here, both
grandmothers, make his case in court and then have it decided right there,''
Reform Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   Texas George W. Bush, a Republican presidential hopeful, said he hopes the
elder Gonzalez ``would be allowed to come ... inhale that great breath of
freedom, to see how is son is being accepted here, take some time for himself
and make the decision (about Elian's future) here on U.S. soil.''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking from Havana, Alarcon said Gonzalez is free to go whenever he can be
assured of getting his son without being entangled in legal or political
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   But Alarcon added, ``We have gotten the advice of many lawyers, including
U.S. officials, that he should not go to that country.'' Among other perils, he
said, Gonzalez could face would be the threat of a congressional subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, another GOP presidential contender, joined
those pushing citizenship for Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've done that to so many others who have been able to escape,'' he told
NBC. ``Look, the only people that have been returned to Cuba have been
criminals. I don't think that Elian falls into that category.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alarcon denounced the citizenship effort. ``You cannot impose citizenship
upon anybody,'' he said. ``And this individual, this 6-year-old boy, has not
requested anything, and he cannot, legally speaking. ... This is going too far,
really.''

<HEADLINE> Samsung Developing Cyber-Microwave  </HEADLINE>
    By TAMMY WEBBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Spending too much time in the kitchen?
</P>
<P>
	   Manufacturers at the International Housewares Show think they have a
solution -- linking microwave ovens to the Internet for an easier cooking
experience.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharp Electronics Corp. has developed a convection microwave oven that can
download recipes from the company's Web site. The microwave then gives
step-by-step instructions on preparing the meal, and automatically sets the
time, adjusts the power and does the roasting, baking, broiling or grilling.
</P>
<P>
	   Samsung is developing a microwave that reads directions on pre-packaged food
when the package's bar code is swiped across a special sensor.
</P>
<P>
	   The oven, being developed with Rutgers University researchers, will then
contact the manufacturers' Internet site, read the directions and cook the meal
-- even taking care of any necessary turning -- while you do something else.
</P>
<P>
	   Putting cyberspace in the kitchen will simplify people's lives by reducing
the amount of time they must spend preparing meals, said Sharp product
development manager Joy Weis Daniel, demonstrating the new oven at the trade
show, which opened Sunday in Chicago,
</P>
<P>
	   "It does all the thinking," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, why swipe a bar code, for example, when you can just read the package
directions?
</P>
<P>
	   Rutgers University researcher Kit Yam, who's helping develop the technology,
gives soggy fish sticks as an example. Directions currently can't be tailored to
every microwave. If they're not right for the oven you're using, you end up with
food that has poor consistency and bad taste, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kota Chang, who was checking out new products for a Pasadena, Calif.,
appliance manufacturer, thinks there is another reason.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just think people are getting more and more lazy," he said, adding that
Americans are ready to take the next step in microwave technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sharp microwave requires a separate PC that can be in any room. The
recipe is downloaded into a data box, which is then connected to the microwave.
Customers could only download recipes from the Sharp Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither microwave is yet available to U.S. consumers. Sharp began selling
its product in Japan in October and hopes to introduce it in the U.S. in the
next year or so, and Samsung officials say they hope to have their oven in
stores next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Such new-style cooking isn't inexpensive. Sharp's new oven sells for about
$1,000 in Japan, said Heather Sweet, an associate marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
	   Samsung's bar code-reading oven will likely cost less than $500 when it hits
the U.S. market, said Dennis Joyner, the company's national marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
	   By then, the unit may even be capable of keeping an inventory of groceries
and notifying users when it's time to restock, he said. Eventually, it could be
connected to a touch-screen computer that allows access to the entire Internet
-- including everything from nutrition about the meal being cooked to weather
and news reports -- said Yam.

<HEADLINE> 'Happy Birthday' sung to cardinal by 3,000 at St. Pat's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Three thousand worshipers sang "Happy Birthday" to
Cardinal John O'Connor as he celebrated Mass the day after turning 80.
<P>
	   "Well, this is wonderful, but does anybody have a job for me?" the cardinal
joked after receiving a standing ovation at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cardinals lose their voting power for new popes once they turn 80, and Pope
John Paul II is expected to name a replacement for O'Connor soon. O'Connor is
also in frail health, unable to stand for long periods as he recovers from
August surgery to remove a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this time, when your illness makes new demands upon your spiritual and
physical resources, I pray that you will press forward, with faith and hope,"
the pope said in a letter read during the Sunday service.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionally, the Vatican announces new appointments for U.S. posts on
Tuesdays, and O'Connor's successor could be named as early as this week. But the
cardinal's spokesman, Joe Zwilling, noted that the announcement may not be made
that soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "It might happen six months from now," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Zwilling said O'Connor "has left the decision of his future entirely in the
hands of Pope John Paul II."
</P>
<P>
	   Zwilling acknowledged that O'Connor has a role in making a recommendation
about his successor, but he said the final decision is made by the pope.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday night, the cardinal attended a birthday party at the
Waldorf-Astoria in his honor. It raised more than $5 million for Catholic
education and other charities. The 1,500 guests included several of the
cardinal's potential replacements, including Edwin O'Brien, archbishop to the
U.S. military; Buffalo's Bishop Henry Mansell, a former top aide to O'Connor;
and Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense Test Had Problems  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If all goes as planned Tuesday, a 121-pound ``smart
rock'' will steer itself into the path of a mock warhead about 140 miles above
the central Pacific Ocean. It will create a celestial collision the military
hopes will give its multibillion-dollar national missile defense project a big
boost.
</P>
<P>
	   Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``smart rock'' -- actually a highly sophisticated missile interceptor --
is still ``learning,'' and Pentagon officials are quick to say that while they
hope for a success they will not be surprised if the interceptor misses its
target. After all, they say, this is a testing program and setbacks are to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
	   This is not any run-of-the-mill testing program, however. At stake, in the
Pentagon's view, is the nation's ability to defend itself against the kind of
long-range missile threats that could emerge in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea, for example, is said to be developing a missile with enough
range to reach U.S. soil, although it has not tested it in flight and agreed
recently to halt missile testing for the time being. No other non-NATO country,
other than Russia and China, possesses an intercontinental ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
	   If Tuesday's test from Vandenburg, Air Force Base, Calif., proves
successful, it could lead to a decision this summer by President Clinton to
officially commit the United States to building a defense against missile attack
at a cost of at least $12.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   If it fails, there will be another chance as soon as April to demonstrate
that strategic missile defense is feasible -- just one of several criteria the
president has set for deciding whether to deploy it.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also will take into account the cost at a time when the armed forces
are hard-pressed to buy the conventional weapons they say will be needed in the
decades ahead. And there's the impact on relations with Russia and China, both
of which are strongly opposed to a U.S. national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
	   In his 2001 budget, to be unveiled Feb. 7, Clinton is expected to ask
Congress for an additional $2.2 billion for the program. That would buy an
arsenal of 100 interceptors and pay for more testing and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very high-priority program,'' chief Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon said Friday. ``We are working very hard ... to get the president the
information he needs from the technical side to make a decision sometime this
summer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, if we have a series of tests that are deemed to be failures we
couldn't say that this was ready to deploy,'' Bacon added.
</P>
<P>
	   If Clinton gives the go-ahead this summer, a missile defense could be ready
to begin operating in 2005, although some Pentagon officials closely involved in
the program think that is too ambitious a timetable.
</P>
<P>
	   The first flight test of the missile interceptor -- known as a ``kill
vehicle'' or by its Pentagon nickname, ``smart rock'' -- was last Oct. 2. A
third test is scheduled for April or May. The first test using the final version
of the interceptor is not scheduled until 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the missile used in the October test encountered some glitches en
route to its target, it managed to score a hit -- prompting the Pentagon to
assert that it had demonstrated that a warhead carrying a nuclear or biological
weapon can be totally destroyed and neutralized.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics are less certain. They doubt the reliability of a national missile
defense and fault the Pentagon for planning only three interceptor tests before
recommending a deployment decision to Clinton this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Regardless of the outcome of the upcoming test, it is already clear that
the three tests will not provide sufficient basis to determine whether the ...
system will work,'' said Tom Collina of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which
opposes deployment.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon spokesman Bacon said it is not yet clear what degree of success
must be achieved in the three tests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't tell you what will constitute the evidence we need to call this
system ready to deploy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Restrictions on Biotech Corn  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmentalists and farmers alike are praising the
planting restrictions that the government is placing on genetically altered corn
to prevent insects from become resistant to its toxin.
</P>
<P>
	   About 30 percent of the corn grown last year was Bt corn, named for the
bacteria it contains to kill the European corn borer.
</P>
<P>
	   The new restrictions, which the Environmental Protection Agency worked out
with industry, will require farmers to plant at least 20 percent conventional
corn in most regions, and 50 percent in areas where cotton is grown.
</P>
<P>
	   Seed companies also will be required to expand field monitoring for signs of
where insect resistance may be occurring.
</P>
<P>
	   The planting limits are in line with recommendations made by the National
Corn Growers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see this to be anything major. It's right in line with what
(farmers) are already doing," Lynn Jensen, president of the growers' group, said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The new EPA policy means "there will be more emphasis on making sure
everyone ... plants 20 percent non-Bt" corn, said Leon Corzine, an Illinois
producer.
</P>
<P>
	   Seed supplier Monsanto Co. said the EPA measures "are nothing new for us or
our customers since most all of them were already in place." It said it has
required farmers "growing our Bt corn and Bt cotton to plant refuge areas since
we first commercialized these products in 1996 and 1997."
</P>
<P>
	   Rebecca Goldburg, senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, said
the new restrictions "confirm the fact that Bt corn can pose both an
environmental and resistance management risk."
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA also requiring the seed companies to tell farmers about voluntary
measures they can take to protect Monarch butterflies from being hurt by the
corn's pollen. The agency posted a brief notice about the new restrictions
Friday on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   The butterfly larvae feed on milkweed, which sometimes is found around corn
fields. A study released last May by Cornell University said Monarch larvae died
when they ate pollen from the Bt corn.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are really happy to see that the agency is taking the resistance issues
and the Monarch issue seriously," said Margaret Mellon, director of the
agricultural and biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think the agency has done a good job of jawboning the industry and
getting them to agree to the restrictions in an environment where strictly
speaking they don't have to. We're concerned that they didn't go far enough."
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA's planting restrictions will be higher in cotton-growing areas
because of the widespread use of a Bt version of cotton.
</P>
<P>
	   Surveys by seed companies indicate farmers in Illinois and other areas that
grow much of their corn for export markets are expected to cut back production
of Bt corn this year due to consumer resistance to biotech food overseas, said
growers president Jensen, a South Dakota producer. Growers in other regions
whose crops are used primarily for livestock feed may plant as much or more Bt
corn then they did last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A smaller, rival group that has been critical of biotechnology, the American
Corn Growers Association, has been predicting a sharp decline in Bt corn
plantings.
</P>
<P>
	   Another factor figuring into growers' considerations is that corn borer
infestations have been low throughout much of the Midwest for the past two
years. Biotech corn is more expensive than conventional varieties because of a
special fee charged by the seed companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Commission, which enforces rules for the 15-member European
Union, cited the Cornell study last summer in delaying approval of pending
requests to sell the corn variety. Mexican environmentalists urged their
government to ban its import and use.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to the study, EPA scientists said last year that they knew the
pollen could kill insects but did not believe the butterflies would be exposed
to the toxin outside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA is to consider renewing expiring registrations for Bt corn later
this year and has asked seed companies to provide data on its impact.

<HEADLINE> 'Next Friday' Is a Big Hit Now  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The friendly mouse has given way to the neighborhood
bully.
</P>
<P>
	   "Next Friday," starring Ice Cube as a man on the run from a vengeful bully,
bumped off the reigning box-office champ, the mouse tale "Stuart Little,"
according to industry estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The sequel to the 1995 film "Friday" took in $14.5 million Friday through
Sunday. The movie has grossed $19.1 million since opening Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stuart Little," the No. 1 movie three of the last four weekends, dropped to
second place with $9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Hurricane," which opened in limited release for Academy Award
consideration around Christmas, expanded to 1,454 theaters Friday and came in at
No. 3 for the weekend with $9.1 million. The movie stars Denzel Washington in
the prison saga of boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   "Girl, Interrupted," starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie as mental
patients, also broke out of limited release and grabbed fourth place with $8.2
million in 1,902 theaters.
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernova," a sci-fi adventure featuring James Spader and Angela Bassett,
fizzled with $5.7 million in 2,280 theaters, debuting in eighth place.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing in just 1,103 theaters, "Next Friday" averaged an impressive $13,146
a screen, compared with $6,259 for "The Hurricane" and $4,311 for "Girl,
Interrupted."
</P>
<P>
	   The first "Friday" movie did a modest $27 million at theaters but went on to
become a video hit. "Next Friday" already has done about two-thirds of that
box-office business and grossed twice its production budget in just five days.
</P>
<P>
	   With strong appeal to black movie-goers, the film also benefitted from
release during the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, when movie-going
is up because many people have today off work.
</P>
<P>
	   "Next Friday" drew well among 18-to-25-year-old white crowds, too, said
David Tuckerman, head of distribution for New Line, which released the movie.
Other recent hits with black casts, such as "The Best Man," have had similar
crossover appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "The movie played well in white areas. We were sold out all over the place,"
Tuckerman said. "It appeals to all audiences. It just feels like the country is
maturing about that."
</P>
<P>
	   In "Next Friday," Ice Cube has another battle with the bully from the first
movie, who gets out of prison bent on revenge. The comedy offered some frivolous
fare in a movie market crowded with Oscar contenders.
</P>
<P>
	   "All these Oscar films are terrific, but in terms of audience satisfaction
and escapist entertainment, this offers people something they've been waiting
for," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which
tracks the box office. "A lot of teens have felt left out of the market the last
six weeks or so."
</P>
<P>
	   "Stuart Little" crossed the $100 million mark Saturday, grossing $106.8
million in about five weeks. Also hitting that milestone was Tom Hanks' "The
Green Mile," which has taken in $101.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   They were the 18th and 19th films released in 1999 to pass $100 million,
breaking the record of 18 movies set in 1998, Dergarabedian said.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures were to be released
today.
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Next Friday," $14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. "Stuart Little," $9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   3. "The Hurricane," $9.1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   4. "Girl, Interrupted," $8.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   5. "The Green Mile," $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   6. "Galaxy Quest," $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   7. "The Talented Mr. Ripley," $6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   8. "Supernova," $5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   9. "Toy Story 2," $5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   10. "Any Given Sunday," $4.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Albright Hails U.S.-Mexico Ties  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) -- In contrast to past years, there is little suspense
about whether Mexico will have to endure the stigma this year of a failing grade
in the annual U.S. evaluation of its cooperation with American counterdrug
efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   It won't.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked about the issue Sunday at a
news conference after meeting with Foreign Secretary Rosario Green.
</P>
<P>
	   Both praised the levels of cooperation the two countries have reached on a
range of issues. Green said the U.S.-Mexican ``dialogue of the deaf'' of
previous years is past.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico and other countries that serve as drug producers or transit points
have complained bitterly about the yearly congressionally mandated process under
which those deemed to be not fully cooperating with U.S. control efforts can be
subject to economic penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   In some years, there has been almost a cliffhanger atmosphere in the
countdown toward the State Department decision on whether Mexico should be
``certified'' as fully cooperating or ``decertified'' for not doing enough in
the drug war.
</P>
<P>
	   Any suspense over the State Department's decision on Mexico this year, due
at the end of February, seemed to evaporate Sunday when Albright said Mexican
cooperation has been ``at a very good level.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since the certification process was initiated in the mid-1980s, Mexico has
yet to be decertified.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also said, ``Our problems are not as much with each other as they
are with those who are trying to undermine what we are trying to do.'' This
year's certification process involves an evaluation of Mexico and 25 other
countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who do not pass muster can be subject to economic penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   Green said certification did not come up during discussions Sunday at this
picturesque city in Mexico's deep south, the last stop on a three-day Albright
visit to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   She returned to Washington late Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   In her discussion of the drug issue, the secretary talked about Mexico's
willingness to cooperate but made no reference to the results it has achieved.
</P>
<P>
	   This tactic has been a sore point with some lawmakers who believe the State
Department's evaluation should be more results-oriented.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico was certified last February, even though its cocaine seizures were
down 35 percent in 1998 and eradication of opium poppies did not keep pace with
new cultivation. The overall harvest increased by 25 percent, government figures
show.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Fiano, chief of operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration,
said in congressional testimony in September that ``continuing reports of
corruption and the rapidly growing power and influence of the major organized
criminal groups in Mexico cause us great concern about the long-term prospects
for success.''
</P>
<P>
	   Weeks later, however, Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said record
hauls of 1,235 tons of marijuana and 185 kilograms of heroin had been seized by
Mexico over the previous year. He said the 25.5 tons of confiscated cocaine was
among the highest totals in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Barry McCaffrey, the Clinton administration's drug control
chief, agreed that Mexican efforts were producing results.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The numbers are spectacular,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Judge Putin on Present  </HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SEWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- The once-dreaded KGB has fared well in the new Russia. Not
long ago, just looking at its ocher and gray stone headquarters in central
Moscow drove fear into most Russians.
</P>
<P>
	   In the eight years since the Soviet collapse, the KGB has changed its name,
hung white, blue and red Russian flags on the front of the building and seen its
leaders emerge in influential roles in business and politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Vladimir Putin, who spent 15 years as an active-duty KGB officer, is the
front-runner in the presidential race to capture Russia's highest office. That's
something that worries some in the West but doesn't seem to bother most
Russians.
</P>
<P>
	   What Putin did while serving the Soviet secret police and what he now stands
for remain murky. The real keys to his past are locked up in files that are
closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
	   Russians are quick to note that Putin didn't serve in the most despised
department of the KGB, the dreaded Fifth Directorate that was responsible for
domestic repression. And they point out that former President Bush once ran the
CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   Weeding out former members of the security services would be impossible in
Russia, where hundreds of thousands of people once worked for the KGB and
millions more served as informers, at least part-time.
</P>
<P>
	   Having worked in the security forces is not a badge of disgrace in Russia,
unlike in the Czech Republic, Poland or the former Soviet republics in the
Baltics, which have tried to confront their totalitarian past.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Russians appear willing to judge Putin on what he can do for them now
rather than worry about his past, about which they know little anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   Filip Alexandrov, a 25-year-old actor who works part-time as a bartender,
said he doesn't plan to vote for Putin but doesn't hold his espionage
credentials against the acting Russian president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't mean a thing that he was in the KGB because in our country
millions of people worked for them in one way or another,'' Alexandrov said.
``Besides, there won't be any going back to the old ways.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, who studied law, joined the KGB in 1975. After training, he was sent
to East Germany, a key Soviet satellite at the edge of the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's time in East Germany coincided with the years of ``stagnation'' back
home, when top KGB officials became increasingly aware -- and worried -- about
the Soviet Union's growing technological and military backwardness.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts and German media reports say Putin's assignments in East Germany
included acquiring Western technology and recruiting West German businessmen as
informers.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Berlin Wall fell, Putin slipped back into his hometown, Leningrad,
which was gripped by the furor of ``perestroika,'' former Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's efforts to open up his country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Putin was placed as a watchdog over democratic development,'' said
Alexander Rahr, the top Russia expert at the German Society for Foreign Policy.
``People like Putin were chosen to guard over controlled change in the Soviet
Union.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin became a top aide to Anatoly Sobchak, the reformist mayor of
Leningrad, who was once a presidential hopeful himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Sobchak, Putin used his excellent German and experience living abroad
to help attract Western, especially German, capital to Leningrad. The city was
renamed St. Petersburg after the Soviet collapse in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1990s, according to Rahr, Putin won ``good marks'' from German
businessmen as somebody who ``gets things done.'' Russians today like his tough,
take-charge attitude.
</P>
<P>
	   While serving Sobchak, Putin was perceived as firmly anchored in the reform
camp.
</P>
<P>
	   Even among former dissidents, there appears to be little concern that Putin
could reinstate the tight political controls, censorship and closed borders of
the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no way back, no return to terror and political isolation,'' said
Boris Pustintsev, who spent five years in prison for protesting the Soviet
invasion of Hungary in 1956. ``It's not possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   But during the years that Putin spent in St. Petersburg, the city became
known as one of the most corrupt and dangerous in Russia, and Putin's past is
not necessarily squeaky clean.
</P>
<P>
	   Local lawmakers in St. Petersburg tried to investigate allegations that
Putin was involved in an export deal that allegedly violated Russian
legislation. However, the probe found no wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   After losing mayoral elections in 1996, Putin's former boss, Sobchak, fled
to France after he fell under suspicion of corruption. He returned to Russia
only after his protege became prime minister in August.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin moved into the highest levels of Russian power in 1998 when he was
named head of the Federal Security Service, the main successor to the KGB.
</P>
<P>
	   During his term as security service chief, Putin was no more successful than
his predecessors in fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Putin has been at the very heart of institutions that have been deeply
corrupt,'' said Mark Galeotti, head of the Russian crime research center at
Keele University in England.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has never made any public effort to distance himself from the security
services and has publicly honored its former leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Ordinary Russians appear to like Putin's clean-cut, sober image. The most
recent polls suggest he could win the March 26 presidential elections in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Putin's past doesn't bother me. If business goes well, so what if he
worked in the KGB,'' said Valera Karmanov, a 30-year-old security guard. ``It
doesn't matter as long as he runs things well and doesn't steal.''

Cuba Orchestrating Anti-US Protests
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cuba's government is orchestrating anti-American
demonstrations demanding the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez largely to
protect U.S. property and diplomats in Havana, a top Cuban official says.
Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly, said Sunday that
anger over Elian's continued presence in the United States is so real and
widespread among Cubans as to pose a potential danger to American interests. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled the boy, rescued at sea by the
Coast Guard after his mother drowned Nov. 25 trying to reach the United States,
must be returned to his father in communist Cuba.

New Restrictions on Biotech Corn

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmentalists and farmers alike are praising the
planting restrictions that the government is placing on genetically altered corn
to prevent insects from become resistant to its toxin. About 30 percent of the
corn grown last year was Bt corn, named for the bacteria it contains to kill the
European corn borer. The new restrictions, which the Environmental Protection
Agency worked out with industry, will require farmers to plant at least 20
percent conventional corn in most regions, and 50 percent in areas where cotton
is grown.

repeatedly failed to account for highly classified documents, The Washington
Post reported. The IG report said lax security procedures plagued the
department's handling of the government's most sensitive intelligence reports
and that 140 offices handling those materials had never been swept for listening
devices, the paper said in Monday's editions.

defeat, then quickly went to Lagos' campaign headquarters at a downtown hotel to

<HEADLINE> American Music Awards To Be Awarded  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dick Clark says any recording artist interested in
acceptance from their peers should hope for a Grammy Award.
</P>
<P>
	   But those interested in their careers, he adds, should shoot for an American
Music Award.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the Grammys, awarded by music-industry voters, American Music Awards
winners are chosen by listeners across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I were an artist interested in longevity and a career, I'd be interested
in the American Music Awards," said Clark. "I'd want that trophy on my shelf
because these awards are a reflection of popular taste."
</P>
<P>
	   "Without a doubt, this show is a popularity contest," said Clark, who is
serving as executive producer of the awards show. "We make no bones about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Comedian Norm MacDonald has been tapped to host the 27th annual American
Music Awards, set to air tonight on ABC. Winners are decided by votes from a
sampling of about 20,000 music fans nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Performers scheduled to appear on the three-hour show include Lenny Kravitz,
Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, the Eurythmics and Enrique Iglesias.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark said he is excited by this year's diverse slate of nominees. The
favorite pop-rock musician categories include such musicians as Latin sensation
Ricky Martin, R&AMP;B veteran Whitney Houston, retro-funk rocker Lenny Kravitz and
1970s hitmaker Carlos Santana, who returned to commercial success in 1999 with
the smash album "Supernatural."
</P>
<P>
	   "The American Music Awards is one of the few times you get people of all
ages to watch a show and have the kids saying, 'See, Dad, that's the music I'm
talking about,"' Clark said. "Or you have adults telling their kids, 'See,
that's Carlos Santana. I've been telling you about him for years. That's who he
is."'
</P>
<P>
	   Santana is nominated for favorite pop-rock band, duo or group, along with
the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernatural," combining the guitarist's searing instrumentals with vocal
collaborators such as Dave Matthews, Lauryn Hill and Rob Thomas, also is
nominated for favorite pop or rock album. The other nominees are the Backstreet
Boys' "Millennium" and Britney Spears' "...Baby One More Time."
</P>
<P>
	   The American Music Awards traditionally are a buildup to the Grammys, which
will be presented Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana leads Grammy nominees with 10, including record and album of the
year. The album also scored a songwriting nomination for Itaal Shur and Thomas
for the single "Smooth."
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel very grateful and honored, but I don't trip on it because I don't go
to work on an album with award expectations," Santana said after the Grammy
nominations came out this month. "That's just not my motivation. My motivation
is to reach people's hearts."
</P>
<P>
	   Tonight's awards show also will feature results of an Internet poll on
listeners' favorite musical artists for each decade from the 1950s through the
1980s.

<HEADLINE> A Fight for Social Conservatives  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- With just a week until Iowa's precinct caucuses
launch the presidential nominating season, there's a still unresolved fight for
the support of social conservatives who are a force in Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
	   To various degrees, four of the six Republican rivals are contending for
that vote, and conceding that the issue has yet to be settled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You get huge changes in the last seven to 10 days as people really
focus,'' said publisher Steve Forbes, interviewed Sunday on Iowa Public
Television. ``I come from the business sector, where competition is a daily fact
of life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes opened the final week before the caucuses rumbling around the state
in an intense grassroots bus tour sounding sharply conservative themes, but the
ground was not being ceded to him.
</P>
<P>
	   Activists Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, along with Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch offer
similar conservative themes that have divided the Republican right. One effect
of splitting the conservative vote has been to dilute the impact of
conservatives who have yet to coalesce behind one contender.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls have generally shown Texas Gov. George W. Bush ahead, with Forbes in
second place in Iowa and all the others in single digits. Bauer has hit the
airwaves with new commercials, and is crisscrossing the state in the final days.
</P>
<P>
	   He argues that the commitment his backers display will pay off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that with the passion level we've got among our supporters, we're
going to be pleased on caucus night,'' said Bauer.
</P>
<P>
	   He has sought to display some differences with Forbes, and takes care to
remind social conservatives that Forbes hasn't always been with them on issues
like abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ''... I have a 25-year record on the sanctity of life,'' Bauer said on ``Fox
News Sunday.'' ``I'm not a Johnny-come-lately like Mr. Forbes.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Keyes has his own appeal, with a fiery speaking style and an
in-your-face conservative message. In the latest GOP debate, he declined the
offer to give a closing statement and instead led the candidates in a nationally
televised prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   With almost no organization he got 8 percent of the vote in the last
precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people who watch those debates have already decided who is
outstanding,'' said Keyes, also speaking on Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch has registered as barely a blip in the polling for Iowa's caucuses,
but he aired a 30-minute commercial Saturday night, largely devoted to blasting
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't you think it's time that somebody speaks substantially on what's
going on rather than 30-second spots and signs and hoopla ..., really that's
what we've been getting during this campaign,'' said Hatch, who joined Bauer and
Keyes on Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona Sen. John McCain appeared for a campaign debate in the state, but
isn't competing in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show Forbes with more success in building backing among the right as
he argues that he has the resources to take the conservative debate to Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You see it in my whole campaign,'' said Forbes. ``They realize I have a
broad-based, principled message that has brought people together.''
</P>
<P>
	   That message was resonating with some as Forbes toured the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarence Van Zee of Pella said he looked over the field of conservatives and
had to decide which one actually had a shot at winning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to be realistic,'' and that led him to Forbes, Van Zee said. ``He
admits he doesn't have a lot of charisma, but I think he's what you see is what
you get.''
</P>
<P>
	   Van Zee's wife, Trudy, conceded that Bauer is ``a good man, too'' but said
Forbes has a broader appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe this man (Forbes) has more answers to more questions,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rita Wilson of Columbus Junction picked Forbes and said it's a matter of
commitment. Why not the front-running Bush?
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he's pro-life personally, but I don't know if he'd go out and
fight for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer insists, however, he's poised for a surprise. Using a direct-mail
fund-raising network, he has assembled enough money to stay on the airwaves
during the caucus campaign's closing days. People have often written him off
prematurely, Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Commentators and conventional political analysts thought 10 months ago
that I wouldn't last in the race for three weeks,'' he said. ``Every time there
has been a vote ... we have done substantially better than polling and my
opponents have done substantially worse than the polling.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes said he's often dismissed or ignored by the media, but said he can
overcome that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given the disadvantages that somebody like me ... labors under, I think
that if I show at all, it's a wonderful performance,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Jousting Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The GOP jousting over taxes continues between Texas Gov.
George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, who disagree sharply over how the federal
government should use its huge projected budget surplus. Fellow presidential
contender Steve Forbes says both have it wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My only point is, there's a fundamental disagreement between Senator
McCain and me,'' Bush said in a taped interview aired Sunday on CNN's ``Late
Edition.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said his five-year, $483 billion tax-relief proposal -- which would
consume most of the anticipated surplus not already earmarked for Social
Security -- would help curb bigger government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The surest way to make sure the budgets aren't bloated is to give the
people their money back,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   A five-year, $237 billion tax cut offered by McCain, R-Ariz., would reserve
about $729 billion to keep Social Security and Medicare solvent as the baby boom
generation retires. But Bush said his own plan is ``more realistic'' because it
doesn't depend on Congress to safeguard that money.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain ``trusts money left in Washington, D.C., will be properly spent,''
Bush said. ``I happen to think it's going to be spent on bigger government and
more programs.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the senator, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' argued that Bush's
tax cut is too skewed toward the wealthy and does little to protect the
government retirement programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm saying it's a matter of priorities,'' McCain said. ``I'm saying we
have obligations, and I'm saying it's conservative to make sure that we make the
promises hold that we made in the form of Social Security, Medicare, and not lay
a huge debt down on future generations of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, meanwhile, dismissed Bush and McCain as the ``timid twins'' on tax
cuts and touted his proposal for a flat tax and an end to the federal tax code
as being far bolder than anything the governor and senator have advanced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I get to the heart of the problem: get rid of the code, don't tinker
around the edges,'' Forbes said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes also began airing a television commercial Sunday in Iowa, site of the
Jan. 24 caucuses that open the presidential nominating season. The ad stresses
character and repeats the millionaire publisher's contention that he isn't
beholden to any special interests. ``He'll keep his word,'' the announcer says.
``Character matters, a lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new ad is a follow-up to one running in Iowa and New Hampshire that
accuses Bush of breaking his no-tax pledge as governor.
</P>
<P>
	   On other issues Sunday:
</P>
<P>
	   --Bush, McCain and Forbes agreed that South Carolina voters should determine
whether the Confederate flag continues to fly atop the state capitol and that it
should not be an issue for the presidential campaign. ``That's a legitimate
debate that will be decided by the people of South Carolina,'' said Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   --Bush said if he were president now he would withhold International
Monetary Fund aid and Export-Import Bank loans from Russia until interim
president Vladimir Putin halted bombing in Chechnya that hits ``innocent women
and children.'' But that would not extend to U.S. aid intended to dismantle
nuclear weapons. ``I think that's a different issue as far as I'm concerned,''
he said. McCain also has said he would withhold such funding from Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   --McCain said he was concerned about industry mergers and that the Senate
Commerce Committee he chairs will hold hearings on the proposed union of America
Online and Time Warner. ``You reach a point at some time where it's not good for
the consumer and it stifles competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   --Forbes rejected criticism that his TV ads upbraiding Bush over a Texas
tax-cut pledge will hurt the GOP in the November election. ``Do we want an
honest, vigorous debate, or do we want to pretend there are no differences
between the candidates?'' Forbes said. ``This is not going to be a coronation.
This is going to be a real contest.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers say drug industry 'waved white flag' on Medicare-drugs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two members of Congress say the drug industry's
about-face on Medicare coverage for prescription drugs offers hope to millions
of senior citizens on fixed incomes.
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
of America, or Pharma, which represents most of the nation's major drug makers,
has dropped its opposition to putting prescription drugs under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a news conference Sunday with Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y.,
Schumer said putting prescription drugs under Medicare would be a major issue
before Congress this year and "just this week, we picked up a major ally - the
prescription drug industry. The big pharmaceutical industry, which fought us
last year, waved the white flag and said, 'We are going to support this
benefit."'
</P>
<P>
	   Calls to the Washington, D.C., headquarters of Pharma were not immediately
returned. The drug industry has previously cited the cost of research on new
drugs for the high prices charged for some medications.
</P>
<P>
	   The voluntary proposal would cover 80 percent of the cost of generic drugs
and 90 percent of the cost of those produced by a single source. Schumer said
seniors on Medicare would pay $24 a month and half the cost of their drugs up to
$5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Without this coverage, many seniors not covered by other plans are forced to
"weigh the cost of drugs against the cost of food or other essentials," Schumer
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Seniors, who make up 12 percent of the population, buy a third of the
country's prescription drugs, and 13 million seniors with no medical coverage
pay entirely from their own pockets, according to a study released Sunday by
Weiner.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found that some drugs, when prescribed for animals, cost only a
fraction of what they cost when prescribed for people.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those drugs Weiner cited were Lanoxin, a heart medicine that costs $25
for a human dose and only $6 for animals, and Medrol, used to treat arthritis,
allergy and asthma, at $20 for a one-month supply for humans compared with $3.90
for dogs.
</P>
<P>
	   "When one in eight seniors is choosing each month between paying for
medicines and paying for food, yet our pets can get identical drugs for the cost
of a box of milk bones, we must call on the nation's pharmaceutical companies to
revamp their price-gouging practices," Weiner said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Blasts Gore on Poverty  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERLOO, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley put his indictment of the Clinton-Gore
administration's shortcomings into the words of Martin Luther King Jr.,
imagining the late civil rights leader would declare his dream unfulfilled as
long as 14 million American children live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought he'd be saying that that's not good enough,'' the Democratic
presidential contender told a community banquet in King's honor Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the federal holiday celebrating King's birthday, both Bradley and his
opponent, Vice President Al Gore, were taking part in commemorations -- Bradley
by dropping in on Iowa's official ceremony and leading a discussion of race at
Drake University; Gore by attending the King family's memorial service at
Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church and then laying a wreath at King's gravesite.
</P>
<P>
	   This evening, Gore and Bradley were meeting at North High School in Des
Moines for a ``Brown-Black'' forum -- the Democrats' last debate before the Jan.
24 Iowa caucuses decide the first test of candidate strength.
</P>
<P>
	   Organized by Rep. Wayne Ford, Iowa's only black state legislator, the forum
is billed an opportunity for black and Hispanic leaders to question presidential
candidates about minority concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   At rallies in school cafeterias and town meetings in country cafes, the
contest between Bradley and Vice President Al Gore has, so far, played out to
almost exclusively white audiences in this state where blacks represent 1.6
percent of the population, and Hispanics just 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   America has not solved the problem of racism in the 32 years since King was
assassinated in Memphis, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He recalled being 11 or 12 years old in his native Missouri and playing
Little League with a black catcher and black left-fielder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After the game, we would go to a restaurant for hamburgers and we would be
denied service. But because our two African-American players were denied
service, we all left because the team stayed together. That's the way we were,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Racism today ``is more subtle, but no less real,'' Bradley told a small
reception at the Waterloo Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
	   It includes ``not being able to get a loan at the bank to buy that
restaurant and ... doctors in this country, two-thirds of whom won't fully
participate in Medicaid,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he has focused his presidential campaign on child poverty and
universal access to health care because 27 percent of black Americans and 30
percent of Latinos don't have health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Echoing his familiar theme -- that the economic prosperity touted by Gore
and President Clinton still leaves too many Americans behind -- Bradley said he
tried to imagine what King would say about things today.

	   ``I thought that in a country where there are still nearly 14 million
children who still live in poverty, I thought he'd be saying that that's not
good enough. I thought that he would be saying that in a country where there are
44 million Americans without any health insurance that that's not enough,''
Bradley said in a rising voice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought he'd be saying that in a country where families who work hard
and play by the rules but still can't get ahead, that's not enough.''

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bradley Lead in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain and Bill Bradley captured the lead in a New
Hampshire poll as likely voters in the nation's first presidential primary began
paying more attention to the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican McCain and Democrat Bradley, who both trail nationally, gained
support from independents and women in New Hampshire in the last two months,
giving both a slight overall edge, according to a Dartmouth College-Associated
Press poll.
</P>
<P>
	   More than four out of five in the January poll said they were paying at
least some attention to the campaign, up from three-fourths in November. And
those who had received a phone call or mail from a candidate's campaign rose 20
percentage points since November.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll Sunday suggested that McCain and Bradley also improved their
standing with registered voters in their own parties in New Hampshire, which has
its primary Feb. 1. Both Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
the national Democratic and Republican front-runners, respectively, had the
advantage in a November Dartmouth-AP poll of New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest poll, taken Jan. 9-12, McCain had 42 percent support to 33
percent for Bush in the Republican race; Bradley was at 49 percent to 43 percent
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous poll, conducted Oct. 31-Nov. 3, had Bush in the lead, 44
percent to 31 percent, and Gore had an edge over Bradley, 48 percent to 41
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The margin of error for the sample of 518 likely voters in the Republican
primary was 4.5 percentage points, while it was plus or minus 5 percentage
points for the 418 likely voters in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The other GOP candidates -- publisher Steve Forbes, former U.N. Ambassador
Alan Keyes, conservative activist Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah --
trail the front-runners. Only Forbes was in double digits, with 11 percent, the
same as in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Republican and Democratic races are very close, with many New
Hampshire polls showing a tilt toward McCain and Bradley, and others showing the
races too close to call or with an edge for Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dartmouth-AP poll disclosed some interesting dynamics in the races that
have developed into tight contests in both parties in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll included 498 likely voters who were first contacted in early
November and were reinterviewed from Jan. 9-12.
</P>
<P>
	   Among that group, one out of three Republicans and one in five Democrats had
switched candidates. The differences were most pronounced among Republicans --
with 80 percent of the switchers from Bush going to McCain, a senator from
Arizona, and Bush getting 20 percent of former McCain supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain pulled slightly ahead of Bush on the questions of who is perceived as
most trustworthy and as providing the strongest leadership, according to the
poll.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of the Republican switchers were those who said they had been
paying very little attention to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that basically McCain has been able to establish himself with
voters,'' said Linda Fowler, a professor of government and director of
Dartmouth's Rockefeller Center. ``There have been a lot of debates, a lot of
advertising, a lot of free media. People were responding to names, now they're
responding to a more substantial picture of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some candidates are converting people, and Bush isn't one of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain improved his appeal with women by 16 percentage points since
November, and is now supported equally by men and women -- 42 percent among each
group, the poll showed. He also improved his standing with independents by 16
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Marise LaPorte, 62, of Milford, N.H., attended a town hall meeting held by
McCain last week and liked his straightforward approach.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems that when something comes up, McCain addresses it. He doesn't
evade the issue. He meets things head-on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes in voters' perceptions of the candidate weren't as pronounced on
the Democratic side. Slightly more people viewed Bradley as more trustworthy
than Gore in both the November and January polls, with more than four in 10
saying that about Bradley and under one-third saying it about Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Linda O'Mahoney, a Democratic-leaning independent from Pembroke, N.H., said
Bradley came across as wishy-washy when she first saw him in television ads and
news coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But when I saw him in person, I was tremendously impressed and moved by
what he had to say,'' O'Mahoney said. ``He was just more dynamic in person.''

<HEADLINE> Creating U.S. Stamps Fun for Artist  </HEADLINE>
   By DARA AKIKO WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Every day, millions of people see Carl Herrman's
art work -- and spit on it.
</P>
<P>
	   As a designer of at least 250 U.S. postage stamps, he expects it.
</P>
<P>
	   Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and Barbie -- Herrman has created
some of the U.S. Postal Service's most memorable stamps since the agency moved
away from staid subjects such as flags and eagles. But it is Herrman's
commemorative millennium stamp that may stand the test of time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like a calling card for America,'' Herrman said. ``Three hundred
years from now, someone will see the millennium stamp. It is important that it
be done nicely.''
</P>
<P>
	   The stamp features a baby wearing a black top hat and blowing a horn, with
streamers, confetti and a ''2000'' banner across the bottom. The design is based
on a drawing by American illustrator J.C. Leyendecker, whose original appeared
Jan. 2, 1937, on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
	   To entice collectors, the Postal Service is offering a Jan. 1, 2000,
postmark through Jan. 26 to people who send self-addressed envelopes with the
millennium stamp to a Washington, D.C., address.
</P>
<P>
	   Collectors, however, are divided on the stamp's attractiveness and whether
it appropriately captures the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It very effectively uses the new year theme,'' said Peter Martin, editor
of Scott Stamp Monthly. He likes the stamp's look but says some people find the
baby too chubby.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Schreiber, managing editor of Linn's Stamp News, doesn't like it at
all. ``It's a stamp a woman would buy rather than a man,'' he said. ``It doesn't
appeal to me. I don't think it appeals to most men.''
</P>
<P>
	   The criticisms don't bother Herrman. His greatest challenge, he says, is
finding something different and exciting for such a tiny medium.
</P>
<P>
	   Herrman, a graphic artist with extensive experience as a commercial
designer, was approached by a friend in 1992 about a position with the Postal
Service. He designed a four-color Statue of Liberty stamp with a sunset in the
background, and was hooked.
</P>
<P>
	   He wouldn't say how lucrative the stamp design business is, but it affords
the Massapequa, N.Y., native a California home, which he shares with his wife,
Sharon, and their 25-pound Scottish terrier, Squiggy, one block from the beach.
</P>
<P>
	   Each new stamp must first be approved by the Postal Service's citizens'
stamp review committee. Sometimes Herrman is assigned a stamp to design; other
times he offers his own ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   A computer chip stamp, for instance, was not his idea and was not ``sexy or
colorful'' to create, Herrman said. But Marilyn Monroe was difficult because
``how do you do justice'' to someone who personifies sexy and colorful, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Slinky, he took lots of pictures and played with the wiry toy,
observing it in motion. He was finally satisfied with a design showing it
straddling a step. ``Actually, it's an adorable stamp.''
</P>
<P>
	   For a stamp celebrating the 100th anniversary of the first American
submarine, he spoke with Edward Latimer Beach, who authored ``Run Silent, Run
Deep'' and was a World War II submarine commander.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ideas were just flying off the wall,'' Herrman said. ``Talking to Capt.
Beach, it was like talking to Lindbergh or somebody.''
</P>
<P>
	   Herrman's stamps featuring the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and a character
from the Broadway show ``Cats'' were released this month. They were chosen in
nationwide balloting last year as two of 15 commemorative stamps saluting the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Of all the stamps Herrman has designed, the comics classics are his
favorites. ``I probably got into this business because of my admiration for Dick
Tracy and Prince Valiant. Having a chance to do the comic classics was very
fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the limitless possibilities, there is still one very personal stamp
Hermann longs to do.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It'd be nice to have Squiggy on a stamp,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITORS: To obtain the Jan. 1, 2000, postmark, send a self-addressed
envelope with the Millennium stamp to: Year 2000 Stamp, 900 Brentwood Road NE,
Washington, D.C. 20066-9991. All orders must be postmarked by Jan. 26.

<HEADLINE> Public Urination Plan Criticized  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT JABLON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A homeless advocate has criticized city officials for
trying to ban urinating in public rather than providing housing for the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one's the bad guy here. The bad guy is homelessness,'' Ted Hayes said
last week as he stood in front of a reeking Skid Row toilet to make his point.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, which is under review by the city Police Commission, would make
it a misdemeanor to urinate or defecate in public or in a place open to public
view unless it was a restroom or similar dedicated facility.
</P>
<P>
	   The maximum punishment would be six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   At least eight California cities, including Pasadena, Santa Ana and San
Diego, already have such ordinances, said Deputy City Attorney Hank Morris, who
added that complaints from local businesses usually prompt their passage.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Skid Row news conference Friday, Hayes argued that the city has ignored
the needs of homeless residents.
</P>
<P>
	   He donned plastic medical gloves to open the door of one of the portable
toilets that dot Fifth Street near downtown. There are about 30 of the white
plastic obelisks in the area, but they are poorly maintained and serve as ``sex
bins and drug bins'' that many homeless avoid, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is America's shame,'' he added, displaying the filthy, fly-dotted
interior.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's filthy in there. You might catch something,'' said a woman crouched
between shopping carts and blanket lean-tos on the street.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearby stores, restaurants and even shelters refuse to allow street people
to use their facilities, leaving them nowhere to go but outside, Hayes and
others said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles proposal is the latest attempt by cities around the nation
to use nuisance ordinances in an effort to force the homeless off the streets,
Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has ordered police to arrest homeless
people who refuse orders to move from sidewalks. Judges last year temporarily
stopped a plan to evict from city shelters homeless adults who refuse to work.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the Clinton administration announced it was giving out $900
million to cities, states and nonprofit groups to help some 245,000 homeless
people find their way off the streets and into productive lives.
</P>
<P>
	   Hayes acknowledged that using the streets as a toilet is a problem, saying
it breeds disease and pollutes the ocean when raw sewage is washed down storm
drains.
</P>
<P>
	   But a law making public urination illegal would be a waste of time and
money, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The police would have to catch someone in the very act,'' Hayes said,
adding money for such an effort would be better used to build flush toilets and
hire the homeless to guard and clean them.
</P>
<P>
	   In the long term, he said, a national plan to eradicate homelessness should
be adopted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot consider ourselves a civilized, free, democratic republic if we
cannot get American people off of these streets,'' Hayes said.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Pot Found on Whitney Houston  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- Whitney Houston was caught with 15.2 grams of
marijuana at an airport security checkpoint last week but boarded her departing
flight before police arrived, a newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribune-Herald of Hilo, Hawaii said an airport security officer at
Keahole-Kona International Airport found the marijuana Tuesday after he asked
the Grammy-winning singer to open her bag for inspection,
</P>
<P>
	   The bag was seized, but the singer walked away when security officers tried
to detain her, said Police Lt. Robert Hickcox. Houston's United Airlines flight
to San Francisco departed 45 minutes before police arrived, Hickcox said.
</P>
<P>
	   Airport security officers, employed by a private company, can only arrest
passengers for crimes related to airport security. The firm, Wackenhut of
Hawaii, declined comment to The Associated Press on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   An answering service for Houston's spokeswoman, Carol Stone, said Stone was
out of the country and could not immediately be reached for comment. A message
left with her answering service was not immediately returned on Sunday night to
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the newspaper, the Hawaii County Police Department's daily
police bulletin noted 15.2 grams of marijuana was recovered at the airport at
2:28 p.m. on Tuesday, but did not identify a suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   Police planned to refer the case to the Hawaii County prosecutor's office, a
process that could take a month, Hickcox told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Police declined to comment to the AP late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at Arista Records, Houston's record label, could not be reached
for comment in either Los Angeles or New York on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Possession of 15 grams of marijuana could lead to a drug charge of promotion
of a detrimental drug, Hickcox said. The petty misdemeanor is punishable by up
to 30 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston has sold millions of records is one of the world's most successful
recording artists. She has also starred in such films as "The Bodyguard" and
"Waiting to Exhale."
</P>
<P>
	   She was nominated this month for four Grammy awards for her latest album,
"My Love is Your Love."

<HEADLINE> State Department Security Said Lax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lax security procedures have plagued the State
Department's handling of the government's most sensitive intelligence reports,
The Washington Post reported today citing a department internal audit.
</P>
<P>
	   The audit by the State Department's inspector general said 239 of 1,890
``sensitive compartmented information'' intelligence reports -- called SCI --
from the National Security Agency's Cryptological Support Group had not been
returned to the group's secure facility inside the State Department between
August and October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In one case, a pouch was returned empty; another was returned open with the
key in it, the Post quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Department is substantially not in compliance with the director of
central intelligence's directives that govern the handling of SCI,'' the
inspector general, Jacqueline Williams-Bridger, concluded in the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Auditors also found that State Department security officials failed to sweep
scores of rooms for bugging devices and repeatedly failed to account for highly
classified documents.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post noted that all of the incidents cited in the IG report occurred
before FBI agents discovered a Russian spy lurking outside the State Department
building, leading to discovery of a listening device placed in a conference room
on the seventh floor of the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general's report, completed in September but kept largely
confidential, was ordered by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 1998
after an earlier security breach.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, a man walked into the executive secretary's office, six doors down
from Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's, took classified briefing
materials in view of two secretaries and walked out. The man was never
identified and the materials were never recovered, a senior State Department
official told the Post said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper quoted a senior State Department official as saying the House and
Senate intelligence committees will receive a full report on planned security
upgrades by Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The Associated Press reported earlier on other sections of the IG report
that said thousands of authorized visitors, including hundreds of foreign
government officials, had enjoyed unescorted access throughout headquarters once
they were cleared by the main security desk.
</P>
<P>
	   In one two-day period in September 1998, the inspector general found, 1,726
visitors, including 326 foreign officials, entered the building and most moved
``about the building unescorted.''
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department stopped allowing authorized visitors unescorted access
to its sprawling headquarters last summer.

<HEADLINE> Drug Giants Agree on Merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- British pharmaceutical heavyweights Glaxo Wellcome PLC and
SmithKline Beecham PLC reached agreement to merge into the world's largest
drugmaker, the companies announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger creates a company valued at $182.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said the merger would create $1.6 billion in pretax cost savings
after three years. Job cuts were expected, the group said, but it released no
other details.
</P>
<P>
	   The planned merger still must be approved by the Federal Trade Commission
and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   The group would have a 7.5 percent share of the global pharmaceutical
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the planned deal, Glaxo shareholders would hold 58.8 percent stake in
the new group, while SmithKline holds a 41.25 stake.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company will have its corporate headquarters in London. Its new
operational base will be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The planned merger demonstrates the pressure facing even the biggest names
in the pharmaceutical industry to consolidate with rivals as a way to afford the
rising costs of developing and selling new medicines. It is also likely to
trigger a new round of takeovers and mergers throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Only last week, Pfizer Inc. emerged as the likely winner in the battle for
U.S. drugmaker Warner-Lambert Co. Bowing to pressure from its investors,
Warner-Lambert management said they would negotiate a buyout from Pfizer,
backing away from a previously announced merger deal with American Home Products
Corp. If that deal goes forward, the combined group would have 6.5 percent of
the global market.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Glaxo and SmithKline were only formally announced on Friday.
Previous discussions between the two groups collapsed two years ago over
differences between their top executives.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's strength lies in its top anti-migraine drug, Imitrex, and in
treatments for asthma and viral infections including HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline's top products include the antibiotic Augmentin, the
antidepressant Paxil and a new diabetes drug, Avandia. It also has a strong
vaccines business.
</P>
<P>
	   After news emerged that the companies were in merger talks, analysts said a
consolidation would make sense. The two companies have complementary drug
portfolios, and a merger would let them pool their research and development
funds and would give the merged company a bigger sales and marketing force.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, after announcing that talks had resumed, both companies saw their
U.S. shares surge on the New York Stock Exchange. Glaxo rose $2.25 to $60.25,
while SmithKline rose $3 to $69.75.
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwide pharmaceutical sales of the combined company would total $17.8
billion, based on 1998 annual figures. That would surpass the $15.9 billion in
sales of a combined Pfizer-Warner-Lambert.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Post 29-Month High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices soared Monday to a 29-month high, supported
by Wall Street's overnight gains. The dollar fell against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 480.68 points, or
2.54 percent, at 19,437.23 points. The average closed up 123.26 points, or 0.65
percent, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the Nikkei's highest close since Aug. 8, 1997, when it ended the
trading day at 19,604.46 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar traded at 105.28 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market at 3
p.m. (1 a.m. EST) Monday, down 0.46 yen from late Friday, and also below its
late New York level of 105.70 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, broad-based buying from foreign investors, domestic
brokerages and individual investors rallied Japan's key cash index.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Tokyo market was basically mirroring the movement in New York," said
Yuichi Kohashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Brokerage houses posted some of Monday's biggest gains, with foreign
investors eager to buy shares in Nomura, Daiwa, and Nikko Securities, traders
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The buying frenzy, however, extended across the board.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is in a good cycle now," said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at
Tokyo Securities Co., noting that investor interest spread from high-technology
stocks to biotechnology and domestic-demand issues on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The advances came after the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 140.55
points to 11,722.98 on Friday. The technology-rich Nasdaq Composite index jumped
107.06 to 4,064.27.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo equity markets often move in tandem with Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section closed up 33.73 points, or 2.05 percent, to 1,681.97. The TOPIX closed
down 9.73 points, or 0.59 percent, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the greenback fell against the Japanese currency as
market expectation of the central bank easing monetary policy diminished. The
Bank of Japan's fortnightly policy meeting is still in session.
</P>
<P>
	   An increase in the amount of yen available in the market would decrease the
currency's strength against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese government officials have repeatedly said that too strong a yen
could hurt the fledgling economic recovery. A strong yen means that profits on
Japanese products sold overseas are worth less when they are changed into the
Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are eying the Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting in Tokyo
on Jan. 22 for further clues to the dollar's future.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.74 yen, down from 108.31 yen
late Friday in Tokyo.

	   LONDON (AP) -- British pharmaceutical heavyweights Glaxo Wellcome PLC and
SmithKline Beecham PLC reached agreement to merge into the world's largest
drugmaker, the companies announced Monday. The merger creates a company valued
at $182.4 billion. The company said the merger would create $1.6 billion in
pretax cost savings after three years. Job cuts were expected, the group said,
but it released no other details. The planned merger still must be approved by

Mars Lander Search To End

	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- After more than a month of searching for a signal
from NASA's Mars Polar Lander, mission controllers are losing any hope that the
$165 million mission to the Red Planet can be saved. The last effort to
communicate with the three-legged lander was scheduled today. After that, space
agency scientists and engineers will focus entirely on what could have gone
wrong and how to avoid the same mistakes in the next mission. Polar Lander was
to have touched down Dec. 3 for a 90-day mission near Mars' south pole to study
the atmosphere and dig for ice. It was last heard from minutes before beginning

Cuba Orchestrating Anti-US Protests

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cuba's government is orchestrating anti-American
demonstrations demanding the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez largely to
protect U.S. property and diplomats in Havana, a top Cuban official says.
Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly, said Sunday that
anger over Elian's continued presence in the United States is so real and
widespread among Cubans as to pose a potential danger to American interests. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled the boy must be returned to his

New Restrictions on Biotech Corn

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmentalists and farmers alike are praising the

to prevent insects from become resistant to its toxin. About 30 percent of the
corn grown last year was Bt corn, named for the bacteria it contains to kill the
European corn borer. The new restrictions, which the Environmental Protection
Agency worked out with industry, will require farmers to plant at least 20
percent conventional corn in most regions, and 50 percent in areas where cotton
is grown.

<HEADLINE> Museum To Show M.L. King Evidence  </HEADLINE>
   By WOODY BAIRD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The rifle that James Earl Ray used to shoot the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. is heading for public display at the museum that sits on
the site of the civil rights leader's murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The exhibit also will mention a recent civil court verdict the King family
says supports their belief that Ray was an unknowing fall guy in a murder
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   But the evidence against Ray -- much of which has been locked away in
storage for more than three decades -- is expected to dominate the museum's
newest exhibit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we will present is pieces of evidence that will help people evaluate
the various theories,'' said Clayborne Carson, a Stanford University history
professor working on the project.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigations by a congressional committee in 1978 and by state prosecutors
in Memphis two years ago concluded Ray was the killer, though he may have had
help from a small group of conspirators. His confession was upheld eight times
by state and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigations found no evidence of the widespread conspiracy involving
the government and organized crime that the King family believes in.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most reasonable story is (Ray) had to be involved in it,'' Carson
said. ``The question is... whether other people had foreknowledge of it. That's
where it gets a lot more complicated.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Civil Rights Museum, which opened in 1991 at the old Lorraine
Motel, is working on an expansion that will double its exhibit space to 25,000
square feet next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with the gun, on display for the first time, museum visitors will get
a view of the murder scene from the flop house from which Ray admitted firing
the death slug.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of people sort of think it was a pretty far distance, but from the
back of that building you can see it really didn't take an expert marksman to
hit the target,'' said Beverly Robertson, the museum's director.
</P>
<P>
	   King was shot while standing on the second-floor balcony of the motel on
April 4, 1968. He was in Memphis to help lead a garbage workers strike. Today is
the national holiday in his honor.
</P>
<P>
	   The museum traces America's struggle for racial equality up to the time of
King's death, focusing heavily on the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   New exhibits will continue the story of the civil rights movement to the
present, and for the first time, the museum will offer information on the
assassination itself.
</P>
<P>
	   A jury hearing a wrongful death suit filed by the Kings against a former
Memphis restaurant owner concluded in December that King was the victim of a
murder conspiracy involving government agents and other ``unknown
conspirators.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the verdict was what the King family had long wanted, critics
described the trial as a hodgepodge of vague conspiracy claims and unsupported
testimony that offered little new information on the killing.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray ``was definitely not vindicated,'' said Robertson.
</P>
<P>
	   Carson said the trial verdict will be ``mentioned'' but what part it will
play in the new exhibit has yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
	   The state plans to give the museum the physical evidence and investigative
reports that would have been used against Ray had he gone to trial. He died in
prison in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Those items are expected to go to the museum when the Justice Department
finishes a new, limited investigation into the murder this year. Information on
that investigation will be part of the museum exhibit, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Evidence gathered during the original police investigation includes the
rifle identified as the murder weapon, personal belongings of Ray's found at the
flop house, autopsy and lab reports and other such items.
</P>
<P>
	   Carson said the Kings' lawsuit failed to change his general view on Ray's
part in the murder largely because the burden of proof in a civil trial is much
less that required in a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're not asking the jury to come to a decision about what actually did
happen on April 4. They would still be in the jury room,'' he said. ``You're
just asking them are you convinced by the official story of what happened ...
and they said no.''

<TEXT>
<P>
    EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Steve Yzerman scored a goal and was denied another
on a last-second breakaway Sunday night as the Detroit Red Wings and Edmonton
Oilers skated to a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
	   Yzerman, whose 613th goal tied Mario Lemieux for seventh place on the NHL's
career list, was stopped by Tommy Salo on a short-handed breakaway as overtime
expired.
</P>
<P>
	   Mathieu Dandenault and Vyacheslav Kozlov also scored for Detroit, which
moved into a tie with St. Louis for first place in the Central Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethan Moreau had two goals and Jim Dowd had one for the Oilers, who played
to their 12th tie.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams are winless in three games (0-2-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Scotty Bowman coached his 500th game for the Red Wings and has compiled a
289-147-64 with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowd knocked in a rebound from beside the net on a power play at 9:48 of the
third period to tie the game 3-3.
</P>
<P>
	   Kozlov gave Detroit a 3-2 advantage, making a perfect deflection from the
slot on Nicklas Lidstrom's shot on a power play at 9:02 of the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Yzerman's power-play goal at 8:46 of the first put Detroit in front 1-0.
Yzerman, who has 42 goals and 74 points in 50 games against the Oilers, scored
on a rebound of Steve Duchesne's point shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Dandenault made it 2-0 less than three minutes later. His slap shot from the
point beat Salo at 11:30.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Grier's shot from the right boards deflected off Moreau and past Chris
Osgood at 15:33 of the first to make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreau tied it by knocking in a rebound of Christian Laflamme's point shot
at 8:02 of the second.

<HEADLINE> Rams 49, Vikings 37  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- There's this one problem with the St. Louis Rams offense:
Not enough footballs to go around.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Rams could stretch NFL rules, they'd gladly find a way to get
footballs in the hands of Marshall Faulk, Isaac Bruce, Tony Horne and Kurt
Warner at the same time. Then they'd be scoring in triple figures with
regularity.
</P>
<P>
	   As it is, they just might reach the 100-point mark before this charmed
season is over. They got almost halfway there in Sunday's 49-37 defeat of the
Minnesota Vikings in the first home playoff game in the city's 33-season
history.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we have done that all year," league MVP Warner said after throwing
for five touchdowns and 391 yards in a near-perfect performance. "We're not just
one-dimensional or two-dimensional. It's unreal how many weapons we have to beat
you."
</P>
<P>
	   They'll take those weapons into next Sunday's NFC championship game against
Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers will bring a sound defense to the noisy Trans World
Dome. But Warner isn't sure even the stingy Bucs can handle the NFL's top
offense.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think anybody can stop this offense," Warner said. "I haven't seen
a defense do it so far. People are going to have to prove it to me for me to
believe it."
</P>
<P>
	   The Vikings (11-7) certainly couldn't prove it. They got Gary Anderson's
31-yard field goal on their opening drive, which merely wetted the Rams'
appetite.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis (14-3) immediately sent Bruce on a deep post pattern. He broke
free at midfield, where Warner hit him perfectly, and Bruce headed to the end
zone for a 77-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   "To tell you the truth, I was thinking about it for a day," Warner said of
the decision to open up with a deep pass. "It was great to get us out of the
chute quickly."
</P>
<P>
	   They weren't nearly done. Faulk, the Offensive Player of the Year, took a
short pass and rambled 41 yards for another touchdown to make it 14-3.
</P>
<P>
	   "The linebackers were thinking, 'Get back, get back,' and we play-action and
throw a screen," he said. "It was set up great."
</P>
<P>
	   And Minnesota was set up for the rout. But something unusual happened: The
Rams began making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner was intercepted at the Minnesota 4 by Jimmy Hitchcock and the Vikings
marched 96 yards. Jeff George, who would finish 29-for-50 for 424 yards -- third
in playoff history, but highest in a non-overtime game -- and four touchdowns,
hit Jake Reed for 41 yards on third-and-14. All-Pro receiver Cris Carter scored
on a 22-yard pass over double-coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   When Faulk couldn't grasp a handoff from Warner at the Vikings 47, Robert
Griffith recovered. Randy Moss went 31 yards with a reception before Leroy Hoard
scored from the 4.
</P>
<P>
	   At halftime, the Vikings led 17-14 and the dome-record crowd of 66,194
wasn't quite in full throat.
</P>
<P>
	   Not to worry. The fans reached a deafening level a scant 18 seconds into the
second half. Horne raced 95 yards down the left sideline with the third-quarter
kickoff for the first such TD runback in Rams playoff history.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was good timing," said Horne, who had two regular-season TDs on kickoff
returns. "Every time we touch the field, we expect something good like that to
happen. Everybody is looking for it to go to the house."
</P>
<P>
	   It made the house sound far louder than it did during a pregame fireworks
display -- exactly what the Vikings didn't need.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thought the crowd was out of it at that time," George said, "and we felt
we had them right where we wanted them. But they stepped up."
</P>
<P>
	   They kept stepping up -- and all over the Minnesota defense. St. Louis,
which averaged 35 points at home in going 8-0 this season, scored that many in a
row before three late Vikings touchdowns padded George's stats.
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk scored on a 1-yard run and Warner threw TD passes to backup tight end
Jeff Robinson (13 yards), center Ryan Tucker on a tackle-eligible play (1) and
tight end Roland Williams (2). It took them just over 20 minutes to rack up the
five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
	   "How we played in the third quarter is about as well as you can play," said
Dick Vermeil, the NFL Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner, whose storybook season has taken him from the Arena League and NFL
Europe to become the only quarterback other than Dan Marino with 40 TD passes in
a season, finished 27-for-33. He set team playoff records for yards passing and
TD throws.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vikings' three touchdowns in the final five minutes led to an NFL
playoff record of 815 yards passing for George and Warner. They surpassed a 1981
San Diego-Miami mark set in an overtime game.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis was playing its first playoff game at home after being without an
NFL team for seven years until the Rams moved there from Los Angeles in 1995.
The Cardinals left St. Louis after the 1987 season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully we painted a glaring picture that we really don't have any
weaknesses," Vermeil said, noting there was even more available. "We couldn't
call everything in the game plan if we played three weeks in a row."
</P>
<P>
	   They only need two more weeks like this to be Super Bowl champions.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Get Another Shot at Titans  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   No more 62-7 wins for the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
	   They are, in fact, trying to paint themselves as the underdog when they play
host to the only team to beat them this season, the Tennessee Titans, in the AFC
title game next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no way around it. It happened," Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin
said of the two losses -- 20-19 to the Titans in Tennessee and 41-14 three weeks
ago in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   "We won't spend a lot of time on it. But we'll throw it out there again and
bring things back to exactly where they were. That will make us very humble."
</P>
<P>
	   In truth, humble is probably just what Jacksonville needs after it's 62-7
humbling (yes, that word again) of Miami. If that swelled their heads, meeting
the Titans again will unswell them.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFC game figures to be the better of next week's two title games, and
the early odds reflect that -- Jacksonville is favored by 7 over Tennessee, St.
Louis is a 13 1/2-point favorite over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   For as tough as the Bucs' defense is -- probably the best in the NFL --
going into St. Louis for the NFC title game with a rookie quarterback running a
prevent offense might be an impossible task. The Rams scored 526 points in the
regular season, third-best in NFL history, and were held to fewer than 27 points
just once this season -- in a 24-21 loss to Tennessee in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Rams are almost invulnerable at home -- the 49-37 shootout win over
Minnesota was the closest game they've had in their dome all season, and that's
deceptive because it was 49-17 with five minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time we touch the field, we expect something good like that to
happen," said Tony Horne, whose 95-yard kickoff return to open the second half
erased a 17-14 deficit and began a run of 35 straight points that put away the
game.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis will probably have more trouble moving against the Bucs than it's
had this season -- Tampa Bay's defense is that good. And Minnesota's leaky
defense was hardly an acid test.
</P>
<P>
	   But with rookie Shaun King at quarterback, the Tampa Bay offense plays to
avoid mistakes. And promising as King is, he's only started six NFL games and is
prone to turnovers if coach Tony Dungy decides to open things up.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee, on the other hand, matches up well with Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jags got a break Saturday because they were able to pull Mark Brunell in
the second quarter and let him rest his injured knee. Fred Taylor also went out
early.
</P>
<P>
	   But Tony Boselli, the game's best offensive lineman, is out for the season,
and Tennessee can move Jevon Kearse to his side if it wants to -- Ben Coleman,
who's replaced Boselli, is better at guard.
</P>
<P>
	   And while Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher is sure to spend the week talking
about how hard it is to beat a team three times in one season, the two wins
already have the Titans feeling good.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're confident that we know Jacksonville," safety Blaine Bishop said after
the Titans' 19-16 win in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you've got a chance to beat a team three times, you must be pretty
good."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans are pretty good and they've got a chance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs?
</P>
<P>
	   Well, this has been a strange season.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Quits as Dolphins' Coach  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVEN WINE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- TV cameras clustered at the exit from the Miami
Dolphins' parking lot, hoping to record reaction to Jimmy Johnson's departure as
coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Some players stopped and rolled down their windows to be interviewed. Dan
Marino left without answering questions, his destination unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   Following perhaps the most tumultuous weekend in team history, it's still
unclear whether Marino is headed for retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson called it quits Sunday and was replaced by Dave Wannstedt, but the
coaching change did little to clarify the quarterback situation. Wannstedt
stammered when asked if Marino, 39 next season, can still win in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ah, you know what, I ... yeah, I mean, Dan had a tough year because of some
injuries and so forth," Wannstedt said. "Dan and I will talk. What his plans are
for the future I don't know. We'll hold off on the Dan thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Wannstedt declined to say whether he wants Marino back.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very sensitive issue," Wannstedt said. "We're going to do the right
thing."
</P>
<P>
	   The Dolphins are hesitant partly because Marino's salary cap figure will be
about $7.5 million in 2000. But after Saturday's 62-7 playoff loss at
Jacksonville, the future Hall of Famer sounded like he wanted to play another
season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I still feel like I can win games in this league," Marino said. "I've
proven that and will continue to do that. So we'll see."
</P>
<P>
	   The coaching change slightly increases the likelihood that Marino will
return, because Johnson wasn't expected to want him back. The transition was
surprising only because it happened so fast -- less than 24 hours after the
worst defeat in franchise history ended Johnson's fourth season at Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson, 56, will remain with the team as a consultant on personnel matters,
but his involvement will be limited, owner Wayne Huizenga said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He does not want to be under contract. He does not want a job. He does not
want any day-to-day position," Huizenga said. "He wants to fish."
</P>
<P>
	   Wannstedt, 47, signed a three-year contract as the fourth coach in Dolphins
history. He went 40-56 in six seasons with the Chicago Bears before being fired
in 1998, then joined the Dolphins' staff as assistant head coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Wannstedt was also an assistant to Johnson with the Dallas Cowboys and Miami
Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are going to find out how great a coach he is," Johnson said. "He's
a better coach than I am."
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson was frustrated in Miami by his disagreements with Marino, his feuds
with the media and his failure to deliver a championship. Late-season collapses
were a perennial problem, and this season the Dolphins stumbled to a 3-7 finish
after a 7-1 start.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson told Huizenga of his plan to quit late in the regular season. Unlike
a year ago, when Johnson briefly considered retirement, Huizenga didn't try to
dissuade him.
</P>
<P>
	   "This time it's final and forever," Johnson said. "I've had my time in the
sun. I've had my time in the spotlight. And now it's time to spend time with my
family."
</P>
<P>
	   The Dolphins are the sixth team to make a coaching change since the end of
the season, joining, Dallas, Green Bay, New England, New Orleans and the New
York Jets.
</P>
<P>
	   At Johnson's recommendation, Wannstedt gets a second chance. Huizenga wanted
continuity and decided against pursuing a high-profile college coach such as
Steve Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
	   "We came to the conclusion we had the best guy right here," Huizenga said.
"He knows the players, he knows the coaches. He doesn't have to take a year or
two to get up to speed."
</P>
<P>
	   The choice of Wannstedt was popular with players.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a great decision," said quarterback Damon Huard, the likely starter
if Marino retires. "A lot of guys have a good relationship with him and will be
excited to play for him next year."
</P>
<P>
	   Wannstedt said there will be no change in philosophy. But he fired offensive
coordinator Kippy Brown, offensive line coach Rich McGeorge and quarterbacks
coach Larry Seiple.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll look at every area of the team," Wannstedt said, "and make a decision
on the areas where we can improve."
</P>
<P>
	   What that means at quarterback has yet to be disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Mora Staying on an Even Keel  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM LITKE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Win or lose, every morning in Jim Mora's house now
comes and goes much like every other one.
</P>
<P>
	   He isn't likely to get up on one side of the bed and suddenly mellowed,
chuck it all and go fishing. But he is no more likely to get up on the other
side, despondent, and go swimming with the fishes, either.
</P>
<P>
	   In the coaching business, this is called staying on an even keel. People who
remember the epic tirade Mora threw on his way out of New Orleans would call it
significant progress as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not going to go out and commit suicide or get drunk, if that's what
you're asking," Mora said Sunday, just moments after his Colts were beaten 19-16
in Sunday's AFC divisional playoff by Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll just get up in the morning," he reassured everyone, "and go back to
work."
</P>
<P>
	   Mora's colleague, Jimmy Johnson, will not be in the Dolphins' office when
Mora arrives, no matter the hour. And he won't be the only one. With each
passing day, fewer of the coaches the 64-year-old Mora once regarded as
contemporaries are around to take his calls.
</P>
<P>
	   Only Rams coach Dick Vermeil, 17 months younger than Mora and one of his
closest friends, still shows up at the office with anything like the same
enthusiasm. It may be because Vermeil still has a shot at the Super Bowl. Or it
may be because Vermeil already flamed out once -- he was out of football for 15
seasons before taking the St. Louis job three years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost every other coach in the NFL seems to be in danger of burning out.
Two weeks ago, Bill Parcells, 58, walked away from the New York Jets and Mike
Ditka, 60, was the oldest of a handful of coaches shown the door soon after.
</P>
<P>
	   Having so many coaches out of work is nothing new in the fraternity, but to
have so many big names leave voluntarily is.
</P>
<P>
	   The salary cap and free agency have made it increasingly tough to acquire
new players and at the same time, hold onto the ones you already have. As the
talent margins between clubs gets slimmer, the coaches and general managers,
most already working 24/7, are being asked to work harder and harder. More are
just saying, "No."
</P>
<P>
	   Like Mora, Johnson lost a playoff game, only his came Saturday at
Jacksonville by an embarrassing 62-7 score. It was so embarrassing that Johnson
awoke Sunday, checked the tide tables in the newspaper and decided to chuck it
all. He collected his wife, his Yorkie, headed for his boat and on his way out
the door, Johnson told Miami owner Wayne Huizenga he might be available to
consult on personnel matters occasionally. But as far as working, that was it.
</P>
<P>
	   "He does not want to be under contract. He does not want a job. He does not
want any day-to-day position," Huizenga said. "He wants to fish."
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson is 56, but it seems like he'd been in the business forever. Maybe
that's because Johnson was so driven and so good -- he won a national
championship at the University of Miami and two Super Bowls in Dallas -- that it
was hard to imagine him doing anything less consuming.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was exactly the problem; he had nothing left.
</P>
<P>
	   "This time it's final and forever," Johnson said. "I've had my time in the
sun. I've had my time in the spotlight. And now it's time to spend time with my
family."
</P>
<P>
	   Mora felt the same way in October, 1996, in the middle of his 11th season in
New Orleans. The Saints were 2-6, going nowhere. He spent his days watching
films, running practices, drawing up game plans, sleeping a few hours and
starting all over again.
</P>
<P>
	   Frustrated, he staged a very public, very profane and ultimately
unforgettable meltdown. The next day he resigned.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was," Mora recalled, "a basket case."
</P>
<P>
	   The surprising thing is how a year-and-a-half away from the NFL rejuvenated
him -- that, and returning with a team like Indianapolis, loaded with young
talent and one of the best general managers in the game, Bill Polian.
</P>
<P>
	   A team he expected to finish 8-8 went 13-3 instead. It failed to give him
his first playoff win ever -- Mora is 0-5 -- but he is still cresting on a wave
of optimism. Winning might not really be everything, but it will keep a coach
off the ledge for a while.
</P>
<P>
	   "It isn't that Jim's changed that much," said Vic Fangio, now the Colts
defensive coordinator and a Mora assistant since New Orleans. "What's changed is
that the time away from the game let him see how easy it is to get too wrapped
up in things. He's making an effort to enjoy himself more now. So far it's
worked."
</P>
<P>
	   So far.

<HEADLINE> Glaxo Wellcome, SmithKline Beecham agree on merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LONDON (AP) - British pharmaceutical heavyweights Glaxo Wellcome PLC and
SmithKline Beecham PLC reached agreement to merge into the world's largest
drugmaker, the companies announced Monday.
<P>
	   The merger would create a company valued at $182.4 billion and with a 7.3
percent share of the global pharmaceutical market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company expects $1.6 billion in pretax cost savings after three years.
The group said job cuts were expected, beleased no other details.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is inevitable that redundancies will arise as a result of bringing the
two companies together," the companies said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The planned merger still must be approved by the Federal Trade Commission
and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the planned deal, Glaxo shareholders would hold a 58.8 percent stake
in the new group, while SmithKline would hold a 41.3 stake.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company would have its corporate headquarters in London. Its new
operational base would be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The planned merger demonstrates the pressure facing even the biggest names
in the pharmaceutical industry to consolidate with rivals as a way to afford the
rising costs of developing and selling new medicines. It is also likely to
trigger a new round of takeovers and mergers throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Only last week, Pfizer Inc. emerged as the likely winner in the battle for
U.S. drugmaker Warner-Lambert Co. Bowing to pressure from its investors,
Warner-Lambert management said they would negotiate a buyout from Pfizer,
backing away from a previously announced merger deal with American Home Products
Corp. If that deal goes forward, the combined group would have 6.5 percent of
the global market.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Glaxo and SmithKline were only formally announced on Friday.
Previous discussions between the two groups collapsed two years ago over
differences between their top executives.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's strength lies in its top anti-migraine drug, Imitrex, and in
treatments for asthma and viral infections including HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline's top products include the antibiotic Augmentin, the
anti-depressantaxil and a new diabetes drug, Avandia. It also has a strong
vaccines business.
</P>
<P>
	   After news emerged that the companies were in merger talks, analysts said a
consolidation would make sense. The two companies have complementary drug
portfolios, and a merger would let them pool their research and development
funds and would give the merged company a bigger sales and marketing force.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, after announcing that talks had resumed, both companies saw their
U.S. shares surge on the New York Stock Exchange. Glaxo rose $2.25 to $60.25,
while SmithKline rose $3 to $69.75.
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwide pharmaceutical sales of the combined company would total $17.8
billion, based on 1998 annual figures. That would surpass the $15.9 billion in
sales of a combined Pfizer-Warner-Lambert.

<HEADLINE> Titans 19, Colts 16  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eddie George did what he was supposed to do. Jevon
Kearse didn't, but his presence allowed his defensive mates to make plays.
</P>
<P>
	   And Tennessee goes to Jacksonville knowing that a third victory over the
Jaguars, whose only two losses were to the Titans, puts them in the first Super
Bowl in the itinerant franchise's 40-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans (15-3) upset the Colts 19-16 Sunday, going ahead for good on
George's 68-yard touchdown run on the third play of the second half and shutting
down Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James and Marvin Harrison, one of the NFL's most
explosive offensive trios.
</P>
<P>
	   George finished with 162 yards on 26 carries after being told by coach Jeff
Fisher that these kinds of games were the reason the Titans -- then the Oilers
-- maneuvered up and down in the first round of the 1996 draft to get him.
</P>
<P>
	   "He asked me to relive draft day back in 1996," George said. "He told me to
remember that he drafted me because he felt I could lead this team to where we
are now. He challenged me to live up to expectations."
</P>
<P>
	   He did.
</P>
<P>
	   So did Kearse, the Defensive Rookie of the Year. He had just a half-tackle
and deflected a couple of late passes but the attention the Colts paid him
allowed teammates like Kenny Holmes to roam free.
</P>
<P>
	   Some results:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Manning, a 62 percent passer in the regular season, was just 19-of-43 for
227 yards. He wasn't sacked, but he was under pressure for much of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   -- James, the Offensive Rookie of the Year, gained just 56 yards in 20
rushing attempts and caught just one pass for 8 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Harrison, who led the AFC with 115 receptions for 1,663 yards, caught
five passes for just 65 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got outplayed today by a better team," Colts coach Jim Mora said. "We
have a very, very young offense that is not near what it is going to be at some
point. We played against an excellent defense
</P>
<P>
	   One reason the Colts were outplayed is that the Titans played at their own
pace, not like the run-and-gun Colts.
</P>
<P>
	   Indianapolis, which finished 13-4, led at the half but it was just 9-6 --
three field goals by Mike Vanderjagt to two by Al Del Greco.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, on the third play of the second half, George split a blitz by the
Colts, broke into the clear 10 yards beyond the line of scrimmage and took it
all the way. He slowed down only to look at the video screen in the end zone to
see how close his pursuers with -- a pause that allowed on to reach him just as
he reached the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   That made it 13-9 Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   They needed the "Music City Miracle" to beat Buffalo last week -- Kevin
Dyson's 75-yard kickoff return on a lateral from Frank Wycheck in the final
seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   But they needed none Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The closest the Colts came to getting back in the game came five minutes
into the fourth quarter trailing 16-9. Terrence Wilkins took a punt and appeared
to take it down the right sideline 87 yards to the Titans 3.
</P>
<P>
	   Replays in the press box showed Wilkins stepped on the sideline and the view
was relayed quickly to Fisher. With the crowd roaring, the Tennessee coach tried
frantically to push the buzzer to call for a replay but the noise prevented
referee Johnny Grier from hearing it.
</P>
<P>
	   So the Titans called a time out, Fisher challenged the play and Grier
reversed it, moving the ball all the way back to the Indianapolis 33, where
Wilkins had stepped out.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was the right call. If you're out of bounds, you're out of bounds," Mora
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feared the worst," Manning said. "You figure if they're challenging
something like that that, he must have been out of bounds."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans made it 19-9, but after Manning's 15-yard TD run with 1:51 left
cut the deficit to three, their onside kick was recovered by Tennessee's Yancey
Thigpen.
</P>
<P>
	   Game over, and on to Jacksonville to play a team the Titans beat 20-19 and
41-14 in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're confident that we know Jacksonville," Tennessee safety Blaine Bishop
said. "If you've got a chance to beat a team three times, you must be pretty
good."
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts won't argue.

<HEADLINE> Drug Giants Agree on Merger  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- British pharmaceutical heavyweights Glaxo Wellcome PLC and
SmithKline Beecham PLC reached agreement to merge into the world's largest
drugmaker, the companies announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger would create a company valued at $182.4 billion and with a 7.3
percent share of the global pharmaceutical market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company expects $1.6 billion in pretax cost savings after three years.
The group said job cuts were expected, but it released no other details.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is inevitable that redundancies will arise as a result of bringing the
two companies together," the companies said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The planned merger still must be approved by the Federal Trade Commission
and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the planned deal, Glaxo shareholders would hold a 58.8 percent stake
in the new group, while SmithKline would hold a 41.3 stake.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company would have its corporate headquarters in London. Its new
operational base would be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The planned merger demonstrates the pressure facing even the biggest names
in the pharmaceutical industry to consolidate with rivals as a way to afford the
rising costs of developing and selling new medicines. It is also likely to
trigger a new round of takeovers and mergers throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Only last week, Pfizer Inc. emerged as the likely winner in the battle for
U.S. drugmaker Warner-Lambert Co. Bowing to pressure from its investors,
Warner-Lambert management said they would negotiate a buyout from Pfizer,
backing away from a previously announced merger deal with American Home Products
Corp. If that deal goes forward, the combined group would have 6.5 percent of
the global market.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Glaxo and SmithKline were only formally announced on Friday.
Previous discussions between the two groups collapsed two years ago over
differences between their top executives.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's strength lies in its top anti-migraine drug, Imitrex, and in
treatments for asthma and viral infections including HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline's top products include the antibiotic Augmentin, the
anti-depressant Paxil and a new diabetes drug, Avandia. It also has a strong
vaccines business.
</P>
<P>
	   After news emerged that the companies were in merger talks, analysts said a
consolidation would make sense. The two companies have complementary drug
portfolios, and a merger would let them pool their research and development
funds and would give the merged company a bigger sales and marketing force.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, after announcing that talks had resumed, both companies saw their
U.S. shares surge on the New York Stock Exchange. Glaxo rose $2.25 to $60.25,
while SmithKline rose $3 to $69.75.
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwide pharmaceutical sales of the combined company would total $17.8
billion, based on 1998 annual figures. That would surpass the $15.9 billion in
sales of a combined Pfizer-Warner-Lambert.

<HEADLINE> TV's Lone Ranger Honored by Fans  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBERT JABLON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They wore black hats but they were there to honor a good
guy.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of fans, some in full cowboy dress, showed up Sunday for a public
tribute to the late actor Clayton Moore, who portrayed the Lone Ranger on
television in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   The trademark black mask, white hat and silver bullets Moore used in the TV
role were displayed outside the Autry Museum of Western Heritage.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore's daughter, Dawn Moore, said she had not intended to hold a public
memorial but changed her mind after she was deluged by letters and e-mails from
fans.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt very overwhelmed by the show of love for him, and I thought it
wasn't fair of me to be selfish and have him to myself, and (not) allow that
final goodbye to be said by everyone," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   During its heyday, the Lone Ranger series was seen by millions and is still
in syndication. Children around the nation could identify the character's
"faithful Indian companion, Tonto" -- played by late actor Jay Silverheels --
and the driving theme music of the "William Tell Overture."
</P>
<P>
	   Actor Bruce Boxleitner, who played a space commander on the "Bablyon 5" TV
series, said he and other Americans of the era learned right and wrong from the
Lone Ranger and other cowboy shows.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was those heroes that gave us that moral strength that we knew our cause
was right," he said. "We were the cowboys. We were the Lone Ranger."
</P>
<P>
	   Moore played the role on television and in several films beginning in 1949.
Friends and family said he preached and lived the Lone Ranger's creed of fair
play, self-reliance and self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
	   Black Stetsons, shiny boots, even a few spurs and dusters were in evidence
at the tribute for Moore, who died Dec. 28 at age 85.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Mendez, 48, of Ontario, had a six-shooter on his hip. He belongs to
a group that reenacts Western gunfights and said the Lone Ranger's values are as
important now as ever.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today, I think we need people that are honest like him, that are for the
little guy, that represent the type of goodness that we need out there."

<HEADLINE> Renault To Inspect Samsung Motors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A four-member survey team from French carmaker
Renault SA arrived in Seoul on Monday to look over South Korea's troubled
Samsung Motors Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspection is part of Renault's move to take over Samsung. They have
been in takeover talks since December.
</P>
<P>
	   The Renault team will survey and inspect Samsung's overall operations,
including its technology and financial condition, Samsung officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Renault officials said that the takeover would give them privileged access
to the Korean market and a larger base in Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   Samsung Motors, a subsidiary of the giant Samsung Group, entered the
nation's already saturated auto market in early 1998 with an annual capacity of
240,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
	   It produced only 50,000 cars in 1998 and a mere 2,000 more in 1999 since
operations were halted during most of the year amid severe financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
	   With $4 billion in debt and $3 billion in assets, Samsung was put in
receivership in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The troubled carmaker has been cited as a typical case of over-investment by
South Korean conglomerates which relied heavily on bank loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Another South Korean carmaker, Daewoo Motors Co., is also on the market.
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. of the United States have expressed
interest in taking over the No. 2 South Korean car firm.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- How's David Letterman doing? Well enough to keep up with
the football news, and to joke about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman, host of "Late Show with David Letterman" on CBS, was in a private
room at New York-Presbyterian Hospital recovering from heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   "I spoke to Dave on the phone," show producer Rob Burnett said Sunday. "I
asked, 'Dave, how do you feel?' and he said, 'Better than Jimmy Johnson."'
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson was coach of the Miami Dolphins. He quit Sunday, a day after his
team was hammered by the Jacksonville Jaguars 62-7 in a National Football League
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman, 52, had emergency quintuple bypass surgery Friday after tests
showed that one of his arteries was clogged.
</P>
<P>
	   His doctors said that they are pleased with his progress and that he might
be able to go home Friday.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Exchange Holdings Hit High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's foreign exchange holdings hit a new
record high of $75.6 billion as of Jan. 15 and will continue to rise to $100
billion by year's end, the government said Monday in a report.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 15 figure was up from $74.5 billion at the end of last year and
compared with a mere $7.2 billion recorded when South Korea sought a bailout of
its economy from the International Monetary Fund in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Government officials said foreign-currency reserves rose during the last two
weeks because local financial institutions paid off loans from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea's economy, which shrank 5.8 percent in 1998, dramatically turned
around last year, expanding more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report outlining its economic policy priorities for 2000, the
government reaffirmed its forecast that South Korea's economy will expand around
6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The country's customs-cleared exports are expected to rise 11 percent this
year to $160 billion, while imports are expected to grow 23.6 percent to $148
billion, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary figures released earlier this month, South Korean
exports climbed 9 percent in 1999 to $144 billion, while imports surged 28.3
percent to $119 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Considering the movement in short-term funds and the country's foreign
liabilities, the government will continue to increase its foreign reserves this
year, said officials at the Ministry of Finance and Economy.

<HEADLINE> Markets Closed for King Holiday  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. government offices, banks and financial markets in the
United States are closed today, in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose sharply Friday, boosted by a strong earnings report from
high-tech bellwether Intel and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan that indicate interest rates will be rising only slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones rose 140.55 to a new closing record of 11,722.98, easily
topping Thursday's record. The new closing high was the Dow's third this week
and its fourth since the start of 2000. For the week, the Dow rose 200.42.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market measures also finished with solid gains. The Nasdaq composite
index rose 107.06 to 4,064.27, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 15.47 to
1,465.15.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq, which dipped as much as 10 percent below its peak last week, has
rebounded smartly in the past two sessions and is now just 1.6 percent below the
record high reached Jan. 3. The S&AMP;P 500, meanwhile, is just four points below
its closing record, reached Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks led the Dow and the Nasdaq Friday, with industry leaders
Intel and Microsoft accounting for a major portion of those indexes' gains.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to have money coming into the market, and money managers are
deciding that technology offers the opportunity for the biggest gains," said
Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel, the world's leading computer chip maker, rose 12 to 103 1/16 after
announcing better than expected earnings late Thursday. The company cited a
surge in sales of personal computers during the back-to-school and holiday
shopping period.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's strong report and optimistic outlook lifted rival chip maker
Applied Materials, which gained 11 1/8 to 135 5/8. Computer makers like IBM, up
1 3/8 to 119 5/8, advanced as investors anticipated strong profit reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft rose 4 7/16 to 112 1/4 a day after Bill Gates' decision to
relinquish his chief executive job to company president Steve Ballmer. Analysts
said the move will assure continuity in the company's leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks also benefited from growing confidence that inflation is not rising
sharply. A speech by Greenspan Thursday night convinced many investors the Fed
is likely to raise rates no more than a quarter-percentage point at the next
Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Feb. 1-2.

were impressed that Greenspan indicated he won't let inflation get in the way of
a surging U.S. economy.

	   "Greenspan has demonstrated that he understands the world has changed and
that he doesn't intend to do anything scary to the market," said Charles

<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The British pharmaceutical company Glaxo Wellcome
PLC plans to buy rival SmithKline Beecham PLC for about $76 billion
in stock in a deal that would create the world's largest drugmaker.
The deal announced today would create a company to be called Glaxo
SmithKline that would hold a 7.3 percent share of the global
pharmaceutical market and have a combined market value in excess of
$182 billion. The companies said the merger would create $1.6

<P>
    SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The Unification Church of Rev. Sun Myung Moon
plans to invest $300 million in a joint venture to build Fiat cars in North
Korea, church officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The church's Pyonghwa Motors and North Korea's state-run Ryonbong Corp.
tentatively agreed last year to build car assembly lines in Nampo on North
Korea's southwestern coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a contract with Italian automaker Fiat SpA, 10,000 cars will be
assembled each year, for both domestic and overseas markets, church officials
said. Production is expected to start next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Pyonghwa Motors was founded last April for the project. It will hold a 70
percent stake in the joint venture for cash investment while Ryonbong will own
the other 30 percent for offering land.

<P>
	   The Unification Church has so far invested $10 million in North Korea. It
runs a hotel, a restaurant and a construction material trading company in
Pyongyang.

<HEADLINE> ENI Buys Stake in Portuguese Firm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Italian energy giant ENI is paying $973 million for
a 33.34 percent stake in Portuguese energy conglomerate GALP SGPS, establishing
a partnership to pursue joint investments in Europe, Africa and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spanish utility Iberdrola is also buying a 4 percent stake in GALP SPGS
for $116.8 million, and the Portuguese utility company Electricidade de Portugal
bought another 11 percent of the company to lift its shareholding to 14.27
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiated sale of stakes by the Portuguese state and private investors
disclosed Monday was part of a major restructuring of GALP SPGS aimed at giving
it the financial muscle and expertise to expand in oil, gas and electricity
sectors abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Finance and Economy Minister Joaquim Pina Moura said the deal was part of "a
strategy of competitive consolidation" which aimed to profit from the
liberalization of the energy sector in Europe and the opening of new markets.
</P>
<P>
	   ENI, Iberdrola, and GALP SPGS all have interests in Latin America,
particularly in Brazil where Portuguese is spoken.
</P>
<P>
	   "Expansion of our operations in Brazil with EdP and ENI will be a key part
of our strategy," said GALP SPGS President Henrique Vieira.
</P>
<P>
	   GALP SGPS, whose core business is oil refining, was formed last year as the
energy holding of the Portuguese state. It brought together Petrogal, an oil
company, and Gas de Portugal, a natural gas provider. The plan was to
consolidate the energy sector and then sell stakes to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
	   The Portuguese state is to sell 15 percent of its stake in GALP SPGS, with
11 percent going to ENI and 4 percent to Iberdrola. The state will retain 35
percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time the private shareholders of Petrogal, who are grouped
together in a holding called Petrocontrol, will sell their 33 percent stake in
GALP SPGS, with 22 percent of that stake going to ENI and 11 percent going to
EdP.
</P>
<P>
	   State-owned bank Caixa Geral de Depositos will maintain its 13 percent
stake.
</P>
<P>
	   The government intends to sell at least some of its GALP SPGS shares on the
market next year.

<HEADLINE> Tourist injured in Downing Street crash back in NJ, thankful to be  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A New Jersey woman who pushed her young son away
from an oncoming car at the British prime minister's London residence will
undergo surgery this afternoon to repair her shattered leg.
<P>
	   Ursula Webster, 39, was in London with her husband and three sons on a
sightseeing trip and was visiting 10 Downing Street because they live at the
same address in Livingston.
</P>
<P>
	   She was hailed by British newspapers as the "Heroine of Downing Street"
after she flung her 8-year-old son Andrew away from the car, which struck her
and tossed her 15 feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
	   "I pushed him as hard as I could, and I was hit by the car and thrown
through the air," she said today in a telephone interview from her hospital bed
at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. "As I was going up, I'm thinking,
'I'm dying, this is it, my life is ending,' and I could actually feel my bones
breaking.
</P>
<P>
	   "But when I hit the ground and was still conscious, I knew it wasn't nearly
that bad," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew was grazed by the door of the red Vauxhall Astra and her 6
1/2-year-old son Alex was grazed by the car's wing mirror, but neither was
seriously hurt. Her 3 1/2-year-old son Peter and her husband David were not
struck.
</P>
<P>
	   The car then smashed into the gates that guard the entrance to Prime
Minister Tony Blair's residence.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Webster left a London hospital Sunday and flew home with her family,
accompanied by a nurse. She arrived late Sunday afternoon at Newark
International Airport, where her mother and other relatives were waiting.
</P>
<P>
	   She sustained a broken femur and tibia, and was to undergo surgery Monday
afternoon at St. Barnabas. She faces three to four months of rehabilitation
after the surgery, she said, and she predicted it would be difficult with three
active children.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I keep thinking this could have been so much worse," she said. "We
could have been killed."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Webster said she and her family approached police officers at the gate
to the prime minister's residence, explained that they lived at the same address
in New Jersey and asked for and received permission to go inside the gates to
take photographs. It was as they were walking back out through the gates and
thanking the police officers that the accident happened, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The car skidded and went straight at the gates," said Sertac Bahri, 19, who
witnessed the accident. "As that was happening a woman tried to push her child
so he didn't get hurt. She saved the kid, but she didn't save herself."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Webster was treated overnight at St. Thomas's Hospital in London. She
said the flight back to New Jersey was "excruciating."
</P>
<P>
	   London police filed charges Sunday against the driver of the car. Stephen
Bonnett, 26, an engineer from Chelmsford, east of London, was charged with
causing grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonnett was granted bail at a five-minute hearing Monday and ordered to
return to court Jan. 31 to face the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Webster had high praise for British police.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were really great to us," she said. "I have to compliment the London
police."
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said tourists were clustered at the gates that lead to Downing
Street when Bonnett's car skidded and crashed. It was not immediately clear
whether he is suspected of deliberately crashing into the ornate black iron
gates or whether he simply lost control of the car.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair and his family were at the British prime minister's country residence,
Chequers, when the crash happened. Blair has asked to be kept informed of Mrs.
Webster's condition and would be writing to her, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister's official residence is visible through the gates that
seal the end of Downing Street - a short street leading on to Whitehall, the
seat of government.

<HEADLINE> Civil rights leaders blast Wallingford for not celebrating MLK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Gov. John G. Rowland today added his voice to
those of civil rights leaders in condemning the town of Wallingford's decision
not to give municipal workers the day off to honor the Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday.
<P>
	   Wallingford is the only one of Connecticut's 169 cities and towns that does
not recognize the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a release this morning, Rowland said supported legislation being promoted
by state Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, that would mandate the observance
of the holiday by municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
	   "The ongoing controversy in Wallingford over the Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday, and the unfortunate message it sends, does not accurately reflect the
feelings of the residents of Wallingford, or the people of this state," Rowland
said. It is my hope the Mushinsky legislation will end this unfortunate
controversy and make clear Connecticut's appreciation of the courageous work of
Dr. King."
</P>
<P>
	   National civil rights leaders say Wallingford is showing disrespect by not
closing government offices today to honor Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe the nation needs to know that in a state that is usually given a
liberal image, there's this pocket that hasn't joined the 21st century," the
Rev. Al Sharpton said after addressing a Hartford church congregation Sunday.
"This one particular community and some others around the North are making an
absolute decision to say that they do not adhere to the principles that Dr. King
stood for."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton echoed some of the comments made Saturday by the Rev. Joseph
Lowery. Speaking at a state workers' union and state NAACP news conference,
Lowery urged town business and religious leaders to press government to close on
the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they are spitting in the face of all the sacrifices of all the
people in this country who tried to bring about racial brotherhood and an end to
discrimination," Lowery said. "This seems to be more akin to Mississippi than to
the great state of Connecticut."
</P>
<P>
	   Town officials said Lowery's words will do little to help Wallingford
resolve the controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallingford is the only town in the state that keeps its government offices
open on the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the government is racist," Town Councilor Tom Zappala said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lowery, 78, founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King
and the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy in 1957. He also played a major role in
ending segregation in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   He ended his 20-year tenure as president of the SCLC last week and was
succeeded by Martin Luther King III.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expected the climate to be cold, but I did not expect the spirit of the
people to be cold," Lowery said at the annual United Auto Workers dinner
honoring King.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallingford Mayor William W. Dickinson Jr. wants the town's unionized
workers to swap the King holiday for another holiday, saying it would allow
workers to honor King without costing taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he admires King, but his position requires him to get the best deal
for taxpayers and to avoid giving away benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The $32,000 it would cost the town to close for the day is a small sacrifice
to honor King, said Roger Vann, president of the Connecticut chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP has tried to give town and union negotiators time to work out
their differences over the holiday. But Vann said the issue may be an indication
of a "larger problem in Wallingford."
</P>
<P>
	   The organization will address the town's poor minority hiring record and
other issues if progress is not made, Vann said.

<HEADLINE> Upturn in Thai Banks Expected  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM WRIGHT
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Many of the larger Thai banks are set to become
profitable early this year, after a dismal 1999 that ended the worst downturn in
recent history, analysts said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Results due on Thursday and Friday will show all banks were deeply in the
red last year as the result of the huge cost of dealing with problem loans,
which totaled 36 percent of total lending at private banks at the end of
November.
</P>
<P>
	   But with loan-loss reserve building almost complete, and as debt
restructuring begins to reduce problem loans racked up since Asia's economic
crisis struck in 1997, large banks should post profits in 2000, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Siam Commercial Bank already began to make net profits in the third quarter
of last year, after it completed provisioning with the help of a government
capital injection.
</P>
<P>
	   It should show a $35 million net profit in the fourth quarter, Kavee
Chukitkasem, an analyst at Capital Nomura Securities, told Dow Jones Newswires.
</P>
<P>
	   Other large banks, such as Bangkok Bank and Thai Farmers Bank, would remain
in the red during the fourth quarter as they continued to divert capital to
loan-loss reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   All banks made huge losses for the full year, including Siam Commercial with
a 1999 net loss estimated at $1.25 billion, said Kavee.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai Farmers, the country's third largest bank, will suffer a full-year net
loss of $864 million said Andrew Maule, bank analyst at ABN Amro Asia
Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   But Thai Farmers is expected return to net profit in the first quarter of
this year. Excluding the cost of provisioning, the bank has made operating
profits since the third quarter due to lower deposit rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank has restructured $400 million in problem loans during the fourth
quarter, which immediately began to earn interest. Maule said this should lead
to a "major improvement" in operating profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the country's largest lender, Bangkok Bank, still needs to raise
more capital to complete provisioning in 2000, which should keep the bank's net
results in the red for at least the first quarter, most analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bangkok Bank will have a 1999 net loss of $1.25 billion due to provisioning
costs, although the bank should make operating profits in the fourth quarter,
said ABN Amro's Maule.

<HEADLINE> Parker Hannifin-Gets Hydraulic Firm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CLEVELAND (AP) -- Parker Hannifin Corp., which makes industrial motion and
control devices, is buying Commercial Intertech Corp., a hydraulic systems
maker, for about $366 million in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
	   In the deal announced today, Parker will also assume about $107 million of
Commercial Intertech's debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker's strategy is to serve customers in its industrial, mobile,
commercial and aerospace markets and this deal helps the company extend that,
said Duane Collins, chairman and chief executive officer of Parker Hannifin.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins noted that Parker has acquired 42 businesses in the last six years,
totaling $1.1 billion in first-year sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker Hannifan said it will cut some jobs but did not know how many or in
which facilities. "No decision has been made yet but there won't be a
significant employment reduction," said Jennifer Eaton, spokeswoman for Parker
Hannifan.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the terms of the agreement, Parker will pay $20 in cash or stock for
each Commercial Intertech share. The deal is expected to be completed by the end
of June.
</P>
<P>
	   That is a 20.3 percent premium over Commercial Intertech's stock price of
$16.62 in trading Friday when it rose 9 percent. Markets were closed Monday for
the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal is still subject to approval from federal regulators and Commercial
Intertech shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland-based Parker Hannifin had almost $5 million in annual sales last
year and employs nearly 40,000 people in 39 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Commercial Intertech, which posted sales of $535 million in 1999, has almost
4,000 employees at its 27 facilities worldwide. It is based in Youngstown. The
company makes hydraulic systems, including gear pumps and motors, control valves
and telescopic cylinders for use on equipment such as dump trucks, cranes,
refuse vehicles and backhoes. The company also produces metal stampings,
including tank ends and a variety of other stamped steel products.

<HEADLINE> Glaxo Buying SmithKline Beecham  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The British pharmaceutical company Glaxo Wellcome PLC plans
to buy rival SmithKline Beecham PLC for about $76 billion in stock in a
long-anticipated deal that would create the world's largest drugmaker.
</P>
<P>
	   The combination announced today would form a company to be called Glaxo
SmithKline that would hold a 7.3 percent share of the global pharmaceutical
market and have a combined market value of about $182.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies said the union would create $1.6 billion in pretax cost
savings after three years. They said job cuts were expected but that they were
still deciding where to make them.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came after previous merger discussions between the two
firms collapsed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has not been easy ..., that is true. On the other hand, today we can
honestly say we have a real powerhouse of a new company," SmithKline Beecham
chief executive Jan Leschly told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Trade Commission and the European Union still must approve the
combination.
</P>
<P>
	   Although executives from both companies stressed that this was "a merger of
equals," their respective shares of ownership of the new group suggest that
Glaxo Wellcome has the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the deal, Glaxo shareholders would hold a 58.75 percent stake in the
new entity, with SmithKline shareholders holding a 41.25 stake.
</P>
<P>
	   Each Glaxo share would be exchanged for one share in the new company, while
each SmithKline share would be worth 0.4552 shares in the combined group.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company would have its corporate headquarters in London, and its new
operational base in the United States, probably in or near New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal demonstrates the pressure facing even the biggest names in the
pharmaceutical industry to consolidate with rivals as a way to afford the rising
costs of developing and selling new medicines. It is also likely to trigger a
new round of takeovers and mergers throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "To succeed in this industry, you must be top-tier, and preferably, you must
have market leadership," Glaxo Wellcome chairman Sir Richard Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Only last week, Pfizer Inc. emerged as the likely winner in the battle for
U.S. drugmaker Warner-Lambert Co. Bowing to pressure from its investors,
Warner-Lambert management said it would negotiate a buyout by Pfizer, backing
away from a previously announced merger deal with American Home Products Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   If the deal with Pfizer goes forward, the combined U.S. group would have an
estimated 6.7 percent of the global pharmaceutical market.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham have long pondered a merger, but the
apparent success of Pfizer's hostile bid for Warner-Lambert gave new impetus to
the merger, said Kevin Wilson, an industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said creating operational synergies and a bigger sales force are the
main reasons that the two sides decided to strike a deal now.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will clearly be a challenge to achieve the integration, but the
potential of the organization three to five years out is intriguing."
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Glaxo and SmithKline were only announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts have said the British firms were able to start a new round of
merger talks following the announcement in December that Leschly planned to
resign by April. Leschly's reported inability to agree with Sykes was seen as
one of the reasons earlier negotiations were suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   "It had nothing to do with my retirement," Leschly insisted.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the merger, to become effective this summer, Sykes would serve the new
company as non-executive chairman, and Leschly's deputy at Glaxo, Jean-Pierre
Garnier, would become its chief executive.
</P>
<P>
	   The board of Glaxo SmithKline would consist of 14 directors drawn equally
from the boards of Glaxo and SmithKline.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's strength lies in its top anti-migraine drug, Imitrex, and in
treatments for asthma and viral infections, including HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline's top products include the antibiotic Augmentin, the
anti-depressant Paxil and a new diabetes drug, Avandia. It also has a strong
vaccines business.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in both companies were trading lower in afternoon trading. Glaxo
Wellcome shares were down 4 percent from Friday's close. SmithKline Beecham
shares were 8 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwide pharmaceutical sales of the combined company would total an
estimated $15 billion, based on 1998 annual figures.

<HEADLINE> 'Fair Trade' Bananas Reach Britain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Bananas stamped "people-friendly" hit British supermarket
shelves Monday as part of an initiative to support independent producers and
their workers, instead of multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fairtrade Foundation stamp on the fruit, imported from independent Costa
Rican farmers, is designed to tell shoppers that the workers who produced the
bananas receive a fair wage and work in satisfactory conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The initiative follows a trade dispute between Europe and the United States
over bananas.
</P>
<P>
	   Europe gives preferential trade quotas and tariffs to its former colonies in
the Caribbean and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU's current system of tariffs and quotas has been ruled illegal four
times by the World Trade Organization, and the United States has imposed almost
$200 million a year in sanctions against EU goods to protest the policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the quotas and higher tariffs, South American bananas grown on
U.S.-owned plantations still represent the majority of the EU market, since the
plantation-produced fruit is so much cheaper than bananas produced on small
family-owned farms in the Caribbean, African and Pacific nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Last November, the EU proposed to work toward a system in which Latin
American producers would gradually be allowed to export more bananas to the
15-nation market.
</P>
<P>
	   Clare Short, Britain's secretary of state for international development,
deemed the new bananas, Britain's most popular fruit, "excellent."
</P>
<P>
	   "When British shoppers choose Fairtrade Mark bananas, they will have better
bananas and help improve the lives of many poor producers," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The London-based foundation, which already has set up similar operations for
tea, coffee, cocoa and honey, said it hopes to expand the program to include
other independent banana producers.

<HEADLINE> Army Closes Probe of Apache Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Army investigators have failed to determine what caused
the fatal crash last spring of an Apache helicopter that was training for a
combat mission in the war over Kosovo, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The Apache investigation has been closed and the cause will be listed as
unknown, ``due to the degree of damage sustained during the crash sequence,''
Army spokesman Col. Edwin Veiga said. In what he described as a highly unusual
outcome, Veiga said investigators could find no definitive answer to what caused
the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   On May 5, the Apache was leading a formation of five helicopters over
mountainous terrain in northern Albania when its nose pitched up and the chopper
rolled to the right. It fell 150 feet to the ground and exploded in flames,
according to the Dayton Daily News, which obtained an Army report on the
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Warrant Officer David Gibbs, 38, of Massillon, Ohio, and Chief Warrant
Officer Kevin Reichert, 28, of Chetek, Wis., were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Early indications pointed to a mechanical failure, but Veiga said
investigators were ultimately unable to determine a cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Apaches are the Army's best attack helicopters and were used extensively in
the 1991 Gulf War. Flown with a crew of two, they are armed with as many as 16
Hellfire missiles designed to knock out tanks and other armor. In addition, they
carry 70mm rockets and a 30mm cannon that can fire 625 rounds per minute.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of the Army's fleet of 743 Apaches has been grounded since
November to replace their tail rotor bearings or to replace transmission parts.
The decision to ground the choppers was made when the Army determined that the
tail rotor bearing was the cause of an Apache crash in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Veiga said all Apaches deployed abroad already have been repaired and
returned to service; the full fleet is scheduled to be back in operation by
April.

<HEADLINE> Thai Petrochemical Restructuring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's largest corporate debtor, Thai
Petrochemical Industries PCL, agreed with creditors Monday to enter bankruptcy
court proceedings, a deal that could help break the logjam of problem bank loans
hobbling Thailand's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai Petrochemical had waged a two-year battle with creditors over
restructuring its $3.5 billion debt, representing close to 5 percent of the dud
loans held by Thai banks in the wake of the Asian economic crisis that struck in
mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's decision to give up its fight signals a victory for Thailand's
new bankruptcy laws, which give creditors increased clout and are seen as vital
toward whittling down a mountain of dud loans amounting to nearly half of all
lending.
</P>
<P>
	   TPI had become notorious in Thai corporate circles for resisting debt
restructuring, seeking a better deal by trying to divide and delay action by its
148 creditors, mostly domestic banks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Makes Holiday Volunteer Day  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA SINDERBRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton marked the birthday observance of slain
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., today by helping volunteers
refurbish a computer lab at a local Boys and Girls Club.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has encouraged Americans to use the federal holiday to help
their neighbors who need it most, rather than as just another day of rest,
saying it should be ``a day on, not a day off.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every time you give a little, you always get more back,'' Clinton said.
``Let's remember that as Dr. King's enduring legacy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the auspices of Greater DC Cares, volunteers were pitching in at 25
sites around the city today. Clinton joined a half-dozen students at the youth
center who were painting walls and staining bookshelves to spruce up their
computer lab.
</P>
<P>
	   King, recipient of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize for his work for racial
equality, was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are in this together. We are members of the community of this city, the
community of this country and the community of humanity,'' Clinton said. ``In
the 30 odd years since Martin Luther King left this earth, we have forgotten
that too much.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Atlanta today, Vice President Al Gore announced that the administration
will seek $1.5 million in the fiscal 2001 budget to help protect the place where
King was born and was buried. ``We must honor and uphold the dreamer,'' Gore
said in a speech at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King preached. ``For we
have come many miles toward justice, but have not yet fulfilled the dream.''

<P>
    SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A story about a boy who runs away from a foster home to
search for his father took top honors in children's literature Monday from the
American Library Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bud, Not Buddy" by Christopher Paul Curtis won the association's 2000 John
Newbery Medal.
</P>
<P>
	   Simms Taback, illustrator of "Joseph Had a Little Overcoat," won the
Randolph Caldecott Medal for most distinguished picture book, the association's
other top honor.
</P>
<P>
	   Illustrated in watercolor, gouache, pencil, ink and collage, "Joseph Had a
Little Overcoat" is based on a Yiddish folktale of a resourceful tailor who
transforms his old overcoat into smaller garments.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bud, Not Buddy" tells the story of a 10-year-old boy who searches for his
father using clues left by his dead mother that point to a legendary jazz
bandleader. The novel explores questions about racism, belonging, love and hope,
said Carolyn S. Brodie, chair of the Newbery Award Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Curtis also is the recipient of the Coretta Scott King Author Award
recognizing excellence by black authors. Brian Pinkney, illustrator for "In the
Time of the Drums," received the King Illustrator Award.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Volunteers on King Holiday  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA SINDERBRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton marked the birthday observance of slain
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., today by helping volunteers
refurbish a computer lab at a local Boys and Girls Club.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has encouraged Americans to use the federal holiday to help
their neighbors who need it most, rather than as just another day of rest,
saying it should be ``a day on, not a day off.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every time you give a little, you always get more back,'' Clinton said.
``Let's remember that as Dr. King's enduring legacy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the auspices of Greater DC Cares, volunteers were pitching in at 25
sites around the city today. Clinton joined a half-dozen students at the youth
center who were painting walls and staining bookshelves to spruce up their
computer lab.
</P>
<P>
	   King, recipient of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize for his work for racial
equality, was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are in this together. We are members of the community of this city, the
community of this country and the community of humanity,'' Clinton said. ``In
the 30 odd years since Martin Luther King left this earth, we have forgotten
that too much.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Atlanta today, Vice President Al Gore announced that the administration
will seek $1.5 million in the fiscal 2001 budget to help protect the place where
King was born and was buried. ``We must honor and uphold the dreamer,'' Gore
said in a speech at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King preached. ``For we
have come many miles toward justice, but have not yet fulfilled the dream.''

<HEADLINE> Former Superfund tainted site up for sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STRATFORD, Conn. (AP)- A chunk of land contaminated for decades by the
manufacture of brake linings and auto parts has been cleaned up and is up for
sale.
<P>
	   After years spent cleaning up contamination, legal wrangling and government
negotiations, the Raymark property is going to be auctioned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The 33-acre piece of property, where for 70 years Raymark created millions
of cubic yards of contaminated sludge before its plant closed in 1989, was
cleaned up through the federal Superfund program.
</P>
<P>
	   The factory buildings were torn down and a protective, multi-layered cap was
built over the soil contaminated with lead, dioxin, PCBs and asbestos.
</P>
<P>
	   A foundation for a shopping center was built into the cap, which was
completed in 1997, so it would not have to be disturbed during construction.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale of the property is set for Wednesday, when the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Bridgeport will hold an auction in open session.
</P>
<P>
	   Several potential bidders are interested in the land and the site is
expected to sell for a minimum of $15 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed Rubenstein, a lawyer for the Raymark bankruptcy trustee, said
redeveloping the highly polluted property is like spinning "straw into gold."
</P>
<P>
	   "Really, what we're doing here is something very special," Rubenstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   Though it was physically ready for redevelopment, the property and its
bankrupt owner got caught up in long negotiations with federal agencies over the
sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, in late 1998, a U.S. District Court judge in Hartford ordered the
sale and in Nov. 1999 Judge Alan Shiff of U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the
sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Stratford officials are pleased at the interest in the property and have
been anxious to get it back on the tax rolls.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're excited that it's going forward," said Richard Buturla, the assistant
town attorney who has been working on the sale.

<HEADLINE> Rowland campaign benefited from treasurer contacts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Gov. John G. Rowland's 1998 re-election campaign
received $145,000 from some of the key figures in fee scandal involving the
state treasurer's office, the Journal Inquirer reported Monday.
<P>
	   The campaign collected the money in contributions from people who did
official business with former state Treasurer Paul J. Silvester, according to
government records obtained by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The records also show more than half of the Silvester-related donations came
from key figures in the scandal over so-called finder's fees. Those were fees
that investment firms paid to Silvester's associates for helping to arrange
state pension-fund deals.
</P>
<P>
	   Silvester, who was defeated in his own election bid in 1998, is awaiting
sentencing after pleading guilty last fall to federal racketeering and
money-laundering charges. He admitted that some of those fees were kicked back
to him, or his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's spokesman, Dean Pagani, acknowledged that there were
considerably more contributions from Silvester's associates and business
partners than previously reported.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pagani denied there was anything untoward about the governor having
accepted the contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to keep in mind that we're looking at this in hindsight, and that
at the time there was absolutely no evidence that Paul Silvester was doing
anything wrong or illegal," Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no indication that the governor, his campaign staff, or anyone
from the administration had done anything that breaks either the letter or the
spirit of the election laws," Pagani added.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those making contributions were Washington lobbyist Wayne L. Berman,
whose consulting firm hired the former treasurer and his campaign manager after
Berman got $1.5 million in finder's fees. Also, Darien lawyer Christopher A.
Stack, who has admitted kicking back to Silvester proceeds from finder's fees he
received.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Berman and Stack, the governor's contributors include seven other
recipients of sizable finder's fees, more than 30 people connected to about ten
companies in which the treasurer invested hundreds of millions of dollars, and
dozens of people employed by the select banks in which Silvester deposited $100
million in state cash.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland also accepted an additional $117,000 in campaign contributions from
more than 100 individuals whom his reports variously identify as private
investors, money managers, brokers, and other investment professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the records don't provide enough information to determine whether
any of those contributors also had business relationships with the state
treasury under Silvester.

<HEADLINE> Ainsley Harriott Dishes Up New Show  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ainsley Harriott's new cooking show may be the tastiest
item on the daytime TV menu.
</P>
<P>
	   Celebrity talk, musical guests, audience participation -- even a house band
-- are among the ingredients. Plus, the expected recipes and kitchen tips.
</P>
<P>
	   "But it's how you jazz it up, isn't it?" Harriott says. "You take a little
bit of this, a little bit of that and stir it up, and it's fantastic!
</P>
<P>
	   "That's what it's all about."
</P>
<P>
	   He happens to be talking about food, not TV. But on the syndicated "Ainsley
Harriott Show," which airs live every weekday at 9 a.m. EST (check local
listings), its expansive host is jazzing up the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
	   A strapping, rubber-faced bloke you could eat with a spoon, Harriott has
long been a familiar TV presence in his native England. But as of last week, he
is out to conquer the New World.
</P>
<P>
	   He has brought with him to his Chelsea Piers studio a broad grin, a hearty
laugh and a bald pate as smooth as his Corian countertops. ("No hair is gonna
fall in the food," he vows with a chuckle.)
</P>
<P>
	   His focus on the show is "simple, nice, easy food -- food that's attractive
and quick to prepare."
</P>
<P>
	   Preparing it, Harriott is effusive. Passionate. Charming. Clownish. (Why NOT
a little ham on the bill of fare?)
</P>
<P>
	   "I need someone to cook with me!" he trumpeted on Wednesday's show. "I need
someone from the audience!"
</P>
<P>
	   A woman named Richarda joined him on the set in his gourmet kitchen. Before
the hour was done, she had helped him whip up a Tropical Fruit Brulee.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, he had brought on his celebrity guest, "Inside Edition"
anchor Deborah Norville, and, after tea and a chat, they set about preparing a
nutritious dish her kids would like: Turkey Tacos.
</P>
<P>
	   Singer Kevon Edmonds did a number.
</P>
<P>
	   And "Produce Pete" Napolitano disclosed a use for the papaya seeds you'd
otherwise discard: After oven-drying them, pour them in a pepper mill for duty
as a meat tenderizer.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday's show, Harriott welcomed an ice sculptor and the former Sarah
Ferguson, Duchess of York, who confessed, "I can't cook."
</P>
<P>
	   "Ohhhh, you can," insisted Harriott. "Everybody's got the ability to cook.
They just have to be shown."
</P>
<P>
	   Then, as if to prove it, a pre-taped remote showed him raiding the cupboard
and fridge of an "Ainsley Ambush" volunteer named Don, who played sous-chef as
Harriott improvised Tortilla Tuna Triangles. Don was last seen sitting down to
this impromptu, candlelit dinner with wife Dolores, as Harriott slipped away.
</P>
<P>
	   It was as bright as a David Letterman bit -- and oddly inspiring.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not saying to people, 'You've got to cook this,"' Harriott explains. "I
just want to give them ideas. Then, when they try something and it works, they
go on to the next thing.
</P>
<P>
	   "Besides, there's going to be a very high percentage of viewers who don't
cook. But they might be inspired to order something new at a restaurant: 'I saw
Ainsley Harriott cook that the other day. I want to have a try!"'
</P>
<P>
	   As further incentive, Harriott has established a Web site as a useful
supplement to his show. Not only are all TV-demonstrated recipes available, but
an "Ask Ainsley" feature invites "questions, suggestions, tips, cooking traumas,
whatever." (On one show, Harriott tackled this problem from a viewer: How do you
keep your gravy free of lumps?)
</P>
<P>
	   The 42-year-old Harriott, a best-selling author of cookbooks and a former
chef at several top London restaurants, began cooking as a child under the
tutelage of his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   "I grew up not being intimidated by the kitchen," he says, "because she gave
me the skill to express myself. And I just went on from there.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was quite shy," he recalls, for the first time straining credibility. "I
found my way, I suppose, with food. It's a confidence builder. How else in life
do you get that opportunity for someone to say to you, 'Wow, that's really
great'? You put food in front of someone and, 'Ahhh, I really enjoyed that!'
It's a lift."
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, the show Harriott puts in front of viewers is a lift -- fun and
informative.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, he demonstrates refreshingly that food unites us all. Whether it's
a star or a civilian in the kitchen with Harriott, food becomes the great
equalizer. Everyone has something to offer when cooking. And something to learn.
</P>
<P>
	   "The kitchen is the place you feel relaxed," says Harriott.
</P>
<P>
	   Even watching it on TV.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in television ...
</P>
<P>
	   'FORGIVE OR FORGET': Who knows if Mother Love can forgive or forget getting
dumped from this show? No matter. Actress Robin Givens ("Head of the Class," the
feature "A Rage in Harlem") premieres today as the new host of this syndicated
talk-relationship series. In its second season, "Forgive or Forget" invites
guests to appeal for forgiveness from someone whom they have wronged. That
person listens backstage, and if willing to forgive, he or she will be found
standing on the other side of an onstage door. Otherwise ... forget it!

<HEADLINE> Army Closes Probe of Apache Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a months-long investigation, the Army has failed to
determine what caused the fatal crash last spring of an Apache helicopter on
training maneuvers in Albania, the Army said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Two soldiers killed in the accident were the only U.S. troop casualties in
the NATO war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Apache investigation has been closed, and the cause will be listed as
unknown ``due to the degree of damage sustained during the crash sequence,''
Army spokesman Col. Edwin Veiga said. In what he described as a highly unusual
outcome, Veiga said investigators could find no definitive answer to what caused
the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   On May 5, the Apache was leading a formation of five helicopters over
mountainous terrain in northern Albania when its nose pitched up and the chopper
rolled to the right. It fell 150 feet and exploded in flames on the ground,
according to the Dayton Daily News, which obtained an Army report on the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Warrant Officer David Gibbs, 38, of Massillon, Ohio, and Chief Warrant
Officer Kevin Reichert, 28, of Chetek, Wis., were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Early indications pointed to mechanical failure, but Veiga said
investigators were ultimately unable to determine a cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Apaches are the Army's best attack helicopters and were used extensively in
the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq. Flown with a crew of two, they are armed with as
many as 16 laser-guided Hellfire missiles designed to knock out tanks. In
addition, they carry 70 mm rockets and a 30 mm cannon that can fire 625 rounds
per minute.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half the Army's fleet of 743 Apaches has been grounded since last
November to replace their tail rotor bearings or to replace transmission parts.
The decision to ground the choppers was made when the Army determined that the
tail rotor bearing was the cause of an Apache crash in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Veiga said all Apaches deployed abroad have been repaired and returned to
service. The full fleet is scheduled to be back in operation by April.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Shuffles Management  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- The embattled telecommunications company
Mannesmann AG shuffled its top management today, an expected change made in
preparation of the spinoff of its engineering and automotive unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert Weismuller will become chief financial officer, taking over from
Joachim Rauhut, who will head Mannesmann Engineering and Automotive, a division
that is to be split off from the company's telecom operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was no surprise that Weismuller will become CFO because he was the right
hand of chief executive Klaus Esser," said Hermann Reith, an analyst with BHF
Bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Reith said the personnel changes are unrelated to the hostile, $137 billion
takeover bid by British rival Vodafone AirTouch PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Weismuller and Kurt Kinzius will become members of the Mannesmann executive
board on Feb. 15 with Kinzius heading mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the company set up a new group management board in charge of
overseeing Mannesmann's recent acquisitions, such as the British
telecommunications company Orange PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   By midday Monday, Mannesmann shares were up 6.4 percent in Frankfurt trading
at $278 a share. Vodafone has offered stock worth about $265 a share for each
Mannesman share.
</P>
<P>
	   Some traders felt the Vodafone bid might be successful, after a weekend of
analyzing Mannesmann's defense documents, which were released Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the papers said Mannesmann offered no new arguments for going
alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann released its official defense documents Friday in an attempt to
persuade shareholders to reject the bid from Vodafone, the world's No. 1 mobile
phone company. Mannesmann shareholders have until Feb. 7 to reply to the offer.

<HEADLINE> Missile Test May Affect US Strategy  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If successful, a test Tuesday of the Pentagon's
anti-missile missile could move administration officials closer to recommending
that President Clinton commit to deploying a nationwide missile defense.
</P>
<P>
	   A system of interceptor rockets, radars and computerized command centers --
a much scaled-down version of the space-based ``star wars'' defense envisioned
by President Reagan in the 1980s -- could be deployed as early as 2005, although
many hurdles remain.
</P>
<P>
	   If Tuesday's test goes as planned, a 121-pound ``smart rock'' will steer
itself into the path of a mock warhead about 140 miles above the central Pacific
Ocean, creating a collision that would reduce both objects to space dust. At
least, that's the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``smart rock,'' actually a highly sophisticated missile interceptor, is
still ``learning,'' Pentagon officials say. And they're quick to say that while
they hope for success, they will not be surprised if the interceptor misses the
target. After all, they say, this is a testing program, and setbacks are to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
	   This is not, however, just any run-of-the-mill testing program. At stake, in
the Pentagon's view, is the nation's ability to defend itself against the kind
of long-range missile threats that could emerge in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea, for example, is said to be developing a missile with enough
range to reach American territory, although it has not tested it in flight and
agreed recently to halt missile testing for the time being. No other non-NATO
country, other than Russia and China, possesses an intercontinental ballistic
missile.
</P>
<P>
	   If Tuesday's test succeeds, it could lead to a decision by Clinton as early
as this summer to commit the United States officially to building a defense
against missile attack at a cost of at least $12.7 billion. Defense Secretary
William Cohen is scheduled to make his recommendation to Clinton in June.
</P>
<P>
	   If the test fails, there will be another chance as early as April to
demonstrate that strategic missile defense is feasible, one of several criteria
the president has set for deciding whether to deploy it.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also will take cost into account at a time when the armed forces are
hard-pressed to buy the conventional weapons they say will be needed in the
decades ahead. And there's the impact on relations with Russia and China, both
of which are strongly opposed to a U.S. national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
	   In his 2001 budget, to be disclosed Feb. 7, Clinton is expected to ask
Congress for an additional $2.2 billion for the program. That would buy an
arsenal of 100 interceptors and pay for more testing and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very high-priority program,'' chief Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon said Friday. ``We are working very hard ... to get the president the
information he needs from the technical side to make a decision sometime this
summer.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, if we have a series of tests that are deemed to be failures we
couldn't say that this was ready to deploy,'' Bacon added.
</P>
<P>
	   If Clinton gives the go-ahead this summer, a missile defense could be ready
to begin operating in 2005, although some Pentagon officials closely involved in
the program think that is too ambitious a timetable.
</P>
<P>
	   The first major test of the missile interceptor -- known as a ``kill
vehicle,'' or by its Pentagon nickname, ``smart rock'' -- was last Oct. 2. The
first test using the final, combat-ready interceptor is not scheduled until
2003.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the missile used in the October test encountered some problems en
route to its target, it scored a hit and prompted the Pentagon to assert it had
demonstrated that a warhead carrying a nuclear or biological weapon can be
destroyed and neutralized.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics are less certain. They doubt the reliability of a national missile
defense and fault the Pentagon for planning only three interceptor tests before
recommending a deployment decision to Clinton this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Regardless of the outcome of the upcoming test, it is already clear that
the three tests will not provide sufficient basis to determine whether the ...
system will work,'' said Tom Collina of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which
opposes deployment.

<HEADLINE> CIA Recruiting Drive Paying Off  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The magazine ad offers jobseekers ``the ultimate
international career,'' inviting applications from those with a college degree,
an ``adventurous spirit'' and ``a forceful personality.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do you have what it takes?'' the advertisement asks in large type.
</P>
<P>
	   More and more college graduates are deciding they do -- and signing up with
the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   While military recruitment is slumping and federal agencies are struggling
to compete with the private sector's high salaries, the Central Intelligence
Agency is reporting an increase in new hires.
</P>
<P>
	   What CIA Director George Tenet calls ``the biggest recruiting drive since
the end of the Cold War'' appears to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're getting great reception on college campuses and a lot of new people
coming in the door. We're quite pleased,'' CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the exact numbers are classified, agency officials said job offers
extended by the CIA increased by 57 percent in 1998 over the year before, and
rose by 53 percent in 1999. About 70 percent of those offers were accepted, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   The increases mark a dramatic turnaround from just a few years ago, when the
spy agency was rife with reports of low morale and organizational drift and was
losing many of its top professionals to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside intelligence analysts believe CIA employment is up from the reported
low of 16,000 of three years ago but still below the 20,000 level near the end
of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
	   Helping the revival: an image makeover engineered by Tenet and an infusion
of money and effort into recruiting.
</P>
<P>
	   A jazzed-up Web site (www.cia.gov) now offers a virtual tour of the
cloistered CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. A large multicolored eye on the
``employment'' link blinks ``ACCESS APPROVED'' to all cyber visitors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Web site lists about 50 positions, from computer scientist and
interpreter to officers in the clandestine service (entry-level pay: $31,000 to
$38,000).
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA recently created a Silicon Valley venture capital company to promote
promising new technologies and invited young techno-wizards to apply for
financing.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency also has been placing ads in magazines and major newspapers. The
full-page ``Do you have what it takes?'' ad ran in last week's issue of The
Economist magazine, for instance.
</P>
<P>
	   That ad specifically seeks new recruits for the CIA's clandestine overseas
service, which it describes as ``the cutting edge of American intelligence ...
an elite corps.''
</P>
<P>
	   CIA recruiters can be found on college campuses and in booths at job fairs.
Tenet, director since 1997, helps with the recruiting himself, talking to
potential applicants as he travels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot offer you a private sector salary,'' Tenet told students
recently at Georgetown University. ``No one in the intelligence field worth his
or her salt is in it for the money. But we can offer you a deeply challenging
and satisfying vocation -- and a mission unequaled anywhere in American
society.''
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA is ``pitching the romance of intelligence'' through its ads and
recruiting spiels, but such appeals are misleading, said Steve Aftergood, of the
Federation of American Scientists, a Washington group that follows intelligence
issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of these bright-eyed young people may be setting themselves up for
disappointment in what is still a rather hidebound institution,'' Aftergood
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The CIA is appealing to young people's adventurous instincts,'' Aftergood
said. ``I think anyone who falls for that is not suited to be an intelligence
officer.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the House
Select Intelligence Committee, said the fact that most CIA workers are
office-bound does not detract from the agency's effort.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, not everybody there is a spy,'' Dicks said. ``Many people are
attracted to the element of service. The CIA has done a good job on using the
Internet and being relevant to what kids are interested in.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dicks said Congress has sought to ``strengthen the agency'' with recent
increases in intelligence spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Those familiar with the budget put the intelligence authorization bill
approved by Congress last fall at about $29.5 billion for fiscal 2000, up
considerably from the $26.7 billion level of 1998, when the government last
disclosed the amount.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA has made recruitment and retention top priorities, agency spokesman
Harlow said. To help cut through bureaucratic complexities, ``our recruiters
have been given the authority to make conditional offers on the spot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If someone comes up and says, 'I'm a computer programer, I'm interested in
foreign affairs and I speak Mandarin Chinese,' ... that person should know they
could have a career with us.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki has huge lead over possible rival in 2002  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki has a huge lead over a possible
Democratic challenger in the 2002 governor's race when it comes to raising money
for the campaign, reports showed Monday.
<P>
	   The reports, prepared for filing with the state Board of Elections, showed
the Republican governor had raised more than $824,000 over the past six months
and had $2.32 million on hand as of Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly, this is an indication that the governor is seriously considering a
run for a third term," Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Pataki and his 1998
campaign manager, said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, at this point four years ago, Pataki's state campaign committee
reported $1.35 million in the bank. Even so, the governor's committee back then
had raised about $760,000 over the previous six months - almost the same
fund-raising pace as over the last six months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a report prepared by state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a
Democrat, showed he had just $72,711.83 in his state campaign account as of the
middle of this month, having raised $22,250 over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
	   "We took '99 off (from fund raising) and now we're gearing up and planning
to go full-steam ahead," Shawn Thompson, executive director of the Friends of
McCall campaign committee, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson, a fund-raising specialist, was recently hired by McCall to help
raise the money needed if the comptroller decides to go ahead with a run for
governor in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to McCall, the Democratic nomination for governor has drawn the
interest of federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, the eldest son of former New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo who was driven out of office by Pataki. The younger Cuomo
has yet to form a state campaign committee and has not begun raising money for a
possible gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither McCall nor Cuomo has yet announced plans to run for governor. Mucha
said any announcement from Pataki is a long way off.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Mucha said the Pataki camp was "very pleased with the results
and we intend to continue to raise the funds that are necessary in order to
launch a third campaign should the governor make that decision."
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Pataki spent more than $20 million in easily defeating Democrat
Peter Vallone and Independence Party candidate B. Thomas Golisano to win a
second term.
</P>
<P>
	   While Pataki said during his 1994 campaign against Mario Cuomo that he would
serve only two four-year terms if elected, the New York Republican has since
said he is considering a run for a third term in 2002. At the time of their
race, Cuomo was seeking a fourth term and polling indicated many New Yorkers
felt the Democratic incumbent had simply stayed around too long.

<HEADLINE> Comptroller latest to urge legislative OK of Empire conversion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A battle with partisan overtones is developing in
Albany over the bid by New York's largest health insurer to change from a
not-for-profit to a for-profit entity.
<P>
	   The latest entrant into the fray is state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who
issued a study last week urging that legislative approval be sought for the
proposed Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield conversion to for-profit status.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall said the conversion is crucial to state policy on a number of levels,
ranging from the size of the company (4.1 million subscribers) to the fact it
would be the first of what health industry officials predict will be a series of
future decisions by not-for-profit entities to go for-profit.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is New York's first time out of the box - we should make sure we do it
legally, and we do it right," McCall said. "We'll be setting a precedent for any
future conversions."
</P>
<P>
	   McCall's recommendations came less than two weeks after the state Insurance
Department in the Republican Pataki administration quietly approved the Empire
request to go to a for-profit status after holding hearings and public forums
throughout most of 1999. In making that determination - by posting a decision on
the Internet without any other public notification - the department also said
current state laws which prohibit conversions of not-for-profit entities to
for-profit don't apply in Empire's case.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have done extensive legal analysis and do not believe our proposal is
barred by the current statute," Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield spokeswoman
Deborah Bohren agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Empire has been talking about a conversion for more than three years, and
even those skeptical about the benefits to ratepayers say the company has
developed a reasonable proposal and has been careful to describe it fully to
health care advocates, government regulators and the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Michael Stocker, Empire's chief executive officer, says a conversion is
necessary to let the company compete for customers with for-profit entities.
Empire has "virtually no ability to raise money" on Wall Street for acquisitions
of other health care plans and new technology while its for-profit competitors
have almost unlimited access to money, Stocker said.
</P>
<P>
	   Empire officials pledge that no subscriber will lose coverage, no health
benefits will change and its networks, rates and service will stay the same
after the conversion.
</P>
<P>
	   To underscore the partisan tone of the debate over whether Empire now must
go to the Legislature for its OK is the fact that former state Attorney General
Dennis Vacco, a Republican, did not think the company needed legislative
approval. But the current attorney general, Democrat Eliot Spitzer, said the
conversion as Empire wants to proceed would break state law.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Empire wants to convert, the Legislature must lift the existing legal
prohibition and Empire must get court approval by showing that the terms of the
transaction are fair and reasonable and that the transaction promotes Empire's
not-for-profit health purposes," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's lawyers are now hashing out the matter with Empire's counsels. A
state Supreme Court justice must ultimately approve the conversion, and the
attorney general has suggested that he is ready to sue if Empire seeks to take a
course he believes is counter to the law.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall is also a Democrat, and the voices in the Legislature clamoring for
the conversion to be endorsed by lawmakers are Democratic, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Assemblyman Alexander Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who chairs the
Assembly's insurance committee, said he wants assurances that Empire will set up
a foundation with funding adequate to meet its costs of treating indigent
patients. That requirement grows out of the decades that Empire received state
subsidies to serve the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   In a more general sense, Grannis said it is important to establish in law
ways of dealing with issues like the charitable foundations for the health
insurers in the future who will be seeking to go to for-profit status. He said
he also expects that some not-for-profit hospitals will try to convert into
for-profit entities as the health care industry continues to get more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I could wave a wand it would be not to have companies convert," Grannis
said. "It is money taken out of the revenue stream that arguably goes to health
care. But we are past that. It's a very competitive world. Conversions to
for-profit are here and I don't see us standing in the way."

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Founder To Visit N. Korea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Chung Ju-yung, South Korea's richest man and head
of the Hyundai group, plans to visit North Korea in February to promote business
with the communist country, group officials said today.Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Chung hopes to meet leader Kim Jong Il and discuss several investment
projects, including a major industrial complex on North Korea's west coast, said
Kim Yun-kyu, a senior Hyundai official.
</P>
<P>
	   Hyundai plans to relocate hundreds of footwear and other small-scale,
labor-intensive South Korean plants to the industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
	   Hyundai also is pushing to invest in about a dozen handicraft and other
small businesses in Chung's hometown of Tongchun on North Korea's east coast.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be Chung's fourth visit to North Korea since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Chung and his family settled in South Korea before the Korean Peninsula was
divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945. He founded
Hyundai in the early 1950s and has developed it into South Korea's largest
conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
	   In an unprecedented joint venture with North Korea, Hyundai launched a
cruise tour to a scenic North Korean mountain in late 1998. More than 160,000
South Koreans have visited the mountain on the tour.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Has Iran Nuclear Concerns  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expressed new worry Monday
over Iran's nuclear program and whether that country has acquired the capability
to make nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will continue to work hard to block those efforts,'' White House
national security spokesman David Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials were not pleased with reports Friday from Moscow that Iran
may order from Russia an additional three nuclear reactors for power generation.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Iran denies having a nuclear weapons program, and Russia insists
its assistance is peaceful and legal, administration intelligence officials view
the Russian-Iranian relationship with rising alarm.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times reported Monday that the Central Intelligence Agency has
told senior Clinton administration officials that Iran might now be able to make
a nuclear weapon. CIA Director George Tenet has been briefing other U.S.
policy-makers on the new assessment, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   National Security officials would not comment directly on the report but
agreed that the possibility that Iran may be able to manufacture nuclear weapons
has been a growing worry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've said all along that we are concerned about Iran's efforts to develop
ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence and defense experts warned that Iran may be closer than
previously believed to amassing a nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior intelligence official said the United States is watching closely
the worrisome problem of availability of fissionable material to Iran, which
could use it to make nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   There remains disagreement among intelligence officials on the pace of
Iran's nuclear program and the degree to which Iran may be attempting to divert
nuclear materials to weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   A reason for differing estimates, officials said, is the difficulty in
monitoring Iran's acquisition of nuclear materials and technology.
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as last year, intelligence officials were telling congressional
intelligence panels that Iran might be able to test a missile that could reach
targets in the United States by 2010. Officials now suggest the timetable might
have to be shortened in light of the recent developments.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. efforts to persuade Russia to stop providing nuclear technology to Iran
have met with little success.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian engineers already are building a reactor at a site in southern Iran
under an existing contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran also has become a top customer of Russia's ailing defense industry with
purchases of fighter jets, missiles, tanks and submarines.
</P>
<P>
	   On several occasions, Congress has sought to impose sanctions on countries
helping Iran develop nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, an intention aimed
primarily at Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has accused Russia, China and North Korea of selling Iran technology
and expertise for its arms program, including attempts to build nuclear weapons
and missiles to carry them.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials as well as military-minded members of Congress have used
the possibility of nuclear attacks from Iran, North Korea and other potential
U.S. enemies as a major rationale for moving to develop a national missile
defense.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Market Guru Mighr Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- An attorney for Martin A. Armstrong said today he is
considering filing an appeal to get the renowned market forecaster out of jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong was handcuffed and led out of court Friday for failing to comply
with an order to turn over gold bars, antiques and company records.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Richard Owen told Armstrong he had the keys to his own cell, and would
be released as soon as he agreed to provide the missing items, which include
about $14 million in valuables and at least one computer.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong, founder of Princeton Economics International Ltd., has been
charged with defrauding Japanese investors out of almost $1 billion. He has
pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong, 50, did produce a half-dozen ancient marble busts, hundreds of
gold coins and four computers last week for a court-appointed receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   "His position is he produced a significant amount of material over the
course of the week, and he needed a bit more time," said Martin Unger, an
attorney with the law firm Tenzer Greenblatt, which is representing Armstrong.
He said he had not yet decided whether to appeal the judge's order to the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the missing items, however, Judge Owen was concerned that the
computers Armstrong handed over were damaged -- one was missing a hard drive --
and almost 600 files had been deleted just hours before the computers were
turned over to the receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   Unger said, "All the information that was on the computer was on another
computer, so it wasn't so much as tampering as he made a mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong testified that he no longer has the other valuables the receiver
claims Armstrong purchased with company funds. Armstrong said several of the
missing items, including a $750,000 black basalt bust of Julius Caesar and a
collection of coins, were given to Australian businessman Nigel Kirwan in
exchange for a 50 percent interest in the Princeton Precious Metals &AMP; Capital
Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong also testified that he gave $1 million in gold bars to Akira
Setogawa, chairman of Cresvale in Tokyo, a subsidiary of Princeton Economics.
Armstrong said the gold was payment for Setogawa's interest in Cresvale.
</P>
<P>
	   Setogawa was indicted last month in Japan for tax evasion and paying illegal
rebates to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong, who is in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, can
be held in jail for up to 18 months for contempt of court in this case.

<HEADLINE> Several Hurt in Israeli Explosion  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HADERA, Israel (AP) -- A pipe bomb hidden in a trash can exploded today at a
park in the Israeli coastal town of Hadera, wounding 21 people in what Israeli
officials said was an attempt to derail Mideast peacemaking. Most injuries were
minor.
</P>
<P>
	   The blast came during a critical phase in Israel's peace talks with the
Palestinians and Syria. Prime Minister Ehud Barak said last week that Israel was
bracing for renewed attempts by Islamic militants to disrupt the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Police officials said the blast was probably carried out by Islamic
militants who hope to derail the process, although the largest hard-line Muslim
group, Hamas, denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   A small group in Lebanon called Omar Mukhtar claimed responsibility for the
blast in a fax sent to Lebanese state run-television Teleliban, but Israeli
police said they had no information that the group was involved. Little is known
about the group that takes its name from the leader of Libya's independence
fight against the Italians in the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has warned he would break off negotiations over a major terror attack,
but it appeared unlikely he would do so over today's blast.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to the explosion, Barak said in a statement that Israel was
``determined to act with all its might to crush terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bomb went off shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small park near a
bank in downtown Hadera, close to the city's marketplace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I heard a loud boom and people were shouting, `Terror attack! Terror
attack!''' said 40-year-old passer-by Moshe Senado, who witnessed the blast.
``People were on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   The pipe bomb was hidden in a trash can, and flung garbage and tree branches
across the park and the adjacent road. It did not shatter nearby windows,
however.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the blast, a paramedic hastily bandaged the bloodied left hand
of a man in his 60s, who appeared dazed as he sipped water from a plastic cup
held by a passer-by. Another wounded man, also elderly, lay on the sidewalk
before being lifted onto a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
	   Border police officers in flak jackets, armed with assault rifles, patrolled
the area, as security forces and dogs searched for additional explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at Hadera's Hillel Yafe Hospital said they treated 21 people. One
man was in moderate condition, and the others were lightly injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said the attack was ``part of the
campaign against the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he thought today's assailants had also carried out two recent
bombings in the nearby town of Netanya. A Nov. 8 explosion wounded 33 people,
while a Dec. 24 blast caused no injuries. Sneh said he did not know the identity
of the assailants.
</P>
<P>
	   Past bombings have usually been carried out by Hamas or Islamic Jihad, two
militant groups based in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Hadera is located 30
miles north of Tel Aviv, and is close to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the Israeli army arrested nearly two dozen Islamic Jihad
activists in the West Bank amid reports that Israel had received new warnings
that the group planned to carry out attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   In a newspaper interview last week, Barak said he was aware there were
``enemies of the peace process,'' and suggested that attacks against Israeli
targets could have a detrimental effect on talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Naturally we are prepared to try to prevent this,'' he was quoted as
saying in Friday's editions of the newspaper, Maariv. ``It should be remembered,
there is no 100 percent guarantee, and this could affect the Syrian track, as
well as the Palestinian track.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   HADERA, Israel (AP) -- A pipe bomb hidden in a trash can exploded in the
center of an Israeli town on Monday, injuring 21 people and underscoring how
delicate the peace process remains.
</P>
<P>
	   The injuries were minor, with most people receiving treatment for shock and
ringing in the ears. Still, televised scenes of medics loading the wounded onto
ambulances could further undermine already teetering talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Police officials said the blast was probably carried out by Islamic
militants who hope to derail the peace process, although the largest hard-line
Muslim group, Hamas, denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   A small, little-known Lebanese group, Omar Mukhtar, claimed responsibility
for the blast in a fax sent to Lebanese state-run television Teleliban. However,
Israeli police said they had no information the group was involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the process revived last September by Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were quick to use the bombing to rally
opposition for the talks, despite quick condemnation of the attack by Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel cannot run negotiations under threat and under intimidation,'' said
opposition legislator Ruby Rivlin.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak said the attack would not affect peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are a strong people, very tough,'' he said. ``We understand the
missions before us, and no type of terror will break our spirit.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians have been frustrated with the progress of the talks and
were infuriated when Barak on Monday postponed for three weeks a withdrawal from
the West Bank that had been scheduled for Thursday. Barak said he needed the
time to focus on the Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is counter to the agreements signed, and unacceptable because it did
not take place in coordination with the Palestinian side,'' said Nabil
Abourdeneh, a top Arafat aide.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal was to be one of the last interim withdrawals before final
peace treaty negotiations start next month. The Palestinians hoped it would
include three Arab suburbs of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides as their capital.
But Barak insisted the suburbs would not be part of the next withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Israeli officials tried to soothe Palestinian anger, saying the talks
were progressing according to plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is natural that there should be disagreements, but this is not a
crisis,'' Foreign Minister David Levy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak won elections in May promising to revive the Palestinian and Syrian
peace processes frozen three years by his hard-line predecessors. He pledges to
have agreements in place this year. Troubles on both fronts -- Barak postponed
talks with the Syrians on Monday -- make that seem increasingly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   In the placid, tree-lined town of Hadera, the blast left residents feeling
that peace -- whatever its dimensions -- would not remove the threat of terror.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that we must have peace, but in the meantime everyone must look
around and be aware,'' said Eliran Assaf, a university student who shoved his
wife and daughter inside a bank when he heard the blast.
</P>
<P>
	   Alastair Meir, a 75-year-old Polish-born Holocaust survivor treated for
shock, refused to let such attacks rattle him.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Religious Violence Grows  </HEADLINE>
   By GEOFF SPENCER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Religious strife spread in eastern Indonesia on
Monday, where angry Muslims burned as many as a dozen churches.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jakarta, meanwhile, reformist Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid
downplayed rumors of an impending coup.
</P>
<P>
	   The churches were burned in the towns of Mataram and Ampenan on Lombok
island, 1,600 miles east of Jakarta, the national capital. Troops fired warning
shots at rock-throwing mobs on the island while Islamic protesters attacked the
Christian places of worship.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds, officials said. Police
said eight churches were burned, while church officials set the number at 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Lombok lies just east of Bali, Indonesia's main tourist destination. Police
said Monday's violence flared well away from popular beach resorts.
</P>
<P>
	   The trouble erupted after thousands of protesters accused Wahid's
three-month-old government of doing little to quell more than a year of civil
war between Muslims and Christians in troubled Maluku province in Indonesia's
remote east.
</P>
<P>
	   The bloodshed, which has claimed more than 1,000 lives, has triggered an
outcry among Muslims, who make up more than 90 percent of Indonesia's 210
million people. Big protests in several cities recently have called for a
``jihad,'' or holy war, against the Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting in Maluku plus bloody rebel violence in Aceh in Indonesia's far
west also have generated discontent within the ranks of the military -- and
fueled coup rumors.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, a moderate Muslim leader, has infuriated some generals by refusing to
impose martial law in Maluku and Aceh. The military, used to using its might to
crush troublemakers during three decades of authoritarian rule under
ex-President Suharto, is also angry at attempts to prosecute some top commanders
for human rights abuses in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   Many say Wahid, who has promised democratic reforms, is slowly whittling
away at the military's once unchecked power. Last week, he fired the military's
top spokesman after he publicly criticized Wahid.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke added
credence to coup fears by warning the military not to try to move against
Wahid's democratically elected government. Wahid made light of the rumors
Monday, but vowed to quash any plot against him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think there will be a coup, that is one thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Military chief Adm. Widodo Adisutjipto also denied the speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who's going to launch a coup? You must have to learn from history that
Indonesia's military has never launch a coup,'' the official Antara news agency
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   In an apparent attempt to placate the generals, Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab
left Monday for the United Nations, where he will try to block efforts to
establish an international East Timor war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators accuse the military of permitting the frenzy of violence that
swept East Timor in September after the territory voted to secede from
Indonesia. Wahid says Indonesia's legal system must handle the case.

	   Mannesmann Shuffles Management
</P>
<P>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- The embattled telecommunications
company Mannesmann AG shuffled its top management today, an
expected change in preparation of the spinoff of its engineering
and automotive unit. Albert Weismuller will become chief financial
officer, taking over from Joachim Rauhut, who will head Mannesmann
Engineering and Automotive, a division that is to be split off from
the company's telecom operations. Hermann Reith, an analyst with
BHF Bank in Frankfurt, said the personnel changes are unrelated to
the hostile, $137 billion takeover bid by British rival Vodafone
AirTouch PLC. Mannesmann has also set up a new group management
board in charge of overseeing Mannesmann's recent acquisitions,
such as the British telecommunications company Orange PLC.
Mannesmann shares were up 6.4 percent in Frankfurt trading at $278

	   Glaxo Wellcome Buying SmithKline Beecham
</P>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- British pharmaceutical company Glaxo Wellcome PLC
plans to buy rival SmithKline Beecham PLC for about $76 billion in
stock, creating the world's largest drugmaker. The combination
announced today would form a company to be called Glaxo SmithKline
that would hold a 7.3 percent share of the global pharmaceutical
market. The deal demonstrates the pressure facing even the biggest
names in the pharmaceutical industry to consolidate with rivals as
a way to afford the rising costs of developing and selling new
medicines. It is also likely to trigger a new round of takeovers
and mergers throughout the industry. Under the deal, Glaxo
shareholders would hold a 58.75 percent stake in the new entity,
with SmithKline shareholders holding a 41.25 stake.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Europe's largest software company,
Germany's SAP AG, is asking shareholders to vote at a special
meeting tomorrow on a stock plan that gives management the option
to buy company shares at a set price in the future, a rare move for
a German company its size. The proposal, disparaged by critics as
``plain vanilla'' for its relative simplicity, is aimed at stemming
a flow of nearly 50 top level employees who have left its
U.S.-based unit over the last year for competitors with more
generous stock offerings. But it also bucks a growing trend in
Germany that ties employee incentives and bonuses more closely to
actual stock performance and stays away from stock options.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court To Weigh 'Bubble' Law  </HEADLINE>
   By AARON J. LOPEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- The morning calm on a tree-lined residential street is
pierced as sign-carrying protesters shout at women entering an abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an office of death! Don't kill your baby! Do you know what you're
doing?'' they yell from 8 feet away at women partially shielded by a 4-foot
brick wall outside the Planned Parenthood clinic.
</P>
<P>
	   It is a scene dictated by Colorado's 1993 ``bubble'' law, which requires
protesters to keep their distance from patients entering health-care facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the law
legally protects patients from harassment and intimidation or violates the
protesters' right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision could establish guidelines for other states and cities that
have grappled with ways to maintain peace between protesters and women seeking
abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The state of Colorado argues that the law balances free-speech rights with
the right to access to health care. The Legislature passed the law after hearing
patients complain of being spat on, kicked and harassed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's all right to protest. That's fine, but when it gets down to
intervening with another person's recognized right, the Legislature felt obliged
to step in,'' said Deputy Attorney General Ken Lane.
</P>
<P>
	   James Henderson of the Virginia-based American Center for Law and Justice,
which represents the protesters, counters that the law tramples on free-speech
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My way of sidewalk counseling is to be gentle and to be compassionate.
Colorado's way is to put me so far away I have to scream and yell,'' Jeanne
Hill, one of three protesters challenging the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Around the country, some cities have tried creating buffer zones between
protesters and clinic patients, and between protesters and churches. Others have
required protesters to obtain permits for demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colorado law bars people from counseling, distributing leaflets or
displaying signs within 8 feet of others without their consent. The protective
bubble is maintained within 100 feet of an entrance to a health-care facility.
Violators can get up to six months in jail and a $750 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the three protesters was arrested under the law. In fact, the law
has gone virtually unenforced since its passage.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Supreme Court returned the case to Colorado's state courts in 1997
to reconsider it in wake of the high court's decision in a New York case. In
that case, the high court allowed abortion protesters to confront patients on
public sidewalks as long as they stayed as least 15 feet from the clinic's
entrance.
</P>
<P>
	   A Colorado appeals court again upheld the law, noting it was enacted by
lawmakers, while the New York case involved a judge's injunction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colorado Supreme Court also voted last year to uphold the state law,
citing ``greater deference for legislative enactments regulating speech.'' It
also drew a distinction between buffer zones of 15 feet and 8 feet, ruling that
the smaller buffer zone allows for ``normal conversational tones.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ellen Brilliant of Planned Parenthood of the Rockies said the mere threat of
prosecution has made a noticeable improvement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have seen clients shoved. I've seen staff pushed,'' Ms. Brilliant said.
``With the bubble law, protesters still can say what they want to say and
clients are able to access health care free from harassment and intimidation.''

<HEADLINE> TV Head Praises U.S. Drug Policy  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The head of the most popular television network
among teen-age girls says the government should be congratulated -- not
condemned -- for trying to insert anti-drug messages in the plots of TV comedies
and dramas.
</P>
<P>
	   The WB network twice sought the advice of President Clinton's anti-drug
counselors on scripts for its prime-time shows. But Jamie Kellner, the WB's
chief executive, said Monday the network received no financial benefit for
pushing a message that discourages drug use.
</P>
<P>
	   "I look at this as the government being very clever in trying to find a way
to get a message out that we totally support," Kellner said.
</P>
<P>
	   The WB consistently has one of network TV's youngest audiences, appealing
particularly to teen-age girls with shows like "Dawson's Creek." The two
programs where it sought government advice on scripts were "The Wayans Brothers"
and "Smart Guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's Office of National Drug Control Policy never asked to see WB
scripts in advance; in the two applicable cases, the network volunteered them,
Kellner said. ABC executives said over the weekend that they became
uncomfortable with Clinton's advisers asking to see scripts of shows before they
aired.
</P>
<P>
	   The WB routinely consults with experts outside government for advice when
producing shows, on such issues as teen pregnancy, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We enjoy doing something that is pro-socially responsible, especially since
we reach a younger audience," Kellner said. "I think people should applaud the
government for being clever. Normally they pay $500 for a toilet seat."
</P>
<P>
	   Kellner said the WB wouldn't have any problems talking to the White House
about scripts in the future, though the network may seek help outside the
government to avoid public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to advice, Clinton's drug advisers offered broadcasters
financial benefits for including anti-drug messages within the plots of
entertainment programs. Under the arrangement, the government would let networks
out of a commitment to air some anti-drug public service announcements, enabling
them to sell the commercial time to other clients.
</P>
<P>
	   While the WB ran fewer public service ads after it produced anti-drug
programming, it did not use the extra time to sell more commercials, Kellner
said. Instead, the network ran promotional announcements or other PSAs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Volunteers on King Holiday  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA SINDERBRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton spent a few hours of his Martin Luther
King Jr. holiday volunteering at a Southeast Washington Boys and Girls Club and
said he hoped people would begin to view the day as ``a day on, not a day off.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president put a dark stain on wooden shelves in a third-floor computer
lab with a group of young volunteers. He later thanked them for keeping him from
``messing up too bad.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president may have revealed one reason he used Monday's event to brush
up on home-improvement skills with his comment that he has a ``lot of work to
do'' on his new Chappaqua, N.Y., house. He said he managed already to get a lot
of work done in the few days he spent there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a great house, and we're making progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president traveled a couple of miles from the White House to the club,
which serves low-income children, to mark the holiday named for the slain civil
rights leader.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a source of immense pride and joy to me every time I see people
reaching across the lines that divide them to do things that lift us all up,''
Clinton said. ``This holiday embodies that. All these children embody that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also praised ``hundreds of thousands'' of AmeriCorps volunteers, who
he said were spending the King holiday on the job in a variety of volunteer
projects. The Clinton administration founded the national service program five
years ago and points to it as an example of volunteer initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My son Simon is very excited the president's here,'' said volunteer
Cynthia Jones. ``Heck, I'm excited.'' She said she hoped the president's
presence brought more attention to the holiday as a day to volunteer, rather
than just another day off from work.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked by reporters about his long-delayed book on race relations, Clinton
said the project is running a little behind because of time spent working on the
Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know, I'm not going to put it out until I have lots of time to spend
personally on it,'' Clinton said. ``I don't want it to be something somebody
else did that my name is on.''

<HEADLINE> IRA Disarmament Key to New Gov't  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The fledgling Protestant-Catholic
government could unravel if the Irish Republican Army doesn't start to disarm
this month, a leading moderate in the major Protestant party warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The comments by Duncan Shipley-Dalton underscored building tensions within
the Ulster Unionist Party, whose leader oversees the four-party Cabinet formed
last month under terms of the 1998 Good Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Party chief David Trimble won narrow Ulster Unionist backing to accept the
IRA-linked Sinn Fein party as Cabinet colleagues, but only on condition that the
IRA begins to disarm in January.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA has not indicated any intention to deliver arms before the Ulster
Unionists vote Feb. 12 whether to remain in the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly, the legislature from which the
Cabinet is drawn, Shipley-Dalton told Sinn Fein members: ``I would be unwilling
and unable to support the continuation of the institutions of this Assembly in
the event that decommissioning did not occur by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I say that as probably one of the most liberal members you're going to
find on this side of this house,'' added Shipley-Dalton, a former British
soldier who had strongly urged Trimble to form the Cabinet and see whether the
IRA responded.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's minister responsible for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson,
repeated his own calls for disarmament during a visit to Omagh, the town where a
car bomb planted by IRA dissidents claimed 29 lives in 1998 -- the bloodiest
single atrocity in the Northern Ireland conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of the agreement must be implemented, including decommissioning, if
all sections of the community are to continue to support it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Party Sets Emergency Session  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's Christian Democrats scheduled an emergency
leadership meeting Monday as calls grew louder for party leaders to resign over
a spreading campaign finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Party leader Wolfgang Schaeuble, himself facing suspicions for accepting the
equivalent of $52,000 from a businessman, set the national party executive
meeting for Tuesday, six days ahead of its next regular session.
</P>
<P>
	   The leaders will be trying to deal with a scandal that was touched off last
month by revelations that former chancellor Helmut Kohl accepted up to $1
million in unreported campaign funds in the 1990s, when the conservative
Christian Democrats led Germany's government.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal grew last week in Hesse state, where former party officials
admitted funneling millions to party coffers from a Swiss account and falsely
reporting the money as bequests. Those irregularities implicated yet another
senior party figure -- former Hesse party chairman Manfred Kanther, once a tough
law-and-order advocate as Kohl's interior minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the weekend, Germany's justice minister urged the entire conservative
leadership to step down. Leaders of the Christian Democrats' post-Kohl
generation pressed for resignations themselves on Monday, and Hesse state Gov.
Roland Koch suggested that Kanther give up his seat in the federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will have to part ways with all those entangled in this affair,''
Christian Wulff, a deputy national party chairman, told North German Radio. ``I
certainly don't exclude expulsions of party members.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble, Kohl's hand-picked successor in 1998, has been undermined by the
ever-growing revelations of apparent breaches of Germany's party financing law.
Hecklers at a weekend party rally urged Schaeuble to resign and scorned his
efforts to clear up the scandal, which is overshadowing the Christian Democrats'
campaign for Feb. 27 elections in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Hesse prosecutors opened a fraud probe Monday against a former party
treasurer and a party tax adviser, widening the range of formal suspects in the
scandal beyond Kohl.
</P>
<P>
	   The probe will seek to determine whether fraud or breach of trust charges
are warranted against tax adviser Horst Weyrauch and the former Hesse party
treasurer, Prince Casimir Sayn-Wittgenstein, prosecutors said. They said they
acted on Kanther's disclosure that $6.8 million flowed to the state's Christian
Democrats from abroad between 1989 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors in Bonn opened a similar probe against Kohl last month.

<HEADLINE> CIA Helps State Dept. on Security  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Central Intelligence Agency is helping the State
Department safeguard its secrets and to improve security in general, a CIA
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has set a Jan. 31 deadline for the State Department to come up with
a plan to improve security. It threatened to stop financing the department's
Bureau of Intelligence and Research if a plan is not produced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are working with State to help assure that classified information is
protected,'' said CIA spokesman Bill Harlow. He said the agency is working to
help State meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   An internal audit by the State Department's inspector general cited lax
procedures in handling classified materials and said the agency was not in
compliance with CIA directives that govern the handling of sensitive material,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The audit was conducted last September, well before the FBI accused a
Russian diplomat in December of spying. The Russian, told to leave the country,
was listening in his car to transmissions from a bug planted in a State
Department conference room on the same floor as Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the audit has not been released publicly, parts of it have been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, officials familiar with the audit said it criticized the State
Department for letting visitors, contractors and maintenance workers roam its
building unescorted. While visitors were screened on entry, they were not
routinely escorted to the offices in which they claimed to have appointments,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another portion of the internal audit, reported Monday by The Washington
Post, found that 140 offices where highly classified documents were handled had
never been swept for listening devices.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, the newspaper reported, 239 of 1,890 highly classified reports
from the Cryptological Support Group of the National Security Agency had not
been returned to the group's secure facility inside the State Department between
August and October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In one case, a pouch was returned empty. Another was returned open with a
key in it, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress demanded the security improvements after a man strolled into a room
six doors down from Albright's office in 1998, helped himself to classified
briefing materials and walked out. He was never identified, and the documents
were never recovered.

<HEADLINE> Glaxo Wellcome buyout of SmithKline Beecham speeds drug industry's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LONDON (AP) - Glaxo Wellcome's planned acquisition of rival drugmaker
SmithKline Beecham would do more than create the world's largest pharmaceutical
company.
<P>
	   The deal, announced Monday and worth about $76 billion in stock, is a clear
sign that the merger trend now reshaping other industries is accelerating in the
still-fragmented drug business.
</P>
<P>
	   Just last week, Pfizer emerged as the likely winner in a battle with
American Home Products for drugmaker Warner-Lambert, while Monsanto is in the
process of merging with Pharmacia and Upjohn. Industry analysts predict other
blue-chip names, including Eli Lilly, Schering Plough, Novartis, Bristol-Myers
Squibb and even merger-averse Merck, won't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a trend that could have a significant impact on New Jersey's economy.
American Home Products, Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Upjohn, Merck and Schering
Plough all are headquartered here. Bristol-Myers Squibb has its research
headquarters in Princeton, and Novartis, a Swiss company, has its U.S.
headquarters in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that eventually about six to 10 companies will own the
pharmaceutical market," said Hemant Shah, an independent industry analyst based
in Warren, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   That's a far cry from the mosaic of firms currently vying for a few cents of
each dollar consumers spend on medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   Compared to other industries, the pharmaceutical business still has many
competitors. Indeed, the combined Glaxo and SmithKline would control just 7.3
percent of global sales, although individual companies dominate treatments for
several specific conditions such as allergies and high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say that consolidations are gathering momentum because drugmakers
are pinched between the ballooning costs of developing new drugs and the demands
of investors and shareholders that they deliver double-digit growth in profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Only by bulking up to pool research and development funds and by slashing
costs can pharmaceutical firms avoid financial peril in an ever more Darwinian
market.
</P>
<P>
	   "To succeed in this industry, you must be top-tier, and preferably, you must
have market leadership," Glaxo Wellcome chairman Sir Richard Sykes told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham said their union would yield $1.6
billion in annual savings after three years. They said job cuts were expected,
but that they were still deciding where to make them.
</P>
<P>
	   The two British-based companies plan to keep their corporate headquarters in
London, but open a new operational headquarters in or near New York.
</P>
<P>
	   They would keep their U.S. businesses separate. SmithKline has a research
and development unit based in Philadelphia and a non-prescription drug business
in Pittsburgh. Glaxo's American operations are headquartered in Research
Triangle Park, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Their union comes two years after previous merger talks collapsed in a fight
over which executives would run the company
</P>
<P>
	   The apparent success of Pfizer's hostile bid for Morris Plains-based
Warner-Lambert gave new impetus to the idea, said Kevin Wilson, an industry
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pfizer-Warner-Lambert has acted as a catalyst," he said. "I could easily
imagine them saying, 'Look, this is a good idea. We might as well get on with it
now.' "
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo SmithKline would have worldwide pharmaceutical sales of an estimated
$15 billion, based on 1998 annual figures. But a combined Pfizer-Warner-Lambert
would be close behind with a 6.7 percent market share, and it would be gaining
fast, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Madison-based American Home Products - the apparent loser in the fight for
Warner-Lambert - has failed three times to combine with other drug companies and
looks like an increasingly attractive takeover target for a European company
such as Bayer that might be aiming to expand its U.S. pharmaceuticals business,
said Andy Penman, an analyst at London brokerage Greig Middleton.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Merck, which has publicly sworn off mergers in the past, might have its
hand forced if it wants to keep up with more financially powerful rivals. Merck
is headquartered in Whitehouse Station.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question that Merck is the best in the business in terms of
developing new drugs, but it's going to be very difficult to compete when there
are companies with R and D budgets that are twice that of Merck," said Shah, the
New Jersey-based analyst.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's strength lies in its top anti-migraine drug, Imitrex, and in
treatments for asthma and viral infections, including HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline's top products include the antibiotic Augmentin, the
antidepressant Paxil and a new diabetes drug, Avandia. It also has a strong
vaccines business.
</P>
<P>
	   But both firms are feeling pressure because their top drugs are facing
expiration of their patents, allowing cheaper generics into the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's leading ulcer drug Zantac lost its patent protection in 1997, and
SmithKline's lucrative Augmentin will lose its patent in 2002.

    PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Kirk Douglas said his new film "Diamonds" is

Douglas told the crowd. "And when you speak slowly, people listen."

stroke. "I thought I would never make another movie unless silent movies came
back," he said, drawing a laugh.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Market Guru Might Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- An attorney for Martin A. Armstrong said today he is
considering filing an appeal to get the renowned market forecaster out of jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong was handcuffed and led out of court Friday for failing to comply
with an order to turn over gold bars, antiques and company records.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Richard Owen told Armstrong he had the keys to his own cell, and would
be released as soon as he agreed to provide the missing items, which include
about $14 million in valuables and at least one computer.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong, founder of Princeton Economics International Ltd., has been
charged with defrauding Japanese investors out of almost $1 billion. He has
pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong, 50, did produce a half-dozen ancient marble busts, hundreds of
gold coins and four computers last week for a court-appointed receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   "His position is he produced a significant amount of material over the
course of the week, and he needed a bit more time," said Martin Unger, an
attorney with the law firm Tenzer Greenblatt, which is representing Armstrong.
He said he had not yet decided whether to appeal the judge's order to the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the missing items, however, Judge Owen was concerned that the
computers Armstrong handed over were damaged -- one was missing a hard drive --
and almost 600 files had been deleted just hours before the computers were
turned over to the receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   Unger said, "All the information that was on the computer was on another
computer, so it wasn't so much as tampering as he made a mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong testified that he no longer has the other valuables the receiver
claims Armstrong purchased with company funds. Armstrong said several of the
missing items, including a $750,000 black basalt bust of Julius Caesar and a
collection of coins, were given to Australian businessman Nigel Kirwan in
exchange for a 50 percent interest in the Princeton Precious Metals &AMP; Capital
Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong also testified that he gave $1 million in gold bars to Akira
Setogawa, chairman of Cresvale in Tokyo, a subsidiary of Princeton Economics.
Armstrong said the gold was payment for Setogawa's interest in Cresvale.
</P>
<P>
	   Setogawa was indicted last month in Japan for tax evasion and paying illegal
rebates to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong, who is in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, can
be held in jail for up to 18 months for contempt of court in this case.

<HEADLINE> Nuns Block West Bank Church Seizure  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) -- Two American nuns, including a sister of
ex-Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos, stubbornly stood their ground Monday in a
monastery Palestinian police tried to seize over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephanopoulos' sister, Maria, said she was bruised in a scuffle with police
and at one point clung to window bars to resist eviction in the property
dispute, which could turn into a diplomatic headache for Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just held tight to the bars of the chapel window, and right in front of
me was a crucifix with Christ and that gave me strength,'' said Sister Maria,
40, of New York City, speaking by cell phone from the monastery.
</P>
<P>
	   She said that during the first 36 hours of the standoff, she refused to eat
and drink, but has since ended her protest fast.
</P>
<P>
	   Sister Maria said she has not spoken to her brother George, but that she
understood he was aware of the dispute. Arafat was to meet with President
Clinton on Thursday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is a property dispute between the exiled Russian Orthodox Church
and its more powerful rival based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian Jericho Garden Monastery had been in the hands of the exiled, or
``White'' church, but Palestinian police raiding it Saturday said they had
documents showing it belonged to the ``Red'' church in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Palestinian policemen patrolled outside the compound and
prevented reporters from entering.
</P>
<P>
	   Police did permit U.S. consular officials to meet with Sister Maria and
another American nun, Sister Tina Cesena of San Fransisco. ``Americans are
involved and therefore we are following very closely,'' said Jane Dafny, a U.S.
Consulate spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian police also permitted a doctor to see the nuns and brought them
food. ``They have been nice, not at all like on Saturday,'' Sister Maria said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sister Maria said she would not leave the compound voluntarily. Palestinian
security officials said they would not evict the nuns by force.
</P>
<P>
	   In Saturday's raid, Palestinian police removed four nuns and monks from the
compound. However, Sister Maria, headmistress of a girls' school near Jerusalem,
was able to get into the monastery and was later joined by Sister Tina. Sister
Maria said two monks from the Russian-based church were also in the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian officials said they were acting on a request made by Moscow
Patriarch Alexy II, who met earlier this month with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Arafat has
proposed locking the compound and setting up a committee to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
	   Father Alexy said the church-in-exile rejected the proposal. He said that a
similar panel, set up after Palestinian police seized a monastery of the exiled
church near the West Bank town of Hebron in 1997, still has not resolved that
dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The origins of the dispute date back to 1917.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Russian revolution, the communist regime seized control of the
Russian Orthodox church, while remnants of the defeated anti-communist armies
set up a church-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
	   The church-in-exile controlled Russian shrines in the Holy Land until 1948,
when Israel recognized the Moscow Patriarchate's claim as a gesture of gratitude
to the Soviet Union for its recognition of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Church property in east Jerusalem and the West Bank remained under ``White''
control through Jordanian and later Israeli control. Despite the fall of Soviet
communism in 1991, the two churches never reconciled.

<HEADLINE> Castro Had Fought Custody Battle  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- If Fidel Castro seems to be taking the case of 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez personally, it may be because he was party himself to a custody
battle involving his first-born son more than four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Elian, Fidelito Castro Diaz had parents with very different visions of
their child's future. Then, as now, the situations underscore the politics and
passions that for more than two generations have torn apart Cuban families
living on both sides of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
	   While Castro recently blamed ``the extremist and terrorist mafia of South
Florida'' for keeping Elian in Miami and blocking his return ``to his legitimate
family and homeland,'' the battle over Elian is not between the Cuban and U.S.
governments. It is a fight within the Cuban family -- one that has even touched
Castro's.
</P>
<P>
	   According to biographers, Castro's first wife, Mirta Diaz-Balart, filed for
divorce in the mid-1950s, when he was imprisoned in Cuba for an attack on a
Santiago military barracks that launched the Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the divorce was final, Mirta Diaz left for the United States with
Fidelito, who was then 5.
</P>
<P>
	   During the divorce battle, the mother was granted custody, but Castro
insisted that the child be returned to Cuba, Tad Szulc writes in ``Fidel: A
Critical Portrait,'' a biography published in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Castro's wife's brother, Rafael Diaz-Balart, was an official in the
government of President Fulgencio Batista, which Castro was trying to overthrow.
Castro worried about the influence the Diaz-Balart family would have on his son.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I refuse even to think that my son may sleep a single night under the same
roof sheltering my most repulsive enemies and receive on his innocent cheeks the
kisses of those miserable Judases ... To take this child away from me, they'll
have to kill me ... I lose my head when I think about these things,'' Castro
wrote in a letter to his elder half-sister, Lidia.
</P>
<P>
	   After leaving prison, Castro continued to fight for custody, saying that if
he lost in court ``it would reaffirm my principles and my determination to fight
until death to live in a more decent republic.''
</P>
<P>
	   After being released from prison, Castro went to Mexico to prepare for a
guerrilla war against the Batista government.
</P>
<P>
	   While there, Castro persuaded Mirta Diaz-Balart to send him the boy for a
two-week visit. He never sent him back, Robert E. Quirk writes in the 1993
biography ``Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Castro turned the boy over to a couple in Mexico he trusted, with
instructions to sign him up for piano lessons.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, when Castro's sisters visited and took Fidelito for a stroll in
Mexico City's Chapultepec Park, three armed men jumped from a car and grabbed
the boy, Quirk wrote. Then Mirta Diaz-Balart flew to Mexico to pick the child
up.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite protests from Castro's sisters, the Mexican government said the
mother had custody rights to the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   By then, Castro was in eastern Cuba, fighting against Batista's troops.
After his successful 1959 revolution, the boy returned to live in Cuba with his
father, studied nuclear science in the former Soviet Union, and lives in Havana
today with his own family. He is 50.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the Diaz-Balart family eventually emigrated to Miami, with the
exception of Mirta Diaz-Balart, who was last known to be living in Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Her nephew, U.S. Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., has been instrumental in
the battle to keep Elian in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's ... ironic that Castro's talking about having the interests of a
small child at heart when he kidnapped even his own son from his mother who had
custody in 1956,'' Diaz-Balart told CNN on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clutching an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25.
His mother died in the fateful ocean crossing to the United States, and his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is waging a fierce battle to repatriate the boy to
Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Glaxo Buying SmithKline Beecham  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Glaxo Wellcome's planned acquisition of rival drugmaker
SmithKline Beecham would do more than create the world's largest pharmaceutical
company.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, announced Monday and worth about $76 billion in stock, is a clear
sign that the merger trend now reshaping other industries is accelerating in the
still-fragmented drug business.
</P>
<P>
	   Just last week, Pfizer emerged as the likely winner in a battle with
American Home Products for U.S. drugmaker Warner-Lambert, while Monsanto is in
the process of merging with Pharmacia and Upjohn. Industry analysts predict
other blue-chip names, including Eli Lilly, Schering Plough, Novartis,
Bristol-Myers Squibb and even merger-averse Merck, won't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that eventually about six to 10 companies will own the
pharmaceutical market," said Hemant Shah, an independent industry analyst based
in Warren, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   That's a far cry from the mosaic of firms currently vying for a few cents of
each dollar consumers spend on medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   Compared to other industries, the pharmaceutical business still has many
competitors. Indeed, the combined Glaxo and SmithKline would control just 7.3
percent of global sales, although individual companies dominate treatments for
several specific conditions such as allergies and high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say that consolidations are gathering momentum because drugmakers
are pinched between the ballooning costs of developing new drugs and the demands
of investors and shareholders that they deliver double-digit growth in profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Only by bulking up to pool research and development funds and by slashing
costs can pharmaceutical firms avoid financial peril in an ever more Darwinian
market.
</P>
<P>
	   "To succeed in this industry, you must be top-tier, and preferably, you must
have market leadership," Glaxo Wellcome chairman Sir Richard Sykes told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham said their union would yield $1.6
billion in annual savings after three years. They said job cuts were expected,
but that they were still deciding where to make them.
</P>
<P>
	   The two British-based companies plan to keep their corporate headquarters in
London, but open a new operational headquarters in or near New York.
</P>
<P>
	   They would keep their U.S. businesses separate. SmithKline has a research
and development unit based in Philadelphia and a non-prescription drug business
in Pittsburgh. Glaxo's American operations are headquartered in Research
Triangle Park, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Their union comes two years after previous merger talks collapsed in a fight
over which executives would run the company
</P>
<P>
	   The apparent success of Pfizer's hostile bid for Warner-Lambert gave new
impetus to the idea, said Kevin Wilson, an industry analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pfizer-Warner-Lambert has acted as a catalyst," he said. "I could easily
imagine them saying, 'Look, this is a good idea. We might as well get on with it
now.' "
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo SmithKline would have worldwide pharmaceutical sales of an estimated
$15 billion, based on 1998 annual figures. But a combined Pfizer-Warner-Lambert
would be close behind with a 6.7 percent market share, and it would be gaining
fast, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products -- the apparent loser in the fight for Warner-Lambert
-- has failed three times to combine with other drug companies and looks like an
increasingly attractive takeover target for a European company such as Bayer
that might be aiming to expand its U.S. pharmaceuticals business, said Andy
Penman, an analyst at London brokerage Greig Middleton.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Merck, which has publicly sworn off mergers in the past, might have its
hand forced if it wants to keep up with more financially powerful rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question that Merck is the best in the business in terms of
developing new drugs, but it's going to be very difficult to compete when there
are companies with R and D budgets that are twice that of Merck," said Shah, the
New Jersey-based analyst.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's strength lies in its top anti-migraine drug, Imitrex, and in
treatments for asthma and viral infections, including HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline's top products include the antibiotic Augmentin, the
antidepressant Paxil and a new diabetes drug, Avandia. It also has a strong
vaccines business.
</P>
<P>
	   But both firms are feeling pressure because their top drugs are facing
expiration of their patents, allowing cheaper generics into the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's leading ulcer drug Zantac lost its patent protection in 1997, and
SmithKline's lucrative Augmentin will lose its patent in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Nuns Block West Bank Church Seizure  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) -- Two American nuns, including a sister of
ex-Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos, stubbornly stood their ground Monday in a
monastery Palestinian police tried to seize over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephanopoulos' sister, Maria, said she was bruised in a scuffle with police
and at one point clung to window bars to resist eviction in the property
dispute, which could turn into a diplomatic headache for Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just held tight to the bars of the chapel window, and right in front of
me was a crucifix with Christ and that gave me strength,'' said Sister Maria,
40, of New York City, speaking by cell phone from the monastery.
</P>
<P>
	   She said that during the first 36 hours of the standoff, she refused to eat
and drink, but has since ended her protest fast.
</P>
<P>
	   Sister Maria said she has not spoken to her brother George, but that she
understood he was aware of the dispute. Arafat was to meet with President
Clinton on Thursday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is a property dispute between the exiled Russian Orthodox Church
and its more powerful rival based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian Jericho Garden Monastery had been in the hands of the exiled, or
``White'' church, but Palestinian police raiding it Saturday said they had
documents showing it belonged to the ``Red'' church in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Palestinian policemen patrolled outside the compound and
prevented reporters from entering.
</P>
<P>
	   Police did permit U.S. consular officials to meet with Sister Maria and
another American nun, Sister Tina Cesena of San Fransisco. ``Americans are
involved and therefore we are following very closely,'' said Jane Dafny, a U.S.
Consulate spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian police also permitted a doctor to see the nuns and brought them
food. ``They have been nice, not at all like on Saturday,'' Sister Maria said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sister Maria said she would not leave the compound voluntarily. Palestinian
security officials said they would not evict the nuns by force.
</P>
<P>
	   In Saturday's raid, Palestinian police removed four nuns and monks from the
compound. However, Sister Maria, headmistress of a girls' school near Jerusalem,
was able to get into the monastery and was later joined by Sister Tina. Sister
Maria said two monks from the Russian-based church were also in the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian officials said they were acting on a request made by Moscow
Patriarch Alexy II, who met earlier this month with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Arafat has
proposed locking the compound and setting up a committee to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
	   Father Alexy said the church-in-exile rejected the proposal. He said that a
similar panel, set up after Palestinian police seized a monastery of the exiled
church near the West Bank town of Hebron in 1997, still has not resolved that
dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The origins of the dispute date back to 1917.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Russian revolution, the communist regime seized control of the
Russian Orthodox church, while remnants of the defeated anti-communist armies
set up a church-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
	   The church-in-exile controlled Russian shrines in the Holy Land until 1948,
when Israel recognized the Moscow Patriarchate's claim as a gesture of gratitude
to the Soviet Union for its recognition of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Church property in east Jerusalem and the West Bank remained under ``White''
control through Jordanian and later Israeli control. Despite the fall of Soviet
communism in 1991, the two churches never reconciled.

<HEADLINE> Marches, church services mark observances of slain civil rights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - About 250 people braved bitter cold Monday
for an abbreviated parade and a church service honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. - one of many observances across New Jersey marking the birthday
of the slain civil rights leader.
<P>
	   The route for the annual parade was shortened in deference to the cold - a
temperature of 16 degrees and a wind chill factor of 17 below zero, according to
the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
	   The march attracted fewer people than usual, as did a service afterward at
St. James AME Church.
</P>
<P>
	   "It cut back on the numbers, but the spirit was just as high," said William
Marsh, president of the Atlantic City chapter of the NAACP, which sponsored the
event. "We marched like it was 90 degrees."
</P>
<P>
	   King, 39, was shot to death April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn. His birthday -
Jan. 15 - became a national holiday in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlantic City parade began, fittingly, at the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. School. Marching from the school down a street also named for King,
bundled-up participants from the NAACP, the Atlantic City High School marching
band and the Stanley Holmes Village housing project put on brave faces for the
15-minute walk.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers said the nasty weather was not unusual.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been doing this for 26 years now, and in all that time we've had only
four nice days," said Pierre Hollingsworth, a former NAACP chapter president who
marched Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The biting cold prompted organizers to cut corners: Instead of marching to
Arctic Avenue and turning left to go to the church, the procession peeled off at
Bacharach Boulevard and made a bee-line to the church, where hot dogs and hot
chocolate awaited.
</P>
<P>
	   In previous years, the march included 400 people or more.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was good that we had the numbers we did, since it was so cold," said
Stephenie Dixon, chairwoman of the event.
</P>
<P>
	   During the church service, a half-dozen clergymen and NAACP officials lauded
King's work but said much more still needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
	   "The dream has not been fulfilled," said the Rev. Milton Hendricks, pastor
of Faith Baptist Church in nearby Pleasantville. "We are still the last hired
and the first fired. Our cities and schools are in a deplorable condition.
Racism still rears its ugly head and brotherhood is still a dream deferred."
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, the Concerned Citizens of Camden Association held a march and
rally in the morning, followed by a neighborhood cleanup in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Community service was also the theme in Livingston, where the high school
was the focal point for a blood drive and collections of eyeglasses, household
items and clothing for needy families.
</P>
<P>
	   In Lawnside, school children competed in the fifth annual Rosie Lee Oates
Teen Speech Contest at Grace Temple Baptist Church. Teen-agers had to pick a
current event and deliver a three- to five-minute speech about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Carson Dunbar, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, was
scheduled as the keynote speaker at an evening service at St. Andrew's United
Methodist Church in Cherry Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunbar was appointed in November to rebuild a department plagued by
race-related troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's doing some things that Dr. King wanted to do for this country," said
Rabbi Lewis Eron, coordinator of the religious Leaders Coalition, one of the
sponsors of the event.
</P>
<P>
	   "It shows the struggle still continues," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cold keeps MLK celebration inside but doesn't stop it  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The bitter -4 degree weather on Monday kept most of
New York's Martin Luther King Jr. celebrations inside, but hearts were still
warmed from the compelling speeches, inspirational choirs and motivational
orchestra music.
<P>
	   "Forget about the weather outside," Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings said during
the program in the Empire State Plaza Convention Center. "It's warm in here."
</P>
<P>
	   The frigidly-cold weather in Albany - the wind chill factor at noon was -45
degrees - forced planners to cancel a march to the Martin Luther King Monument
at Albany's Lincoln Park.
</P>
<P>
	   But no one seemed to mind after inspirational songs by the Empire State King
Interdenominational Mass Choir and the Empire State Youth Orchestra, as well as
an impassioned lecture from the Rev. Calvin Butts III, pastor of the Abyssinian
Baptist Church in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Butts, who also is the president of the State University of New York at Old
Westbury, praised King, saying "the marching feet of his nonviolent army shook
the foundations of America."
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a prophet to the nation, saying that we will live together as
brothers and sisters or we will perish apart as fools," Butts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue, the highest-ranking state official at the program,
urged people to make every day a celebration of Martin Luther King's dream of
equality and civil rights. "The key is action now, today and every day," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue also accepted on behalf of the state a small crystal Marin Luther
King Jr. monument donated by Steuben Glass and the New York Power Authority. The
monument will "remind us of the past and guide us to the future," Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
	   The monument will be placed in the Empire State Plaza later this year, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone was celebrating this day, however. Members of the Center For
Law &AMP; Justice protested outside the Empire State Convention Center during the
program, trying to call attention to the growing number of prisoners being
denied parole in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Alice Green, the center's executive director, wants legislative hearings on
the state's prison systems. She says the prisons are steadily getting worse for
inmates and officials are denying inmates a chance at parole to keep a steady
low-paid work force for the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters carried signs saying "Dr. King was a prisoner too," "Parole
justice" and "Prisoners have families too." and chanted "We are Family."
</P>
<P>
	   "If George Pataki is serious about Martin Luther King Day, then he would
listen to what these people have to say," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Green saw no conflict in holding protests on Martin Luther King Jr. Day,
saying peaceful protests - not acceptance of the status quo - are what Dr. King
espoused.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not here to sing and dance for the white people," Green said. "That's
what they want us to do."
</P>
<P>
	   In Utica, a luncheon and awards ceremony were held along with an evening
march and memorial service at Hope Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolyn Bradley was on pins and needles in anticipation. "We were raised to
look for the good in people, not the bad," said Bradley, who met King after he
gave a speech in Kingstree, S.C., in the early 1960s. "We had a lot of love
instilled in us."
</P>
<P>
	   Growing up in the South, the 47-year-old Bradley can remember a time when
she wasn't able to play at white children's homes. But in her house, it was
different.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't have white friends, black friends," she said. "We had friends. I
tried to instill in my kids the same things."

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Arms Embargo on Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Despite opposition from human rights campaigners,
the European Union on Monday lifted a 4-month-old arms embargo imposed on
Indonesia during the violence that followed East Timor's vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The restrictive measures taken against the previous Indonesian government
... need not be renewed,'' the EU said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15-nation bloc said it would continue to closely monitor weapons sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The ban was lifted despite objections from the human rights group Amnesty
International.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While East Timor is now secure, similar patterns of intimidation and
killing which shocked the world ... are being repeated in parts of Indonesia,''
the group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The arms embargo was introduced to pressure Jakarta into accepting
international peacekeepers in East Timor, where pro-Indonesia militias rampaged
after the province voted overwhelming for independence in an Aug. 30 referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU banned all sales of arms, munitions, military equipment and other
goods ``which may be used for internal repression.'' It also suspended military
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Ordinary Dutchman Is African King  </HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY DEUTSCH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- A middle-aged, paunchy, unemployed white man
plops down on the sofa to watch TV with his kids.
</P>
<P>
	   Meet King Togbe Korsi Ferdinand Gakpetor II of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
	   In Holland, the king is Henk Otte, a Dutch construction worker on welfare.
In West Africa, he rules part of the lush Volta Region, home to tens of
thousands of Ewes who revere him as Togbe, or king.
</P>
<P>
	   Otte, 43, is as Dutch as the Dutch come, born and raised in Amsterdam like
his parents. He lives in an Amsterdam housing project with his wife and two
children, and an ordinary life would have suited him just fine.
</P>
<P>
	   But, during a 1995 visit to the hometown of his Ghanaian-born wife, Mamaa
Awo Mepeyo Kpui, Otte was identified as the reincarnation of the late chief, his
wife's grandfather.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My two brothers were there when I was asked to become king,'' Otte said
with a chuckle. ``When I translated for them what had been said, they almost
choked with laughter: `You, a king? Ha!'''
</P>
<P>
	   Now, when his brothers accompany him to Ghana, Otte is carried by
throne-bearers and surrounded by cheering crowds. Drummers pound and dancers
swirl in a surreal procession that has been shown on several Dutch television
documentaries.
</P>
<P>
	   The region he rules, about 45 miles east of the capital, Accra, comprises
about 40 villages populated by more than 100,000 people. It was leaderless for
almost 17 years until the Dutchman was proclaimed king.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ewe, a group of tribes that share a common language, account for around
10 percent of Ghana's population of 18.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   According to local lore, the Ewes in the Volta Region originate from the
eastern shores of Togo's Aklakpa River. Their first king, according to legend,
was carried across the dark, torrential waters by alligators to settle their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   When he is in Africa, Otte wears a crown and monarch's garments and lives in
a home built for him.
</P>
<P>
	   Otte's attraction to Ghana began as a child, while reading about the
geography and history of the region. Later, he says, a Ghanaian fortune teller
predicted he would obtain a position of power.
</P>
<P>
	   During a visit to his wife's village of Mepe, a spiritual healer told Otte
things about his life the Dutchman is convinced the healer couldn't have
possibly known. Villagers stared at him, insisting his spiritual ``aura''
reminded them of the late king. He became a magnet for swarms of children and
visitors, who walked for days to see him.
</P>
<P>
	   One evening, Mepe's leaders told him he was the chosen one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They asked me how I would feel about becoming king,'' he said. ``I looked
at them and thought: 'You've got to be completely insane.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Although he's considering moving to Ghana, Otte is aware that life as a king
isn't all fun and games. In Mepe, he is prohibited from eating or drinking in
public, he can't shake hands with the thousands of ``commoners'' who flock to
his side and is always escorted, even to the toilet.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, telephone calls and faxes are the only way Otte maintains a say in
community decision-making. He also collects donations to improve the region's
impoverished education system and has sent a shipment of toys for the
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the scores of foreigners, mostly aid workers, who have been named
``development chiefs'' in Ghana and undergo a purely ceremonial coronation,
Otte's is a position with authority.
</P>
<P>
	   He will undergo a traditional installment ceremony on the fifth anniversary
of his crowning this August, a ritual that can last for weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Otte doesn't believe in reincarnation, myths or spiritual healing. But over
the years, he has overcome his Western skepticism and now agrees with his
subjects that his appointment was predetermined by a higher being.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you think about it, it's pretty weird,'' he said. ``But it's my
destiny.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Official Briefs Pope on Elian  </HEADLINE>
   By VANIA GRANDI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Cuba's foreign minister said Monday he briefed John
Paul II -- but did not ask for intervention -- on the case of a Cuban boy caught
in a tug-of-war between the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian Gonzalez, now 6, was rescued at sea Nov. 25 after his mother drowned
trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Filipe Perez Roque said he talked to the pope about ``how
Elian is being kept separated from his father -- something the pope was very
worried about.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican's communique on the meeting made no mention of Elian. A Vatican
spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini, said later that there would be no comment
about Perez Roque's remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez Roque said he had not asked the pontiff to intervene, but said he
hoped the meeting would help raise international concern for Elian. Perez Roque
also plans stops in France, the Netherlands and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled the boy must be
returned to his father in communist Cuba. But Attorney General Janet Reno last
week lifted an INS deadline so Elian's relatives in Miami can fight a federal
court battle to keep the boy. A Florida judge also has scheduled a hearing in
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Some U.S. politicians and Cuban-Americans have suggested congressional
action to give Elian permanent residency or even American citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it had been a Haitian or Mexican boy, they would have thrown him back
into the sea,'' Perez Roque said after meeting with Italian Premier Massimo
D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican used the papal audience and the minister's sessions with the
Vatican secretary of state and foreign minister to push for more religious
freedom in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Regarding church-state relations, ``the minister has restated the will of
his government to favor a mutual, harmonious collaboration,'' Vatican spokesman
Joaquin Navarro-Valls said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For its part the Holy See has expressed a wish for ever greater religious
liberty in the wake of what the Holy Father affirmed in his historic visit in
January 1998,'' the Vatican spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   During his visit to Cuba, John Paul made blunt calls for more freedoms,
including that of expression.
</P>
<P>
	   After nearly 40 years of tensions following the 1959 Cuban revolution that
brought Fidel Castro to power, church-state relations have improved over the
last few years, especially following John Paul's visit. Christmas, for example,
has been reinstated as a permanent holiday on the island thanks to the pope's
visit.

<HEADLINE> Cayugas turn to court for compensation in land claim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -The negotiating is over. Now it is up to a federal
court jury to listen, and decide how much the Cayuga Indian Nation should be
awarded for its lost ancestral lands.
<P>
	   "There's always a chance of settling in any case. But I can't give you any
reason for great optimism," said Martin Gold, the Cayugas' attorney, as he
prepared for jury selection Tuesday and the start of the damages phase of the
tribe's 19-year-old land claim.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state is defending this case with an absolute scorched earth policy, as
if they have just been wonderful to the Cayugas and the other Indian nations
since the beginning of history," said Gold.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a year's worth of negotiations directed by a court-appointed mediator
have failed to resolve how much the state of New York owes for illegally taking
64,027 acres of Cayuga land two centuries ago. A 12-member jury will be seated
to complete that task. Lawyers have said testimony could take two to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas claimed in a 1980 lawsuit that the land was wrongfully acquired
by the state, which failed to obey a 1790 federal law requiring the federal
government to approve all land treaties. Based on a 1985 U.S. Supreme Court
ruling, U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn upheld the Cayugas' claim in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas original claim sought the return of all their lost lands in
Cayuga and Seneca counties and $350 million. In June, the state reportedly
offered a settlement that included $110 million and 4,500 acres of private and
state land. McCurn has said no landowners will be unwillingly evicted from their
property.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the mediator floated a settlement proposal of $120 million but no
land. It was a move sharply criticized by the state and counties, who said they
did not authorize it. On Monday, state Sen. Michael F. Nozzolio wrote to McCurn
calling for the mediator's dismissal for making such an "irresponsible" offer.
</P>
<P>
	   During an eight-day pretrial hearing, the state's expert appraiser placed
the value of the Cayuga claim at $25 million to $40 million and the land's
rental value no more than $6 million. The highest land value was offered by the
federal government's appraiser, who said the land's current market value was
$264.7 million and its rental value $70.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury will not have to stay within the experts' monetary limits. And,
whatever amount it decides, is unlikely to end the land claim because one side
will almost surely appeal the ruling to the U.S. Second Circuit, and eventually
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mohawks, Oneidas and Senecas also have land claims pending and the
Onondaga Nation has said it would file its lawsuit after seeing how the Cayuga's
trial ends. All of the tribes are watching the Cayugas trial with interest
because it is the first to reach the damages stage and will have an impact on
their unsettled claims.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas, who once spread out over 3 million acres of upstate New York,
are the only landless tribe among the five aboriginal tribes of the Iroquois
Confederacy. Currently, about 500 Cayugas live in western New York on and around
the Seneca's Cattaraugus reservation. Two other groups of Cayugas live in Canada
and Oklahoma.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Soar; Europe Shares Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose to a 29-month high in Tokyo today as Japan's
central bank left its monetary policy unchanged, a move that also boosted the
yen against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   European markets were modestly higher, with a new high reached by Germany's
main index, as investors debated the merits of a $76 billion merger in the
pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. financial markets were closed today in observance of Martin Luther King
Jr. Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, a solid rally Friday on Wall Street that left the Dow Jones
industrial average at a record high helped lift stocks in overseas markets
today.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average rose 480.68 points, or 2.54
percent, to close at 19,437.23 points. It was the Nikkei's highest close since
Aug. 8, 1997, when it ended the day at 19,604.46 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said technology and brokerage stocks boosted the index. The Nikkei
also benefited from strength last week in the U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Tokyo market was basically mirroring the movement in New York," said
Yuichi Kohashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar tumbled against the yen as Bank of Japan opted to leave interest
rates and monetary policy unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, the Bank of Japan has repeatedly intervened in the currency
market to buy dollars in order to stem the yen's rise. A strong yen means that
profits on Japanese products sold overseas are worth less when they are changed
into the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
	   In London trading, the dollar fell to 104.78 yen from 107.40 Friday. Most
European currencies slipped against the dollar, however. The euro fell to
$1.0090 from $1.0142 Friday and the British pound fell to $1.6308 from $1.6377.
</P>
<P>
	   In Europe, stocks closed higher despite some mixed reactions to the latest
round of corporate mergers. Shares of drug companies were mostly lower following
the announcement of the merger agreement between British drug companies Glaxo
Wellcome PLC and SmithKline Beecham PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's acquisition of SmithKline, which would create the world's largest
drugmaker, unites two companies that conducted unsuccessful merger talks two
years ago. Traders suggested that investors were disappointed because they had
hoped the deal would create greater cost savings than the $1.6 billion projected
by Glaxo and SmithKline.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology shares rose on growing confidence that Vodafone AirTouch PLC will
be successful in its $137.6 billion bid for German telecommunications company
Mannesmann AG. Mannesmann is fighting the bid. Shareholders have until Feb. 7 to
reply to the offer.
</P>
<P>
	   London's FTSE-100 Share Index closed up 11.3 points, or 0.2 percent, and the
Paris CAC-40 Index closed 55.34 points or 1.0 percent higher. Frankfurt's Xetra
DAX Index surged to its second record close in a row, ending 85.68 points or 1.2
percent higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Latin American indexes were also mostly higher Monday.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Aide Denies Arkan Link  </HEADLINE>
   By DUSAN STOJANOVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The government was not behind the death of a
notorious paramilitary leader, an aide to President Slobodan Milosevic said
Monday, despite reports suggesting the victim may have been killed to prevent
him from testifying against Yugoslav leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Serb Police Chief Radmilo Bogdanovic, a senior official in
Milosevic's Socialist Party, dismissed claims that the government was behind the
gangland-style slaying of Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan.
</P>
<P>
	   Bogdanovic told independent radio station B2-92 that it was ``impossible to
connect'' Arkan's death with ``state terrorism'' and that ``only a serious
police and judicial investigation'' could shed light on the killing.
</P>
<P>
	   Raznatovic, who had been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal
for alleged atrocities committed during wars in Croatia and Bosnia, was believed
to have close ties to Milosevic's security services.
</P>
<P>
	   That fueled widespread speculation in Serbia that Arkan was killed Saturday
because he could implicate Milosevic and other Serbian leaders in atrocities
committed during the bloody breakup of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   At The Hague, Paul Risley, spokesman for the war crimes tribunal, said two
lawyers claiming to represent Arkan contacted the court separately last week and
said he was interested in negotiating a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Risley said it was never clear whether the two lawyers actually represented
Raznatovic and added: ``I am not aware that Arkan or any of his associates have
had any contact with the tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police have not issued a statement on the attack, which occurred Saturday
night in the lobby of a luxury hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   With no official police account of the killing, Belgrade's newspapers were
full of conflicting accounts, which further encouraged speculation of high-level
involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   The government-run Politika daily said Raznatovic's assassin approached from
behind and shot him in the head as he sat in the hotel lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   This conflicted with other independent media reports that said several
masked assailants staged the attack while Arkan was walking through the lobby.
The independent Glas newspaper claimed Arkan knew one of the assassins and
greeted him moments before the shooting started.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we don't get a precise police statement soon on who is behind the
assassination, the question should be asked on whether the police are hiding the
facts about the murder or perhaps they are behind it,'' Budimir Babovic, a
former Interpol official, told Belgrade's Beta news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan, 47, led a paramilitary group known as the ``Tigers,'' that was
purportedly organized in the early 1990s by Milosevic's secret police to fight
alongside Serb-led troops.
</P>
<P>
	   That enabled Milosevic's government to try to disassociate itself with some
atrocities committed in Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan's Serbian Unity Party said a memorial service for Raznatovic will be
held Wednesday at the Union Hall in Belgrade while the funeral was scheduled for
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Spain Wants Pinochet Examined Again  </HEADLINE>
   By CIARAN GILES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spain put the Pinochet ball squarely back in Britain's
court Monday, sending London a judge's request for a new medical exam to
determine whether the former Chilean dictator is mentally fit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The move came a day before Britain's deadline for opinions on the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Britain's Home Office said doctors believe Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
84, is too ill to be extradited to Spain to face charges. Home Secretary Jack
Straw said he was considering canceling the extradition, but he asked for
opinions from Spain, France, Belgium and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said the Spanish
government would not send Britain any more petitions from Judge Baltasar Garzon,
the magistrate who wants to try Pinochet in Madrid. Spanish leaders have always
been uneasy about their involvement in the case, which has potential
implications for their relations with Chile and Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Matutes' office later qualified its statement, saying the petition would be
forwarded but only if it contained new material. Then on Monday, Spain decided
to forward Garzon's petition after all. Matutes would only say the decision was
in line with Spain's stance of not interfering in the legal process.
</P>
<P>
	   But others believed the administration led by conservative Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar had ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It looks as if Spain realized there was more to be gained by passing on
Garzon's argument, in the hope that it won't make any difference to the case
anyway, than by blocking it and risking a tirade of criticism back home,'' said
political analyst and columnist Javier Tussell. ``At least, if Straw now decides
to release Pinochet, Aznar won't look so bad.''
</P>
<P>
	   Garzon's call for a second medical examination was joined by four groups:
Amnesty International, the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of
Torture, the Association of the Relatives of the Disappeared in Chile, and
Redress.
</P>
<P>
	   The organizations sent a letter to Straw on Monday requesting that the
results of the original medical team's examination be disclosed. They said they
would submit a full petition by Tuesday's deadline and would seek a second
medical examination for Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw set Tuesday as the deadline for responses. He is then expected to make
what could be the final decision in the yearlong wrangle over whether or not
Pinochet should stand trial in Madrid for human rights crimes during his 1973-90
dictatorship. Chilean reports say 3,197 people died or disappeared after
Pinochet ousted a civilian government in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Garzon, who initiated the case by ordering Pinochet's arrest in London on
Oct. 16, 1998, claims a fresh examination is needed to determine whether
Pinochet is mentally fit. Doctors say Pinochet suffers from failing health, but
Garzon argues that under British and Spanish law, physical ailments are not
enough to prevent someone from standing trial.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Suffer Heavy Losses  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombian rebels suffered their heaviest losses in
months over the weekend as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited the
war-torn South American nation to promote a huge military and economic aid
package.
</P>
<P>
	   Gains by drug-financed rebels have made Colombia the Western Hemisphere's
No. 1 security threat in the eyes of U.S. officials. But as the weekend fighting
showed, a battlefield turnaround may already be taking place.
</P>
<P>
	   The military claims 44 guerrillas were killed Saturday when ground troops
and helicopter gunships repelled a rebel assault on a town 30 miles southeast of
the capital, Bogota. Six soldiers and police died, as well as eight civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Several wounded guerrillas surrendered and television images showed a slain
comrade being carried out of the battle zone, his hands and feet tied to a
branch. It was the highest rebel death toll since hundreds of guerrilla fighters
died in a nationwide offensive last July.
</P>
<P>
	   Separate fighting raged Monday in northern Bolivar state, where at least 13
guerrillas have been killed, armed services chief Gen. Fernando Tapias told
reporters. Rebel bombings of power lines also left Colombia's second-largest
city, Medellin, without power for several hours in the morning.
</P>
<P>
	   While gunfire rattled the Andean mountain town of Guayabetal on Saturday,
Albright was meeting with President Andres Pastrana in a Caribbean port hundreds
of miles away.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, who also stopped in Panama and Mexico on a three-day Latin America
tour, discussed a proposed $1.6 billion emergency aid package for Colombia, the
source of 80 percent of the world's cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   The aid plan, which must be approved by Congress, is earmarked for fighting
narcotics, not guerrillas. But most of the money will pay for helicopters and
training for two new army battalions that will push into southern jungles where
the rebels are heavily involved in the cocaine trade.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials admit privately they hope the anti-narcotics aid will also
help level the military playing field and even pressure the rebels in peace
talks. The weekend's fighting was the heaviest since a year-end truce expired a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Rich from taxing the drug trade, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC, has become more powerful than ever in recent years, killing hundreds of
police and soldiers in large-scale assaults. The 15,000-member group became the
dominant force in a third of the country and took on an air of invincibility.
</P>
<P>
	   But in recent months, Colombia's armed forces have dealt the biggest blows.
</P>
<P>
	   Reporters shuttled to battle zones have been shown hundreds of dead
guerrillas, the first time in years the military has backed up frequent claims
of heavy FARC casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Improved intelligence and air power are the key factors in the turnaround,
officials and analysts agree. Most of the rebels, including some this weekend,
were killed when helicopters and fighter planes strafed retreating guerrilla
columns.
</P>
<P>
	   Army officials gave credit Saturday to a new ``rapid reaction force''
composed of 4,000 elite troops backed by fighter planes and helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
	   While Colombia's military has fared better, the 15,000-member rebel group
remains a potent threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of FARC fighters overran a marine base near the Panamanian border
last month, killing 23 soldiers in one of the military's worst defeats in
months. Rains kept the rapid reaction force from arriving in time to stop the
slaughter, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Cold keeps MLK celebration inside but doesn't stop it  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - It may have been cold outside but spirits were
warmed on the inside all around upstate New York, as people everywhere
celebrated Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of equality and nonviolence.
<P>
	   "Forget about the weather outside," Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings said Monday
during the program in the Empire State Plaza Convention Center. "It's warm in
here."
</P>
<P>
	   The frigidly-cold weather in Albany - the wind chill factor at noon was -45
degrees - forced planners to cancel a march to the Martin Luther King Monument
at Albany's Lincoln Park.
</P>
<P>
	   But no one seemed to mind after inspirational songs by the Empire State King
Interdenominational Mass Choir and the Empire State Youth Orchestra, as well as
an impassioned lecture from the Rev. Calvin Butts III, pastor of the Abyssinian
Baptist Church in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Butts, who also is the president of the State University of New York at Old
Westbury, praised King, saying "the marching feet of his nonviolent army shook
the foundations of America."
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a prophet to the nation, saying that we will live together as
brothers and sisters or we will perish apart as fools," Butts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue, the highest-ranking state official at the program,
urged people to make every day a celebration of Martin Luther King's dream of
equality and civil rights. "The key is action now, today and every day," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue also accepted on behalf of the state a small crystal Martin Luther
King Jr. monument donated by Steuben Glass and the New York Power Authority. The
monument will "remind us of the past and guide us to the future," Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
	   The monument will be placed in the Empire State Plaza later this year, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone was celebrating this day, however. Members of the Center For
Law &AMP; Justice protested outside the Empire State Convention Center during the
program, trying to call attention to the growing number of prisoners being
denied parole in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Alice Green, the center's executive director, wants legislative hearings on
the state's prison systems. She says the prisons are steadily getting worse for
inmates and officials are denying inmates a chance at parole to keep a steady
low-paid work force for the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters carried signs saying "Dr. King was a prisoner too," "Parole
justice" and "Prisoners have families too." and chanted "We are Family."
</P>
<P>
	   "If George Pataki is serious about Martin Luther King Day, then he would
listen to what these people have to say," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Green saw no conflict in holding protests on Martin Luther King Jr. Day,
saying peaceful protests - not acceptance of the status quo - are what Dr. King
espoused.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not here to sing and dance for the white people," Green said. "That's
what they want us to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Justyn Glowinski, an 11-year-old boy shopping in the Walden Galleria Mall in
Cheektowaga, N.Y., had his own interpretation of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "At my school there was a play on Friday about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
and maybe if he didn't live there wouldn't be black kids at my school," he said.
"And maybe we couldn't use the bathroom in the mall together."
</P>
<P>
	   Others questioned whether they should even have to think about Monday as
anything but another day off. "I mean, you don't sit around thinking about what
George Washington did when you get out of school for his birthday," said Kiesha
Moore, 15. "But I guess maybe I think about MLK a lot of days anyway, so I don't
need a day off to."
</P>
<P>
	   That kind of attitude bothers Denise Thomas, who was also in the mall.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very important day, but maybe kids should be in school today," she
said. "You know, learning about what the 60's meant to black Americans. They
aren't learning about Dr. King by shopping today. In school, maybe they would."
</P>
<P>
	   In Utica, a luncheon and awards ceremony were held along with an evening
march and memorial service at Hope Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolyn Bradley was on pins and needles in anticipation. "We were raised to
look for the good in people, not the bad," said Bradley, who met King after he
gave a speech in Kingstree, S.C., in the early 1960s. "We had a lot of love
instilled in us."
</P>
<P>
	   Growing up in the South, the 47-year-old Bradley can remember a time when
she wasn't able to play at white children's homes. But in her house, it was
different.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't have white friends, black friends," she said. "We had friends. I
tried to instill in my kids the same things."

<HEADLINE> Russian Jets Raid Mountain Villages  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KURCHALOI, Russia (AP) -- Federal forces bombarded roads and footpaths in
Chechnya's southern mountains on Monday, trying to prevent rebel raids into
Russian-controlled villages, while acting President Vladimir Putin appealed to
European human rights leaders to see Russia's side in the war.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian airplanes and artillery pummeled the region of Vedeno, a rebel
stronghold deep in the mountains, about 35 miles south of the capital Grozny.
Troops also took three settlements in the region, the Interfax news agency said,
citing military sources.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Russian reconnaissance reports, rebels are active in the region
and are planning to storm Russian-held villages. The federal forces want to
prevent any repeat of the raids on three Russian-controlled towns earlier this
month, which cast doubts on the military's reports of success in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops in the region were jumpy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the Chechens come today, we'll be easily defeated,'' said Alexei
Migulin, a Russian soldier in the village of Kurchaloi. He said that the 150
troops in the village had enough ammunition to last only 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent troops into Chechnya in September to crush Islamic rebels who
had staged armed incursions into neighboring Dagestan and are blamed for
apartment house bombings that killed about 300 people.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, Putin and other senior Russian officials met for more than three
hours with a delegation from the 41-nation Council of Europe, the continent's
highest human rights body. He urged that it ``base its position not on
propaganda materials but on the real situation, facts and trustworthy
information.''
</P>
<P>
	   The delegation was setting out on a fact-finding mission in preparation for
a special debate on Jan. 27 over the war in Chechnya. Some council members have
suggested that Russia's membership should be suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   The leader of the delegation, Lord Russel-Johnston, said he had expressed
the council's opposition to the war to Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want a cease-fire, we want negotiations, we want the intolerable
situation with refugees to be stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin said that he wanted to see a quick end to the war, but that the
Russians had no serious negotiating partners from the Chechen side,
Russel-Johnston told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin also agreed in principle that international human rights observers
should be allowed to operate in Chechnya, and that Russia would be willing to
accept such observers in Ingushetia, a region bordering on the breakaway
republic, Russel-Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
	   The military reported Monday there had been more than 110 air raids on
Chechnya in the past 24 hours, and that more than 80 rebels had been killed. The
Defense Ministry said that over the same period, two soldiers had been killed
and five wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Jets strafed several villages at the entrance to the strategic Argun gorge,
which leads through the rebel-held mountains to Georgia. The military said that
the raids had hit five rebel bases in the mountains and created avalanches to
block mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal aircraft also targeted the Chechen capital Grozny, where ground
troops have advanced cautiously to avoid the heavy losses suffered in the
1994-96 Chechen campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian forces prevented at least six rebel attempts to break out of the
city, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In the southwestern Urus-Martan region, Russian troops opened fire Monday on
a bus carrying refugees, killing the driver and three passengers, eyewitnesses
said. It was not known what had prompted the shooting, but Nikolai Koshman, the
Kremlin's top political representative in Chechnya, vowed the perpetrators would
be punished.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As soon as we find out who did this, they will be shot and killed in
public,'' Koshman said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Adjourns Ex-Premier's Hearing  </HEADLINE>
   By ZAHID HUSSAIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- The hearing into allegations of treason and
hijacking against deposed Premier Nawaz Sharif was adjourned Monday, giving
defense attorneys an extra day to prepare their case.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge ordered Sharif to return to court on Tuesday, along with his six
codefendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Rehmet Hussein Jaffri adjourned the hearing after Sharif's lawyers
said they were still waiting for a recording of conversations that occurred Oct.
12 in the control tower of the Karachi International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Oct. 12 was the day of the military coup that overthrew Sharif. That day,
the army alleges, Sharif refused to let an aircraft carrying army chief Gen.
Pervez Musharraf land in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
	   Barely seven minutes of fuel remained when the aircraft finally landed.
After seizing power, the army placed Sharif in protective custody and later
accused him of trying to kill Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharif has denied the allegation, and so far no formal charges have been
filed. It was not clear whether charges would be filed Tuesday, but once they
are filed and a trial begins, it must be completed within seven days.
</P>
<P>
	   Musharraf, who is leading the country's military regime, has said he will
restore civilian rule only after he revives the battered economy and introduces
political reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, China pledged unwavering support for Pakistan, giving a boost
to Musharraf on his first visit to a non-Islamic state since taking charge.
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji promised his government will nurture the nations'
``comprehensive partnership,'' China's Xinhua News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   China has been a loyal ally of Pakistan for decades, seeing it as a useful
counterbalance to India's regional dominance. China has refrained from publicly
criticizing the coup and has said Sharif's trial was Pakistan's internal affair.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, tensions continued between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pakistan Foreign Ministry said Monday that Sunday's arrest of a junior
employee at the Indian Embassy is proof that India is sponsoring terrorism in
Pakistan. The employee, identified as P. Moses, allegedly had an explosive
device. The Foreign Ministry said Moses admitted the bomb was to be detonated in
a congested bazaar.
</P>
<P>
	   India denied the allegation and demanded Moses be released.
</P>
<P>
	   Since last month's hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane, the troubled
relations between India and Pakistan have plummeted. India has accused Pakistan
of orchestrating the hijacking. Pakistan denies the charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Musharraf was quoted by one of India's principal newspapers, The Hindu, as
saying that no progress will be made if India repeats assertions that Pakistan
harbors terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I may add,'' Musharraf said, ``that I am not one of those that when you
keep receiving all this kind of flak from across the border, I keep sitting and
I turn my other cheek.''

<HEADLINE> Ben-&AMP;-Jerry's Sale Opposed  </HEADLINE>
    By ROSS SNEYD AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- In a bid to keep Ben &AMP; Jerry's independent and
socially active, some franchisees of the gourmet ice cream company are
pressuring its board to abandon plans to sell the company.
</P>
<P>
	   But they also want to send a message to any suitor: "If by some miracle you
are able to take us over, we're not changing. You have to change," said Michael
Garrett, who owns four Ben &AMP; Jerry's stores in Connecticut and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc., known for serving flavors like Rainforest
Crunch and embracing the liberal causes of the former hippies who founded the
business, revealed last month that it was being courted.
</P>
<P>
	   Reflecting the near-cult status that has grown up around the company, a
number of grassroots campaigns have since cropped up, all sharing a common
thread -- a desire that Ben &AMP; Jerry's consider more than just the financial
impact on its shareholders when it evaluates a takeover bid. They want the
company also to consider how a sale would affect its corporate culture, its
customers and the communities where it operates.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ben &AMP; Jerry's was a groundbreaker in raising consciousness that capital
can, in fact, be caring," said Judy Wicks, owner of the White Dog Cafe in
Philadelphia and a proponent of socially responsible business practices.
</P>
<P>
	   She's also helping a group calling itself the Coalition to Save Ben &AMP;
Jerry's to organize a series of rallies across the country next week to generate
support for Ben &AMP; Jerry's remaining independent.
</P>
<P>
	   Rallies are planned outside Ben &AMP; Jerry's scoop shops in New York,
Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, Montreal and Baltimore. Arrangements
are being made for rallies in Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides that, a majority of the 206 Ben &AMP; Jerry's franchise stores are
encouraging customers to send postcards to the company's board members urging
them to reject any takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
	   There are two Web sites dedicated to Ben &AMP; Jerry's independence.
</P>
<P>
	   An independence rally was held outside the company's flagship store in
Burlington last month. Gov. Howard Dean has practically declared the company a
symbol of the state it calls home.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ben &AMP; Jerry's is a signature company for Vermont," he said. "It is like
maple syrup. Ben &AMP; Jerry's has probably done more to market Vermont than any
company in the last 20 years."
</P>
<P>
	   But it's much more than marketing that creates such a loyal following for
the manufacturer of super premium ice creams, frozen yogurts, sorbets and other
frozen foods. It's the notion of corporate social responsibility that Ben Cohen
and Jerry Greenfield made a cornerstone of their business.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only does Ben &AMP; Jerry's donate 7.5 percent of its pretax profits to
charity, it maintains a so-called double bottom line dedicated to earning a
profit and promoting social good, such as buying its milk from small family
farms or its nuts from sustainable farms in the South American rainforests.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was Ben &AMP; Jerry's, Ben specifically, that came up with the concept of
the double bottom line," Wicks said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were the teachers and they have been teachers and continue to be
teachers in influencing hundreds of thousands of businesses throught the world
that business can serve the common good and not just the financial interests of
businesses and stockholders," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   That -- in addition to funky ice cream flavors such as Cherry Garcia and
Wavy Gravy -- are what has drawn thousands to buy stock in Ben &AMP; Jerry's and to
sell its products.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got into this business 12 years ago and, truly, that's why I got into
it," Garrett said. "I could have gotten a Haagen-Dazs franchise."
</P>
<P>
	   Garrett wouldn't lose his franchises if Ben &AMP; Jerry's was sold, but said
he's worried about losing the identity of the business.
</P>
<P>
	   People who love our ice cream love the fact that there really is a Ben and
there really is a Jerry," he said. "They don't want to see their heroes selling
out."
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's may be able to take advantage of a change in Vermont corporate
law that allows companies to consider the interests of its employees, suppliers,
creditors, customers and the economy of the state in deciding a takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear whether that's being weighed by directors. The company has
declined to comment since the takeover overtures were disclosed and has not
identified the suitor. Greenfield, reached at home Monday, said Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations prevented him from discussing board
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't say anything about this," Greenfield said. "No decisions have been
made; no implications should be drawn."

<HEADLINE> Weyerhaeuser;s 100th Birthday Tues.  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- In 1900, German immigrant and businessman
Frederick Weyerhaeuser bought 900,000 acres of prime timberland in the rugged
mountains of Washington state, leftovers from the Great Western Railroad.
</P>
<P>
	   A century later, the company that bears his name is one of the largest
lumber and forest products companies in the world, expanding heavily into the
Pacific Rim and boasting the latest technology.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, as the company prepares to celebrate its first 100 years in business on
Tuesday, this could be the most competitive time in Weyerhaeuser Co.'s history.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are so many innovations that affect what we do," said George
Weyerhaeuser Jr, Frederick's great-great-grandson and the company's senior vice
president of technology. "Will online news threaten our newsprint business? Will
more houses be built with concrete instead of lumber?"
</P>
<P>
	   The challenges of the 21st century are not lost on George Weyerhaeuser Jr.,
who declined the traditional family leadership roles in the company to focus on
technologies that will help the company compete.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have been fascinated with the technology side of the business," he said.
"How our society gets its materials is going to change, and we want to be part
of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Frederick Weyerhaeuser started the company in Tacoma with a team of 11
investors, three employees and a $6 million investment in timberland. Today, now
based in Federal Way, Weyerhaeuser Co. has 45,000 employees in 13 countries.
Revenues last year totaled nearly $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The family business was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1963 -- the
same year it opened its first office in Japan. In 1964, it began operating in
Europe. In 1984, it opened an office in China, where a box plant in Shanghai now
makes containers for Coca-Cola and Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've positioned ourselves to be the forest products purveyor to the
Pacific Rim," said George Weyerhaeuser.
</P>
<P>
	   That position is key, because other companies around the globe have stepped
up their acquisitions and competition. Foreign companies -- once thought to be
second-tier competitors best left to their own markets -- have grown
considerably, even as Weyerhaeuser Co. has itself expanded overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now have very large, very effective international competitors," George
Weyerhaeuser said. "If we take our customers for granted, they can muscle right
in."
</P>
<P>
	   The nature of the business has changed as well. While Weyerhaeuser has
continued to grow its core business -- forestry, lumber and basic wood products
-- it has also made key acquisitions and spent $80 million on research last year
alone to develop the next generation of engineered products.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of potential in carbon-based products," George Weyerhaeuser
said, noting the recent development of plastics based on organic materials like
corn. "They are renewable, they're powered by the sun, and they're benign
environmentally. That's a very intriguing combination for us."
</P>
<P>
	   The recent acquisition of Trus Joist Co. gives Weyerhaeuser strong inroads
into the engineered wood products market. By combining traditional lumber with
chemical and physical processes, the company can make stronger building
materials using less actual lumber.
</P>
<P>
	   George Weyerhaeuser said that kind of innovation will help the company in
the near future, but added that his great-great-grandfather would be more amazed
by the level of communication and cooperation that helps run the company today.
</P>
<P>
	   "Back when Frederick started the company, you basically sent your best, most
trustworthy person out to essentially run things for you," he said. "You trusted
them to pretty much run everything. I think the biggest surprise to him would be
in how we coordinate and communicate and use computers to tie everything
together."

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court To Weigh 'Bubble' Law  </HEADLINE>
   By AARON J. LOPEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- The morning calm on a tree-lined residential street is
pierced as sign-carrying protesters shout at women entering an abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an office of death! Don't kill your baby! Do you know what you're
doing?'' they yell from eight feet away at women partially shielded by a 4-foot
brick wall outside the Planned Parenthood clinic.
</P>
<P>
	   It is a scene dictated by Colorado's 1993 ``bubble'' law, which requires
protesters to keep their distance from patients entering health-care facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the law
legally protects patients from harassment and intimidation or violates the
protesters' right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision could establish guidelines for other states and cities that
have grappled with ways to maintain peace between protesters and women seeking
abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The state of Colorado argues that the law balances free-speech rights with
the right to access to health care. The Legislature passed the law after hearing
patients complain of being spat on, kicked and harassed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's all right to protest. That's fine, but when it gets down to
intervening with another person's recognized right, the Legislature felt obliged
to step in,'' said Deputy Attorney General Ken Lane.
</P>
<P>
	   James Henderson of the Virginia-based American Center for Law and Justice,
which represents the protesters, counters that the law tramples on free-speech
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My way of sidewalk counseling is to be gentle and to be compassionate.
Colorado's way is to put me so far away I have to scream and yell,'' Jeanne
Hill, one of three protesters challenging the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Around the country, some cities have tried creating buffer zones between
protesters and clinic patients, and between protesters and churches. Others have
required protesters to obtain permits for demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have laws that prohibit
protesters from blocking clinic entrances, said Elizabeth Arndorfer, an attorney
with the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colorado law bars people from counseling, distributing leaflets or
displaying signs within eight feet of others without their consent. The
protective bubble is maintained within 100 feet of an entrance to a health-care
facility. Violators can get up to six months in jail and a $750 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the three protesters at the center of the case was arrested under
the law. Colorado Senate Minority Leader Mike Feeley, a Democrat who sponsored
the legislation, said no one at all has been arrested since it was enacted.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Supreme Court returned the case to Colorado's state courts in 1997
to reconsider it in wake of the high court's decision in a New York case. In
that case, the high court allowed abortion protesters to confront patients on
public sidewalks as long as they stayed at least 15 feet from the clinic's
entrance.
</P>
<P>
	   A Colorado appeals court again upheld the law, noting it was enacted by
lawmakers, while the New York case involved a judge's injunction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colorado Supreme Court also voted last year to uphold the state law,
citing ``greater deference for legislative enactments regulating speech.'' It
also drew a distinction between buffer zones of 15 feet and eight feet, ruling
that the smaller buffer zone allows for ``normal conversational tones.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ellen Brilliant of Planned Parenthood of the Rockies said the mere threat of
prosecution has made a noticeable improvement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have seen clients shoved. I've seen staff pushed,'' Ms. Brilliant said.
``With the bubble law, protesters still can say what they want to say and
clients are able to access health care free from harassment and intimidation.''

technologies that will help the company compete.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have been fascinated with the technology side of the business," he said.
"How our society gets its materials is going to change, and we want to be part
of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Frederick Weyerhaeuser started the company in Tacoma with a team of 11
investors, three employees and a $6 million investment in timberland. Today, now
based in Federal Way, Weyerhaeuser Co. has 45,000 employees in 13 countries.
Revenues last year totaled nearly $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The family business was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1963 -- the
same year it opened its first office in Japan. In 1964, it began operating in
Europe. In 1984, it opened an office in China, where a box plant in Shanghai now
makes containers for Coca-Cola and Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've positioned ourselves to be the forest products purveyor to the
Pacific Rim," said George Weyerhaeuser.
</P>
<P>
	   That position is key, because other companies around the globe have stepped
up their acquisitions and competition. Foreign companies -- once thought to be
second-tier competitors best left to their own markets -- have grown
considerably, even as Weyerhaeuser Co. has itself expanded overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now have very large, very effective international competitors," George
Weyerhaeuser said. "If we take our customers for granted, they can muscle right
in."
</P>
<P>
	   The nature of the business has changed as well. While Weyerhaeuser has
continued to grow its core business -- forestry, lumber and basic wood products
-- it has also made key acquisitions and spent $80 million on research last year
alone to develop the next generation of engineered products.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of potential in carbon-based products," George Weyerhaeuser
said, noting the recent development of plastics based on organic materials like
corn. "They are renewable, they're powered by the sun, and they're benign
environmentally. That's a very intriguing combination for us."
</P>
<P>
	   The recent acquisition of Trus Joist Co. gives Weyerhaeuser strong inroads
into the engineered wood products market. By combining traditional lumber with
chemical and physical processes, the company can make stronger building
materials using less actual lumber.
</P>
<P>
	   George Weyerhaeuser said that kind of innovation will help the company in
the near future, but added that his great-great-grandfather would be more amazed
by the level of communication and cooperation that helps run the company today.
</P>
<P>
	   "Back when Frederick started the company, you basically sent your best, most
trustworthy person out to essentially run things for you," he said. "You trusted
them to pretty much run everything. I think the biggest surprise to him would be
in how we coordinate and communicate and use computers to tie everything
together."

ice cream company are pressuring its board to abandon plans to sell

``If by some miracle you are able to take us over, we're not

	   Mannesmann Shuffles Management
</P>
<P>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- The embattled telecommunications
company Mannesmann AG shuffled its top management today, an
expected change in preparation of the spinoff of its engineering
and automotive unit. Albert Weismuller will become chief financial
officer, taking over from Joachim Rauhut, who will head Mannesmann
Engineering and Automotive, a division that is to be split off from
the company's telecom operations. Hermann Reith, an analyst with
BHF Bank in Frankfurt, said the personnel changes are unrelated to
the hostile, $137 billion takeover bid by British rival Vodafone
AirTouch PLC. Mannesmann has also set up a new group management
board in charge of overseeing its recent acquisitions, such as the
British telecommunications company Orange PLC. Mannesmann shares
were up 6.4 percent in Frankfurt trading at $278 a share Monday.

<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Glaxo Wellcome's planned acquisition of rival
drugmaker SmithKline Beecham would do more than create the world's
largest pharmaceutical company. The deal, announced today and worth
about $76 billion in stock, is a clear sign that the merger trend
now reshaping other industries is accelerating in the
still-fragmented drug business. Just last week, Pfizer emerged as
the likely winner in a battle with American Home Products for U.S.
drugmaker Warner-Lambert, while Monsanto is in the process of
merging with Pharmacia and Upjohn. Industry analysts predict other
blue-chip names, including Eli Lilly, Schering Plough, Novartis,
Bristol-Myers Squibb and even merger-averse Merck, won't be far

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Europe's largest software company,
Germany's SAP AG, is asking shareholders to vote at a special
meeting tomorrow on a stock plan that gives management the option
to buy company shares at a set price in the future, a rare move for
a German company its size. The proposal, disparaged by critics as
``plain vanilla'' for its relative simplicity, is aimed at stemming
a flow of nearly 50 top level employees who have left its
U.S.-based unit over the last year for competitors with more
generous stock offerings. But it also bucks a growing trend in
Germany that ties employee incentives and bonuses more closely to
actual stock performance and stays away from stock options.

Japan's central bank left its monetary policy unchanged, a move
that also boosted the yen against the dollar. European markets were
modestly higher as investors debated the merits of a $76 billion
merger in the pharmaceutical industry. U.S. financial markets were
closed today in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In Japan,
the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average rose 480.68 points, or 2.54

higher despite some mixed reactions to the latest round of
corporate mergers. Shares of drug companies were mostly lower
following the announcement of the merger agreement between British

	   Weyerhaeuser Reacheing 100 Years
</P>
<P>
	   FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- In 1900, German immigrant and
businessman Frederick Weyerhaeuser bought 900,000 acres of prime
timberland in the rugged mountains of Washington state, leftovers
from the Great Western Railroad. A century later, the company that
bears his name is one of the largest lumber and forest products
companies in the world, expanding heavily into the Pacific Rim and
boasting the latest technology. Yet, as the company prepares to
celebrate its first 100 years in business tomorrow, this could be
the most competitive time in Weyerhaeuser Co.'s history. George
Weyerhaeuser Jr, Frederick's great-great-grandson and the company's
senior vice president of technology, points out such challenges as
whether online news threaten the company's newsprint business or
whether more houses will be built with concrete instead of lumber.

<HEADLINE> Drug Mergers Threaten Competition  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- As drug companies rush to merge, worries are surfacing that
a shrinking number of industry titans will dominate the treatment of major
health problems, leading to higher prices for consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "As competition goes down, there is a concern from a pricing perspective,"
said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, president of the Public Health Research Group, a
Washington, D.C-based consumer advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, two British drugmakers, Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham
agreed to merge, forming the world's largest pharmaceutical firm. Additionally,
Pfizer Inc. and Warner-Lambert Co. are negotiating a merger deal, and Pharmacia
&AMP; Upjohn Inc. is trying to finalize its purchase of Monsanto Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug companies insist mergers are good for consumers because they boost the
surviving companies' ability to do research, which can increase the odds of
developing new medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry also argues that competition is keen because even the largest
companies hold a relatively small share of the total market for drugs. The
combined Glaxo SmithKline, for instance, will hold less than 8 percent of the
world market.
</P>
<P>
	   However, in many of the major drug classifications, one company does
dominate.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, Schering-Plough, maker of Claritin, controls 40 percent of
market for allergy-fighting medicines. Glaxo Wellcome controls 46 percent of
market for anti-migraine drugs and Warner-Lambert controls 48 percent of the
market for cholesterol-lowering drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo SmithKline, as the new company will be called, will dominate the
market for drugs for asthma, AIDS, migraines and vaccines. It will also have a
huge lead in sales of antiviral pills used to treat herpes and shingles.
</P>
<P>
	   Further industry consolidation poses the risk that a small group of
companies will dominate treatment of the major diseases and set prices as they
please, critics argue.
</P>
<P>
	   Counterbalancing this concern are managed care companies, which often demand
deep discounts from drugmakers and won't cover those drugs they consider too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher drug prices, though, are only one concern as the drug industry
consolidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry observers note that as companies get bigger, they will have the
clout to push out smaller competitors that don't have the money to effectively
market their medicines to physicians and consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, while big drug companies devote billions annually in search for new
medicines, they are less likely to research drugs that don't have large sales
potential. That could hurt efforts to develop new drugs for rare diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say the gargantuan-size companies will also be less likely to
develop so called "me too" drugs that act similarly to existing drugs. That
because such drugs are less likely to turn into blockbusters, said Sergio
Traversa of Mehta Partners.
</P>
<P>
	   That can be bad for consumers too because some "me too" drugs end up being
more effective than their predecessors. One example is Warner-Lambert's
cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor. While it was the fourth drug in its class,
Lipitor is more effective than others and is now the biggest selling
anticholesterol drug in the United States.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Selects Iraq Weapons Inspector  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After a difficult search for a candidate to head the
new Iraq weapons inspection agency, the U.N. chief announced his choice Monday:
Rolf Ekeus, the same man who led the old inspection agency for six years.
</P>
<P>
	   In picking the Swedish diplomat, Secretary-General Kofi Annan overrode
Russian and Chinese objections and set up a likely confrontation with Baghdad.
Iraq immediately questioned the nomination, saying it amounted to putting ``old
wine in new bottles.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can they appoint a new commission and then name its former head to
lead it?'' Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters after a meeting
in Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus was the first executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission, which
was created in 1991 in the aftermath of Persian Gulf War to rid Iraq of its
weapons of mass destruction. He stepped down in 1997 to become Sweden's
ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   While his successor, Richard Butler of Australia, incurred the wrath of the
Iraqis during his tumultuous two-year term, Ekeus too was harshly criticized by
the Baghdad leadership, particularly towards the end of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
	   Aziz on Monday accused Ekeus of deliberately prolonging U.N. trade sanctions
imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. He said the Swedish diplomat
allowed inspectors to spy on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
	   Aziz, however, did not say whether or not Iraq would cooperate with Ekeus if
his nomination is approved.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia and China had told Annan on Friday that they opposed nominating Ekeus
for the new agency, called the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission, or UNMOVIC. They argued that Ekeus would not be acceptable to Iraq.
France also indicated it preferred other candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't immediately clear if the three nations would block Annan's
nomination or allow it to be approved. Under normal procedures for U.N.
appointments, a mission has 24 hours to formally object to a nomination.
Otherwise, it is automatically accepted.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus is retiring as U.S. ambassador this summer and had been expected to
take up a five-year post to be chairman of the governing board of the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   The new inspection agency, UNMOVIC, was formed in December to replace
UNSCOM, which pulled out of Baghdad in December, 1998, ahead of U.S. and British
airstrikes. Iraq has said UNSCOM inspectors cannot return.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan named Ekeus after a difficult monthlong search for a candidate who
would be agreeable to all members of the Security Council. After a Sunday
deadline passed without consensus, Annan wrote to the president of the council,
Richard Holbrooke of the United States, that he had ``come to the conclusion
that Ambassador Rolf Ekeus of Sweden should be appointed executive chairman of
UNMOVIC.''
</P>
<P>
	   Annan considered other candidates -- including Brazil's former U.N.
ambassador, Celso Amorim; and Finland's ambassador to Israel and Cyprus, Pasi
Patokallio -- in a bid to ensure unanimous support. Spokesman Fred Eckhard said
the secretary-general had exhausted his search without success.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over 30 days, he raised something like 25 names and he could not find one
on which all could agree. So he put forward the name of the person he thought
best for the job,'' Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus' tenure as chief U.N. inspector was marked by several important
developments, including the uncovering of Iraq's biological weapons program.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ekeus also raised eyebrows at the United Nations when he cut a deal with
the Iraqis to gain access to so-called ``sensitive sites'' in 1996, setting up
special procedures for access that weren't called for in U.N. resolutions. Some
at the United Nations believe that deal was the first step in UNSCOM's downfall,
setting the stage for future Iraqi attempts to prevent or complicate inspectors'
access to certain sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Ekeus was known to be Annan's top choice from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   At a December press conference, Annan outlined his dream candidate for the
job, telling reporters he wanted someone who knew disarmament, had good
judgement and people skills and who could be firm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In effect, I'll probably be looking for somebody like Rolf Ekeus,'' Annan
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel-Syria Negotiations Postponed  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a stunning setback, the Clinton administration was
forced Monday to call off scheduled peace talks between Israel and Syria amid
sharp disagreement between the two sides over a projected Israeli pullback on
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and senior U.S. mediator Dennis Ross
telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa of Syria looking for a way to move ahead. Announcement of the
indefinite suspension came from Jerusalem, where Barak had been preparing to
return to Shepherdstown, W.Va., for the second round of talks this month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it isn't comfortable for the Syrians to come now, and they need some
time, they should take the time,'' Barak said. ``We will come when there are
discussions, and the delay, if in fact it is agreed on, does not bother us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Having agreed last week to resume the talks Wednesday, Syria hesitated over
the weekend. Syrian officials were frustrated that the negotiations had not met
their territorial demands -- a promised pullback by Israel from all the
strategic borderline plateau.
</P>
<P>
	   Disclosure via an Israeli leak that Syria had offered Israel diplomatic
relations as well as arrangements on trade, tourism and transportation may have
contributed to the Syrian frustration.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the weekend, statements emanated from Syria and Lebanon that indicated
President Hafez Assad's government was reconsidering whether to proceed to
another round.
</P>
<P>
	   In Damascus, an informed Syrian source said Monday that Syria had not
suggested the delay. Rather, al-Sharaa concluded from telephone conversations
with Albright that Israel was not serious, said the source, who insisted on
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Sharaa told Albright, with whom he spoke Saturday as well as Monday, the
Syrians would not participate in a third round until the Israelis were prepared
to demarcate a new border at lines that existed prior to the Six-Day War in
1967, the source said.
</P>
<P>
	   When Israel decides to go back to the table to do that, the source said,
then there will be another meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Had the United States insisted on going ahead with the talks Wednesday, they
would have been held, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the two sides in sharp disagreement on how to proceed, each wanting
his priority demands dealt with first, the outlook for progress was not bright.
</P>
<P>
	   For Syria, that demand is recovery of all of the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured in the 1967 war. Since then, the high ground has served as a border
buffer. Around 18,000 Jewish settlers live on the plateau, operating small
businesses, wineries and farms.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria is insisting on recovery of territory all the way to the Sea of
Galilee, Israel's water storehouse. This includes patches of land it captured in
the 1950s, then lost in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel and Syria each agreed to send two experts to Washington to nibble
away at issues that are not central to land-for-peace negotiations. After that,
the administration will decide how to proceed, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   In a carefully worded statement, Albright blamed neither side for the
postponement but said their approaches differed to a U.S.-prepared document that
the Americans hoped would form a basis for an accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, before the talks were postponed, Clinton sounded an
optimistic note.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The good news is, I'm convinced that both still want to do it,'' he said
during a Martin Luther King Jr. Day appearance. ``And they are not as far apart
as they might be. They're not as far apart as they have been.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Israel's chief rabbis ruled in Jerusalem that the Golan Heights is
part of the biblical land of Israel, a decision that could influence Israel's
Orthodox Jews to vote against returning it.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Chief Rabbinical Council did not conclude that Jewish law
forbids Israel to give up the Golan Heights for peace. Many rabbis have
concluded peace has the highest priority.

<HEADLINE> Governor adds voice to those calling on Wallingford to honor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) - As more than 400 Wallingford residents
attended an annual service Monday honoring Martin Luther King Jr., Gov. John G.
Rowland pledged his support for legislation that would force town officials to
recognize the holiday.
<P>
	   Wallingford is the only municipality in the state that does not close town
offices on the holiday, despite 1986 legislation that made Martin Luther King
Day a state holiday. The town's policy has drawn sharp criticism from civil
rights leaders, politicians and some residents.
</P>
<P>
	   State Rep. Mary Mushinsky, a Democrat from Wallingford, has proposed
legislation that would force the town to recognize the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor stepped up the pressure on Wallingford officials Monday by
issuing a statement formally supporting Mushinsky's legislation, which would
require all cities and towns to close their offices on King Day.
</P>
<P>
	   "There should be no doubt in anyone's mind that the state of Connecticut,
and each one of its cities and towns, recognizes Dr. King's contributions to our
country. Every town should observe the Martin Luther King holiday by closing
government offices for the day," Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
	   As Rowland was issuing his statement, more than 400 people gathered in St.
Paul's Episcopal Church for an annual service honoring King. They sang "We Shall
Overcome," read from King's speeches and lit white candles to symbolize King's
preaching of non-violence.
</P>
<P>
	   But outside, just before the service began, a man dressed in a black Ku Klux
Klan hood and robe stood near the front steps of the church. The man told
reporters he is a member of "The Invisible Empire," a division of the Klan. He
had a minor confrontation with a man who yelled at him and then walked away.
</P>
<P>
	   Security at the church was tight because of recent Klan activity in town and
a phone call police received Monday morning telling them that Klansmen would
attend the church service.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten members of a special police tactical unit were stationed at various
spots inside and around the church, as well as in buildings near the church. In
addition, two uniformed police officers were stationed inside the church and
another three were outside.
</P>
<P>
	   Town employees were encouraged to attend the service on their lunch hour.
Civil rights leaders from various parts of the state also attended. Some
criticized the town for refusing to make King Day an official town holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's pathetic," said Roland Cockfield, president of the
Meriden-Wallingford chapter of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
	   "George Washington has his holiday as founder of the nation. Martin Luther
King was founder of freedom and peace. I think he should get the same
recognition," Cockfield said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor William Dickinson, who is at the center of the controversy, also
attended the service. Dickinson said the controversy is not about race, but
instead a dispute between himself and the town's labor unions. Dickinson wants
town workers to swap another holiday for King Day, instead of closing town
offices and giving workers a 13th paid holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor said he would not consider changing his position, despite the
governor's statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "My position is rooted in firm principle in honoring Dr. King and his
message, which is what we're doing today," he said. "The issue is not one of
racism at all. It's an issue of benefits for unions."
</P>
<P>
	   Police Chief Douglas Dortenzio said a man called police Monday morning and
said he and other Klan members planned to try to enter the church service
dressed in Klan robes.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was told by police that he would not be welcome inside this building and
that he would be arrested if he did try to come in," Dortenzio said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, three men, including one in a crimson Klan robe, shouted at cars.
The two other men put on white robes and hoods when police questioned them, but
then disbanded.
</P>
<P>
	   Peggy Raczkovy, 81, who has lived in Wallingford since 1941, has attended
the church service every year since the town started it 11 years ago. She said
she feels divided on the issue, just as the town is.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can see the mayor's point of view, but I feel bad about the effect it's
had on the town. It reflects badly on the whole town," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Superintendent of Schools Joseph Cirasuolo, who also attended the
service, said he agreed with the mayor's stance.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the town unions felt as strongly about this as they claim, the solution
is very easy - all they have to do is swap holidays," said Cirasuolo.
</P>
<P>
	   "What they're trying to do is get an additional holiday and trying to put
enough pressure on the town to get that."

<HEADLINE> Protests, Speeches Mark MLK Jr. Day  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Decrying the Confederate flag as a symbol of slavery
and racism, nearly 50,000 people marched to South Carolina's Statehouse on
Martin Luther King Day to demand the banner be taken down.
</P>
<P>
	   They also said the slain civil rights leader should be honored with a
permanent state holiday. South Carolina state workers now can take off on the
King holiday or another of their choice, including one of several tied to
Confederate anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The flag is coming down today,'' marchers sang as they walked six blocks
from a downtown church to the Statehouse. Some carried signs reading, ``Your
heritage is my slavery.''
</P>
<P>
	   Across the country, Americans remembered the slain civil rights leader
Monday with marches and speeches urging the nation to commit itself to King's
principles and fulfill his dream of racial harmony and equality.
</P>
<P>
	   This was the first year that the King holiday was observed in some form in
all 50 states, and the 15th year it has been celebrated as a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Atlanta, Vice President Al Gore joined King's widow, Coretta Scott King,
and other family members in placing two wreaths at King's grave. King, who was
assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968, would have been 71 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today, nearly 32 years after we lost him, we still need Martin Luther King
Jr. more than ever,'' Gore said from the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church,
where King served as pastor during the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Martin, where are you now? `We shall overcome' needs to be more than just
a look into our past, but a way to find the resolve to find the true America we
know we can be at last.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton helped paint a community computer center in Washington.
``Every time you give a little, you always get more back,'' Clinton said.
``Let's remember that as Dr. King's enduring legacy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among the celebrations elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Operation Hope, a community group in New Orleans, honored King by
offering $50 for guns, no questions asked. The group said the weapons would be
turned over to police to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Several hundred people of many different races marched in Rochester,
Minn., where the Rev. Jesse Jackson was the featured speaker. Seven-year-old
Naava Johnson came to the march with her grandmother. If King had never been
born, the little girl said, ``We'd still be slaves.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber was cast as President Kennedy in a play about
King's life at Willamette University in Salem, Ore. Frank Thompson, assistant
director of the Corrections Department, got the role of King.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Several hundred people marched through downtown Memphis to Claiborne
Temple, where King held strategy meetings while leading a sanitation workers'
strike in his final days.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In Arizona, which in 1992 became the only state to establish the holiday
by popular vote, 5,000 people gathered in a park to celebrate after a march
through downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone used the occasion to celebrate King. In Oneonta, Ala., a group
blocked from flying the Confederate flag at the courthouse brought its own pole
and did it anyway, to honor Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's birthday, which is
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody wants to talk about Martin Luther King, and we're tired of it.
We want them to talk about our hero,'' said Benjamin Hestley, commander of the
38-member St. Clair Camp 308 of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   At the South Carolina rally against the flag, state police estimated the
crowd at 46,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Frederick C. James, a retired African Methodist Episcopal bishop, said he
was reminded of marching with King in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were just about as sure in 1963 that we were going to be victorious
with the civil rights law, which was enacted in 1964, as we are now that this
flag will come down off of that Statehouse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A few white marchers joined the mostly black crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Margaret Abbott, 59, wore her grandmother's Daughters of Confederate
Veterans certificate around her neck. She said her ancestors fought in the Civil
and Revolutionary wars so she could have freedom of choice, and she wants the
flag removed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a lot more important things to do than fight over this stupid
flag,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is waging a
tourism boycott against South Carolina over the flag. Many marchers from out of
state honored the boycott by sleeping Sunday night on cots in church basements
instead of checking into hotels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the kind of thing we need to be doing on Martin Luther King's
birthday,'' Martin Luther King III, King's son, said at a prayer breakfast.
``The flag is a terrible symbol that brings a lot of negative energy. And while
we believe the flag has an appropriate place, it just does not belong on top of
the Capitol because it is not a sign of unification.''
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina raised the flag in 1962 during the Civil War centennial, and
it flies atop the Statehouse along with the U.S. and state flags.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters say the banner is a symbol of the state's heritage and honors
Confederate soldiers killed in the Civil War. More than 6,000 Confederate flag
supporters marched a week ago at the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Only South Carolina's Legislature can lower the flag.
</P>
<P>
	   While South Carolina is the only state still flying the flag from its
Capitol, Georgia incorporated the symbol into its state flag in 1956.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition now wants tourists to boycott Georgia until
the emblem is removed. Activists are threatening to begin the boycott on Jan.
30, the day the Super Bowl will be held in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Hold Secret Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HADERA, Israel (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat held a secret meeting Monday night just hours after a pipe
bomb suspected of being aimed at derailing the peace process injured 22
Israelis, most of them only slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting came as Palestinians were accusing Israel of reneging on its
commitments by postponing a West Bank troop withdrawal, due to have taken place
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told Israel TV the meeting was aimed at
pushing the peace process forward. The two leaders were to have met later this
week in Washington, but Barak canceled his trip following Monday's postponement
of peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Israel Radio reported that Barak was asking Arafat for a
two-month delay in reaching a framework agreement for a final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   The sides had agreed to develop a framework agreement by Feb. 13. Barak aide
Gadi Baltiansky said that Israel hoped to meet the February deadline, but that
``if not, we'll reach an agreement with them (the Palestinians) for something
else.''
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's meeting at an undisclosed site demonstrated both leaders'
commitment to negotiations despite the pipe bomb attack in the northern Israeli
city of Hadera. Police officials said the blast was probably carried out by
Islamic militants who hope to derail the peace process, although the largest
hard-line Muslim group, Hamas, denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   A small, little-known Lebanese group, Omar Mukhtar, claimed responsibility
for the blast in a fax sent to Lebanese state-run television. However, Israeli
police said they had no information that the group was involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite quick condemnation of the attack by Arafat's Palestinian Authority,
opponents of the peace process were quick to use the bombing to rally opposition
for the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel cannot run negotiations under threat and under intimidation,''
opposition legislator Ruby Rivlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak said the attack would not affect peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are a strong people, very tough,'' he said. ``We understand the
missions before us, and no type of terror will break our spirit.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians have been frustrated with the progress of the talks and
were infuriated Monday when Barak postponed a withdrawal from the West Bank that
had been scheduled for Thursday. Barak said he needed the three-week delay to
focus on the Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal was to be one of the last interim withdrawals before final
peace treaty negotiations start next month. The Palestinians hoped it meant
Israeli forces would leave three Arab suburbs of Jerusalem, claimed by both
sides as their capital. But Barak insisted the suburbs would not be part of the
next withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Israeli officials tried to soothe Palestinian anger, saying the talks
were progressing according to plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is natural that there should be disagreements, but this is not a
crisis,'' Foreign Minister David Levy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak won elections in May promising to revive the Palestinian and Syrian
peace processes, which were frozen for three years by his hard-line
predecessors. He pledges to have agreements in place this year. Troubles on both
fronts -- Barak postponed talks with the Syrians on Monday -- make that seem
increasingly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   In the placid, tree-lined town of Hadera, the blast left residents feeling
that peace, whatever its dimensions, would not remove the threat of terror.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that we must have peace, but in the meantime everyone must look
around and be aware,'' said Eliran Assaf, a university student who shoved his
wife and daughter inside a bank when he heard the blast.
</P>
<P>
	   Alastair Meir, a 75-year-old Polish-born Holocaust survivor treated for
shock, said he refused to let such attacks rattle him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The trash can blew up right next to the bench where I was sitting,'' he
said, sitting up in his hospital bed. ``I sit there every day, and I'll keep on
sitting there, because it's the best spot in Hadera.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. woman who saved kids from London crash recuperating after  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - It happened so fast that all Ursula Webster could
do was shove her 8-year-old son as hard as she could out of the path of the
oncoming car.
<P>
	   She recalls the thud as the vehicle struck her, sending her flying into the
air outside the London residence of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
	   "As I was going up, I'm thinking, 'I'm dying, this is it, my life is
ending,' and I could actually feel my bones breaking," she said Monday in a
telephone interview from her hospital bed. "But when I hit the ground and was
still conscious, I knew it wasn't nearly that bad."
</P>
<P>
	   The British tabloids are hailing the Livingston woman as "The Heroine of
Downing Street" for saving her son from the speeding car that crashed into the
gates outside 10 Downing Street on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   She, her husband David and their three sons were there sightseeing because
they have virtually the same address in Livingston - 10 Downing Place.
</P>
<P>
	   Webster was in satisfactory condition Monday evening at St. Barnabas Medical
Center in Livingston following a 73-minute operation that inserted a
33-centimeter (13.2-inch) stainless steel rod in her lower right leg to
stabilize a broken bone, the tibia, said her surgeon, Dr. Michael H. Rieber.
</P>
<P>
	   "She was awake the whole time, just a little sedated so she doesn't have to
hear all the noise," Rieber said. "Everything went very smoothly."
</P>
<P>
	   The noise came from drilling holes for screws, and from reaming the bone so
the rod would fit, he said. The bone was broken in one place, but some bone was
shattered, so the rod was needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At Mrs. Webster's request, the surgeon played Bruce Springsteen music during
the operation.
</P>
<P>
	   She faces four to six months of rehabilitation after the surgery, she said,
and she predicted it would be difficult with three active children.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I keep thinking this could have been so much worse," she said. "We
could have been killed."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Webster said she and her family approached police officers at the
gates, explained that they lived at the same address in New Jersey and asked for
and received permission to go inside the ornate protective gates to take
photographs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have the same door knocker on our house as the one at 10 Downing Street,
and we thought it would be neat to take a picture of it," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was as they were walking back out and thanking the police officers that
the accident happened, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The car skidded and went straight at the gates," said Sertac Bahri, 19, who
witnessed the accident. "As that was happening a woman tried to push her child
so he didn't get hurt. She saved the kid, but she didn't save herself."
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew was brushed by the door of the red Vauxhall Astra and her 6
1/2-year-old son Alex was grazed by the car's wing mirror, but neither was
seriously hurt. Her 3 1/2-year-old son Peter and her husband were not struck.
</P>
<P>
	   "It happened so fast that we were in complete shock," Webster said. "There
was no time to be afraid. We're all very luck we weren't killed."
</P>
<P>
	   London police filed charges Sunday against the driver of the car. Stephen
Bonnett, 26, an engineer from Chelmsford, east of London, was charged with
causing grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonnett was granted bail at a five-minute hearing Monday and ordered to
return to court Jan. 31 to face the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear whether he is suspected of deliberately
crashing into the gates or whether he simply lost control of the car.
</P>
<P>
	   Webster said she suspects it was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
	   "My husband saw him after the crash, and he said he had this crazy look on
his face," she said. "I think maybe he had something against" Blair or the
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair and his family were at the British prime minister's country residence,
Chequers at the time. Blair has asked to be kept informed of Mrs. Webster's
condition and would be writing to her, aides said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Police shot and killed a suspected Islamic militant
and detained two others in a shootout Monday in a residential Istanbul
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Police had raided the home where the shootout occurred as part of an
investigation into the kidnappings of seven businessmen. The kidnappings are
attributed to an Islamic Kurdish group, Istanbul Police Chief Hasan Ozdemir
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the three suspected militants armed with automatic weapons opened
fire first, injuring one policeman in the hand. The militants stayed barricaded
in the apartment for nearly five hours, exchanging fire with scores of policemen
in flak jackets, before police stormed the hide-out, Ozdemir said.
</P>
<P>
	   Snipers were positioned on top of nearby buildings and police sealed off
roads leading to the neighborhood. The two suspects who were detained were taken
to an antiterrorism unit for questioning, the Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, police decided to intensify their crackdown on the Kurdish
group, which calls itself Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   The group is believed to be responsible for hundreds of killings in the
predominantly Kurdish southeast during the past few years. Like the far more
powerful PKK Kurdish rebels, Hezbollah took up arms in 1984. But unlike the PKK,
Hezbollah has not carried out any major attacks against Turkish targets.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announcing New Gun Program  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is taking a new tack in the fight
against gun violence by asking Congress for more ATF agents and support for a
system to track firearms through ballistics tests, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The president was to announce the program Tuesday in Boston. The appearance
at the Orchard Gardens Community Center in Boston's Roxbury section also was
expected to highlight Clinton's community policing initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   After a spate of high-profile shooting attacks by troubled killers at high
schools and other places, Clinton pushed for tougher gun-control measures in
Congress. Lawmakers refused to close the gun show loophole in the Brady law or
require safety locks on handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   Outlining plans for his final year in office, Clinton last week alluded to
new projects aimed at curbing gun violence. The administration already announced
a request for $10 million to develop ``smart guns'' that fire only when held by
their owners.
</P>
<P>
	   The new plans for the budget for fiscal year 2001, which begins Oct. 1,
represent an effort to invest more in enforcement of laws aimed at combating the
illegal use and possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
	   People familiar with Clinton's plan, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he would ask Congress to hire more Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
agents and for money to improve federal investigators' ability to track crimes
through improved ballistics testing. The officials were unable to provide dollar
amounts of the requests.
</P>
<P>
	   By maintaining records of unique markings each gun barrel leaves on bullets,
investigators could track firearms used in crimes to their purchasers, even if
that person had passed the weapon to another individual.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I want us to do is to put our partisan divisions aside to complete
the unfinished business of the last century,'' Clinton said, ``including things
like ... sensible legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and
children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Boston's homicide rate dropped to a 38-year low in 1999, thanks in part to a
program that allied law enforcement, the clergy, community leaders and gang
members against crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort, called the Boston Pilot Project, is credited with forcing the
homicide toll down from 132 slayings in 1990 to 31 in 1999. A strong economy and
declining use of crack cocaine also contributed to improved neighborhood
security.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Thomas Menino and Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, both
Democrats, and several religious and community leaders were expected to attend
the address at the Orchard Gardens, in an area where crime was down more than 65
percent last year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In his Roxbury appearance, Clinton also was expected to stress the success
of his 1994 crime-fighting package, which provided money for 100,000 community
police officers. The fiscal 2000 budget includes funds for 50,000 more.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Tuesday, Clinton was addressing a Democratic National Committee
fund-raising reception at a private residence in a Boston suburb.

<HEADLINE> Celtic-Style Musician Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARGAREE HARBOUR, Nova Scotia (AP) -- John Morris Rankin, a member of the
musical family that helped popularize Cape Breton-style Celtic music, was killed
when his truck ran off a road into the ocean. He was 40.
</P>
<P>
	   Rankin died Sunday while driving his son and two other teen-agers to a
morning hockey game, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. The three youths
were all rescued unharmed from the frigid ocean water off Nova Scotia in eastern
Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Rankin played fiddle and piano with his four siblings in groups known first
as The Rankin Family and then the Rankins. Their music drew from the strong
traditional Celtic roots of Cape Breton island, a part of Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
	   Over a decade that began with appearances at county fairs, the group sold
more than 2 million records and won five Juno Awards, the Canadian equivalent of
the Grammy. The Rankins broke up last summer so members could pursue independent
careers.
</P>
<P>
	   Rankin is survived by his wife, Sally, and two children, along with his
musical siblings Jimmy, Cookie, Raylene and Heather. A funeral was planned for
Thursday in Mabou, Nova Scotia.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- In his latest undercover expedition, Jordan's boyish
king disguised himself in old clothes and slipped out of his hilltop Amman
palace on Monday to find out about the hospital services offered to ordinary
Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the fourth time since his ascension to the throne nearly a year ago
that King Abdullah II has left his palace in disguise to try to find out what
life is really like for the people of his Arab kingdom.
</P>
<P>
	   On the previous occasions, he posed as a television reporter, a taxi driver
and an old man.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, Abdullah, 37, was dressed in old clothes and a traditional Arab
headdress draped across his face, according to Royal Palace officials who asked
not to be named. His destination was a government hospital in the northeastern
city of Zarqa, where he made inquiries about services provided to patients, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The king-in-disguise ploy recalls the populist touch of King Hussein,
Abdullah's father and predecessor, who often mingled with his subjects. But
Hussein's disguises were usually no more elaborate than the end of a headdress
draped across his bearded face.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdullah's forays have combined secrecy with a deft touch for publicity.
They are also the actions of a man who was never groomed to be king: He became
crown prince only days before his father's death in February last year,
replacing his uncle, Prince Hassan, who had been the heir-designate for decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Palace officials said they didn't even know Abdullah had gone out until he
returned and told them about his day. He offered few details of what exactly he
posed as, saying he wanted to keep it secret because he may use the same
disguise again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He got firsthand information on the services provided at the Zarqa
Government Hospital,'' one official said. ``His finding is that the hospital is
poorly managed and its services are unsatisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the king spent two hours Monday afternoon watching patients standing
in long queues to see doctors. Many of the doctors had not shown up for work.

<HEADLINE> Rally Targets S.C. Confederate Flag  </HEADLINE>
   By DAN LEWERENZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Hundreds of out-of-state visitors who came to rally
against the Confederate flag flying atop South Carolina's Statehouse snubbed
hotels and slept in churches to support the NAACP's tourism boycott of the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 46,000 people converged on the Statehouse on Monday for the
march and rally. But the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People tourism boycott that started Jan. 1 left few hotel rooms filled.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodney Jenkins said 150 visitors from Maryland ate and slept at Bethel
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Columbia, where he is a trustee. About 200
more stayed at Benedict College or at other churches, some sleeping on cots.
</P>
<P>
	   Jenkins said blacks in other states might not have to live under the
Confederate flag's shadow, but ``we have common causes. Across this nation,
black folks have the same problems, whether it be a flag, whether it be job
discrimination or housing. We are as one.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harris Sable, manager of the downtown Governor's House Hotel, said only a
few visitors stayed there. ``There's a very small handful -- I mean, maybe
there's four, if that,'' Sable said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those on a bus from Tennessee would not spend a penny in South Carolina,
said 16-year-old Melissa Hudson of Memphis. They brought their own food and
would sleep on the bus, she said. They bought fuel before crossing the state
line -- enough gas to get to Columbia and out of the state before they have to
fill up again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to support a state that flies that flag,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sable said his hotel has had $20,000 to $25,000 worth of cancellations since
the boycott was announced in July, and has lost an unknown amount of potential
business.
</P>
<P>
	   Not all businesses suffered. A cool, windy morning led to a brisk business
in warm beverages and lunchtime lines stretched to the sidewalk at restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They just kept buying hot chocolate after hot chocolate, cappuccino,
coffee,'' said Amanda Maybin of the Atlanta Bread Company, who said the downtown
restaurant served about 200 more customers Monday than on a typical weekday.
``Considering there was nobody working downtown, we had a pretty busy day.''

<HEADLINE> Man nabbed at border could be daring getaway robber  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A phony passport and a sword was all it took for border
officials to deny a man access from Buffalo into Canada. The real surprise came
later, when U.S. Customs officials learned the man may be wanted in New York for
a series of knifepoint robberies and a daredevil escape from a high-rise.
<P>
	   Now the NYPD is investigating whether the 21-year-old man - who goes by the
names Jaquan Muhammad and Nastali Triplett - may have used the sword he was
found with to kill a Brooklyn resident Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Monday the accused had "personal notes" with him detailing the crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, no charges have been filed against the man, whose real identity has
not been revealed by police. He was flown back from Buffalo Monday afternoon -
escorted by several NYPD detectives - and taken in for further questioning, said
Deputy Chief Tom Fahey, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were investigating whether the man was responsible for at least eight
knifepoint robberies since Jan. 8 in midtown Manhattan. The robber fooled police
Jan. 11 after he ran into a high-rise building, jumped out a 19th floor window
onto an air conditioning unit on a nearby rooftop, disguised himself as a food
delivery person and blended into the lunchtime crowd to escape.
</P>
<P>
	   After that getaway, police declared all-out war by splashing a sketch of the
robber all over the news. One tabloid newspaper even dubbed him "Spiderman."
</P>
<P>
	   Did the notoriety send the robber out of town? That remains to be seen,
police say. But a police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, believes
the publicity spooked the robber, prompting him to hop a Greyhound bus Sunday
for Buffalo in hopes of fleeing the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   At the border Sunday, a man on a bus at the Peace Bridge crossing was denied
access into Canada, said Janet Rapaport, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Customs
Service in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   He was allegedly sporting a phony passport, had a sword and was carrying a
6-inch dagger and a 12-inch hunting knife.
</P>
<P>
	   Into the arms of waiting Customs officials he went. A check of the man's
personal effects proved interesting. He had several documents with various names
of them, said the federal official.
</P>
<P>
	   "And personal notes he had indicated he was wanted by the NYPD," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Once in a holding cell in Buffalo, the man allegedly tried to get away
again, this time by crawling into a ceiling space after he knocked down some
tiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in New York, police were scheduling lineups, hoping a victim or witness
to the recent robberies might link the would-be border crosser to the crimes in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   Lineups could begin as early as Tuesday, police said.

<HEADLINE> Syria Restless on Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SEVAREID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- In the United States, Syria's foreign minister
handles negotiations with Israel. But the minister is more of a messenger for
President Hafez Assad, the real decision-maker, who is sitting out the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad is a master negotiator of the subtle variety, reclusive and indirect.
What he wants his citizens or the outside world to know is relayed through
feelers, leaks or the state-run media. And what he has been leaking of late
indicates he may want to readjust the course of negotiations to focus on Syria's
key concern -- the return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel announced Monday that the third round of talks, which had been set to
open Wednesday in the United States, had been indefinitely postponed following
hints Syria wanted a delay. Syria has indicated it expects talks will resume
soon, though neither side has said how soon.
</P>
<P>
	   By sending signals of wariness, Assad appears to be trying to pressure the
Americans and Israelis. At the same time, Syrians have been suspicious that
Barak may use Cabinet crises, opinion polls and rallies against a Golan
withdrawal to force Syrian concessions. Neither side wants to appear to be
giving up too much too easily.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria accuses Israel of wanting to focus only on side issues, not what
Damascus sees as the crux of the problem -- setting a new border.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel seized the Golan Heights border plateau from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war. When Assad agreed last year to resume negotiations after a 3 1/2-year
freeze, he insisted that for talks to begin, there had to be an understanding
Syria would get back the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria has made clear that other matters can be negotiated after an agreement
on the Golan. But before drawing any boundaries, Israel wants to know what sort
of security guarantees and relations it will get in return.
</P>
<P>
	   At the last round of talks, the committee dealing with border issues met
formally only once. A U.S. working document leaked to an Israeli newspaper
indicated wide gaps remain on border and security questions. But it suggested
the two sides were much closer to answers Israel is looking for on the nature of
future relations.
</P>
<P>
	   The document, considered merely a basis for future talks, cites no
differences in positions on exchanging ambassadors, promoting bilateral trade
and tourism and opening borders.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria's anger over the leaks was clear. The state-controlled Syrian
newspaper Al-Thawra accused Israel of leaking the document, perhaps ``to kill
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
	   A pro-Syrian Lebanese newspaper responded with what it says were Syrian
amendments to the document. The amendments emphasized Syrian steadfastness,
calling for a complete Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 border and the removal of
Israeli settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   Editorials in state-run Syrian newspapers since the second round of talks
adjourned Jan. 10 in Shepherdstown, W.Va., repeatedly have called negotiations
thus far a failure.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, though, Middle East analyst Yezid Sayigh said, games played by
both sides during day-to-day negotiations are largely for domestic consumption
and mean little in the overall picture.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know what's on the table. We all know what the final deal has to look
like more or less. And the rest is playing games,'' Sayigh, of the International
Center for Strategic Studies, said in a telephone interview from his London
office.

<HEADLINE> Glaxo Is Buying SmithKline Beecham  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Glaxo Wellcome's planned acquisition of rival drugmaker
SmithKline Beecham would do more than create the world's largest pharmaceutical
company.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, announced Monday and worth about $76 billion in stock, is a clear
sign that the merger trend now reshaping other industries is accelerating in the
still-fragmented drug business.
</P>
<P>
	   Just last week, Pfizer emerged as the likely winner in a battle with
American Home Products for U.S. drugmaker Warner-Lambert, while Monsanto is in
the process of merging with Pharmacia and Upjohn. Industry analysts predict
other blue-chip names, including Eli Lilly, Schering Plough, Novartis,
Bristol-Myers Squibb and even merger-averse Merck, won't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that eventually about six to 10 companies will own the
pharmaceutical market," said Hemant Shah, an independent industry analyst based
in Warren, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, the pharmaceutical business still has many competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the combined Glaxo and SmithKline would control just 7.3 percent of
global sales, although it would dominate the markets for asthma, AIDS, migraines
and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say that consolidations are gathering momentum because drugmakers
are pinched between the ballooning costs of developing new drugs and the demands
of investors and shareholders that they deliver double-digit growth in profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Only by bulking up to pool research and development funds and by slashing
costs can pharmaceutical firms avoid financial peril in an ever more Darwinian
market.
</P>
<P>
	   "To succeed in this industry, you must be top-tier, and preferably, you must
have market leadership," Glaxo Wellcome chairman Sir Richard Sykes told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham said their union would yield $1.6
billion in annual savings after three years. They said job cuts were expected,
but that they were still deciding where to make them.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of both companies fell on the London Stock Exchange Monday as some
investors took profits following a runup Friday when the companies announced
they were in talks. In addition, some analysts said they were disappointed in
the cost savings predicted by the companies. Glaxo fell nearly 5 percent while
SmithKline fell 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The two British-based companies plan to keep their corporate headquarters in
London, but open a new operational headquarters in or near New York.
</P>
<P>
	   They would keep their U.S. businesses separate. SmithKline has a research
and development unit based in Philadelphia and a non-prescription drug business
in Pittsburgh. Glaxo's American operations are headquartered in Research
Triangle Park, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Their union comes two years after previous merger talks collapsed in a fight
over which executives would run the company
</P>
<P>
	   The apparent success of Pfizer's hostile bid for Warner-Lambert gave new
impetus to the idea, said Kevin Wilson, an industry analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pfizer-Warner-Lambert has acted as a catalyst," he said. "I could easily
imagine them saying, 'Look, this is a good idea. We might as well get on with it
now.' "
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo SmithKline would have worldwide pharmaceutical sales of an estimated
$15 billion, based on 1998 annual figures. But a combined Pfizer-Warner-Lambert
would be close behind with a 6.7 percent market share, and it would be gaining
fast, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products -- the apparent loser in the fight for Warner-Lambert
-- has failed three times to combine with other drug companies and looks like an
increasingly attractive takeover target for a European company such as Bayer
that might be aiming to expand its U.S. pharmaceuticals business, said Andy
Penman, an analyst at London brokerage Greig Middleton.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Merck, which has publicly sworn off mergers in the past, might have its
hand forced if it wants to keep up with more financially powerful rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question that Merck is the best in the business in terms of
developing new drugs, but it's going to be very difficult to compete when there
are companies with R and D budgets that are twice that of Merck," said Shah, the
New Jersey-based analyst.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's strength lies in its top anti-migraine drug, Imitrex, and in
treatments for asthma and viral infections, including HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline's top products include the antibiotic Augmentin, the
antidepressant Paxil and a new diabetes drug, Avandia. It also has a strong
vaccines business.
</P>
<P>
	   But both firms are feeling pressure because their top drugs are facing
expiration of their patents, allowing cheaper generics into the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's leading ulcer drug Zantac lost its patent protection in 1997, and
SmithKline's lucrative Augmentin will lose its patent in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Socialist Wins Chile Election  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Fresh from his narrow election victory,
President-elect Ricardo Lagos on Monday promised to fulfill his campaign pledges
to speed up economic recovery and curb crime.
</P>
<P>
	   He stressed his appeals for national unity to tackle Chile's problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos is Chile's first socialist elected president since Salvador Allende,
the leader who was toppled in the bloody 1973 coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
The new president-elect was a leading Pinochet opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos won Sunday's election at the helm of the ruling center-left coalition,
Concertacion. The coalition, made up of two socialist groups and the Christian
Democratic Party of outgoing President Eduardo Frei, has governed since the end
of the Pinochet regime in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he is a socialist, Lagos does not endorse Allende's radical brand
of Marxism.
</P>
<P>
	   The 61-year-old president-elect is committed to maintaining the free market
economic policies first implemented by Pinochet. But ``we have to have greater
social concerns and state policies that correct the inequalities produced by the
market,'' he told Radio Cooperativa of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
	   While Allende appears a distant figure for Lagos, Pinochet and the legacy of
his regime linger ominously close.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet, 84, was arrested in London in October 1998 on a warrant from a
Spanish judge who wants to try him for human rights abuses during his regime.
But last week, Britain said Pinochet is too ill to stand trial -- thus opening
the way for his likely early return home, an event that could prove complex for
the new president.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the British announcement, demands have grown to put Pinochet on trial
in Chile. Lagos' victory speech Sunday was interrupted by the crowd chanting,
``Trial to Pinochet.'' Lagos replied that it is for judges, not the president,
to decide who should be tried.
</P>
<P>
	   He went back to the subject Monday, but not in detail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The country has open wounds from the past and we are going to do our best
to heal those wounds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people died or disappeared
after Pinochet's coup. But it is widely believed that a trial of Pinochet would
be complicated. The armed forces and much of the country's political right still
offer firm support to their former leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, Lagos visited a rehabilitation center for young drug addicts
and said he will ``work with all sectors'' to face problems as Chile emerges
from a deep recession with unemployment at more than 9 percent. He said his
``main priority will be creating jobs with more dignity for Chileans.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also repeated his other priorities: curbing crime and improving health,
education and housing services, especially for the needy.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington on Monday, President Clinton congratulated Lagos and the
Chilean people for holding an election that was ``a model of civic
participation.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I look forward to working with President-elect Lagos and to deepening the
friendship and cooperation that have characterized the excellent relations
between our two nations,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Joaquin Lavin, the rightist rival Lagos narrowly defeated Sunday in a runoff
vote, said he is prepared to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wish him the greatest success,'' said Lavin, who won about 49 percent of
the vote to Lagos' 51 percent. ``He can always count on me for help.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Concertacion coalition holds a majority in Chile's lower house of
congress, but the right controls the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Democrats Hold Edge Over GOP  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Private Republican polling shows Democrats hold an edge
on top election-year concerns, and 25 percent of George W. Bush's support
``prefers Democrats on the issues by a significant margin.''
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats were favored, 44 percent to 31 percent, when the survey asked
potential voters which party cares more about them, according to the poll shown
recently to about 50 GOP members of the House.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the findings suggested several ways for House Republicans
to gain an advantage, including opening a ``new issue front'' on such subjects
as government waste or retiring the national debt. The GOP is trying to retain
its narrow majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP leadership has already announced plans to highlight those issues in
the congressional session beginning next week. In particular, Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., is expected to unveil portions of a national debt retirement
plan before the opening gavel falls in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey material was presented at a two-day communications meeting this
month organized near the Capitol by Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, who ranks
fourth in the House GOP leadership. An estimated 55 Republicans attended the
sessions, which also included a workshop conducted by Wade West, a media trainer
who specializes in preparing individuals for media interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll was conducted for Securing America's Future for Everyone (SAFE), an
organization Watts set up to assist him in his leadership post. A copy of the
survey findings was obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings underscore the challenges ahead for the House Republicans --
even with presidential front-runner Bush showing strongly in the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey recommended that the House GOP target its election-year efforts
at Catholic voters; so-called ``soccer moms,'' or suburban women; and voters
making $100,000 and above, as well as independents and moderates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They've got to connect ideology to solving problems. That's their
mission,'' said David Winston of the Fabrizio McLaughlin firm, which conducted
the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey, the results of 1,000 interviews conducted in November, found
Republicans must make a greater effort to develop their ``brand,'' much as any
organization must do as it competes for market share.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet on three of the top five issues, as identified by potential voters,
Democrats hold an edge. They lead on education, the top-ranked issue, by 16
percentage points; on health care by an even bigger margin; and strongly on
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans are favored by a wide margin on moral values. As for handling
the economy, support for Republicans vs. Democrats was within the survey's
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   On six other issues tested, which the voters defined as less important,
Republicans hold a narrow advantage on taxes and a more substantial edge on
foreign policy and defense as well as on crime and drugs. Democrats are favored
on Medicare and the environment. Campaign finance was a virtual draw.
</P>
<P>
	   The margins for Democrats were ``much higher'' than for the GOP, the poll
found.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was favored in a hypothetical matchup with Vice President Al Gore, but
25 percent of his supporters identified themselves more closely with Democrats
than Republicans on the issues. On average, those voters said they preferred
Democrats on roughly five of the 11 issues, and backed the Republican position
on roughly three.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters who identified themselves as regular Republican voters, on the other
hand, leaned toward Republicans on an average of 7.8 of the 11 issues, and
toward the Democrats on only 1.6.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, the findings reported, ''25 percent of Bush's vote prefers Democrats
on the issues by a significant margin.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, undecided voters tend to favor the Democratic positions on the
issues.
</P>
<P>
	   On education, despite a Democratic advantage of 48 percent to 32 percent,
the survey reported that voters would prefer a candidate who espouses a GOP
position of providing better education by giving local schools the flexibility
to hire new teachers, buy new books, provide better training, buy computers and
repair classrooms. The poll did not address the school voucher issue.

<HEADLINE> Favorite Sons in Iowa Campaign Ads  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iowa airwaves are filled with ads featuring hometown
senators Tom Harkin and Charles Grassley, though neither man is on the ballot.
They're vouching for Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   As voting nears, the presidential candidates are trotting out high-profile
supporters in TV and radio ads, and are hoping voters will follow their lead.
</P>
<P>
	   So in South Carolina, popular Rep. Lindsey Graham stars in an endorsement
for Republican Sen. John McCain. In New Hampshire, liberal icon Edward Kennedy
invites voters to stand with him for Gore. And when Barbara Bush goes to New
Hampshire this week, her son's campaign will have cameras rolling, ready to beam
her to TV sets across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The governor's family is a tremendous asset in this campaign,'' said Mark
McKinnon, media strategist for the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Endorsement ads are usually used as campaigns near an end -- the Iowa
caucuses are next week, followed by the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1. -- with
popular homestate officials reassuring voters that so-and-so will be good for
their state.
</P>
<P>
	   Harkin tells Iowans that Gore will be good for farmers and Graham tells
South Carolinians that McCain will restore honor to the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are a way of signaling that people who have the best interests of the
state at heart and have been elected by the citizens of the state believe it
would be in the state's interest to vote for this candidate,'' said Kathleen
Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University
of Pennsylvania, who studies political advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   That's just what Harkin, who has been campaigning for Gore, aims to do in
his radio and television ads airing now in Iowa ahead of the Jan. 24 caucuses.
He sends a message: I trust him; you can too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's always nice to have someone in the White House who understands people
who live in rural states like Iowa,'' Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, the Bush campaign recruited Grassley, Iowa's other senator, for
radio ads airing now that respond to critical ads by Bush rival Steve Forbes.
``If you're tired of mudslinging and name calling, go to the caucuses Monday,
January 24th, and join me in voting for a fresh start for America by voting for
George W. Bush,'' Grassley says.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time Grassley was on the ballot, he pulled 72 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   There are no plans to use Bush's father, the former president, in
advertising, though his mother may show up in an ad later this week. The
campaign is filming moments from the New Hampshire campaign trail and turning
them into quick-hit ads for the following day. Mrs. Bush, who remains popular
across the country, is a likely subject, McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the campaign has not taped a full-fledged ad featuring Bush's parents,
and that makes sense, Jamieson said. ``It raises the question, 'Is he running in
his own right, or is he running by virtue of being the heir apparent?''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ads must be used strategically or they can backfire. Well-known politicians
also have detractors among the electorate, and a candidate doesn't want to
inherent any ill will. So while Kennedy is adored by many New England Democrats,
New Hampshire is a conservative state, and Gore's campaign is using him only on
radio. That allows the campaign to target the ads to communities where Kennedy
is likely to be well received.
</P>
<P>
	   There's little peril for McCain by featuring Graham in his ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham is popular in South Carolina, where he was hailed for the role he
played as a prosecutor during President Clinton's impeachment trial. He knows
his state, and was itching to talk about honor when he taped his radio and
television endorsements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain is the polar opposite of Bill Clinton,'' Graham says in a
radio ad now airing. ``He has absolute total character and candor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Democrat Bill Bradley is also trading on his endorsements. He featured a
trio of senators who endorsed him in his first ad. He now has Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York in TV ads in Iowa and New Hampshire, as Bradley
tries to motivate his supporters to go and vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's ads normally end with the tag line: ``It can happen,'' suggesting
there's reason to believe in his long-shot bid. But the Moynihan ad ads a line:
``It can happen,'' the screen reads, ``if you go to caucus on January 24.''

<HEADLINE> Women Lead Music Awards Nominees  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Country star Shania Twain, soul singer Whitney Houston
and teen newcomer Britney Spears were among the favorites going into Monday
night's American Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
	   The three led the field with three nomination each. And all three were in
the running for favorite pop-rock female artist at the 27th annual awards show,
scheduled to air on ABC from the Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
	   Twain was also nominated in the country female and adult contemporary artist
categories. Houston was nominated for female artist and album for "My Love Is
Your Love" in the soul-rhythm and blues categories. Spears was up for favorite
pop-rock new artist and pop-rock album for "... Baby One More Time."
</P>
<P>
	   Houston was departing for Europe on Monday night or Tuesday and did not plan
on attending the show, awards spokesman Paul Shefrin said. He said her absence
was unrelated to an incident in Hawaii last week, when airport security guards
said they found about half an ounce of marijuana in her bag but she boarded her
flight before police arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest incarnation of guitarist Carlos Santana's band had two
nominations for his commercial comeback album "Supernatural." In the pop-rock
categories, Santana was nominated for favorite album and favorite band, duo or
group.
</P>
<P>
	   Other nominees for pop-rock band, duo or group were the Backstreet Boys and
'N Sync. The pop-rock male artist nominees were Lenny Kravitz, Ricky Martin and
Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Santana and Spears' albums, the Backstreet Boys' "Millennium" was up
for favorite pop-rock album.
</P>
<P>
	   The nominees were chosen by music industry representatives. The winners were
decided by about 20,000 music fans nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides awards in 20 regular categories, the show was to feature results of
an Internet poll on listeners' favorite musical artists for each decade from the
1950s through the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Performers scheduled to appear on the three-hour show included Kravitz,
Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, the Eurythmics and Enrique Iglesias. Comedian
Norm Macdonald was tapped to be host.

<HEADLINE> Houston May Face Drug Charges  </HEADLINE>
    By JEAN CHRISTENSEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONOLULU (AP) -- Authorities are weighing whether to file drug charges
against pop star Whitney Houston, who allegedly was found with half an ounce of
marijuana at an airport security checkpoint but boarded her flight before police
arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawaii County Prosecutor Jay Kimura said he would wait for the results of a
police investigation before deciding whether to charge the 36-year-old singer.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the most likely charge would be promoting a detrimental drug, an
offense punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   Kimura said his office typically does not pursue mainland suspects who are
charged with petty misdemeanors such as marijuana possession. But he said
Houston could be served with a summons if she ever returns to the islands and
could be arrested if she ignores the summons.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston was stopped Jan. 11 at a security checkpoint at Keahole-Kona
International Airport while on her way to board a United Airlines flight to San
Francisco. The airport is on the island of Hawaii, 167 miles southeast of
Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
	   During a search of her bag, a security officer allegedly found the marijuana
and seized the bag. Airport security officers, who can only arrest passengers
for crimes related to airport security, told her to stay with them until police
arrived, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Houston left the scene and boarded her flight, which departed about a
half hour before police arrived, Big Island police spokesman William Donham said
Monday. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald of Hilo reported that her husband, Bobby
Brown, was traveling with her.
</P>
<P>
	   After San Francisco, Houston was heading to her East Coast home to prepare
for a trip to Europe on Monday night or Tuesday. Although she was one of the
leading nominees at Monday's American Music Awards in Los Angeles, Houston was
not scheduled to perform or attend the ceremony, awards spokesman Paul Shefrin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of the public relations firm that represents Houston were
off for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday and could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
	   The police spokesman said officers did not treat the situation any
differently because it involved a celebrity. He noted that the airport is five
miles away from the nearest police station. He also said the amount of marijuana
allegedly found was relatively small.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would imagine that they were busy," Donham said. "It's not a major crime.
I don't think you realize how much dope does go through this island. We're one
of the major growing areas in the country."
</P>
<P>
	   Houston and Brown have had run-ins with Hawaii authorities before.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Honolulu police investigated a report that Brown slapped Houston in
the face during a quarrel in a mall parking lot. Police said they closed the
investigation after Houston refused to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
	   That same year, Brown threw a punch at a Maui bar patron who had reached out
for Houston. Brown missed and instead hit a county liquor control inspector in
the ribs.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Begin Latest Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley agreed Monday that the
Confederate battle flag should be removed from the South Carolina statehouse,
and the vice president added that ``it's only the GOP White House hopefuls'' who
disagree because they are ``so scared of the right wing.''
</P>
<P>
	   The racially sensitive issue came up in the opening moments of a televised
debate on the federal holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King, Jr., the
last time two Democratic presidential hopefuls will meet before next Monday's
kickoff Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also told his questioner he would not agree to participate in an NAACP
boycott of South Carolina, because ``I don't think a president of the United
States should ever boycott an individual state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said the flag ``offends our common humanity and it is not the future
of our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who spoke first, also noted that some people view the flag favorably.
``We have to try to bring them into a shared understanding of why, as a symbol,
it is so hurtful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the sixth debate between the two men, and in the early moments, they
reprised well-worn arguments about health care. Gore said Bradley's plan would
hurt the poor; Bradley said it wasn't so.

<HEADLINE> Israel-Syria Negotiations Postponed  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a serious setback, the Clinton administration was
forced Monday to call off scheduled peace talks between Israel and Syria amid
sharp disagreement between the two sides over a projected Israeli pullback on
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and senior U.S. mediator Dennis Ross
telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa of Syria looking for a way to move ahead. Announcement of the
indefinite suspension came from Jerusalem, where Barak had been preparing to
return to Shepherdstown, W.Va., for the second round of talks this month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it isn't comfortable for the Syrians to come now, and they need some
time, they should take the time,'' Barak said. ``We will come when there are
discussions, and the delay, if in fact it is agreed on, does not bother us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Having agreed last week to resume the talks Wednesday, Syria hesitated over
the weekend. Syrian officials were frustrated that the negotiations had not met
their territorial demands -- a promised pullback by Israel from all the
strategic borderline plateau.
</P>
<P>
	   Disclosure via an Israeli leak that Syria had offered Israel diplomatic
relations as well as arrangements on trade, tourism and transportation may have
contributed to the Syrian frustration.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the weekend, statements emanated from Syria and Lebanon that indicated
President Hafez Assad's government was reconsidering whether to proceed to
another round.
</P>
<P>
	   In Damascus, an informed Syrian source said Monday that Syria had not
suggested the delay. Rather, al-Sharaa concluded from telephone conversations
with Albright that Israel was not serious, said the source, who insisted on
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Sharaa told Albright, with whom he spoke Saturday as well as Monday, the
Syrians would not participate in a third round until the Israelis were prepared
to demarcate a new border at lines that existed prior to the Six-Day War in
1967, the source said.
</P>
<P>
	   When Israel decides to go back to the table to do that, the source said,
then there will be another meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Had the United States insisted on going ahead with the talks Wednesday, they
would have been held, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the two sides in sharp disagreement on how to proceed, each wanting
his priority demands dealt with first, the outlook for progress was not bright.
</P>
<P>
	   For Syria, that demand is recovery of all of the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured in the 1967 war. Since then, the high ground has served as a border
buffer. Around 18,000 Jewish settlers live on the plateau, operating small
businesses, wineries and farms.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria is insisting on recovery of territory all the way to the Sea of
Galilee, Israel's water storehouse. This includes patches of land it captured in
the 1950s, then lost in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel and Syria each agreed to send two experts to Washington to nibble
away at issues that are not central to land-for-peace negotiations. After that,
the administration will decide how to proceed, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   In a carefully worded statement, Albright blamed neither side for the
postponement but said their approaches differed to a U.S.-prepared document that
the Americans hoped would form a basis for an accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, before the talks were postponed, Clinton sounded an
optimistic note.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The good news is, I'm convinced that both still want to do it,'' he said
during a Martin Luther King Jr. Day appearance. ``And they are not as far apart
as they might be. They're not as far apart as they have been.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Israel's chief rabbis ruled in Jerusalem that the Golan Heights is
part of the biblical land of Israel, a decision that could influence Israel's
Orthodox Jews to vote against returning it.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Chief Rabbinical Council did not conclude that Jewish law
forbids Israel to give up the Golan Heights for peace. Many rabbis have
concluded peace has the highest priority.
</P>
<P>
	   Prodding Israel and Syria to the negotiating table after an impasse of
nearly four years was considered a diplomatic accomplishment for the
administration. It raised hopes that Clinton might be able to preside over the
closing of the circle of peace in the Middle East with Israel coming to terms
with both Syria and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   The president is due to meet at the White House on Thursday with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat. A deadline for the outline of an overall settlement with
Israel is less than a month away.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak and Arafat might have had a three-way meeting with Clinton if the
negotiations were Syria were held, the senior U.S. official said.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Hold Secret Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HADERA, Israel (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat held a secret meeting Monday night just hours after a pipe
bomb suspected of being aimed at derailing the peace process injured 22
Israelis, most of them only slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting came as Palestinians were accusing Israel of reneging on its
commitments by postponing a West Bank troop withdrawal, due to have taken place
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told Israel TV the meeting was aimed at
pushing the peace process forward. The two leaders were to have met later this
week in Washington, but Barak canceled his trip following Monday's postponement
of peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel Radio reported that Barak was asking Arafat for a two-month delay in
reaching a framework agreement for a final peace treaty. Barak's office would
not confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The sides had agreed to develop a framework agreement by Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak aide Gadi Baltiansky would not comment on the report but said that
Israel hoped to meet the February deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If not,'' he said, ``we'll reach an agreement with them (the Palestinians)
for something else.''
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo responded angrily to the
possibility of a delay, accusing Israel of neglecting the Palestinians in favor
of peace talks with Syria. He said the Palestinians would ask Arab nations to
``calm down'' the process of normalization with Israel until it reaches a final
peace treaty with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's meeting at an undisclosed site demonstrated both leaders'
commitment to negotiations despite the pipe bomb attack in the northern Israeli
city of Hadera. Police officials said the blast was probably carried out by
Islamic militants who hope to derail the peace process. Hamas, largest hard-line
Muslim group, denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   A small, little-known Lebanese group, Omar Mukhtar, claimed responsibility
for the blast in a fax sent to Lebanese state-run television. However, Israeli
police said they had no information that the group was involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite quick condemnation of the attack by Arafat's Palestinian Authority,
opponents of the peace process were quick to use the bombing to rally opposition
for the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel cannot run negotiations under threat and under intimidation,''
opposition legislator Ruby Rivlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak said the attack would not affect peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are a strong people, very tough,'' he said. ``We understand the
missions before us, and no type of terror will break our spirit.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians have been frustrated with the progress of the talks and
were infuriated Monday when Barak postponed a withdrawal from the West Bank that
had been scheduled for Thursday. Barak said he needed the three-week delay to
focus on the Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal was to be one of the last interim withdrawals before final
peace treaty negotiations start next month. The Palestinians hoped it meant
Israeli forces would leave three Arab suburbs of Jerusalem, claimed by both
sides as their capital. But Barak insisted the suburbs would not be part of the
next withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak won elections in May promising to revive the Palestinian and Syrian
peace processes, which were frozen for three years by his hard-line
predecessors. He pledges to have agreements in place this year. Troubles on both
fronts -- Barak postponed talks with the Syrians on Monday -- make that seem
increasingly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Alastair Meir, a 75-year-old Polish-born Holocaust survivor, was
injured in the Hadera blast but said he refused to let such attacks rattle him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The trash can blew up right next to the bench where I was sitting,'' he
said, sitting up in his hospital bed. ``I sit there every day, and I'll keep on
sitting there, because it's the best spot in Hadera.''

<HEADLINE> Income gap widens for American families  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Fueled in part by the boom on Wall Street, the income
gap between New York's poorest and richest families is now the widest in the
nation, according to a report by two Washington think tanks.
<P>
	   The average income for the poorest fifth of New York families dipped by 15
percent to $10,770 between 1988 and 1998. It rose by 15 percent for the richest
fifth to $152,350, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic
Policy Institute said in a report issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found the richest 20 percent of New York families had average
incomes 14 times the average of the poorest 20 percent of families.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, wages for the poorest fifth of American families rose less than
1 percent between 1988 and 1998 but jumped 15 percent for the richest fifth.
</P>
<P>
	   Income for the poorest families - defined as two or more relatives living
together - rose an average of $110 to $12,990 during the 10-year period. For the
richest families it increased by $17,870, to $137,480, the report found.
</P>
<P>
	   The richest 20 percent of families had average incomes 20 times larger than
the poorest 20 percent of families, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
	   "The inequality is particularly striking in New York where the numbers show
the rich getting richer and the poor either stagnating or getting poorer," said
Trudi Renwick, of New York's labor-supported Fiscal Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth McNichol, one of the study's authors, attributed the widening gap
to Wall Street's long-running bull market boosting the economy in general while
lower-paying service jobs replace better-paying manufacturing work.
</P>
<P>
	   And the minimum wage is too low to help, she said. Ten states and the
District of Columbia currently have minimum wages above the $5.15 national rate.
The Senate last year passed a $1 minimum wage increase over three years but the
House failed to act on the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   McNichol also suggested strengthening states' unemployment assistance
programs and social safety net programs for low-income workers, like
transportation and child care.
</P>
<P>
	   But Stephen Moore, director of social policy for the Cato Institute, said
the study contorted data to put a negative face on a "spectacular economy."
</P>
<P>
	   "The rich are getting richer but the poor are getting richer too in this
expansion," said Moore.
</P>
<P>
	   The study used before-tax data from the U.S. Census Bureau and adjusted the
figures for inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic Policy Institute
are nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations pushing for changes in tax laws and
other federal policies to benefit low-and moderate-income families.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, income was most evenly distributed in Utah, where the poorest
families saw their income increase by $1,360 and the richest rose $24,870.
</P>
<P>
	   The income gap narrowed in just three states - Alaska, Louisiana and
Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> Flu Outbreak Hits Blood Supply  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A flu outbreak that walloped many parts of the country
harder and earlier than usual is having an unexpected side effect: a nationwide
blood shortage that is leaving blood banks from New York to Los Angeles with
just a one- or two-day supply.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual drop in donations that hurts blood banks every December, when
people are busy preparing for the holidays, was worse than usual because of the
pre-millennium fervor, said Linda Levi, spokeswoman for The New York Blood
Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the flu season, which hit early, kept potential donors home at the
beginning of January, just when blood banks usually replenish their supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Blood Center issued an emergency appeal for donors Monday, a
week after the American Red Cross made a similar request.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This really goes from Boston to L.A. and hits the heartland,'' said
Jacquelyn Fredrick, chief operating officer for the American Red Cross blood
services.
</P>
<P>
	   Fredrick worried that the cold snap in the Northeast could make it even
harder to draw donors in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-five of the 37 regional blood centers run by the national Red Cross
had less than one day's supply of Type O blood -- the ``universal donor'' type
-- a week after the organization issued the emergency appeal, Fredrick said.
Among the most severely affected areas are Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
Washington, Detroit, Nashville, Tenn., and Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Blood Center, which operates independently of the American Red
Cross, had less than a two-day supply of Type O blood Monday, Levi said. A
five-day supply is considered normal.
</P>
<P>
	   In Toldeo, Ohio, where the Red Cross called 135 people asking them to
donate, 75 declined because they were suffering from the flu or another
illnesses, Fredrick said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Peoria, Ill., drive to collect blood platelets, which are needed by
cancer patients, 24 of 34 scheduled donors canceled their appointments because
of illness, Fredrick said.
</P>
<P>
	   The shortage highlights a widening gap between blood supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Usage is growing as fast as we can collect more blood because of the aging
population and more advanced medical treatments like transplants,'' Fredrick
said. ``The blood supply in this country is very fragile. Even in the best of
times, we're probably only a day away from a blood shortage.''

<HEADLINE> Syria Restless on Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SEVAREID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- In the United States, Syria's foreign minister
handles negotiations with Israel. But the minister is more of a messenger for
President Hafez Assad, the real decision-maker, who is sitting out the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad is a master negotiator of the subtle variety, reclusive and indirect.
What he wants his citizens or the outside world to know is relayed through
feelers, leaks or the state-run media.
</P>
<P>
	   And what he has been leaking of late indicates he may want to readjust the
course of negotiations to focus on Syria's key concern -- the return of the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Syria also has been angered at leaks elsewhere
suggesting that Israel is getting the better of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel announced Monday that the third round of talks, which had been set to
open Wednesday in the United States, had been indefinitely postponed following
hints Syria wanted a delay. Syria has indicated it expects talks will resume
soon, though neither side has said how soon.
</P>
<P>
	   By sending signals of wariness, Assad appears to be trying to pressure the
Americans and Israelis. At the same time, Syrians have been suspicious that
Barak may use Cabinet crises, opinion polls and rallies against a Golan
withdrawal to force Syrian concessions. Neither side wants to appear to be
giving up too much too easily.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria accuses Israel of wanting to focus only on side issues, not what
Damascus sees as the crux of the problem -- setting a new border.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel seized the Golan Heights border plateau from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war. When Assad agreed last year to resume negotiations after a 3 1/2-year
freeze, he insisted that for talks to begin, there had to be an understanding
Syria would get back the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria has made clear that other matters can be negotiated after an agreement
on the Golan. But before drawing any boundaries, Israel wants to know what sort
of security guarantees and relations it will get in return.
</P>
<P>
	   At the last round of talks, the committee dealing with border issues met
formally only once. A U.S. working document leaked to an Israeli newspaper
indicated wide gaps remain on border and security questions. But it suggested
the two sides were much closer to answers Israel is looking for on the nature of
future relations.
</P>
<P>
	   The document, considered merely a basis for future talks, cites no
differences in positions on exchanging ambassadors, promoting bilateral trade
and tourism and opening borders.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria's anger over the leaks was clear. The state-controlled Syrian
newspaper Al-Thawra accused Israel of leaking the document, perhaps ``to kill
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
	   A pro-Syrian Lebanese newspaper responded with what it says were Syrian
amendments to the document. The amendments emphasized Syrian steadfastness,
calling for a complete Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 border and the removal of
Israeli settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   Editorials in state-run Syrian newspapers since the second round of talks
adjourned Jan. 10 in Shepherdstown, W.Va., repeatedly have called negotiations
thus far a failure.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, though, Middle East analyst Yezid Sayigh said, games played by
both sides during day-to-day negotiations are largely for domestic consumption
and mean little in the overall picture.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know what's on the table. We all know what the final deal has to look
like more or less. And the rest is playing games,'' Sayigh, of the International
Center for Strategic Studies, said in a telephone interview from his London
office.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Begin Latest Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley agreed Monday that the
Confederate battle flag should be removed from the South Carolina statehouse,
and the vice president added that ``it's only the GOP White House hopefuls'' who
disagree because they are ``so scared of the right wing.''
</P>
<P>
	   The racially sensitive issue came up in the opening moments of a televised
debate on the federal holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King, Jr., the
last time two Democratic presidential hopefuls will meet before next Monday's
kickoff Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also told his questioner he would not agree to participate in an NAACP
boycott of South Carolina, because ``I don't think a president of the United
States should ever boycott an individual state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said the flag ``offends our common humanity and it is not the future
of our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who spoke first, also noted that some people view the flag favorably.
``We have to try to bring them into a shared understanding of why, as a symbol,
it is so hurtful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the sixth debate between the two men, and in the early moments, they
reprised well-worn arguments about health care. Gore said Bradley's plan would
hurt the poor; Bradley said it wasn't so.
</P>
<P>
	   The proceedings were disrupted briefly by a young woman who stood at her
seat in the audience to pose a question about global warming. As security guards
move to silence her, the moderator, Travis Smiley of Black Entertainment
Television, quipped, ``I get my 15 minutes (of fame) and this is what happens to
me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore broke in to say the young woman had raised a good question, but Smiley
kept firm control, and told the vice president that maybe they could get to the
issue later.
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederate flag issue has come up recently because the GOP presidential
contenders, including Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain,
have refused to say it should come down. Instead, they say it's an issue for
residents of the state to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's only the Republican candidates for president who are so scared of the
extreme right win that they will be tolerant of the intolerant lest they offend
the offensive,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacks account for a small minority of the vote in Iowa, but given the date
and fact that a black state lawmaker organized the event, a ``Black-Brown''
forum, the two Democrats pledged support for continued efforts to support civil
rights and combat racism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Racial profiling is particularly pernicious,'' said Bradley, who said that
as president, he would issue an executive order outlawing the practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said, he would do likewise, and send legislation to Congress to outlaw
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley trails Gore in the polls in the runup to next week's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Both agreed that they would only appoint to the Supreme Court justices who
appreciate the value of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I could never appoint anyone to the Supreme Court that I thought would
turn the clock back on civil rights,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore answered the question directly as it was posed: Would he appoint
someone in the tradition of liberal Thurgood Marshall, or conservative Clarence
Thomas?
</P>
<P>
	   ``Two words: Thurgood Marshall,'' Gore said. ``Affirmative action is one of
the tools we still need available to us.''

<HEADLINE> American Greetings' Stone Dies  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN AFFLECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Irving Stone, who started working in his family's greeting
card business at age 5 and helped transform it into American Greetings Corp.,
one of the world's largest card makers, died Monday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone died at University Hospitals in Cleveland. The company said he had
suffered from an extended illness but did not specify the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone still held the title of founder-chairman and visited American
Greetings' offices as often as he could, but was not involved in managing the
company's day-to-day affairs at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
	   "Irving Stone was a true visionary, whose leadership propelled our company
to 93 years of consecutive growth," Morry Weiss, chairman and chief executive
officer of American Greetings, said in a written statement. "The company that
once sold its products from the back of a horse-drawn wagon today has sales of
$2.2 billion with products sold in 75 countries around the world."
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland-based American Greetings, which is in the process of buying
Cincinnati's Gibson Greetings, is second only to the privately held Hallmark in
the card business, though it is the largest publicly traded greeting card
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone's father, Jacob Sapirstein, founded the company in 1906 by selling
picture postcards from his wagon.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone, whose brothers Harry and Morris also were involved in the family
business, first started working for his father by stuffing postcards into
envelopes.
</P>
<P>
	   By age 9, Stone had become a partner in the company and handled the every
aspect of the business, from sales to delivery to billing, for two months while
his father was ill. He was the company's bookkeeper by age 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone continued to work for the company throughout high school and into his
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
	   Dissatisfied with the quality of cards the family was buying for resale,
Stone got the company to begin designing and printing its own cards in the
1930s. One of his earliest verses, "From Someone Who Likes To Remember Someone
Too Nice To Forget," has sold more cards than any other in the company's history
and is still part of the line, American Greetings said in its obituary for
Stone.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone became company president in 1960, and was promoted to chairman of the
board and chief executive officer in 1978. When Weiss, his son-in-law, was
promoted to CEO in 1987, Stone retained his position as board chairman. He
became founder-chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone, who lived in the Cleveland suburb of Beachwood, was active in many
Jewish community organizations. He is survived by his wife, Helen, brother Harry
and sister Bernice and four children. His first wife, Beatrice, the mother of
Stone's children, is deceased.
</P>
<P>
	   Funeral services were scheduled for Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Crowd's behavior at St. Bonaventure condemned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   OLEAN, N.Y (AP) - St. Bonaventure fans who got their team a technical
foul for throwing objects from the stands Saturday got a warning Monday from
Atlantic 10 commissioner Linda Bruno.
<P>
	   "A recurrence of this problem will result in action by the Conference
office," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans threw objects at Temple head coach John Chaney and several Temple
basketball players during the Bonnie's shocking 57-56 win with a 3-point shot at
the buzzer. Chaney himself got a technical foul for smashing a cookie to the
floor to get officials' attention.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the cookie had been thrown at him.
</P>
<P>
	   "The conduct of a few members of that crowd ... provided an atmosphere that
was detrimental to the playing of the game and could have resulted in injury to
our student-athletes, coaches and fans," Ms. Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Bonaventure's director of athletics, Gothard Lane, said he has taken
measures to provide a safer environment at the Bonnies' next home game Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
	   There was also good news for the Bonnies Monday. They earned 49 points in
the Associated Press' Top 25 poll. They placed 30th in the ranking. The team has
not earned a spot in the poll since 1971.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Party Sets Emergency Session  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's Christian Democrats scheduled an emergency
leadership meeting Monday as calls grew louder for party leaders to resign over
a spreading campaign finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Party leader Wolfgang Schaeuble, himself facing suspicions for accepting the
equivalent of $52,000 from a businessman, set the national party executive
meeting for Tuesday, six days ahead of its next regular session.
</P>
<P>
	   The leaders will be trying to deal with a scandal that was touched off last
month by revelations that former chancellor Helmut Kohl accepted up to $1
million in unreported campaign funds in the 1990s, when the conservative
Christian Democrats led Germany's government.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal grew last week in Hesse state, where former party officials
admitted funneling millions to party coffers from a Swiss account and falsely
reporting the money as bequests. Those irregularities implicated yet another
senior party figure -- former Hesse party chairman Manfred Kanther, once a tough
law-and-order advocate as Kohl's interior minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Hesse Christian Democrat spokesman Christian Schnee said Monday that Kanther
had decided to give up his parliament seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the weekend, Germany's justice minister urged the entire conservative
leadership to step down. Leaders of the Christian Democrats' post-Kohl
generation pressed for resignations themselves on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will have to part ways with all those entangled in this affair,''
Christian Wulff, a deputy national party chairman, told North German Radio. ``I
certainly don't exclude expulsions of party members.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble, Kohl's hand-picked successor in 1998, has been undermined by the
ever-growing revelations of apparent breaches of Germany's party financing law.
Hecklers at a weekend party rally urged Schaeuble to resign and scorned his
efforts to clear up the scandal, which is overshadowing the Christian Democrats'
campaign for Feb. 27 elections in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Hesse prosecutors opened a fraud probe Monday against a former party
treasurer and a party tax adviser, widening the range of formal suspects in the
scandal beyond Kohl.
</P>
<P>
	   The probe will seek to determine whether fraud or breach of trust charges
are warranted against tax adviser Horst Weyrauch and the former Hesse party
treasurer, Prince Casimir Sayn-Wittgenstein, prosecutors said. They said they
acted on Kanther's disclosure that $6.8 million flowed to the state's Christian
Democrats from abroad between 1989 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors in Bonn opened a similar probe against Kohl last month.

<HEADLINE> 'Next Friday' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM HARRIGAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Ice Cube comedy "Next Friday" topped the box office
for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend with $17 million in earnings,
according to industry estimates released Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stuart Little" was No. 2 for the Friday-through-Monday period with an
estimate of $12.6 million in ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Hurricane" was in third place with $10.7 million, and "Girl,
Interrupted" was fourth at $9.6 million. They moved into wide circulation after
opening in limited release last month to be eligible for Oscar consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   "Next Friday," a sequel to the 1995 comedy "Friday," stars Ice Cube as an
inner-city man hiding out in the suburbs from a vengeful villain. It opened
Wednesday and was No. 1 despite playing in just 1,103 theaters, compared to
3,092 for "Stuart Little."
</P>
<P>
	   "Next Friday" earned about $4.8 million per day from Friday to Sunday. New
Line Cinema estimated Monday's pace would slip to about $2.5 million but had
hopes for the film's long-term success.
</P>
<P>
	   "The original film stayed on the list of top 100 video rentals and sales for
100 weeks, so we knew we had a strong crossover audience for this picture, not
just African-Americans," said David Tuckerman, New Line's executive vice
president for distribution, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stuart Little" has grossed nearly $110 million in five weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are getting a lot of repeat business, and family groups," said Ed
Russell, a spokesman for Sony's Columbia Pictures. "We anticipate better than
$140 million for the length of its run."
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at North American theaters,
according to studios and Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures were to be
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Next Friday," $17 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. "Stuart Little," $12.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   3. "The Hurricane," $10.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   4. "Girl, Interrupted," $9.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   5. "The Green Mile," $8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   6. "Galaxy Quest," $8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   7. "The Talented Mr. Ripley," $7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   8. "Supernova," $6.6 million.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Clash in 6th Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley challenged Vice President Al Gore
Monday night to demand the president issue an immediate order banning racial
profiling, but Gore shot back in campaign debate, ``I don't think President Bill
Clinton needs a lecture from Sen. Bill Bradley'' on standing up for blacks and
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   In their sixth and final debate before next Monday's kickoff Iowa caucuses,
the two Democratic hopefuls agreed the Confederate flag should come down from
atop the South Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore went one step further, saying ``it's only the Republican candidates for
president'' who disagree because they are ``so scared of the extreme right
wing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men also agreed that the father of Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban
boy at the center of an international dispute, should come to the United States
to seek custody.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of racially sensitive issues came up in the opening moments of a
televised debate on the federal holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King,
Jr., a ``Black-Brown Forum'' that both men hoped to use to appeal to voters in
other states with a larger minority population than Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The proceedings were disrupted briefly by a young woman who stood at her
seat in the audience to pose a question about global warming. As security guards
moved to silence her, the moderator, Travis Smiley of Black Entertainment
Television, quipped, ``I get my 15 minutes (of fame) and this is what happens to
me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Racial profiling is the practice by which some police offers target racial
minorities for traffic stops, and Gore and Bradley both said firmly that they
are against it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all know what driving while black is,'' said Bradley, who has made race
relations a cornerstone of his career in public life. ``It is breathing while
black.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Battle Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush questioned the credibility of Sen.
John McCain's campaign-promised tax cut Monday, while the GOP challenger said
he'd give the breaks to working Americans and end ``special benefit'' favors for
big money interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain renewed at a distance the argument that began when the Texas
governor said in a presidential campaign debate that the senator's proposal
would impose ``a $40 billion tax increase'' on the benefits employers provide
their workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Wrong, an architect of the McCain plan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Spitzer, a Phoenix tax attorney, said the McCain proposal is to end the
deductions employers can now take on tax-exempt benefits they give their
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It does nothing to the employees,'' said Spitzer, an Arizona state
senator.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain had not disputed Bush's assertion in the Saturday debate in Des
Moines, Iowa, as the governor pointedly noted. But his campaign immediately
denied it was so.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said later that Bush had mischaracterized his proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're talking about income taxes,'' his spokesman, Howard Opinsky said.
``We're talking about payroll taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign based the governor's assertion on Congressional Research
Service estimates of the revenue loss due to the tax-free treatment of
non-retirement fringe benefits aside from health insurance coverage and child
care, which wouldn't be affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's $40 billion claim reflects those estimates extended for five years
after a new administration is installed. But those numbers are based on taxes
paid by individuals, not their employers.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer said the McCain campaign does not have an estimate of the revenues
that would be added by imposing payroll taxes on employers for the value of the
benefits they pay for employees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The point was, I didn't hear an explanation about the $40 billion benefit
tax increase on workers,'' Bush, in Austin, said in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press. ``There seems to be a tax gap between what his explanation
was in Iowa and what reality is ...
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an important debate, because it's a debate about the credibility
of tax plans,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush advocates a five-year, $483 billion tax cut, and says the only way to
be certain that projected budget surpluses aren't spent by the government is to
refund most of the money to taxpayers. McCain's alternative is a $237 billion
overall cut, the closing of what he calls tax loopholes to offset part of the
cost, and the commitment of additional budget surpluses to secure the financial
future of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain says Bush would spend more than the projected surpluses, without
putting aside a penny of it for Social Security. The Arizona senator boasted of
a new poll indicating that most Republicans would prefer a smaller tax cut with
more money set aside for Social Security and to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The Time-CNN poll showed 63 percent of Republicans felt that way, 29 percent
wanted more money to go into tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This poll confirms that Republicans agree with me,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest round in their tax argument gets into the fine print of the tax
code, dealing with what are called ``employer paid non-retirement fringe
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
	   By the Bush campaign's account, the McCain tax proposal would impose income
taxes on things like employer-subsidized education, commuting costs, discounted
meals and purchases, parking and life insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said his plan would not do that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I'm saying is that the guy who owns the corporation isn't going to
get his tax break for his golf club membership,'' McCain said on CNN. ``He's not
going to get his spa fees written off and he's not going to get free parking.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congress already has barred tax deductions for perks like country club dues.
The IRS code says that there can be no deduction ``for amounts paid or incurred
for membership in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation or other
social purposes.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Spitzer said there are still loopholes, and McCain wants them closed.
For example, he said, a company can give an executive pricey tickets to a
National Basketball Association game and deduct them as a corporate cost,
although the individual isn't taxed on them.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told the Rotary Club in Rochester, N.H., that his tax proposal would
be a step toward a flatter, simpler tax code. ``Every time we pass a tax bill,
we put in a special deal, a special benefit for a big-money contributor special
interest,'' McCain said. He said he'd put an end to that.

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Head Injured in Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Former CIA Director Adm. Stansfield Turner was
in stable but critical condition Monday following the crash of a tourist plane
that killed his wife and three others.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Deborah Beuchan of the Hospital Mexico said Turner suffered injuries to
his head and chest in Saturday's crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner, 76, is a former admiral who served as CIA director under President
Jimmy Carter between 1977 and 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner's wife, Eli Karen, died in the accident, according to U.S. Embassy
spokesman David Gilmour. Also killed were Siegfried and Therese Richert of the
United States and Antonio Sanchez Diaz of Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen passengers and three crew members were aboard the Czech-built
LET410, operated by Taxi Aereo Centroamericano, which went down en route to
Tortuguero national park on the Caribbean coast.

	   The plane crashed into a house in the exclusive Rohrmoser neighborhood,
minutes after taking off from the Tobias Bolanos Airport in San Jose. A maid
working at the house suffered minor injuries.

	   Civil Aviation officials said they had recovered the plane's flight
recorders and were studying them to help determine the cause of the crash.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Clash in 6th Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley challenged Vice President Al Gore
Monday night to demand the president issue an immediate order banning racial
profiling, but Gore shot back in campaign debate, ``I don't think President Bill
Clinton needs a lecture from Sen. Bill Bradley'' on standing up for blacks and
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   In their sixth and final debate before next Monday's kickoff Iowa caucuses,
the two Democratic hopefuls agreed the Confederate flag should come down from
atop the South Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore went one step further, saying ``it's only the Republican candidates for
president'' who disagree because they are ``so scared of the extreme right
wing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men also agreed that the father of Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban
boy at the center of an international dispute, should come to the United States
to seek custody.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of racially sensitive issues came up in the opening moments of a
televised debate on the federal holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King,
Jr., a ``Black-Brown Forum'' that both men hoped to use to appeal to voters in
other states with a larger minority population than Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The proceedings were disrupted briefly by a young woman who stood at her
seat in the audience to pose a question about global warming. As security guards
moved to silence her, the moderator, Travis Smiley of Black Entertainment
Television, quipped, ``I get my 15 minutes (of fame) and this is what happens to
me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Racial profiling is the practice by which some police offers target racial
minorities for traffic stops, and Gore and Bradley both said firmly that they
are against it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all know what driving while black is,'' said Bradley, who has made race
relations a cornerstone of his career in public life. ``It is breathing while
black.''
</P>
<P>
	   When Gore said he would issue an executive order banning the practice,
Bradley served him a challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a president now,'' he said. ``You serve with him. I want you to
walk into his office and say, `Sign this executive order today.'''
</P>
<P>
	   His remarks were greeted with applause, but Gore had a ready reply.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley
about how to fight for African Americans'' and Latinos, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to talk the talk. It's another thing to walk the walk,''
Gore said, to scattered boos from the audience.

<HEADLINE> American Greetings Founder Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN AFFLECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Irving Stone, who started working in his family's greeting
card business at age 5 and helped transform it into American Greetings Corp.,
one of the world's largest card makers, died Monday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said he suffered from an extended illness but did not specify
the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone held the title of founder-chairman at the time of his death, but was
not involved in managing the company's day-to-day affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Irving Stone was a true visionary, whose leadership propelled our company
to 93 years of consecutive growth,'' Morry Weiss, Stone's son-in-law and
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. ``The company that
once sold its products from the back of a horse-drawn wagon today has sales of
$2.2 billion with products sold in 75 countries around the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stone's father, Jacob Sapirstein, founded the company in 1906 by selling
picture postcards from his wagon.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone, whose brothers Harry and Morris also were involved in the family
business, first started working for his father by stuffing postcards into
envelopes.
</P>
<P>
	   By age 9, Stone had become a partner in the company and handled the every
aspect of the business for two months while his father was ill. He was the
company's bookkeeper by age 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Dissatisfied with the quality of cards the family was buying for resale,
Stone got the company to begin designing and printing its own cards in the
1930s. One of his earliest verses, ``From Someone Who Likes To Remember Someone
Too Nice To Forget,'' has sold more cards than any other in the company's
history and is still part of the line, American Greetings said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone became company president in 1960, and was promoted to chairman of the
board and chief executive officer in 1978. Weiss replaced him as CEO in
1987.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton meets with Sharpton on King Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The long-awaited meeting between Hillary Rodham Clinton
and the Rev. Al Sharpton took place Monday at a Martin Luther King Jr.
celebration, but the only person who took any flak during the event was somebody
who wasn't there - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
<P>
	   "The only mayor of a big city that could not go into an African-American
community on Martin Luther King Day is the mayor of this city," Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani held a prayer breakfast at Gracie Mansion Monday morning and was
one of several Republican officials who attended a dinner Monday night given by
the Congress of Racial Equality, which is led by the conservative black activist
Roy Innes.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor skipped a King tribute at the Brooklyn Academy of Music that he
has attended for the past few years because Mrs. Clinton decided to attend it.
</P>
<P>
	   "It became a political event once they invited Mrs. Clinton," Ms. Mindel
said. She added that the mayor spent the day working on the city budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton also spoke at the Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Harlem. At
all three events, she recalled having met King when she was 15 in 1963, having
been brought with her church youth group to hear him speak in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   "He took my hand and shook it and I felt my life would never be the same,"
she said, adding that King's stirring speech that night - titled "Remaining
Awake Through a Great Revolution" - inspired her to "dedicate my life to public
service."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton noted there has been progress in blacks achieving equality, but
added: "There is still a need for affirmative action." She quoted her husband,
President Clinton, saying of affirmative action, "We need to mend it, not end
it."
</P>
<P>
	   She was accompanied to Sharpton's headquarters by former Mayors David
Dinkins and Ed Koch, along with a number of other elected Democratic officials.
The audience of about 300 repeatedly interrupted her remarks with cheers,
applause and occasional cries of "Run Hillary run!"
</P>
<P>
	   Afterwards, she met privately with Sharpton and several others, including
the parents of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed African immigrant who was killed by
four white police officers in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had a few private moments with them and expressed my personal sympathy
and condolences and shared my hope that justice is done," Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial of the officers who killed Diallo is set to begin soon in Albany.
It was moved from the Bronx because an appellate court concluded the officers
could not get a fair trial there. Sharpton and U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel of
Harlem have asked the U.S. Justice Department to consider a federal
investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there is a role for the federal government, I would certainly encourage
and urge that that would occur," said Mrs. Clinton. But she said it was too
early to say whether federal intervention is merited.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton did not agree on every issue raised at the Sharpton event, at
one point defending sanctions against Iraq despite murmurs of disapproval.
</P>
<P>
	   "She did very well," Sharpton said afterwards. "She did not show any
reluctance at all to deal with the issues."
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly before Mrs. Clinton entered Sharpton's headquarters, another
speaker, Rev. Charles Norris, said he had missed one of King's demonstrations
because he was working. Referring to his employers, Norris said: "Miller No. 1
was a Jew. Miller No. 2 was a Jew. I then went to work for another Jew - Jesus."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton later told reporters that before she arrived, "I heard that one
of the speakers made some divisive comments, which I soundly reject."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton said he had not heard Norris' remarks.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects U.N.'s Iraq Inspector  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After a difficult search for a candidate to head the
new Iraq weapons inspection agency, the U.N. chief announced his choice Monday:
Rolf Ekeus, the same man who led the old inspection agency for six years.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia immediately rejected Annan's pick, throwing Ekeus' nomination into
doubt. The United States, currently president of the Security Council, received
a formal letter Monday evening from the Russian ambassador saying Moscow
``cannot agree with the proposal,'' a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Consultations were scheduled for Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   In picking the Swedish diplomat, Secretary-General Kofi Annan overrode
Russian and Chinese objections and set up a likely confrontation with Baghdad.
Iraq immediately questioned the nomination, saying it amounted to putting ``old
wine in new bottles.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can they appoint a new commission and then name its former head to
lead it?'' Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters after a meeting
in Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus was the first executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission, which
was created in 1991 in the aftermath of Persian Gulf War to rid Iraq of its
weapons of mass destruction. He stepped down in 1997 to become Sweden's
ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   While his successor, Richard Butler of Australia, incurred the wrath of the
Iraqis during his tumultuous two-year term, Ekeus too was harshly criticized by
the Baghdad leadership, particularly towards the end of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
	   Aziz on Monday accused Ekeus of deliberately prolonging U.N. trade sanctions
imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. He said the Swedish diplomat
allowed inspectors to spy on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
	   Aziz, however, did not say whether or not Iraq would cooperate with Ekeus if
his nomination is approved.
</P>
<P>
	   Before its outright rejection, Russia, along with China, had told Annan on
Friday that they opposed nominating Ekeus for the new agency, called the U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or UNMOVIC. They argued that
Ekeus would not be acceptable to Iraq. France also indicated it preferred other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't immediately clear how Russia's rejection would affect Annan's
nomination. Under normal procedures for U.N. appointments, a mission has 24
hours to formally object to a nomination. Otherwise, it is automatically
accepted.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus is retiring as U.S. ambassador this summer and had been expected to
take up a five-year post to be chairman of the governing board of the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   The new inspection agency, UNMOVIC, was formed in December to replace
UNSCOM, which pulled out of Baghdad in December, 1998, ahead of U.S. and British
airstrikes. Iraq has said UNSCOM inspectors cannot return.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan named Ekeus after a difficult monthlong search for a candidate who
would be agreeable to all members of the Security Council. After a Sunday
deadline passed without consensus, Annan wrote to the president of the council,
Richard Holbrooke of the United States, that he had ``come to the conclusion
that Ambassador Rolf Ekeus of Sweden should be appointed executive chairman of
UNMOVIC.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States applauded Annan's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We support Ambassador Ekeus, who in the past, has ably served the
international community in its efforts to disarm Iraq,'' said the deputy State
Department spokesman, James. B. Foley.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan considered other candidates -- including Brazil's former U.N.
ambassador, Celso Amorim; and Finland's ambassador to Israel and Cyprus, Pasi
Patokallio -- in a bid to ensure unanimous support. Spokesman Fred Eckhard said
the secretary-general had exhausted his search without success.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over 30 days, he raised something like 25 names and he could not find one
on which all could agree. So he put forward the name of the person he thought
best for the job,'' Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus' tenure as chief U.N. inspector was marked by several important
developments, including the uncovering of Iraq's biological weapons program.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ekeus also raised eyebrows at the United Nations when he cut a deal with
the Iraqis to gain access to so-called ``sensitive sites'' in 1996, setting up
special procedures for access that weren't called for in U.N. resolutions. Some
at the United Nations believe that deal was the first step in UNSCOM's downfall,
setting the stage for future Iraqi attempts to prevent or complicate inspectors'
access to certain sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Ekeus was known to be Annan's top choice from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   At a December press conference, Annan outlined his dream candidate for the
job, telling reporters he wanted someone who knew disarmament, had good
judgement and people skills and who could be firm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In effect, I'll probably be looking for somebody like Rolf Ekeus,'' Annan
said.

<HEADLINE> 4-alarm fire raging in Newark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A raging, four-alarm fire tore through an industrial
building Monday evening and spread to nearby homes, sending plumes of choking
smoke for miles and forcing the evacuation of about 10 families.
<P>
	   No injuries were immediately reported, Police Department spokesman Matt
Greimel said.
</P>
<P>
	   The block-long commercial building near Interstate 78 and the Irvington
border began burning at approximately 4:30 p.m. It quickly drew firefighters
from surrounding communities, but they were hampered by sub-freezing
temperatures and gusting winds.
</P>
<P>
	   A fire dispatcher said that the building fire had spread to "at least three"
homes in the area.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's WABC-TV reported that several workers escaped the building.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we were all going to burn. But we got out OK," Maria Cuevas told
the television station.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just went outside, and I heard two explosions," said Meg Batta, who was
working in a Pathmark supermarket a block and a half from the fire. "There's
heavy black smoke all over here. If the wind shifts, we might have to close."
</P>
<P>
	   Flames were leaping from the roof of the building, which witnesses said was
a candle factory, and heavy plumes of smoke were obscuring motorists' vision on
Route 78.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lord, it was so black you couldn't see a thing," said Myrtle Turner, who
lives two blocks from the fire on Fabyan Place. "There was fire all over. It was
terrible."
</P>
<P>
	   "We saw the flames, and heard sirens and ambulances," added Audrey Anderson,
an employee of The Rainbow Shop, a dress store on Lyons Avenue in Irvington,
also a block and a half from the fire.

<HEADLINE> Group Wants Global Warming Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By KEN THOMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Braving an icy 28-degree evening, members of Ozone
Action rallied around their 25-foot inflatable ear of corn outside the scene of
Monday night's Brown-Black Presidential Forum, calling for a plan to combat
global warming.
</P>
<P>
	   Kate Simmons, the group's spokeswoman, said the organization was still
hoping that one of the candidates -- Vice President Al Gore or Bill Bradley --
will directly address the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No candidate has presented a detailed plan for action yet,'' Simmons said.
``We've been at this for 2 1/2 weeks. Once we've moved on with Iowa, we'll go
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   The group plans simultaneous events Tuesday in Ames, Cedar Falls and Iowa
City to release a scientific report on global warming.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley weren't the only candidates with supporters outside the
debate site.
</P>
<P>
	   Perennial presidential contender Lyndon LaRouche, 78, had three supporters
on hand, one of whom carried a large, neon orange sign that said: ``Dump Gore's
Dixiecrat Racism. Vote LaRouche, The Third Party Candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Baker, who works in LaRouche's Leesburg, Va., office, said the candidate
is the only one who recognizes that there is a severe financial meltdown around
the world. Baker said LaRouche is the only one who can mobilize this nation as
well as protect U.S. farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Cecil Conry, who farms near Elliott in southwest Iowa, said LaRouche is
taken seriously, but is ignored by the media and crowded out by the Democratic
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   LaRouche has filed paperwork to run in the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   State Rep. Rebecca Reynolds said she favored Gore earlier in the campaign
but switched to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His health care plan is second to none,'' said Reynolds, a registered
nurse.
</P>
<P>
	   On campaign finance reform, she said, ``I've seen firsthand the horrors that
accompany raising campaign dollars, and I support what he hopes to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for his chances in Iowa's caucuses next week, Reynolds said: ``I'm
constantly amazed by the high number of Democrats getting on board to support
Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
	   Marissa Ollison of Des Moines said she's supporting Bradley because of his
support ``for all people, all sexual preferences.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said she's not sure how Bradley will do at the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just know how I'm going to vote. I'll support Bill Bradley. I don't know
what the rest of Iowa will do,'' Ollison said.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Clash in 6th Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley challenged Vice President Al Gore
Monday night to demand the president issue an immediate order banning racial
profiling, but Gore shot back in campaign debate, ``I don't think President Bill
Clinton needs a lecture from Sen. Bill Bradley'' on standing up for blacks and
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   In their sixth and final debate before next Monday's kickoff Iowa caucuses,
the two Democratic hopefuls agreed the Confederate flag should come down from
atop the South Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore went one step further, saying ``it's only the Republican candidates for
president'' who disagree because they are ``so scared of the extreme right
wing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men also agreed that the father of Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban
boy at the center of an international dispute, should come to the United States
to seek custody.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of racially sensitive issues came up in the opening moments of a
televised debate on the federal holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King,
Jr., a ``Black-Brown Forum'' that both men hoped to use to appeal to voters in
other states with a larger minority population than Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The proceedings were disrupted briefly by a young woman who stood at her
seat in the audience to pose a question about global warming. As security guards
moved to silence her, the moderator, Travis Smiley of Black Entertainment
Television, quipped, ``I get my 15 minutes (of fame) and this is what happens to
me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Racial profiling is the practice by which some police offers target racial
minorities for traffic stops, and Gore and Bradley both said firmly that they
are against it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all know what driving while black is,'' said Bradley, who has made race
relations a cornerstone of his career in public life. ``It is breathing while
black.''
</P>
<P>
	   When Gore said he would issue an executive order banning the practice,
Bradley served him a challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a president now,'' he said. ``You serve with him. I want you to
walk into his office and say, `Sign this executive order today.'''
</P>
<P>
	   His remarks were greeted with applause, but Gore had a ready reply.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley
about how to fight for African Americans'' and Latinos, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to talk the talk. It's another thing to walk the walk,''
Gore said, to scattered boos from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore sidestepped a question of whether he would appoint a Hispanic to the
Supreme Court, and to list some possible contenders for the seat. He jokingly
asked his questioner whether he possessed a law degree, then said he would make
appointments that reflect ``the diversity of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said, ``I could never appoint someone who would turn the clock back
on civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederate flag has surfaced as an issue in the Republican presidential
field, which must compete in a primary in South Carolina on Feb. 19. The leading
GOP contenders, Texas Gov, George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain, have
refused to take a stand on the issue, saying it is up to the residents of South
Carolina to decide whether the flag should fly atop their statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   While both Gore and Bradley said they believe the flag should come down, the
vice president also noted that some people view the flag favorably. ``We have to
try to bring them into a shared understanding of why, as a symbol, it is so
hurtful,'' he said. Gore also told his questioner he would not agree to
participate in an NAACP boycott of South Carolina, because ``I don't think a
president of the United States should ever boycott an individual state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said the flag ``offends our common humanity and it is not the future
of our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's only the Republican candidates for president who are so scared of the
extreme right wing, that they will be tolerant of intolerance, less they offend
the offensive. It ought to come down,'' Gore added.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is the national front-runner by far in the public opinion polls, and
also is hoping for a clear triumph over Bradley in Iowa next week. Bradley leads
in polls in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary eight days after Iowa's
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacks account for a small minority of the vote in Iowa, but given the date
and fact that a black state lawmaker organized the event, a ``Black-Brown''
forum, the two Democrats pledged support for continued efforts to support civil
rights and combat racism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Racial profiling is particularly pernicious,'' said Bradley, who said that
as president, he would issue an executive order outlawing the practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said, he would do likewise, and send legislation to Congress to outlaw
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley trails Gore in the polls in the runup to next week's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Both agreed that they would only appoint to the Supreme Court justices who
appreciate the value of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I could never appoint anyone to the Supreme Court that I thought would
turn the clock back on civil rights,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore answered the question directly as it was posed: Would he appoint
someone in the tradition of liberal Thurgood Marshall, or conservative Clarence
Thomas?
</P>
<P>
	   ``Two words: Thurgood Marshall,'' Gore said. ``Affirmative action is one of
the tools we still need available to us.''

	   As a moderator was about to ask the second question of the debate, a young
woman affiliated with Ozone Action left her seat and walked toward the front of
the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to know what you're going to do about global warming,'' said Kim
DeFeo, 23, a member of the organizations' Iowa field team.
</P>
<P>
	   She was immediately grabbed by security and escorted out of the auditorium.
Neither Gore nor Bradley had a chance to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   DeFeo later was taken in for questioning by Secret Service agents, who
declined to comment. Police also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   DeFeo apparently had discussed with other group members the possibility of
disrupting the nationally televised debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We talked about it and it was a pretty spontaneous thing. She had fire in

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Cargo Goes Through Canal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- A ship carrying 44 tons of nuclear waste safely
crossed the Panama Canal on Monday. It was the first such cargo to make the
passage since the United States ceded the waterway to Panama.
</P>
<P>
	   Independent groups had expressed concern that terrorist or extremist groups
could attempt to board the British ship, especially since Panama has no army to
protect the canal. The country relies on a national police force for security.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Pacific Swan, carrying waste from a French nuclear plant to Japan,
completed the eight-hour crossing without incident early Monday, said Jorge Luis
Quijano, director of maritime operations for the canal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The crossing was peaceful and well organized,'' Quijano said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute had expressed concern about
the trip, noting that environmental activists with Greenpeace boarded the
Pacific Swan two years ago just as it was about to enter the canal.
</P>
<P>
	   Panama has insisted that is it ready to protect the canal, which was handed
over by the United States on Dec. 31.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Official Briefs Pope on Elian  </HEADLINE>
   By VANIA GRANDI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Cuba's foreign minister said Monday he briefed Pope
John Paul II -- but did not ask for intervention -- on the case of a Cuban boy
caught in a tug-of-war between the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian Gonzalez, now 6, was rescued at sea Nov. 25 after his mother drowned
trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Filipe Perez Roque said he talked to the pope about ``how
Elian is being kept separated from his father -- something the pope was very
worried about.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican's communique on the meeting made no mention of Elian. A Vatican
spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini, said later that there would be no comment
about Perez Roque's remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez Roque said he had not asked the pontiff to intervene, but said he
hoped the meeting would help raise international concern for Elian. Perez Roque
also plans stops in France, the Netherlands and Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled the boy must be
returned to his father in communist Cuba. But Attorney General Janet Reno last
week lifted an INS deadline so Elian's relatives in Miami can fight a federal
court battle to keep the boy. A Florida judge also has scheduled a hearing in
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Some U.S. politicians and Cuban-Americans have suggested congressional
action to give Elian permanent residency or even American citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it had been a Haitian or Mexican boy, they would have thrown him back
into the sea,'' Perez Roque said after meeting with Italian Premier Massimo
D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican used the papal audience and the minister's sessions with the
Vatican secretary of state and foreign minister to push for more religious
freedom in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Regarding church-state relations, ``the minister has restated the will of
his government to favor a mutual, harmonious collaboration,'' Vatican spokesman
Joaquin Navarro-Valls said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For its part the Holy See has expressed a wish for ever greater religious
liberty in the wake of what the Holy Father affirmed in his historic visit in
January 1998,'' the Vatican spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   During his visit to Cuba, John Paul made blunt calls for more freedoms,
including that of expression.
</P>
<P>
	   After nearly 40 years of tensions following the 1959 Cuban revolution that
brought Fidel Castro to power, church-state relations have improved over the
last few years, especially following John Paul's visit. Christmas, for example,
has been reinstated as a permanent holiday on the island thanks to the pope's
visit.

<HEADLINE> Famed Tiger May Have Been Killed  </HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR MAX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Forest officials have recovered a pelt that may
have come from Sita, a wild tiger that once graced the cover of National
Geographic magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   The 18-year-old female has not been seen in the Bandhavgarh National Park
since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The skin, found in the home of a man who has a record of poaching and theft,
bore marks similar to Sita, but a positive identification could not be made,
said Ranjit Talwar of the World Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether it is Sita or not, the fact is a tiger skin as been found. That
means all is not well,'' Talwar, an expert on tigers, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   India loses dozens of tigers to poachers every year. Bandhavgarh, in the
central state of Madhya Pradesh, is known as one of the best parks for seeing
tigers.
</P>
<P>
	   While 100,000 tigers roamed freely at the turn of the 20th century, only an
estimated 5,000 to 7,000 exist in the wild today, about half in India.
</P>
<P>
	   Sita was a prolific breeder who had six documented litters. Of her 18 known
cubs, only seven survived. She was 10 1/2 feet long.
</P>
<P>
	   In the December 1997 issue of National Geographic, writer Geoffrey C. Ward
described his first sighting of Sita as she slept over the remains of a deer she
had killed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing seemed to faze her -- nothing, until a rufous-and-white tree pie
smaller than a North American magpie fluttered down onto her kill. She was up
and fully awake in a millisecond, swatting at the terrified bird with one
enormous forepaw and roaring so loudly the sky seemed to split.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. Hero Recuperating After Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE PARRY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The car came toward them so fast that all Ursula
Webster could do was shove her 8-year-old son out of its path.
</P>
<P>
	   She recalls the thud as the vehicle struck her, sending her flying into the
air outside the London residence of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I was going up, I'm thinking, `I'm dying, this is it, my life is
ending,' and I could actually feel my bones breaking,'' Mrs. Webster said Monday
in a telephone interview from her hospital bed in Livingston. ``But when I hit
the ground and was still conscious, I knew it wasn't nearly that bad.''
</P>
<P>
	   The British tabloids are hailing the New Jersey woman as ``The Heroine of
Downing Street'' for saving her son from the speeding car that crashed into the
gates outside 10 Downing Street on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   She, her husband, David, and their three sons were sightseeing there because
they have virtually the same address in Livingston -- 10 Downing Place.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Webster returned home Sunday and had surgery Monday to fix her
shattered leg. She was in satisfactory condition at St. Barnabas Medical Center
following the operation to insert a stainless steel rod to stabilize her broken
right tibia, said her surgeon, Dr. Michael H. Rieber.
</P>
<P>
	   At Mrs. Webster's request, the music of New Jersey rocker Bruce Springsteen
was played during the operation.
</P>
<P>
	   She faces four to six months of rehabilitation, she said, and predicted it
would be difficult with three active children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I keep thinking this could have been so much worse,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The son Mrs. Webster pushed out of the way, Andrew, was brushed by the car's
door and Alex, 6, was grazed by the wing mirror. Peter, 3, and her husband were
not struck.
</P>
<P>
	   A man has been charged with causing grievous bodily harm and dangerous
driving, London police said. He was granted bail Monday and ordered to return to
court Jan. 31.

	   LONDON (AP) -- Glaxo Wellcome's planned acquisition of rival drugmaker
SmithKline Beecham would do more than create the world's largest pharmaceutical
company.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, announced Monday and worth about $76 billion in stock, is a clear

	   Just last week, Pfizer emerged as the likely winner in a battle with
American Home Products for U.S. drugmaker Warner-Lambert, while Monsanto is in
the process of merging with Pharmacia and Upjohn. Industry analysts predict
other blue-chip names, including Eli Lilly, Schering Plough, Novartis,
Bristol-Myers Squibb and even merger-averse Merck, won't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that eventually about six to 10 companies will own the
pharmaceutical market," said Hemant Shah, an independent industry analyst based
in Warren, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, the pharmaceutical business still has many competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the combined Glaxo and SmithKline would control just 7.3 percent of
global sales, although it would dominate the markets for asthma, AIDS, migraines
and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say that consolidations are gathering momentum because drugmakers
are pinched between the ballooning costs of developing new drugs and the demands
of investors and shareholders that they deliver double-digit growth in profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Only by bulking up to pool research and development funds and by slashing
costs can pharmaceutical firms avoid financial peril in an ever more Darwinian
market.
</P>
<P>
	   "To succeed in this industry, you must be top-tier, and preferably, you must
have market leadership," Glaxo Wellcome chairman Sir Richard Sykes told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham said their union would yield $1.6
billion in annual savings after three years. They said job cuts were expected,
but that they were still deciding where to make them.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of both companies fell on the London Stock Exchange Monday as some
investors took profits following a runup Friday when the companies announced
they were in talks. In addition, some analysts said they were disappointed in
the cost savings predicted by the companies. Glaxo fell nearly 5 percent while
SmithKline fell 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The two British-based companies plan to keep their corporate headquarters in
London, but open a new operational headquarters in or near New York.
</P>
<P>
	   They would keep their U.S. businesses separate. SmithKline has a research
and development unit based in Philadelphia and a non-prescription drug business
in Pittsburgh. Glaxo's American operations are headquartered in Research
Triangle Park, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Their union comes two years after previous merger talks collapsed in a fight
over which executives would run the company
</P>
<P>
	   The apparent success of Pfizer's hostile bid for Warner-Lambert gave new
impetus to the idea, said Kevin Wilson, an industry analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pfizer-Warner-Lambert has acted as a catalyst," he said. "I could easily
imagine them saying, 'Look, this is a good idea. We might as well get on with it
now.' "
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo SmithKline would have worldwide pharmaceutical sales of an estimated
$24.9 billion, based on 1998 annual figures. But a combined
Pfizer-Warner-Lambert would be close behind with a 6.7 percent market share, and
it would be gaining fast, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products -- the apparent loser in the fight for Warner-Lambert
-- has failed three times to combine with other drug companies and looks like an
increasingly attractive takeover target for a European company such as Bayer
that might be aiming to expand its U.S. pharmaceuticals business, said Andy
Penman, an analyst at London brokerage Greig Middleton.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Merck, which has publicly sworn off mergers in the past, might have its
hand forced if it wants to keep up with more financially powerful rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question that Merck is the best in the business in terms of
developing new drugs, but it's going to be very difficult to compete when there
are companies with R and D budgets that are twice that of Merck," said Shah, the
New Jersey-based analyst.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's strength lies in its top anti-migraine drug, Imitrex, and in
treatments for asthma and viral infections, including HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline's top products include the antibiotic Augmentin, the
antidepressant Paxil and a new diabetes drug, Avandia. It also has a strong
vaccines business.
</P>
<P>
	   But both firms are feeling pressure because their top drugs are facing
expiration of their patents, allowing cheaper generics into the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's leading ulcer drug Zantac lost its patent protection in 1997, and
SmithKline's lucrative Augmentin will lose its patent in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Gore Seeing Black Support in South  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore holds a huge advantage over Bill Bradley among
black voters -- a group with significant influence later in the Democratic
nomination fight. They help form the vice president's ``Southern firewall.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even with victories in New Hampshire and a few other early primary states,
Bradley couldn't topple Gore without more support from blacks, particularly in
the South. That's why the Bradley campaign is questioning the vice president's
commitment to blacks and reminding voters about the former New Jersey senator's
own record on race relations.
</P>
<P>
	   The hurdles facing Bradley are high, but not insurmountable, according to
Democratic pollsters and activists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Blacks are serving as Gore's Southern firewall: If Bradley happens to win
Iowa and New York, then they go south and Gore has a remarkable number of black
voters,'' said Democratic pollster Ron Lester, who surveys for several black
congressmen. ``Black voters have no reason to leave Gore, but if Bradley can
blow Gore out in a couple of states, he might be able to catch on.''
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates debated Monday -- Martin Luther King Day -- in a minority-run
forum in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls consistently show blacks backing Gore over Bradley by a 2-to-1 margin.
That edge won't help in Iowa or New Hampshire, where few blacks are registered
to vote, but the impact grows later on.
</P>
<P>
	   In nearly half of the 11 states conducting Democratic primaries March 7,
blacks made up at least 10 percent of the vote in the 1992 presidential
primaries. Still, Bradley's ties to New York and other Northeast states -- and
his ability to raise money in California -- bode well for his chances in major
states on that day.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days later, votes will be cast in South Carolina, where 43 percent of
the Democrats who participated in the 1996 primaries were black.
</P>
<P>
	   On March 14, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas
conduct primaries. Oklahoma is the only one of those states without a sizable
black vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore's going to come out of the South with enormous margins and it's
basically going to be all over but the crying,' said David Bositis, an expert on
black voting patterns with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wouldn't say it's automatic,'' said Silas Lee, a political pollster from
New Orleans who cautioned that Gore has yet to prove his black supporters are
passionate enough to turn out and vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say Gore owes most of his support to President Clinton, who is
viewed favorably by nine out of 10 blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Thank God I don't have to run against Bill Clinton,'' Bradley jokingly
told an Iowa youngster Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Clinton's impact on the race was clear in Monday's debate, when Bradley
chastised Gore for not securing a presidential order to end racial profiling of
criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing by his man, Gore replied: ``I don't think President Bill Clinton
needs a lecture from Sen. Bill Bradley on how to stand up and fight'' for
blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is benefiting from administration policies, such as increasing the
minimum wage, and from a perception that Clinton-Gore put the brakes on plans by
congressional Republicans that would have hurt blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The economy has helped, too. For the first time in memory, Bositis found in
1998 that blacks were more likely than whites to say they were better off
financially than the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   The Monica Lewinsky inquiry increased Clinton's support among blacks, many
of whom felt the president was targeted because of his support of black issues,
pollsters said. Gore's steadfast support of his boss may be hurting him among
moderate Democrats and independent voters, but it has helped him among blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   There are few distinctions between Gore and Bradley on race and issues that
appeal to blacks. Each has an interesting story to tell: Gore says his father,
Albert Gore Sr., lost his Tennessee Senate seat in the fight for civil rights;
Bradley talks about growing up in a racially mixed community and playing
professional basketball with blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Irked that Gore is benefiting from Clinton's good will, Bradley aides say
their boss will gain support as blacks get to know him. Mark Alexander, a black
adviser, said the administration improved the plight of blacks, ``but I don't
think that is credit Gore should be taking.''
</P>
<P>
	   Civil rights leader Roger Wilkins said, ``The vice president is a friend of
mine ... and I like him, but I do not believe he is as mature as Senator Bradley
and I don't believe Senator Bradley's commitment to civil rights can be matched
by anyone.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an appeal to black voters, Bradley argues that he is the only candidate
to make race and poverty central to his campaign. The Clinton-Gore prosperity
leaves too many Americans behind, Bradley said Monday as he put his complaints
in the words of Martin Luther King Jr.: ``That's not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore advisers say privately that the black vote could swing if Bradley gains
momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic nominee, whoever that might be, will make it his first task
to reunite the black community for the general election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a vote he's going to have to fight for,'' Republican front-runner
George W. Bush warned in a telephone interview from Austin, Texas. He earned 27
percent of the black vote in the 1998 Texas governor's election.

<HEADLINE> Protests, Speeches Mark MLK Jr. Day  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Decrying the Confederate flag as a symbol of slavery
and racism, nearly 50,000 people marched to South Carolina's Statehouse on
Martin Luther King Day to demand the banner be taken down.
</P>
<P>
	   They also said the slain civil rights leader should be honored with a
permanent state holiday. South Carolina state workers now can take off on the
King holiday or another of their choice, including one of several tied to
Confederate anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The flag is coming down today,'' marchers sang as they walked six blocks
from a downtown church to the Statehouse. Some carried signs reading, ``Your
heritage is my slavery.''
</P>
<P>
	   Across the country Monday, Americans remembered King with marches and
speeches urging the nation to commit itself to his principles and fulfill his
dream of racial harmony and equality.
</P>
<P>
	   This was the first year that the King holiday was observed in some form in
all 50 states, and the 15th year it has been celebrated as a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Atlanta, Vice President Al Gore joined King's widow, Coretta Scott King,
and other family members in placing two wreaths at King's grave. King, who was
assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968, would have been 71 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today, nearly 32 years after we lost him, we still need Martin Luther King
Jr. more than ever,'' Gore said from the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church,
where King served as pastor during the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ''`We shall overcome' needs to be more than just a look into our past, but a
way to find the resolve to find the true America we know we can be at last.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton helped paint a community computer center in Washington.
``Every time you give a little, you always get more back,'' Clinton said.
``Let's remember that as Dr. King's enduring legacy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among the celebrations elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Operation Hope, a community group in New Orleans, honored King by
offering $50 for guns, no questions asked. The group said the weapons would be
turned over to police to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Several hundred people of many different races marched in Rochester,
Minn., where the Rev. Jesse Jackson was the featured speaker. Seven-year-old
Naava Johnson, at the march with her grandmother, said that if King had never
been born, ``We'd still be slaves.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber was cast as President Kennedy in a play about
King's life at Willamette University. Frank Thompson, assistant director of the
Oregon Corrections Department, got the role of King.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Several hundred people marched through downtown Memphis to Claiborne
Temple, where King held strategy meetings while leading a sanitation workers'
strike in his final days.
</P>
<P>
	   -- About 100,000 people watched a King parade in Liberty City, a Miami
neighborhood. The event featured 50 floats, five bands and local government
leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Attorney General Janet Reno addressed a diverse crowd in the old
courthouse in St. Louis where the infamous Dred Scott case was tried. She said
Americans should reach out to people in need -- such as the more than 2 million
inmates who will be released from prisons over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just here to work on my bigotry,'' Bob Powers said as he left the
courthouse. ``Even when you think you've got rid of it, there's always a little
bigotry left.''
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone used the occasion to celebrate King. In Oneonta, Ala., a group
blocked from flying the Confederate flag at the courthouse brought its own pole
and did it anyway, to honor Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's birthday, which is
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody wants to talk about Martin Luther King, and we're tired of it.
We want them to talk about our hero,'' said Benjamin Hestley, commander of the
38-member St. Clair Camp 308 of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   At the South Carolina rally against the flag, state police estimated the
crowd at 46,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Frederick C. James, a retired African Methodist Episcopal bishop, said he
was reminded of marching with King in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were just about as sure in 1963 that we were going to be victorious
with the civil rights law, which was enacted in 1964, as we are now that this
flag will come down off of that Statehouse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A few white marchers joined the mostly black crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Margaret Abbott, 59, wore her grandmother's Daughters of Confederate
Veterans certificate around her neck. She said her ancestors fought in the Civil
and Revolutionary wars so she could have freedom of choice, and she wants the
flag removed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a lot more important things to do than fight over this stupid
flag,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is waging a
tourism boycott against South Carolina over the flag. Many marchers from out of
state honored the boycott by sleeping Sunday night on cots in church basements
instead of checking into hotels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the kind of thing we need to be doing on Martin Luther King's
birthday,'' Martin Luther King III, King's son, said at a prayer breakfast.
``The flag is a terrible symbol that brings a lot of negative energy. And while
we believe the flag has an appropriate place, it just does not belong on top of
the Capitol because it is not a sign of unification.''
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina raised the flag in 1962 during the Civil War centennial, and
it flies atop the Statehouse along with the U.S. and state flags.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters say the banner is a symbol of the state's heritage and honors
Confederate soldiers killed in the Civil War. More than 6,000 flag supporters
marched a week ago at the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Only South Carolina's Legislature can lower the flag.
</P>
<P>
	   While South Carolina is the only state still flying the flag from its
Capitol, Georgia incorporated the symbol into its state flag in 1956.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition now wants tourists to boycott Georgia until
the emblem is removed. Activists are threatening to begin the boycott on Jan.
30, the day the Super Bowl will be held in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> 100 Sioux Seize Pine Ridge Office  </HEADLINE>
   By CHET BROKAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- About 100 Oglala Sioux who accuse the tribe of
financial mismanagement have taken over tribal headquarters and demanded that
the governing council step down.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters said Monday they will remain there until they are satisfied
authorities will investigate their allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday afternoon, however, members of the tribal council voted to have
the protesters thrown out of the building. They voted to have tribal law
officers enforce tribal laws that ban the spread of false propaganda and actions
that interfere with the conduct of council business.
</P>
<P>
	   Council members said they expect the tribe's public safety director to evict
the protesters Monday night or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The group, which is allied with tribal President Harold Dean Salway, took
control of the tribal building at the Pine Ridge Reservation on Sunday. About
100 people stayed there Sunday night and Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the unarmed group are calling for an audit and have demanded the
immediate resignation of tribal Treasurer Wesley ``Chuck'' Jacobs and all 17
members of the tribal council. They also have asked the FBI to seize tribal
records dealing with law enforcement, housing and other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bottom line is, we want accountability and responsibility by our
elected officials,'' said group spokesman Dale Looks Twice.
</P>
<P>
	   The takeover resulted from months of disagreement over financial issues.
Salway suspended Jacobs in October for allegedly mismanaging tribal funds, but a
tribal judge later reinstated the treasurer.
</P>
<P>
	   Eileen Janis, a spokeswoman for Salway, said the president and others have
become frustrated with Jacobs and the council majority that always supports the
treasurer. ``We want a complete audit of everything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs was not home Monday. His wife said he was at a tribal meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Vukelich, senior supervisory agent with the FBI in Rapid City, said
Monday afternoon that the protesters have not provided specific allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the tribe's 38,000 members live on the reservation, which
consistently ranks as one of the poorest areas of the nation.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Clash in 6th Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley challenged Vice President Al Gore
Monday night to demand the administration issue an immediate order banning
racial profiling, but Gore shot back in campaign debate, ``I don't think
President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Sen. Bill Bradley'' on standing up
for blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   In their sixth and final debate before next Monday's kickoff Iowa caucuses,
the two Democratic hopefuls agreed the Confederate flag should come down from
atop the South Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore went one step further, saying ``it's only the Republican candidates for
president'' who disagree because they are ``so scared of the extreme right
wing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men said the father of Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban boy at the
center of an international dispute, should come to the United States to press
his claim for custody.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of racially sensitive issues came up in the hour-long televised
debate on the federal holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King, Jr., a
``Black-Brown Forum'' that both men hoped to use to appeal to voters in other
states with a larger minority population than Iowa. MSNBC carried the event
live.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues ranged from racially insensitive comments made by Atlanta Braves
baseball player John Rocker, to the controversial New York minister, Al
Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is the national front-runner by far in the public opinion polls, and
also is hoping for a clear triumph over Bradley in Iowa next week. Bradley leads
in polls in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary eight days after Iowa's
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Perched on stools on a debate stage in Iowa's capital city, both men said
firmly they oppose racial profiling, the practice by which some police offers
target racial minorities for traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all know what driving while black is,'' said Bradley, who has made race
relations a cornerstone of his career in public life. ``It is breathing while
black.''
</P>
<P>
	   When Gore said he would issue an executive order banning the practice,
Bradley served him a challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a president now,'' he said. ``You serve with him. I want you to
walk into his office and say, `Sign this executive order today.'''
</P>
<P>
	   His remarks were greeted with applause, but Gore had a ready reply.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley
about how to fight for African Americans'' and Latinos, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to talk the talk. It's another thing to walk the walk,''
Gore said, to scattered boos from the audience. Gore also added that the mayor
of Newark, Sharpe James, ``asked for help on the policy of racial profiling when
you were in the Senate'' representing New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's here today, and he's supporting me because President Clinton and I
have helped him with racial profiling,'' Gore the vice president added.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore sidestepped a question of whether he would appoint a Hispanic to the
Supreme Court, and to list some possible contenders for the seat. He jokingly
asked his questioner whether he possessed a law degree, then said he would make
appointments that reflect ``the diversity of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said, ``I could never appoint someone who would turn the clock back
on civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proceedings were disrupted briefly by a young woman who stood at her
seat in the audience to pose a question about global warming. As security guards
moved to silence her, the moderator, Tavis Smiley of Black Entertainment
Television, quipped, ``I get my 15 minutes (of fame) and this is what happens to
me.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederate flag has surfaced as an issue among Republican presidential
contenders, who are competing in a South Carolina primary on Feb. 19. The
leading GOP hopefuls, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain,
have refused to take a stand on the issue, saying it is up to the residents of
South Carolina to decide whether the flag should fly atop their statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   While both Gore and Bradley said they believe the flag should come down, the
vice president also noted that some people view the flag favorably. ``We have to
try to bring them into a shared understanding of why, as a symbol, it is so
hurtful,'' he said. Gore also told his questioner he would not agree to
participate in an NAACP boycott of South Carolina, because ``I don't think a
president of the United States should ever boycott an individual state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said the flag ``offends our common humanity and it is not the future
of our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's only the Republican candidates for president who are so scared of the
extreme right wing, that they will be tolerant of intolerance, less they offend
the offensive. It ought to come down,'' Gore added.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacks account for a small minority of the vote in Iowa, but given the date
and fact that a black state lawmaker organized the event, a ``Black-Brown''
forum, the two Democrats pledged support for continued efforts to support civil
rights and combat racism.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men condemned the racist remarks made recently by Atlanta Braves
pitcher John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley used a question on the issue to recount that as a professional
basketball player three decades ago, part of his job on the New York Knicks was
to take aside any white player ``who didn't understand'' the need to treat
blacks respectfully.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates were asked if they would agree to the Rev. Al Sharpton's
request for a public meeting. Gore ducked, saying he had met with Sharpton in a
larger group. Bradley said he had visited Sharpton's church in Harlem, though he
added, ``I don't agree with Al Sharpton on everything.''
</P>
<P>
	   The moderators asked if it was unfair to minorities for the majority-white
states of Iowa and New Hampshire to have such a disproportionate voice in the
early primaries. Both said yes, and cited the more personal nature of
campaigning in those small states.

	   They also said the slain civil rights leader should be honored with a
permanent state holiday. South Carolina state workers now can take off on the
King holiday or another of their choice, including one of several tied to
Confederate anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The flag is coming down today,'' marchers sang as they walked six blocks
from a downtown church to the Statehouse. Some carried signs reading, ``Your
heritage is my slavery.''
</P>
<P>
	   Across the country Monday, Americans remembered King with marches and
speeches urging the nation to commit itself to his principles and fulfill his
dream of racial harmony and equality.
</P>
<P>
	   This was the first year that the King holiday was observed in some form in
all 50 states, and the 15th year it has been celebrated as a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Atlanta, Vice President Al Gore joined King's widow, Coretta Scott King,
and other family members in placing two wreaths at King's grave. King, who was
assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968, would have been 71 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today, nearly 32 years after we lost him, we still need Martin Luther King
Jr. more than ever,'' Gore said from the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church,
where King served as pastor during the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ''`We shall overcome' needs to be more than just a look into our past, but a
way to find the resolve to find the true America we know we can be at last.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton helped paint a community computer center in Washington.
``Every time you give a little, you always get more back,'' Clinton said.
``Let's remember that as Dr. King's enduring legacy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among the celebrations elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Operation Hope, a community group in New Orleans, honored King by
offering $50 for guns, no questions asked. The group said the weapons would be
turned over to police to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Several hundred people of many different races marched in Rochester,
Minn., where the Rev. Jesse Jackson was the featured speaker. Seven-year-old
Naava Johnson, at the march with her grandmother, said that if King had never
been born, ``We'd still be slaves.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber was cast as President Kennedy in a play about
King's life at Willamette University. Frank Thompson, assistant director of the
Oregon Corrections Department, got the role of King.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Several hundred people marched through downtown Memphis to Claiborne
Temple, where King held strategy meetings while leading a sanitation workers'
strike in his final days.
</P>
<P>
	   -- About 100,000 people watched a King parade in Liberty City, a Miami
neighborhood. The event featured 50 floats, five bands and local government
leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Attorney General Janet Reno addressed a diverse crowd in the old
courthouse in St. Louis where the infamous Dred Scott case was tried. She said
Americans should reach out to people in need -- such as the more than 2 million
inmates who will be released from prisons over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just here to work on my bigotry,'' Bob Powers said as he left the
courthouse. ``Even when you think you've got rid of it, there's always a little
bigotry left.''
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone used the occasion to celebrate King. In Oneonta, Ala., a group
blocked from flying the Confederate flag at the courthouse brought its own pole
and did it anyway, to honor Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's birthday, which is
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody wants to talk about Martin Luther King, and we're tired of it.
We want them to talk about our hero,'' said Benjamin Hestley, commander of the
38-member St. Clair Camp 308 of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   At the South Carolina rally against the flag, state police estimated the
crowd at 46,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Frederick C. James, a retired African Methodist Episcopal bishop, said he
was reminded of marching with King in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were just about as sure in 1963 that we were going to be victorious
with the civil rights law, which was enacted in 1964, as we are now that this
flag will come down off of that Statehouse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A few white marchers joined the mostly black crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Margaret Abbott, 59, wore her grandmother's Daughters of Confederate
Veterans certificate around her neck. She said her ancestors fought in the Civil
and Revolutionary wars so she could have freedom of choice, and she wants the
flag removed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a lot more important things to do than fight over this stupid
flag,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is waging a
tourism boycott against South Carolina over the flag. Many marchers from out of
state honored the boycott by sleeping Sunday night on cots in church basements
instead of checking into hotels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the kind of thing we need to be doing on Martin Luther King's
birthday,'' Martin Luther King III, King's son, said at a prayer breakfast.
``The flag is a terrible symbol that brings a lot of negative energy. And while
we believe the flag has an appropriate place, it just does not belong on top of
the Capitol because it is not a sign of unification.''
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina raised the flag in 1962 during the Civil War centennial, and
it flies atop the Statehouse along with the U.S. and state flags.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters say the banner is a symbol of the state's heritage and honors
Confederate soldiers killed in the Civil War. More than 6,000 flag supporters
marched a week ago at the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Only South Carolina's Legislature can lower the flag.
</P>
<P>
	   While South Carolina is the only state still flying the flag from its
Capitol, Georgia incorporated the symbol into its state flag in 1956.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition now wants tourists to boycott Georgia until
the emblem is removed. Activists are threatening to begin the boycott on Jan.
30, the day the Super Bowl will be held in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Sharpton on King Day  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH J. HARPAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A long-awaited meeting between Hillary Rodham Clinton and
the Rev. Al Sharpton took place Monday at a Martin Luther King Jr. celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton also spoke at Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Harlem and
attended a King tribute at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. At each event, she
recalled meeting King in 1963 at age 15 when she traveled with her church youth
group to hear him speak in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He took my hand and shook it and I felt my life would never be the same,''
she said, adding that King's stirring speech that night inspired her to
``dedicate my life to public service.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, who is running for a Senate seat from New York, noted there
has been progress in blacks achieving equality, but added: ``There is still a
need for affirmative action.'' She quoted her husband, President Clinton, saying
of affirmative action, ``We need to mend it, not end it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the audience of about 300 at the Sharpton event repeatedly
interrupted the first lady with cheers, applause and occasional cries of ``Run
Hillary run!''
</P>
<P>
	   Afterwards, she met privately with Sharpton and several others, including
the parents of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed African immigrant who was killed by
four white police officers in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had a few private moments with them and expressed my personal sympathy
and condolences and shared my hope that justice is done,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial of the officers is set to begin soon in Albany, where it was moved
after an appellate court concluded the officers could not get a fair trial in
the Bronx. Sharpton and Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y, have asked the U.S. Justice
Department to consider investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there is a role for the federal government, I would certainly encourage
and urge that that would occur,'' said Mrs. Clinton. She said it was too early
to say whether such a step was merited.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton did not agree on every issue raised at the Sharpton event, at
one point defending sanctions against Iraq despite murmurs of disapproval.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She did very well,'' Sharpton said afterwards. ``She did not show any
reluctance at all to deal with the issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Separately Monday, Mrs. Clinton 's likely Republican opponent, New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, held a prayer breakfast at the official mayor's
residence and attended a dinner by the Congress of Racial Equality. But he
skipped the King tribute at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which he has attended
for the past few years, because Mrs. Clinton decided to attend it.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly before Mrs. Clinton entered Sharpton's headquarters, another
speaker, the Rev. Charles Norris, said he had missed one of King's
demonstrations because he was working. Referring to his employers, Norris said:
``Miller No. 1 was a Jew. Miller No. 2 was a Jew. I then went to work for
another Jew -- Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton later told reporters that before she arrived, ``I heard that
one of the speakers made some divisive comments, which I soundly reject.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Clash in 6th Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley challenged Vice President Al Gore
Monday night to demand the administration issue an immediate order banning
racial profiling, but Gore shot back in campaign debate, ``I don't think
President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Sen. Bill Bradley'' on standing up
for blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   In their sixth and final debate before next Monday's kickoff Iowa caucuses,
the two Democratic presidential hopefuls agreed the Confederate flag should come
down from atop the South Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore went one step further, saying ``it's only the Republican candidates for
president'' who disagree because they are ``so scared of the extreme right
wing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men said the father of Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban boy at the
center of an international dispute, should come to the United States to press
his claim for custody.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of racially sensitive issues came up in the hour-long televised
debate on the federal holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King, Jr., a
``Black-Brown Forum'' that both men hoped to use to appeal to voters in other
states with a larger minority population than Iowa. MSNBC carried the event
live.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues ranged from racially insensitive comments made by Atlanta Braves
baseball player John Rocker, to the controversial New York minister, Al
Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is the national front-runner by far in the public opinion polls, and
also is hoping for a clear triumph over Bradley in Iowa next week. Bradley leads
in most polls in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary eight days after
Iowa's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Perched on stools on a debate stage in Iowa's capital city, both men said
firmly they oppose racial profiling, the practice by which some police offers
target racial minorities for traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all know what driving while black is,'' said Bradley, who has made race
relations a cornerstone of his career in public life. ``It is breathing while
black.''
</P>
<P>
	   When Gore said he would issue an executive order banning the practice,
Bradley served him a challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a president now,'' he said. ``You serve with him. I want you to
walk into his office and say, `Sign this executive order today.'''
</P>
<P>
	   His remarks were greeted with applause, but Gore had a ready reply.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley
about how to fight for African Americans'' and Latinos, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to talk the talk. It's another thing to walk the walk,''
Gore said, to scattered boos from the audience. Gore also added that the mayor
of Newark, Sharpe James, ``asked for help on the policy of racial profiling when
you were in the Senate'' representing New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's here today, and he's supporting me because President Clinton and I
have helped him with racial profiling,'' Gore the vice president added.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore sidestepped a question of whether he would appoint a Hispanic to the
Supreme Court, and to list some possible contenders for the seat. He jokingly
asked his questioner whether he possessed a law degree, then said he would make
appointments that reflect ``the diversity of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said, ``I could never appoint someone who would turn the clock back
on civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proceedings were disrupted briefly by a young woman who stood at her
seat in the audience to pose a question about global warming. As security guards
moved to silence her, the moderator, Tavis Smiley of Black Entertainment
Television, quipped, ``I get my 15 minutes (of fame) and this is what happens to
me.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederate flag has surfaced as an issue among Republican presidential
contenders, who are competing in a South Carolina primary on Feb. 19. The
leading GOP hopefuls, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain,
have refused to take a stand on the issue, saying it is up to the residents of
South Carolina to decide whether the flag should fly atop their statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   While both Gore and Bradley said they believe the flag should come down, the
vice president also noted that some people view the flag favorably. ``We have to
try to bring them into a shared understanding of why, as a symbol, it is so
hurtful,'' he said. Gore also told his questioner he would not agree to
participate in an NAACP boycott of South Carolina, because ``I don't think a
president of the United States should ever boycott an individual state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said the flag ``offends our common humanity and it is not the future
of our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's only the Republican candidates for president who are so scared of the
extreme right wing, that they will be tolerant of intolerance, less they offend
the offensive. It ought to come down,'' Gore added.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacks account for a small minority of the vote in Iowa, but given the date
and fact that a black state lawmaker organized the event, a ``Black-Brown''
forum, the two Democrats pledged support for continued efforts to support civil
rights and combat racism.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men condemned the racist remarks made recently by Atlanta Braves
pitcher John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley used a question on the issue to recount that as a professional
basketball player three decades ago, part of his job on the New York Knicks was
to take aside any white player ``who didn't understand'' the need to treat
blacks respectfully.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates were asked if they would agree to the Rev. Al Sharpton's
request for a public meeting. Gore ducked, saying he had met with Sharpton in a
larger group. Bradley said he had visited Sharpton's church in Harlem, though he
added, ``I don't agree with Al Sharpton on everything.''
</P>
<P>
	   The moderators asked if it was unfair to minorities for the majority-white
states of Iowa and New Hampshire to have such a disproportionate voice in the
early primaries. Both said yes, and cited the more personal nature of
campaigning in those small states.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Earnings More Than Triple  </HEADLINE>
    By MARIO FOX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) -- Motorola Inc. on Monday reported earnings for the
final quarter of 1999 more than tripled from the year ago period, beating
analysts expectations as demand for digital wireless telephones surged.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter earnings excluding special items were $514 million, or 82
cents per share, compared with $159 million, or 26 cents per share, in the 1998
period. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial were expecting the
company to earn 81 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically, it's right on target," Pete Peterson, an analyst in San
Francisco for Prudential Volpe Technology, said. "They beat the (Wall) Street's
prediction by a penny so the Street will look favorably at this."
</P>
<P>
	   Motorola, based in this suburb northwest of Chicago, reported sales of $8.5
billion in the fourth quarter, up 2 percent from $8.3 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the fourth quarter was $349 million, or 56 cents per share,
compared with $159 million, or 26 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings for the year were up 279 percent to $1.2 billion, or $1.94 a share,
up from $317 million, or 53 cents a share, in 1998. Sales rose nearly 9 percent
to $30 billion from $27.6 billion in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Several low-growth Motorola businesses have been sold in the past 12 months
and the company recently bought General Instrument Corp., maker of cable-boxes,
for $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   "This quarter culminates a year in which we achieved significant improvement
in financial performance from our digital wireless phone and semiconductor
businesses and benefited from our corporate-wide restructuring actions," Robert
L. Growney, president and chief operating officer, said in the earnings
statement. "We have also made investments and formed promising alliances in
third-generation wireless, Internet, broadband and semiconductor technologies."
</P>
<P>
	   The communications and equipment maker appears to have rebounded well from a
rough stretch in which it underwent a billion-dollar restructuring and laid off
24,000 people in late 1998 and early 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said sales of wireless phones increased significantly during
1999, especially in Asia. The increased demand is expected to continue into the
first and second quarters of this year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is very bullish," Peterson said. "They were under the gun before, they
promised to make changes, they made the changes and we are seeing the results,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Haitian Kids To Be Reunited With Mom  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL NORTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- The two Haitian children still lack passports,
but they have a more valuable treasure: permission to join their mother in
Florida and, possibly, begin a new life far from the privations of their native
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
	   Marc Yvens Dieubon, 10, and Germanie, 8, were typically polite and reserved
as they waited Monday for exit papers from the Haitian government. But they
turned giddy when they thought about their reunion with their mother, who is in
a Florida hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You are always on my mind,'' was the message Germanie asked to send to her
mother. ``I am longing to see you again.''
</P>
<P>
	   The siblings were separated from their mother, Yvena Rhinvil, after a
smuggling boat packed with 411 would-be migrants ran aground off the Florida
coast on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Rhinvil, 33, who is pregnant, was one of four people brought ashore for
medical treatment. Her children were left on the boat and were among the 407
people returned to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They took our mother away. We cried, but nobody asked us why,'' said Marc,
who along with his sister rode in different section of the rickety vessel,
squeezed together so tightly that they had to sleep hunched over on a bench.
They hardly moved during the several days they spent at sea.
</P>
<P>
	   The siblings became the focus of an intense lobby by Haitian-Americans who
contrasted their plight with the immense attention given Elian Gonzalez, the
6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba's government is demanding that Gonzalez, rescued after a smuggling
accident off Florida, be returned to his father in Cuba. Gonzalez's relatives in
Miami, backed by Cuban-American exile leaders, are demanding he be allowed to
remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The two cases underscored what critics say is a double standard between
Cubans and others who seek refuge in the United States. Thanks to a 1966 law,
Cubans who reach shore usually are allowed to stay. Haitians and others are
usually repatriated unless they successfully navigate the complex and difficult
political asylum process.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service granted the children
humanitarian parole on Thursday. INS officials say U.S. Coast Guard officers
didn't know Rhinvil had children on board before they took her from the boat.
</P>
<P>
	   Enthusiastically, Marc and Germanie showed off the English they'd learned
from Coast Guard officers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One, two, three, four,'' they counted in proud and happy unison. Dark eyes
gleaming, they rattled off the numbers all the way to 10 in the offices of the
National Coalition for Haitian Rights, which has given them haven in an
undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
	   The identity and location of their father isn't known.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvena Rhinvil has applied for political asylum, said Pierre Esperance,
director of the Haitian rights group. He said he was optimistic that she will
succeed.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton meets with Sharpton on King Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The long-awaited meeting between Hillary Rodham Clinton
and the Rev. Al Sharpton took place Monday at a Martin Luther King Jr.
celebration, but the only person who took any flak during the event was somebody
who wasn't there - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
<P>
	   "The only mayor of a big city that could not go into an African-American
community on Martin Luther King Day is the mayor of this city," Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani held a prayer breakfast at Gracie Mansion Monday morning and was
one of several Republican officials who attended a dinner Monday night given by
the Congress of Racial Equality, which is led by the conservative black activist
Roy Innes.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor skipped a King tribute at the Brooklyn Academy of Music that he
has attended for the past few years because Mrs. Clinton decided to attend it.
</P>
<P>
	   "It became a political event once they invited Mrs. Clinton," Ms. Mindel
said. She added that the mayor spent the day working on the city budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton also spoke at the Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Harlem. At
all three events, she recalled having met King when she was 15 in 1963, having
been brought with her church youth group to hear him speak in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   "He took my hand and shook it and I felt my life would never be the same,"
she said, adding that King's stirring speech that night - titled "Remaining
Awake Through a Great Revolution" - inspired her to "dedicate my life to public
service."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton noted there has been progress in blacks achieving equality, but
added: "There is still a need for affirmative action." She quoted her husband,
President Clinton, saying of affirmative action, "We need to mend it, not end
it."
</P>
<P>
	   She was accompanied to Sharpton's headquarters by former Mayors David
Dinkins and Ed Koch, along with a number of other elected Democratic officials.
The audience of about 300 repeatedly interrupted her remarks with cheers,
applause and occasional cries of "Run Hillary run!"
</P>
<P>
	   Afterwards, she met privately with Sharpton and several others, including
the parents of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed African immigrant who was killed by
four white police officers in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had a few private moments with them and expressed my personal sympathy
and condolences and shared my hope that justice is done," Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial of the officers who killed Diallo is set to begin soon in Albany.
It was moved from the Bronx because an appellate court concluded the officers
could not get a fair trial there. Sharpton and U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel of
Harlem have asked the U.S. Justice Department to consider a federal
investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there is a role for the federal government, I would certainly encourage
and urge that that would occur," said Mrs. Clinton. But she said it was too
early to say whether federal intervention is merited.

speaker, Rev. Charles Norris, said he had missed one of King's demonstrations
because he was working. Referring to his former employers, Norris said: "Miller
No. 1 was a Jew. Miller No. 2 was a Jew. I was then employed by yet another Jew
by the name of Jesus ... and will not be fired until he thinks it's necessary."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton later told reporters that before she arrived, "I heard that one
of the speakers made some divisive comments, which I soundly reject."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton said he had not heard Norris' remarks.

<HEADLINE> Group Wants Global Warming Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By KEN THOMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Braving an icy 28-degree evening, members of Ozone
Action rallied around their 25-foot inflatable ear of corn outside the scene of
Monday night's Brown-Black Presidential Forum, calling for a plan to combat
global warming.
</P>
<P>
	   Kate Simmons, spokeswoman for the group, which studies global warming, said
the organization was still hoping that one of the candidates -- Vice President
Al Gore or Bill Bradley -- will directly address the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No candidate has presented a detailed plan for action yet,'' Simmons said.
``We've been at this for 2 1/2 weeks. Once we've moved on with Iowa, we'll go
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   The group plans simultaneous events Tuesday in Ames, Cedar Falls and Iowa
City to release a scientific report on global warming.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   As a moderator was about to ask the second question of the debate, a young
woman affiliated with Ozone Action left her seat and walked toward the front of
the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to know what you're going to do about global warming,'' said Kim
DeFeo, 23, a member of the organizations' Iowa field team.
</P>
<P>
	   She was immediately grabbed by security and escorted out of the auditorium.
Neither Gore nor Bradley had a chance to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   DeFeo later was taken in for questioning by Secret Service agents, who
declined to comment. Police also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   DeFeo apparently had discussed with other group members the possibility of
disrupting the nationally televised debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We talked about it and it was a pretty spontaneous thing. She had fire in
her belly and she wanted to see what the candidates would say,'' said Simmons,
the Ozone Action spokeswoman. Simmons, too, was questioned by Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley weren't the only candidates with supporters outside the
debate site.
</P>
<P>
	   Perennial presidential contender Lyndon LaRouche, 78, had three supporters
on hand, one of whom carried a large, neon orange sign that said: ``Dump Gore's
Dixiecrat Racism. Vote LaRouche, The Third Party Candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Baker, who works in LaRouche's Leesburg, Va., office, said the candidate
is the only one who recognizes that there is a severe financial meltdown around
the world. Baker said LaRouche is the only one who can mobilize this nation as
well as protect U.S. farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Cecil Conry, who farms near Elliott in southwest Iowa, said LaRouche is
taken seriously, but is ignored by the media and crowded out by the Democratic
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   LaRouche has filed paperwork to run in the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's wife Ernestine was seen kissing and hugging people before the
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   A man who was pecked on the cheek wouldn't talk to reporters, but a woman
next to him, swept up in a big bear hug, shared her story.
</P>
<P>
	   Julie Turner, from Ridgewood, N.J., said she was Bill Bradley's first
volunteer in New Jersey. She began working on his presidential campaign in
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm old enough to remember government when you believed in what you could
do and how you could contribute to your country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   To emphasize her point, she exclaimed: ``Look, I have gray hair.''
</P>
<P>
	   Today's generation, she said, doesn't share her feelings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Kids today don't have that. They don't trust government. Bill Bradley
could rebuild that trust,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Quincy Suthers, 56, a Gore supporter from Des Moines, wasn't too impressed
upon seeing NBA Hall of Famer Bill Russell in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell was in town campaigning for Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bill Russell really means nothing. What does he know about government?''
Suthers said. ``He's just a basketball player. I like him, but he's just a
basketball player.''
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, Suthers said, ``Gore brought people actually running this
country.''
</P>
<P>
	   On hand for the vice president were Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman and Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Instead of selling the steak, Bradley's trying to sell his smell,'' said
Suthers, who added that he thought this was the most spirited debate so far.
``Gore brought out the meat in this discussion.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Russell strode into the media filing center with Bradley after the debate
and held an impromptu news conference with reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I suggested to him when he was in the Senate that he give me a call if he
was going to run for president,'' Russell said of Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell, who won 11 NBA championships with the Boston Celtics, said he first
met Bradley when he had completed his days as a basketball player at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
	   He always suspected that Bradley might run for president, but back then he
``was sizing him up as a player.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bill Bradley is my friend, and I'd like to see him be president,'' Russell
said. ``I have nothing bad or ill to say about the other candidates.''

<HEADLINE> 4-alarm fire raging in Newark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A raging, four-alarm fire tore through a candle
factory Monday evening, threatening nearby homes, sending plumes of choking
smoke for miles and forcing the evacuation of about 10 families.
<P>
	   No injuries were immediately reported, said Fire Chief James Langenbach.
</P>
<P>
	   The block-long commercial building housing the Mercury Candle Co., near
Interstate 78 and the Irvington border, began burning just after 3 p.m,
Langenbach said. Within an hour, the four-alarm fire drew as many as 130
firefighters from 29 surrounding fire companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters were hampered by subfreezing temperatures and gusting winds.
Just after 7 p.m., Langenbach said the winds had died down, but the fire was
still burning out of control.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we were all going to burn. But we got out OK," said employee
Maria Cuevas.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just went outside, and I heard two explosions," said Meg Batta, who was
working in a Pathmark supermarket a block and a half from the fire. "There's
heavy black smoke all over here. If the wind shifts, we might have to close."
</P>
<P>
	   Flames leapt from the building's roof, and heavy plumes of smoke obscured
motorists' vision on Route 78.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lord, it was so black you couldn't see a thing," said Myrtle Turner, who
lives two blocks from the fire on Fabyan Place. "There was fire all over. It was
terrible."
</P>
<P>
	   "We saw the flames, and heard sirens and ambulances," added Audrey Anderson,
an employee of The Rainbow Shop, a dress store on Lyons Avenue in Irvington,
also a block and a half from the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The building also contained a business that made kitchen equipment, said an
employee who declined to identify himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Langenbach said cold air had not frozen firefighters' hoses, but water was
freezing upon contact with the ground.

<HEADLINE> Glaxo Wellcome buyout of SmithKline Beecham speeds drug industry's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LONDON (AP) - Glaxo Wellcome's planned acquisition of rival drugmaker
SmithKline Beecham would do more than create the world's largest pharmaceutical
company.
<P>
	   The deal, announced Monday and worth about $76 billion in stock, is a clear
sign that the merger trend now reshaping other industries is accelerating in the
still-fragmented drug business.
</P>
<P>
	   Just last week, Pfizer emerged as the likely winner in a battle with
American Home Products for U.S. drugmaker Warner-Lambert, while Monsanto is in
the process of merging with Pharmacia and Upjohn. Industry analysts predict
other blue-chip names, including Eli Lilly, Schering Plough, Novartis,
Bristol-Myers Squibb and even merger-averse Merck, won't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that eventually about six to 10 companies will own the
pharmaceutical market," said Hemant Shah, an independent industry analyst based
in Warren, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, the pharmaceutical business still has many competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the combined Glaxo and SmithKline would control just 7.3 percent of
global sales, although it would dominate the markets for asthma, AIDS, migraines
and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say that consolidations are gathering momentum because drugmakers
are pinched between the ballooning costs of developing new drugs and the demands
of investors and shareholders that they deliver double-digit growth in profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Only by bulking up to pool research and development funds and by slashing
costs can pharmaceutical firms avoid financial peril in an ever more Darwinian
market.
</P>
<P>
	   "To succeed in this industry, you must be top-tier, and preferably, you must
have market leadership," Glaxo Wellcome chairman Sir Richard Sykes told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham said their union would yield $1.6
billion in annual savings after three years. They said job cuts were expected,
but that they were still deciding where to make them.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of both companies fell on the London Stock Exchange Monday as some
investors took profits following a runup Friday when the companies announced
they were in talks. In addition, some analysts said they were disappointed in
the cost savings predicted by the companies. Glaxo fell nearly 5 percent while
SmithKline fell 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The two British-based companies plan to keep their corporate headquarters in
London, but open a new operational headquarters in or near New York.
</P>
<P>
	   They would keep their U.S. businesses separate. SmithKline has a research
and development unit based in Philadelphia and a non-prescription drug business
in Pittsburgh. Glaxo's American operations are headquartered in Research
Triangle Park, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Their union comes two years after previous merger talks collapsed in a fight
over which executives would run the company
</P>
<P>
	   The apparent success of Pfizer's hostile bid for Warner-Lambert gave new
impetus to the idea, said Kevin Wilson, an industry analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pfizer-Warner-Lambert has acted as a catalyst," he said. "I could easily
imagine them saying, 'Look, this is a good idea. We might as well get on with it
now.' "
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo SmithKline would have worldwide pharmaceutical sales of an estimated
$24.9 billion, based on 1998 annual figures. But a combined
Pfizer-Warner-Lambert would be close behind with a 6.7 percent market share, and
it would be gaining fast, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products - the apparent loser in the fight for Warner-Lambert
- has failed three times to combine with other drug companies and looks like an
increasingly attractive takeover target for a European company such as Bayer
that might be aiming to expand its U.S. pharmaceuticals business, said Andy
Penman, an analyst at London brokerage Greig Middleton.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Merck, which has publicly sworn off mergers in the past, might have its
hand forced if it wants to keep up with more financially powerful rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question that Merck is the best in the business in terms of
developing new drugs, but it's going to be very difficult to compete when there
are companies with R and D budgets that are twice that of Merck," said Shah, the
New Jersey-based analyst.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's strength lies in its top anti-migraine drug, Imitrex, and in
treatments for asthma and viral infections, including HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline's top products include the antibiotic Augmentin, the
antidepressant Paxil and a new diabetes drug, Avandia. It also has a strong
vaccines business.
</P>
<P>
	   But both firms are feeling pressure because their top drugs are facing
expiration of their patents, allowing cheaper generics into the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's leading ulcer drug Zantac lost its patent protection in 1997, and
SmithKline's lucrative Augmentin will lose its patent in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Sharpton on King Day  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH J. HARPAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A long-awaited meeting between Hillary Rodham Clinton and
the Rev. Al Sharpton took place Monday at a Martin Luther King Jr. celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton also spoke at Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Harlem and
attended a King tribute at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. At each event, she
recalled meeting King in 1963 at age 15 when she traveled with her church youth
group to hear him speak in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He took my hand and shook it and I felt my life would never be the same,''
she said, adding that King's stirring speech that night inspired her to
``dedicate my life to public service.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, who is running for a Senate seat from New York, noted there
has been progress in blacks achieving equality, but added: ``There is still a
need for affirmative action.'' She quoted her husband, President Clinton, saying
of affirmative action, ``We need to mend it, not end it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the audience of about 300 at the Sharpton event repeatedly
interrupted the first lady with cheers, applause and occasional cries of ``Run
Hillary run!''
</P>
<P>
	   Afterwards, she met privately with Sharpton and several others, including
the parents of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed African immigrant who was killed by
four white police officers in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had a few private moments with them and expressed my personal sympathy
and condolences and shared my hope that justice is done,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial of the officers is set to begin soon in Albany, where it was moved
after an appellate court concluded the officers could not get a fair trial in
the Bronx. Sharpton and Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y, have asked the U.S. Justice
Department to consider investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there is a role for the federal government, I would certainly encourage
and urge that that would occur,'' said Mrs. Clinton. She said it was too early
to say whether such a step was merited.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton did not agree on every issue raised at the Sharpton event, at
one point defending sanctions against Iraq despite murmurs of disapproval.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She did very well,'' Sharpton said afterwards. ``She did not show any
reluctance at all to deal with the issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Separately Monday, Mrs. Clinton 's likely Republican opponent, New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, held a prayer breakfast at the official mayor's
residence and attended a dinner by the Congress of Racial Equality. But he
skipped the King tribute at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which he has attended
for the past few years, because Mrs. Clinton decided to attend it.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly before Mrs. Clinton entered Sharpton's headquarters, another
speaker, Rev. Charles Norris, said he had missed one of King's demonstrations
because he was working. Referring to his former employers, Norris said: ``Miller
No. 1 was a Jew. Miller No. 2 was a Jew. I was then employed by yet another Jew
by the name of Jesus ... and will not be fired until he thinks it's necessary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton later told reporters that before she arrived, ``I heard that
one of the speakers made some divisive comments, which I soundly reject.''

Why Canada Shipped U.S. Plutonium by Air
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Federal government departments urged that a controversial
shipment of U.S. plutonium be quietly shipped to a research reactor near Ottawa
by air, not road as first planned.
</P>
<P>
	   The surprise flight Friday from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, to Atomic Energy
of Canada's site at Chalk River, Ontario, took protesters off guard. It was to
have been moved by highway despite promises from environmental activists and
First Nations to block its path.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We, quite frankly, weren't thinking of air,'' said AECL spokesman Larry
Shewchuk. ``That wasn't our choice to go to air.''
</P>
<P>
	   The change, approved Jan. 10 by Transport Canada, was made ``because the
government asked us to based on the feedback they got from the public,''
Shewchuk said.
</P>
<P>
	   Flying plutonium is outlawed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   But Friday's flight broke no Canadian regulations, said John Read, director
general of the Transport Dangerous Goods section of Transport Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   The fuel, along with another shipment expected from Russia in the spring, is
to be used in tests to recycle bombs into reactor fuel.

Rothmans Denies Role in 1990s Cigarette Smuggling
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Rothmans, Canada's second-largest tobacco manufacturer,
strongly denied Monday that it played a role in tobacco smuggling in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are very concerned about contraband,'' John McDonald, spokesman for
Rothmans, Benson and Hedges said after an anti-smoking activist added heat to a
morning shareholders' meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We made the government aware of our trade practices and there's nothing
being said that suggests any improper behaviour on the part of RBH.''
</P>
<P>
	   Garfield Mahood of the Non-Smoker's Rights Association was silenced before
he could utter a question at the gathering, during which a motion was passed to
amalgamate two holding companies and split the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it doesn't relate to this motion, then we are not going to discuss
it,'' company chairman Senator William Kelly stated when Mahood stood to ask a
question.
</P>
<P>
	   Les Thompson, a former executive at RJR-Macdonald who was convicted last
year in connection with cigarette smuggling, has said all three of Canada's
major tobacco companies were involved.

Ontario PM Seeks Facts on Emergency Rooms
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Ontario Premier Mike Harris is promising to find out whether
lives are being lost as a result of what critics call an escalating crisis in
emergency rooms across the province.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris made the promise Monday amid lingering questions about 18-year-old
asthmatic Joshua Fleuelling, who died in hospital early Saturday after he went
into cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   The 18-minute ambulance ride Fleuelling endured while in the grips of a
severe asthma attack is quickly becoming a flashpoint for a growing fear across
Canada that cash-strapped emergency rooms have been pushed past the breaking
point.
</P>
<P>
	   Paramedics were forced to take Fleuelling to Markham-Stouffville Hospital
because the closest hospital, Scarborough Grace, was on critical-care bypass and
closed to ambulance patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Ontario deputy chief coroner Jim Cairns has said his office will await the
results of an autopsy before deciding whether to proceed with a coroner's
inquest.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Plutonium Flight Protested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Local officials and environmental groups are protesting a
Canadian government agency's decision to fly weapons-grade plutonium across 300
miles of southern Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   In a surprise move Friday, 4.2 ounces of plutonium was transported by
helicopter from Sault Ste. Marie on the U.S. border to Atomic Energy of Canada
Ltd.'s plant in Chalk River, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency originally had planned to ship the plutonium by truck. But unable
to reach a compromise with groups who were planning protests along the shipping
route, it instead flew the shipment without making any public announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   The plutonium arrived safely on Friday morning, but that didn't make critics
of the shipment any happier.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The plutonium overflight was a completely unnecessary risk,'' Elizabeth
May of the Sierra Club of Canada said Monday. Sault Ste. Marie Mayor Steve
Butland said he was never informed about the helicopter transport, and New
Democrat Party environment critic Peter Mancini called the move ``a blatant
disregard for the concerns and safety of Canadians.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials said the shipment broke no Canadian regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   The shipment was part of the Parallex Project, a joint American-Russian
experiment to determine whether commercial nuclear reactors in Canada can use
material from decommissioned Russian nuclear weapons as fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said the experiment was crucial to U.S. efforts to help
Russia dismantle nuclear weapons. They insisted it would be a one-time event,
but critics said they believed it would be the first of many shipments of
nuclear material through the United States and Ontario.

<HEADLINE> A Fight for Social Conservatives  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- With just a week until Iowa's precinct caucuses
launch the presidential nominating season, there's a still unresolved fight for
the support of social conservatives who are a force in Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
	   To various degrees, four of the six Republican rivals are contending for
that vote, and conceding that the issue has yet to be settled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You get huge changes in the last seven to 10 days as people really
focus,'' said publisher Steve Forbes, interviewed Sunday on Iowa Public
Television. ``I come from the business sector, where competition is a daily fact
of life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes opened the final week before the caucuses rumbling around the state
in an intense grassroots bus tour sounding sharply conservative themes and, on
Monday, his campaign was endorsed by conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly,
president of the Eagle Forum.
</P>
<P>
	   Schlafly, who was a national co-chairman of Pat Buchanan's GOP presidential
campaign in 1996, will travel and campaign for Forbes during the next two days,
Forbes' campaign said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the conservative ground was not being ceded to Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   Activists Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, along with Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah
offer similar conservative themes that have divided the Republican right. One
effect of splitting the conservative vote has been to dilute the impact of
conservatives who have yet to coalesce behind one contender.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls have generally shown Texas Gov. George W. Bush ahead, with Forbes in
second place in Iowa and all the others in single digits. Bauer has hit the
airwaves with new commercials, and is crisscrossing the state in the final days.
</P>
<P>
	   He argues that the commitment his backers display will pay off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that with the passion level we've got among our supporters, we're
going to be pleased on caucus night,'' said Bauer.
</P>
<P>
	   He has sought to display some differences with Forbes, and takes care to
remind social conservatives that Forbes hasn't always been with them on issues
like abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ''... I have a 25-year record on the sanctity of life,'' Bauer said on ``Fox
News Sunday.'' ``I'm not a Johnny-come-lately like Mr. Forbes.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Keyes has his own appeal, with a fiery speaking style and an
in-your-face conservative message. In the latest GOP debate, he declined the
offer to give a closing statement and instead led the candidates in a nationally
televised prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   With almost no organization he got 8 percent of the vote in the last
precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people who watch those debates have already decided who is
outstanding,'' said Keyes, also speaking on Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch has registered as barely a blip in the polling for Iowa's caucuses,
but he aired a 30-minute commercial Saturday night, largely devoted to blasting
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't you think it's time that somebody speaks substantially on what's
going on rather than 30-second spots and signs and hoopla ..., really that's
what we've been getting during this campaign,'' said Hatch, who joined Bauer and
Keyes on Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain of Arizona appeared for a campaign debate in the state, but
isn't competing in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show Forbes with more success in building backing among the right as
he argues that he has the resources to take the conservative debate to Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You see it in my whole campaign,'' said Forbes. ``They realize I have a
broad-based, principled message that has brought people together.''
</P>
<P>
	   That message was resonating with some as Forbes toured the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarence Van Zee of Pella said he looked over the field of conservatives and
had to decide which one actually had a shot at winning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to be realistic,'' and that led him to Forbes, Van Zee said. ``He
admits he doesn't have a lot of charisma, but I think he's what you see is what
you get.''
</P>
<P>
	   Van Zee's wife, Trudy, conceded that Bauer is ``a good man, too'' but said
Forbes has a broader appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe this man (Forbes) has more answers to more questions,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rita Wilson of Columbus Junction picked Forbes and said it's a matter of
commitment. Why not the front-running Bush?
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he's pro-life personally, but I don't know if he'd go out and
fight for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer insists, however, he's poised for a surprise. Using a direct-mail
fund-raising network, he has assembled enough money to stay on the airwaves
during the caucus campaign's closing days. People have often written him off
prematurely, Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Commentators and conventional political analysts thought 10 months ago
that I wouldn't last in the race for three weeks,'' he said. ``Every time there
has been a vote ... we have done substantially better than polling and my
opponents have done substantially worse than the polling.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes said he's often dismissed or ignored by the media, but said he can
overcome that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given the disadvantages that somebody like me ... labors under, I think
that if I show at all, it's a wonderful performance,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Seek AIDS Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for $175 million for
AIDS treatment and prevention programs in his 2001 budget proposal,
administration officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton wants $125 million for Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Act
grants. The 10-year-old program, named for the Indiana boy whose battle with
AIDS attracted national attention, provides money for health clinics treating
low-income AIDS patients and for training for those caring for HIV-infected
individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will ask Congress to approve $50 million to fund state
and local AIDS prevention programs administered by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. It's the most the administration has ever asked for
prevention, which AIDS groups say is woefully underfunded by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   While the number of AIDS deaths has dropped dramatically in recent years
thanks to new treatments, the decline in deaths slowed last year and the disease
is hitting minority groups and women hard.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacks, who make up about 13 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for
49 percent of AIDS deaths in 1998, according to the CDC. Thirty-two percent of
deaths were among whites and 18 percent were among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 23 percent of AIDS diagnoses reported in 1998 were among women.
</P>
<P>
	   Activists who have been calling on the government to put more money into
prevention said Clinton's 2001 budget proposal falls short.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have gone from closing their eyes to giving prevention a passing
glance,'' said Steven Fisher, spokesman of the advocacy group AIDS Action.
``It's not enough to make a dent in the 40,000 new infections every year, half
of which are among young people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal comes as the Ryan White program celebrates its 10th anniversary
this week. Since it started in 1990, the program has received $6.4 billion in
federal funding. More than 500,000 people -- many of whom have no insurance --
have received care each year through the program.

<HEADLINE> Missile Test May Affect US Strategy  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If successful, a test Tuesday of the Pentagon's
anti-missile missile could move administration officials closer to recommending
that President Clinton commit to deploying a nationwide missile defense.
</P>
<P>
	   A system of interceptor rockets, radars and computerized command centers --
a much scaled-down version of the space-based ``star wars'' defense envisioned
by President Reagan in the 1980s -- could be deployed as early as 2005, although
many hurdles remain.
</P>
<P>
	   If Tuesday's test goes as planned, a 121-pound ``smart rock'' will steer
itself into the path of a mock warhead about 140 miles above the central Pacific
Ocean, creating a collision that would reduce both objects to space dust. At
least, that's the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The launch is to take place sometime during a four-hour period that begins
at 9 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``smart rock,'' actually a highly sophisticated missile interceptor, is
still ``learning,'' Pentagon officials say. And they're quick to say that while
they hope for success, they will not be surprised if the interceptor misses the
target. After all, they say, this is a testing program, and setbacks are to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
	   This is not, however, just any run-of-the-mill testing program. At stake, in
the Pentagon's view, is the nation's ability to defend itself against the kind
of long-range missile threats that could emerge in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea, for example, is said to be developing a missile with enough
range to reach American territory, although it has not tested it in flight and
agreed recently to halt missile testing for the time being. No other non-NATO
country, other than Russia and China, possesses an intercontinental ballistic
missile.
</P>
<P>
	   If Tuesday's test succeeds, it could lead to a decision by Clinton as early
as this summer to commit the United States officially to building a defense
against missile attack at a cost of at least $12.7 billion. Defense Secretary
William Cohen is scheduled to make his recommendation to Clinton in June.
</P>
<P>
	   If the test fails, there will be another chance as early as April to
demonstrate that strategic missile defense is feasible, one of several criteria
the president has set for deciding whether to deploy it.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also will take cost into account at a time when the armed forces are
hard-pressed to buy the conventional weapons they say will be needed in the
decades ahead. And there's the impact on relations with Russia and China, both
of which are strongly opposed to a U.S. national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
	   In his 2001 budget, to be disclosed Feb. 7, Clinton is expected to ask
Congress for an additional $2.2 billion for the program. That would buy an
arsenal of 100 interceptors and pay for more testing and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very high-priority program,'' chief Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon said Friday. ``We are working very hard ... to get the president the
information he needs from the technical side to make a decision sometime this
summer.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, if we have a series of tests that are deemed to be failures we
couldn't say that this was ready to deploy,'' Bacon added.
</P>
<P>
	   If Clinton gives the go-ahead this summer, a missile defense could be ready
to begin operating in 2005, although some Pentagon officials closely involved in
the program think that is too ambitious a timetable.
</P>
<P>
	   The first major test of the missile interceptor -- known as a ``kill
vehicle,'' or by its Pentagon nickname, ``smart rock'' -- was last Oct. 2. The
first test using the final, combat-ready interceptor is not scheduled until
2003.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the missile used in the October test encountered some problems en
route to its target, it scored a hit and prompted the Pentagon to assert it had
demonstrated that a warhead carrying a nuclear or biological weapon can be
destroyed and neutralized.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics are less certain. They doubt the reliability of a national missile
defense and fault the Pentagon for planning only three interceptor tests before
recommending a deployment decision to Clinton this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Regardless of the outcome of the upcoming test, it is already clear that
the three tests will not provide sufficient basis to determine whether the ...
system will work,'' said Tom Collina of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which
opposes deployment.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela: Conflict With U.S. Eases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan officials said Monday that tensions had
been eased in the conflict with the United States over a U.S. offer to send
troops to help with flood relief.
</P>
<P>
	   The conflict began last week, when U.S. officials ordered a U.S. Navy ship
that was en route to Venezuela to reverse course after Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez said he did not want the U.S. troops in his country. U.S. officials said
they were dismayed by Chavez's announcement, since Venezuela's defense minister
had requested the help in a letter Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, U.S. Ambassador John Maisto met with Chavez. Afterwards, Maisto
said the United States would still collaborate with Venezuela in the disaster
recovery. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel told reporters the
problem ``has been overcome.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. forces, though, still will not be going.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 450 Marine and Navy engineers had been expected to help rebuild a
coastal road damaged by Dec. 15 flooding that killed thousands of Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
	   Rangel said Venezuela also rejected similar offers from other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We said the same thing to Brazil when they wanted to send a group of
soldiers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Women Lead Music Awards Nominees  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana's band won best-album honors at Monday's
American Music Awards for "Supernatural," a commercial comeback that put the
rock guitar maestro on top of the charts for the first time in his 30-year
career.
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernatural," mixing Santana's searing instrumentals with vocals by such
collaborators as Dave Matthews and Lauryn Hill, beat out two teen sensations,
the Backstreet Boys' "Millennium" and Britney Spears' "... Baby One More Time."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana took the stage to a standing ovation. After thanking his parents,
siblings and wife, he invited his producer, Clive Davis, to join him. "Your
music has soared," Davis told Santana. "To musicians everywhere, this is a
special moment, because it's this man."
</P>
<P>
	   Garth Brooks won for best country album for "Double Live."
</P>
<P>
	   "They say live albums never do anything," Brooks said. "Thank you once again
for not listening to the rules."
</P>
<P>
	   DMX won for favorite rap-hip hop artist. "I wouldn't have done this without
Lord and savior Jesus Christ," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three awards were announced before the show. Red Hot Chili Peppers beat Kid
Rock and Limp Bizkit for favorite alternative artist, and Phil Collins won for
favorite adult contemporary artist over Cher and country star Shania Twain.
"Wild Wild West" was the favorite soundtrack, beating "Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me" and "Runaway Bride."
</P>
<P>
	   Spears, Twain and soul singer Whitney Houston led the field with three
nominations each. And all three were in the running for favorite pop-rock female
artist at the 27th annual awards show, which aired on ABC from the Shrine
Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides adult contemporary artist, Twain was nominated for favorite female
country artist. Houston was nominated for female artist and album for "My Love
Is Your Love" in the soul-rhythm and blues categories. Besides pop-rock album,
Spears also was up for favorite pop-rock new artist.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston was departing for Europe on Monday night or Tuesday and did not plan
on attending the show. Awards spokesman Paul Shefrin said her absence was
unrelated to an incident in Hawaii last week, when airport security guards said
they found about half an ounce of marijuana in her bag but she boarded her
flight before police arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides pop album, the latest incarnation of Santana's band was nominated
for favorite pop-rock band, duo or group. Other nominees in that category were
the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync. The pop-rock male artist nominees were Lenny
Kravitz, Ricky Martin and Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   The nominees were chosen by music industry representatives. The winners were
decided by about 20,000 music fans nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides awards in 20 regular categories, the show was to feature results of
an Internet poll on listeners' favorite musical artists for each decade from the
1950s through the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   The show also included an Award of Merit for Gloria Estefan, who was honored
with a musical tribute featuring 'N Sync. Past winners of the award, given in
recognition for American musical contributions, include Benny Goodman, Stevie
Wonder, Loretta Lynn and Paul McCartney.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariah Carey received an Award of Achievement for her "rare and
distinguished accomplishments." Michael Jackson and Prince are the only previous
winners of that award.
</P>
<P>
	   Performers scheduled to appear on the three-hour show included Carey,
Kravitz, Christina Aguilera, the Eurythmics and Enrique Iglesias. Comedian Norm
Macdonald was the host.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Clash in 6th Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley challenged Vice President Al Gore
Monday night to demand the administration issue an immediate order banning
racial profiling, but Gore shot back in campaign debate, ``I don't think
President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley'' on standing up for
blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   In their sixth and final debate before next Monday's kickoff Iowa caucuses,
the two Democratic presidential hopefuls agreed the Confederate flag should come
down from atop the South Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore went one step further, saying ``it's only the Republican candidates for
president'' who disagree because they are ``so scared of the extreme right
wing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men said the father of Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban boy at the
center of an international dispute, should come to the United States to press
his claim for custody.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of racially sensitive issues came up in the hour-long televised
debate on the federal holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King, Jr., a
``Black-Brown Forum'' that both men hoped to use to appeal to voters in other
states with a larger minority population than Iowa. MSNBC carried the event
live.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues ranged from racially insensitive comments made by Atlanta Braves
baseball player John Rocker, to the controversial New York minister, Al
Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is the national front-runner by far in the public opinion polls, and
also is hoping for a clear triumph over Bradley in Iowa next week. Bradley leads
in most polls in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary eight days after
Iowa's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Perched on stools on a debate stage in Iowa's capital city, both men said
firmly they oppose racial profiling, the practice by which some police offers
target racial minorities for traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all know what driving while black is,'' said Bradley, who has made race
relations a cornerstone of his career in public life. ``It is breathing while
black.''
</P>
<P>
	   When Gore said he would issue an executive order banning the practice,
Bradley served him a challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a president now,'' he said. ``You serve with him. I want you to
walk into his office and say, `Sign this executive order today.'''
</P>
<P>
	   His remarks were greeted with applause, but Gore had a ready reply.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley
about how to fight for African Americans'' and Latinos, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to talk the talk. It's another thing to walk the walk,''
Gore said, to scattered boos from the audience. Gore also added that the mayor
of Newark, Sharpe James, ``asked for help on the policy of racial profiling when
you were in the Senate'' representing New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's here today, and he's supporting me because President Clinton and I
have helped him with racial profiling,'' Gore added.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the Bradley campaign distributed a July 14, 1992 story from The
(Bergen, N.J.) Record that quoted James saluting Bradley as ``the only national
figure who is talking about racism in America. He's not saying it for the votes.
He's saying it from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore sidestepped a question of whether he would appoint a Hispanic to the
Supreme Court, and to list some possible contenders for the seat. He jokingly
asked his questioner whether he possessed a law degree, then said he would make
appointments that reflect ``the diversity of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said, ``I could never appoint someone who would turn the clock back
on civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proceedings were disrupted briefly by a young woman who stood at her
seat in the audience to pose a question about global warming. As security guards
moved to silence her, the moderator, Tavis Smiley of Black Entertainment
Television, quipped, ``I get my 15 minutes (of fame) and this is what happens to
me.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederate flag has surfaced as an issue among Republican presidential
contenders, who are competing in a South Carolina primary on Feb. 19. The
leading GOP hopefuls, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain,
have refused to take a stand on the issue, saying it is up to the residents of
South Carolina to decide whether the flag should fly atop their statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   While both Gore and Bradley said they believe the flag should come down, the
vice president also noted that some people view the flag favorably. ``We have to
try to bring them into a shared understanding of why, as a symbol, it is so
hurtful,'' he said. Gore also told his questioner he would not agree to
participate in an NAACP boycott of South Carolina, because ``I don't think a
president of the United States should ever boycott an individual state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said the flag ``offends our common humanity and it is not the future
of our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's only the Republican candidates for president who are so scared of the
extreme right wing, that they will be tolerant of intolerance, less they offend
the offensive. It ought to come down,'' Gore added.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacks account for a small minority of the vote in Iowa, but given the date
and fact that a black state lawmaker organized the event, a ``Black-Brown''
forum, the two Democrats pledged support for continued efforts to support civil
rights and combat racism.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men condemned the racist remarks made recently by Atlanta Braves
pitcher John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley used a question on the issue to recount that as a professional
basketball player three decades ago, part of his job on the New York Knicks was
to take aside any white player ``who didn't understand'' the need to treat
blacks respectfully.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates were asked if they would agree to the Rev. Al Sharpton's
request for a public meeting. Gore ducked, saying he had met with Sharpton in a
larger group. Bradley said he had visited Sharpton's church in Harlem, though he
added, ``I don't agree with Al Sharpton on everything.''
</P>
<P>
	   The moderators asked if it was unfair to minorities for the majority-white
states of Iowa and New Hampshire to have such a disproportionate voice in the
early primaries. Both said yes, and cited the more personal nature of
campaigning in those small states.

<HEADLINE> Details Fuzzy in Democratic Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic debate Monday was mostly about vision but
some of the details weren't quite right. Vice President Al Gore continues to
misrepresent the details of his rival's Medicaid plan, and Bill Bradley
neglected to mention that it would take 10 years for his 600,000 new teachers to
arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   And, incidentally, the first baby born in Iowa this year was Latino, not
black.
</P>
<P>
	   The sharpest difference between Gore and Bradley continues to concern health
care. Bradley wants to replace Medicaid, a system run by the states, with
subsidies allowing people to buy health insurance from the system that serves
federal employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, pointing to a pair of families in the audience, repeated his assertion
that Bradley's plan would give them just $150 per month to buy a health plan.
But the $150 figure is the average subsidy for a single person, not a family. A
family actually would get $417 per month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is a serious misrepresentation in this debate,'' said Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania, who has been monitoring the debates.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also stretched the facts on health care, saying the new Children's
Health Insurance Program isn't working because only a fraction of eligible
children are enrolled.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, which just finished its second year, actually doubled
enrollment in 1999 to about 2 million kids. But there isn't enough money to
serve all of the eligible children.
</P>
<P>
	   Plus, there's no guarantee that Bradley's plan, which would be administered
by the federal government, would do a better job at signing families up for
insurance. In fact, it might be harder, since managing it from Washington would
create new challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore promised to sign an executive order banning racial profiling, where
police stop drivers or question certain people because of their race. But after
the debate, Gore's own campaign noted that most law enforcement agencies are run
by state and local governments and wouldn't be affected by a presidential order.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's campaign was responding to Bradley, who said Gore should get
President Clinton to sign an executive order if he really wants one. But, in
essence, the Gore camp tried to have it both ways: promising an order but saying
it wouldn't really do much.
</P>
<P>
	   On education, Bradley touted his plan to put 600,000 ``qualified, great
teachers'' into public schools. Jamieson called it an exaggeration. ``He has no
way to guarantee they are going to be qualified or great,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   And Bradley didn't mention that it would take 10 years to pay for all of
them.
</P>
<P>
	   Moving to school vouchers, which provides public money for kids to go to
private schools, Gore's camp made an error that Bradley didn't correct. Like
many Democrats, Gore opposes school vouchers, saying they drain dollars from
public schools, and he regularly notes that Bradley has supported a variety of
voucher experiments.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said in the debate that he was encouraged that Bradley now opposes
vouchers. But, in fact, Bradley has not said he opposes them -- only that he
doesn't think they are the answer to the problems of public education.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men noted several times that the debate was taking place on Martin
Luther King Jr. Day, and Gore added that this was the first year that New
Hampshire is calling its holiday just that. He credited Gov. Jeanne Shaheen --
one of his supporters -- for making it happen. But here Republican predecessor,
Gov. Steve Merrill, also fought to name the holiday after the slain civil rights
leader.
</P>
<P>
	   And while Gore tried for extra credit by noting that the first baby born in
Iowa this year was black, it may have backfired. ``Latino!'' came a cry from the
audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Iowa's millennium birth was to a Latina woman.

<HEADLINE> Bradley challenges Gore on racial profiling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Bill Bradley challenged Vice President Al Gore
Monday night to demand the administration issue an immediate order banning
racial profiling, but Gore shot back in campaign debate, "I don't think
President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Sen. Bill Bradley" on standing up
for blacks and Hispanics.
<P>
	   In their sixth and final debate before next Monday's kickoff Iowa caucuses,
the two Democratic presidential hopefuls agreed the Confederate flag should come
down from atop the South Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore went one step further, saying "it's only the Republican candidates for
president" who disagree because they are "so scared of the extreme right wing."
</P>
<P>
	   Both men said the father of Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban boy at the
center of an international dispute, should come to the United States to press
his claim for custody.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of racially sensitive issues came up in the hour-long televised
debate on the federal holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King, Jr., a
"Black-Brown Forum" that both men hoped to use to appeal to voters in other
states with a larger minority population than Iowa. MSNBC carried the event
live.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues ranged from racially insensitive comments made by Atlanta Braves
baseball player John Rocker, to the controversial New York minister, Al
Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is the national front-runner by far in the public opinion polls, and
also is hoping for a clear triumph over Bradley in Iowa next week. Bradley leads
in most polls in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary eight days after
Iowa's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Perched on stools on a debate stage in Iowa's capital city, both men said
firmly they oppose racial profiling, the practice by which some police offers
target racial minorities for traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all know what driving while black is," said Bradley, who has made race
relations a cornerstone of his career in public life. "It is breathing while
black."
</P>
<P>
	   When Gore said he would issue an executive order banning the practice,
Bradley served him a challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a president now," he said. "You serve with him. I want you to walk
into his office and say, 'Sign this executive order today."'
</P>
<P>
	   His remarks were greeted with applause, but Gore had a ready reply.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley
about how to fight for African Americans" and Latinos, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's one thing to talk the talk. It's another thing to walk the walk," Gore
said, to scattered boos from the audience. Gore also added that the mayor of
Newark, Sharpe James, "asked for help on the policy of racial profiling when you
were in the Senate" representing New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's here today, and he's supporting me because President Clinton and I
have helped him with racial profiling," Gore added.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the Bradley campaign distributed a July 14, 1992 story from The
(Bergen, N.J.) Record that quoted James saluting Bradley as "the only national
figure who is talking about racism in America. He's not saying it for the votes.
He's saying it from the heart."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore sidestepped a question of whether he would appoint a Hispanic to the
Supreme Court, and to list some possible contenders for the seat. He jokingly
asked his questioner whether he possessed a law degree, then said he would make
appointments that reflect "the diversity of the country."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said, "I could never appoint someone who would turn the clock back
on civil rights."
</P>
<P>
	   The proceedings were disrupted briefly by a young woman who stood at her
seat in the audience to pose a question about global warming. As security guards
moved to silence her, the moderator, Tavis Smiley of Black Entertainment
Television, quipped, "I get my 15 minutes (of fame) and this is what happens to
me."
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederate flag has surfaced as an issue among Republican presidential
contenders, who are competing in a South Carolina primary on Feb. 19. The
leading GOP hopefuls, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain,
have refused to take a stand on the issue, saying it is up to the residents of
South Carolina to decide whether the flag should fly atop their statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   While both Gore and Bradley said they believe the flag should come down, the
vice president also noted that some people view the flag favorably. "We have to
try to bring them into a shared understanding of why, as a symbol, it is so
hurtful," he said. Gore also told his questioner he would not agree to
participate in an NAACP boycott of South Carolina, because "I don't think a
president of the United States should ever boycott an individual state."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said the flag "offends our common humanity and it is not the future
of our country."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's only the Republican candidates for president who are so scared of the
extreme right wing, that they will be tolerant of intolerance, less they offend
the offensive. It ought to come down," Gore added.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacks account for a small minority of the vote in Iowa, but given the date
and fact that a black state lawmaker organized the event, a "Black-Brown" forum,
the two Democrats pledged support for continued efforts to support civil rights
and combat racism.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men condemned the racist remarks made recently by Atlanta Braves
pitcher John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley used a question on the issue to recount that as a professional
basketball player three decades ago, part of his job on the New York Knicks was
to take aside any white player "who didn't understand" the need to treat blacks
respectfully.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates were asked if they would agree to the Rev. Al Sharpton's
request for a public meeting. Gore ducked, saying he had met with Sharpton in a
larger group. Bradley said he had visited Sharpton's church in Harlem, though he
added, "I don't agree with Al Sharpton on everything."
</P>
<P>
	   The moderators asked if it was unfair to minorities for the majority-white
states of Iowa and New Hampshire to have such a disproportionate voice in the
early primaries. Both said yes, and cited the more personal nature of
campaigning in those small states.

<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell early Tuesday on profit-taking following
sharp gains the previous day. The dollar edged lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 217.11 points, or 1.12
percent, to 19,220.12 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the

</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 104.87 yen, down 0.31 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but
above its late London level of 104.78 yen. Financial markets in New York were
closed Monday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started lower as investors locked in profits a
day after the Nikkei closed at its highest level in 29 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's finish of 19,437.23 points was the index's highest close since Aug.
8, 1997, when it ended the day at 19,604.46.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said information and telecommunications-related issues were among
early losers. Some players were taking a cautious position as they continued to
watch the dollar's direction against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 7.82 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,674.15. The TOPIX closed up
33.73 points, or 2.05 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar moved in a narrow range in early Asian
trading Tuesday after financial markets in New York took Monday off.

<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.18 yen, down from 106.80 yen
late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 100 Sioux Seize Pine Ridge Office  </HEADLINE>
   By CHET BROKAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- About 100 Oglala Sioux who accuse the tribe of
financial mismanagement have taken over tribal headquarters and demanded that
the governing council step down.
</P>
<P>
	   The group, which is allied with tribal President Harold Dean Salway, took
control of the tribal building at the Pine Ridge Reservation on Sunday. About
100 people stayed there overnight and said they will remain until they are
satisfied authorities will investigate their allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the tribal council voted to have the protesters thrown out of the
building. They voted to have tribal law officers enforce tribal laws that ban
the spread of false propaganda and actions that interfere with the conduct of
council business.
</P>
<P>
	   Council members said they expect the tribe's public safety director to evict
the protesters Monday night or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the unarmed group are calling for an audit and have demanded the
immediate resignation of tribal Treasurer Wesley ``Chuck'' Jacobs and all 17
members of the tribal council. They also have asked the FBI to seize tribal
records dealing with law enforcement, housing and other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bottom line is, we want accountability and responsibility by our
elected officials,'' said group spokesman Dale Looks Twice.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, federal agents used to a search warrant to seize paper files and
computer records from the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority. U.S. Attorney Ted
McBride said the warrant was related to an investigation of programs funded by
the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
	   By Monday evening, Salway, the tribal president, signed an order suspending
Jacobs for a second time. He suspended Jacobs in October for allegedly
mismanaging tribal funds, but a tribal judge later reinstated the treasurer.
</P>
<P>
	   And the council adopted resolutions encouraging a tribal judge to hold
Salway in contempt for violating previous court orders that said he did not have
authority to fire Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs said there has been no mismanagement of federal or tribal funds and
told council members they need to make sure financial records are not destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This thing is a total breakdown in tribal government. It's up to you guys
to regain control,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eileen Janis, a spokeswoman for Salway, said the president and others have
become frustrated with Jacobs and the council majority that always supports the
treasurer. ``We want a complete audit of everything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Vukelich, senior supervisory agent with the FBI in Rapid City, said
Monday afternoon that the protesters have not provided specific allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the tribe's 12,100 members live on the reservation, which
consistently ranks as one of the poorest areas of the nation.

<HEADLINE> Congo Loyalists Break Rebel Blockade  </HEADLINE>
   By KAMANGA MUTOND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Troops loyal to Congo President Laurent Kabila broke
through rebel lines, ending a two-month siege on a strategic government-held
town, the warring sides said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The breakthrough came early Sunday in Ikela, 400 miles northeast of the
capital, Kinshasa. The fighting prompted neighboring Rwanda to call for U.N.
peacekeepers to prevent an outright collapse of Congo's fraying cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Kabila and his allies, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, signed a cease-fire in
July with Rwanda and Uganda, the countries that back Congo's rebels. The rebel
factions signed the pact the following month. But fighting has flared on several
fronts since then, and the warring sides frequently accuse each other of
violating the pact.
</P>
<P>
	   Congolese rebels encircled Ikela in November and cut off the main overland
and river supply routes. The siege had kept 2,000 troops loyal to Kabila,
including 800 Zimbabweans, trapped in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The breakthrough allowed government forces to provide the troops supplies
and reinforcements after months of shortages, Congo army spokesman Leon Richard
Kasonga said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government alliance had no ``ambition to gain more territory,'' Kasonga
said. He said the troops were only preserving positions held before the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Rwandan state minister Patrick Mazimhaka said the situation in Ikela
underscored the urgent need for U.N. peacekeepers. The United Nations has
considered proposals for a 25,000-member U.N. peacekeeping force in the region,
but some Western powers have expressed fears the situation is too unstable for
peacekeepers to be effective.

<HEADLINE> DEBATE NOTEBOOK: On icy evening, statements sought on global  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Braving an icy 28-degree evening, members of
Ozone Action rallied around their 25-foot inflatable ear of corn outside the
scene of Monday night's Brown-Black Presidential Forum, calling for a plan to
combat global warming.
<P>
	   Kate Simmons, spokeswoman for the group, which studies global warming, said
the organization was still hoping that one of the candidates - Vice President Al
Gore or Bill Bradley - will directly address the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "No candidate has presented a detailed plan for action yet," Simmons said.
"We've been at this for 2 1/2 weeks. Once we've moved on with Iowa, we'll go
elsewhere."
</P>
<P>
	   The group plans simultaneous events Tuesday in Ames, Cedar Falls and Iowa
City to release a scientific report on global warming.
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   As a moderator was about to ask the second question of the debate, a young
woman affiliated with Ozone Action left her seat and walked toward the front of
the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to know what you're going to do about global warming," said Kim
DeFeo, 23, a member of the organizations' Iowa field team.
</P>
<P>
	   She was immediately grabbed by security and escorted out of the auditorium.
Neither Gore nor Bradley had a chance to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   DeFeo later was taken in for questioning by Secret Service agents, who
declined to comment. Police also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   DeFeo apparently had discussed with other group members the possibility of
disrupting the nationally televised debate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We talked about it and it was a pretty spontaneous thing. She had fire in
her belly and she wanted to see what the candidates would say," said Simmons,
the Ozone Action spokeswoman. Simmons, too, was questioned by Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley weren't the only candidates with supporters outside the
debate site.
</P>
<P>
	   Perennial presidential contender Lyndon LaRouche, 78, had three supporters
on hand, one of whom carried a large, neon orange sign that said: "Dump Gore's
Dixiecrat Racism. Vote LaRouche, The Third Party Candidate."
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Baker, who works in LaRouche's Leesburg, Va., office, said the candidate
is the only one who recognizes that there is a severe financial meltdown around
the world. Baker said LaRouche is the only one who can mobilize this nation as
well as protect U.S. farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Cecil Conry, who farms near Elliott in southwest Iowa, said LaRouche is
taken seriously, but is ignored by the media and crowded out by the Democratic
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   LaRouche has filed paperwork to run in the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's wife Ernestine was seen kissing and hugging people before the
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   A man who was pecked on the cheek wouldn't talk to reporters, but a woman
next to him, swept up in a big bear hug, shared her story.
</P>
<P>
	   Julie Turner, from Ridgewood, N.J., said she was Bill Bradley's first
volunteer in New Jersey. She began working on his presidential campaign in
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm old enough to remember government when you believed in what you could
do and how you could contribute to your country," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   To emphasize her point, she exclaimed: "Look, I have gray hair."
</P>
<P>
	   Today's generation, she said, doesn't share her feelings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Kids today don't have that. They don't trust government. Bill Bradley could
rebuild that trust," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   Quincy Suthers, 56, a Gore supporter from Des Moines, wasn't too impressed
upon seeing NBA Hall of Famer Bill Russell in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell was in town campaigning for Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill Russell really means nothing. What does he know about government?"
Suthers said. "He's just a basketball player. I like him, but he's just a
basketball player."
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, Suthers said, "Gore brought people actually running this
country."
</P>
<P>
	   On hand for the vice president were Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman and Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
	   "Instead of selling the steak, Bradley's trying to sell his smell," said
Suthers, who added that he thought this was the most spirited debate so far.
"Gore brought out the meat in this discussion."
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   Russell strode into the media filing center with Bradley after the debate
and held an impromptu news conference with reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   "I suggested to him when he was in the Senate that he give me a call if he
was going to run for president," Russell said of Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell, who won 11 NBA championships with the Boston Celtics, said he first
met Bradley when he had completed his days as a basketball player at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
	   He always suspected that Bradley might run for president, but back then he
"was sizing him up as a player."
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill Bradley is my friend, and I'd like to see him be president," Russell
said. "I have nothing bad or ill to say about the other candidates."

meeting King in 1963 at age 15 when she traveled with her church youth group to

Clinton To Seek AIDS Funds

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for $175 million for
AIDS treatment and prevention programs in his 2001 budget proposal,
administration officials said today. Clinton wants $125 million for Ryan White
Comprehensive AIDS Resources Act grants. The 10-year-old program, provides money
for health clinics treating low-income AIDS patients and for training for those
caring for HIV-infected individuals. The president also will ask Congress to
approve $50 million to fund state and local AIDS prevention programs
administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's the most
the administration has ever asked for prevention, which AIDS groups say is
woefully underfunded by the government.

<HEADLINE> Dominican Migrant Boat Sinks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- A boat carrying 40 migrants trying
to illegally reach Puerto Rico sank off the Dominican coast, killing at least
eight people, the Dominican navy said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-one people survived the sinking, and U.S. Coast Guard aircraft and
Dominican navy ships were searching for 11 others just off Bavaro, 90 miles east
of Santo Domingo. In a prepared statement, the navy said it had arrested the
trip's organizer, a man it identified only as William.
</P>
<P>
	   The migrants' 40-foot wooden boat had left the town of Sabana de la Mar
before it lost one of two small motors and sank in rough weather off Bavaro,
Dominican navy Lt. Holguin Terrero said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of Dominicans die each year while trying to reach Puerto Rico, a U.S.
territory 75 miles to the east. From Puerto Rico, many Dominican migrants hope
to make their way to the U.S. mainland.

<HEADLINE> Campaign contributions out of Hollywood skyrocket  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Hollywood took a beating last year from Washington,
but it kept on giving - with campaign contributions skyrocketing.
<P>
	   Donors already have pumped more than $1.6 million into the coffers of the
four leading presidential candidates - nearly twice the $901,969 that the top
four money getters collected for the two-year 1996 campaign cycle - and the
first primary is still not here. Two Republicans are getting a lot of the
industry's wealth this year, following the road well worn by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Andy Spahn, of DreamWorks SKG, who advises Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey
Katzenberg and David Geffen on political donations, says, "Essentially you are
talking about people who have done quite well who are creative and passionate
and who are giving back."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Hollywood is well known for its political largess. Barbra Streisand
is a major Clinton fund-raiser. Celebrity couples like Goldie Hawn and Kurt
Russell chip in $25,000 to $100,000 and mix with politicians at Beverly Hills
mansions. The DreamWorks partners regularly are hosts for Democratic Party
soirees.
</P>
<P>
	   But what about the tough talk from Washington after the Columbine shootings?
Analysts and industry figures differ over whether this season's rise in
contributions is Hollywood's way of buying insurance to try to protect against
future verbal attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton blasted the industry for contributing to a culture of
violence after two teen-agers gunned down their classmates at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
	   Senators exhorted industry representatives to sign a code of conduct
limiting sexual and violent images in their work and sought investigations into
whether Hollywood targeted youths with violent images and products.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was some real anger over the scapegoating of Hollywood by
Washington," Spahn said. "It's not as clear how that plays out on a partisan
level - some of the attacks were coming from both parties."
</P>
<P>
	   Prominent Hollywood Democrats have crossed party lines this election season,
suggesting they may be working to see that whoever wins considers the industry's
concerns. There is a $1,000 per candidate federal contribution limit.
</P>
<P>
	   Geffen, one of Hollywood's most prominent Clinton backers and a supporter of
Vice President Al Gore, gave the maximum donation to both Gore - and to Sen.
John McCain, the Arizona Republican. Norman Lear, writer and director of shows
like "All in the Family," "Good Times" and "The Jeffersons," gave $1,000 each to
Gore, former Sen. Bill Bradley and McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Geffen nor Lear donated to a Republican presidential candidate in
1992 or 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Some donors say they're giving to several candidates as a way of encouraging
the debate of ideas generated by multiple candidates. Lear's political adviser
Lara Bergthold said he believes "the more voices the better."
</P>
<P>
	   Donors in the television, film and music industries already had given Gore
$642,865 through last Sept. 1, according to campaign finance reports covering
the period starting Jan. 1, 1999. Republican Gov. George W. Bush took in
$488,327 for the same period.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley collected $328,524 and McCain made $180,938, a strong Hollywood
showing for a No. 2 Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Entertainment industry donations comprise a small fraction of the
candidates' overall take, but they can bring benefits beyond the actual dollars.
Celebrity support attracts media attention that can translate into help from
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollywood insiders are quick to point out that donations in other industries
also are up this year, indicating that other factors aside from Hollywood's
self-interest may be at play.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts note the compressed primary season and the presence of multiple
candidates and no incumbent. The economy is going well, freeing money to donate
while contribution caps have stayed the same.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they are making enough money that $1,000 is not that much to them,"
Bergthold said of the Hollywood donors.

<HEADLINE> Physicist worked with Fermi on early A-bomb experiments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - Robert Rathbun Wilson, an influential nuclear
physicist who was a leader in the Manhattan Project, died Sunday.
<P>
	   He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson's death at a senior residence in Ithaca was caused by complications
of a stroke he suffered last year, according to Cornell University, where he
researched and taught.
</P>
<P>
	   By 1940, he earned a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, and
only two years later was collaborating with Enrico Fermi at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology on experiments that would lead to the atomic bomb.
Wilson's job was designing particle accelerators.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one was more aware of the technical subtlety of accelerators, no one
more ingenious in practical design, no one paid more attention to their
aesthetic qualities," physicist Bruce McDaniel said of Wilson, in a statement
released by Cornell. "He thought of accelerator builders as the contemporary
equivalent of the builders of the great cathedrals in France and Italy, but it
was the physics potential that came first."
</P>
<P>
	   The work at MIT was a precursor to the secretive World War II effort known
as the Manhattan Project. Wilson invented an electromechanical method for
separating uranium isotopes that became known as the Isotron method, according
to Cornell.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1943, Wilson and colleagues from Princeton moved a cyclotron, which
smashed atoms, to Los Alamos, New Mexico. There he headed the Experimental
Nuclear Physics Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years later, the atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima, Japan, and
killed 140,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1947, Wilson joined the physics faculty at Cornell. Its Wilson Synchotron
Laboratory was named for him.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson also served as director of the National Accelerator Laboratory in
Batavia, Ill., which, at four-miles-long, was the largest-ever physics facility.
He was Fermilab's director until 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson was born March 4, 1914 in Frontier, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
	   He was an amateur sculptor and his artwork is on display at Princeton and
Cornell.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite reaching the top of his highly technical field, he maintained a
simple wit about his work.
</P>
<P>
	   In a February 1986 Science Digest article, he recalled a time when
physicists did not know the scores of subatomic particles his machines would
reveal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had only electrons and protons, and you could put those together into
atoms in various ways and make the whole universe," he said. "It was a very
simple theory that even a dope could understand. I decided then that I wanted to
go into physics."
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include his wife of 59 years, Jane Wilson, three sons, four
grandchildren and a sister.
</P>
<P>
	   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Monday evening.

<HEADLINE> Expelled Ill. Student Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- Hours after the Rev. Jesse Jackson led a rally on
behalf of six expelled high school students, one of the teens was charged with
fleeing a traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
	   An officer on routine patrol directed a vehicle driving without its
headlights to stop about 1:45 a.m. Sunday. The driver, identified by passengers
as Roosevelt T. Fuller, stopped the car and ran away on foot, according to
Police Lt. Todd Walker.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm scared of police,'' Fuller said in a telephone interview Monday.
``When I see them, I just run.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fuller, 18, said his fear was based on being kicked in the head by a Decatur
police officer during the brawl that led to his expulsion, as well as repeated
reports from people on the street that he was a police target.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I knew they were going to do something against me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the rally Saturday, Jackson declared the cause of the students as
America's top civil rights battle. He linked their case to the Rev. Martin
Luther King's birthday, saying King would have fought for the students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We continue to support Roosevelt Fuller and his family as we have
throughout this ordeal,'' said Stephanie Gadlin, a Jackson spokeswoman. ``Of
course, we believe he shouldn't have done that. We know why he did.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fuller was released after posting bond Sunday. Police were seeking
misdemeanor charges of resisting arrest and obstructing a police officer. Fuller
was also cited with moving violations.
</P>
<P>
	   In connection with the brawl, Fuller faces charges of mob action, resisting
police and aggravated battery.
</P>
<P>
	   The six teens had been expelled from school up to two years for the Sept. 17
brawl, punishment Jackson called too harsh. Amid increasing criticism, the city
school board cut the time to one year and let the teens attend alternative
schools.

<HEADLINE> Gay-Military Issue Ads To Be Aired  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Striking back on the issue of gays in the military, a gay
rights group is unveiling a new ad that goes after Republicans who would keep
them out of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads, being shown Tuesday in New Hampshire and Iowa, respond to an ad
campaign from the Republican National Committee that spotlights the controversy
surrounding Al Gore's position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republican presidential candidates are so busy fighting about who can
and cannot serve in the military, they may have forgotten the values we actually
fight for,'' says the 30-second ad produced by the Human Rights Campaign, a
Washington-based gay advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   The group is spending $30,000 to air the ad over five days in Iowa beginning
Tuesday and four days in New Hampshire from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The group accuses Republicans of exploiting Gore's position on the issue and
hopes the ad campaign will help focus attention on the merits of his views --
that gays should be allowed to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   In a debate earlier this month, Gore said he would require officers on the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to share his position on the matter. Later he backtracked,
saying that his appointees would simply be required to implement his policy.
</P>
<P>
	   But that clarification did not stop the RNC from running $10,000 worth of
ads accusing Gore of setting up a litmus test that Colin Powell and Norman
Schwarzkopf couldn't pass.
</P>
<P>
	   The gay rights ad does not name any one Republican, but includes shots from
a GOP debate of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Alan
Keyes and Gary Bauer. Bush and McCain have said they would continue President
Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which allows gays to serve in the
military as long as they do not acknowledge their homosexuality. The other GOP
candidates want to ban their service altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   The RNC ad features shots of soldiers at work, of Powell and Schwarzkopf and
ends with: ``Call Al Gore. Tell him the only litmus test ought to be for
patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley, who have essentially the same position, are competing for
liberal voters who participate in Democratic primaries and are generally
supportive of gay rights. But the RNC hopes the issue will come back to hurt the
eventual nominee in the general election, when the competition is for more
moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the gay rights group is hoping to influence not just the debate
but public opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   Its ad says that the military is fighting for core values: ``Equality,
fairness, freedom, justice -- for all Americans, including gay Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The purpose of this campaign is to refocus the debate on the core values
we think should drive it,'' said David M. Smith of the Human Rights Campaign.
``The debate has been sorely lacking of any substance. The candidates have
basically gotten away with simply platitudes.''

<HEADLINE> Spanish Leader Calls for Election  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar on Monday called
general elections for March 12, paving the way for his likely return to power.
</P>
<P>
	   The popular center-right politician made the announcement after a special
cabinet meeting and confirmed a date that had already been widely expected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 1996, the Popular Party proposed big targets and now the task we
started must continue,'' Aznar told a press conference. ``I will ask Spaniards
again for their confidence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Recent opinion polls have been unanimous in predicting a victory for Aznar's
Popular Party, but by a narrow margin that promises anything but clear sailing
in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Aznar, the Popular Party won its first general election in 1996 but
fell short of an outright majority, taking 156 seats in the 350-seat lower
house. Poll results published recently have indicated Aznar's party could
improve to 174 seats this time, which would still be just short of a majority.

<HEADLINE> Houseware Makers Introduce Products  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Want a waterfall in your house? How about a bubble jet bath
massager, or a lamp that wakes you up gradually?
</P>
<P>
	   Houseware makers, recognizing that increasingly affluent Americans want to
indulge themselves, are introducing a slew of new products to make their
lifestyles more luxurious and pampered.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the thousands of items on display in the cavernous halls of the
International Housewares Show this week are not must-have products. Still, the
quest for the next useful or just cool-to-have product in the $63 billion U.S.
housewares industry has lured an estimated 60,000 buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a little more money to spend on accessories," Doug Weiskopf of
Midwest Tropical Inc. said Monday at the show at the McCormick Center. "People
are just looking for something new and eye-catching."
</P>
<P>
	   That explains why these are such good times for coffee tables with plastic
fish floating in them.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiskopf's company, based in Lincolnwood, Ill., just north of Chicago, makes
those, along with CD bubble racks, indoor waterfalls and the hot-selling "aqua
palm" -- an 8 1/2-foot-tall artificial tree with fluorescent water bubbles
cascading through a transparent trunk.
</P>
<P>
	   The waterfalls -- trickling down a facade like the black monolith from the
movie "2001" -- have been sold to offices for a few years. But thanks to a
booming economy, they suddenly are flowing into living rooms in significant
numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   A new, smaller (5-foot) version of the so-called aqua fall on display at the
industry-only trade show goes for a mere $399, the first opportunity for Joe
Consumer to buy a waterfall for less than $1,000. It features recirculating
water systems and halogen lighting with interchangeable red, blue, yellow and
green lenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The fish tables retail for $999 to $1,199.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've put more of this stuff in people's living rooms in the last year or
so than ever before," Weiskopf said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another innovation drawing attention at the show is a lamp alarm clock that
can be programmed to gradually brighten your room just as the rising sun does.
</P>
<P>
	   The user can set the Rise &AMP; Shine light and sound alarm clock for a 15- or
30-minute wake-up cycle, with the choice of eight programmable sounds, including
birds singing, a brook babbling or horses' hooves clip-clopping in a country
town.
</P>
<P>
	   If you get desperate, you can even turn off all the gizmos and use it as a
regular lamp and buzzer alarm clock. Retail price: about $199.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of Stamford, Conn.-based Verilux, who were touting the
product Monday called the innovation "a quality-of-life issue."
</P>
<P>
	   Pampering is the issue with HoMedics, a Commerce Township, Mich.-based
company that was displaying indoor mini-fountains for $20 to $100, aroma lamps
for $19.99 and bubble jet bath massagers -- a sort of everyman's Jacuzzi -- soon
to go on the market for $100 to $179.
</P>
<P>
	   The recently introduced "relaxing fountains" have proved so successful that
HoMedics has 13 new versions of the items, in which water gurgles over a small
display of stones worthy of a Zen monastery.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're all about relaxation -- we're about 'Get off the Internet,' " said
marketing director Paulette Abraham. "De-stressing is wellness."
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Brandl, president of the National Housewares Manufacturers
Association, which sponsors the show, said the luxury offerings typify an
industry where the desire for high quality, even at high cost, now is dominant.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's reflective of the economy that we're in, and of demographics -- baby
boomers getting older and having more disposable income," he said.

<HEADLINE> McCain: Defends U.S. Foreign Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By ANN S. KIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GILFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain defended U.S. foreign aid Monday and
said encouraging democracy in other countries can help prevent terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican presidential candidate met with 150 people early in the
morning at a fire station in Gilford, where the wind chill was well below zero.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Akerley, a 38-year-old independent, asked why the United States spends
money on foreign aid when many Americans could use the help.
</P>
<P>
	   Switching subjects, McCain said tax cuts would make things easier for
Americans because ending foreign aid would not provide much money to address
domestic problems.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said some U.S. foreign policies do work, and that by encouraging
democracy worldwide the United States can help prevent terrorism abroad and on
U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's in our interest not to have conflicts arise all over the world,''
McCain replied.
</P>
<P>
	   At a meeting with the Rochester Rotary Club later in the day, a voter asked
what the United States can do to help solve human rights abuses and other
problems abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   While stressing that the United States is the world's greatest power, McCain
said that power must be used judiciously and that military action often is
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the United States cannot bring an end to the AIDS epidemic in
Africa, but it can help draw attention to it and can look at other ways of
alleviating it.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, McCain, a Navy veteran, told several dozen people in the living room
of a Stratham home that the nearby Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, a major area
employer, should be considered in any new round of military base closings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard must be in play as the five bases in Arizona
must be in play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   His staff called it another example of straight talk, of him telling people
what they don't want to hear.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, McCain told a reporter that he didn't want to see any bases closed,
``but every military expert -- Colin Powell and Norman Schwartzkopf -- will tell
you we have too many bases.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Survivor Recounts Voyage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Some of the 11 people who died during the voyage that brought
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to the United States from Cuba gave their lives to
save his, one of the trip's three survivors said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We, the men, were protecting him so the waves didn't hit him in the face
and he did not drink the (salt) water,'' Nivaldo Fernandez Ferran said in an
interview broadcast Monday by ``Dateline NBC.''
</P>
<P>
	   When their boat began to sink, they were able to save one water bottle, and
only Elian was allowed to drink the fresh water, he said. Among the people who
died after high waves and heavy winds capsized their 17-foot aluminum boat were
Elian's mother and stepfather.
</P>
<P>
	   Ferran and his girlfriend came ashore near Key Biscayne on Nov. 23. Elian
was later found clinging to an inner tube offshore and has been at the center of
an international custody battle ever since.
</P>
<P>
	   His father and the Cuban government are demanding his return. Attorney
General Janet Reno and President Clinton have backed a decision made by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to return the boy to the island nation.
Elian's Miami relatives and several Cuban exile groups are trying to keep him in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   After the boat sank, two inner tubes were tied together to form a raft,
which the would-be immigrants used to stay afloat for two days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were there all morning and afternoon and part of the night,'' Ferran
said. ``Many people had swallowed water. They were delirious from fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ferran said one of the men started hallucinating so much that he thought he
saw land and swam off into the night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was thirsty and hungry and he thought that land was close. ... He said,
'Look, land is there, it's close,''' Ferran said. ``We told him, 'No, we're in
the middle of the ocean.' He said, 'Yes, yes, there it is. I can reach it.' And
he swam and we didn't see him.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Battle Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush questioned the credibility of Sen.
John McCain's campaign-promised tax cut Monday, while the GOP challenger said
he'd give the breaks to working Americans and end ``special benefit'' favors for
big money interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain renewed at a distance the argument that began when the Texas
governor said in a presidential campaign debate that the senator's proposal
would impose ``a $40 billion tax increase'' on the benefits employers provide
their workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Wrong, an architect of the McCain plan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Spitzer, a Phoenix tax attorney, said the McCain proposal is to end the
deductions employers can now take on tax-exempt benefits they give their
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It does nothing to the employees,'' said Spitzer, an Arizona state
senator.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain had not disputed Bush's assertion in the Saturday debate in Des
Moines, Iowa, as the governor pointedly noted. But his campaign immediately
denied it was so.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said later that Bush had mischaracterized his proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're talking about income taxes,'' his spokesman, Howard Opinsky said.
``We're talking about payroll taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arriving in New Hampshire Monday night, Bush said: ``I like the idea of
pointing out that his tax reform is going to raise taxes on people here in this
state, and I intend to make that an issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign based the governor's assertion on Congressional Research
Service estimates of the revenue loss due to the tax-free treatment of
non-retirement fringe benefits aside from health insurance coverage and child
care, which wouldn't be affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's $40 billion claim reflects those estimates extended for five years
after a new administration is installed. But those numbers are based on taxes
paid by individuals, not their employers.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer said the McCain campaign does not have an estimate of the revenues
that would be added by imposing payroll taxes on employers for the value of the
benefits they pay for employees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The point was, I didn't hear an explanation about the $40 billion benefit
tax increase on workers,'' Bush said earlier in the day from Austin, Texas,
during a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``There seems to be a
tax gap between what his explanation was in Iowa and what reality is ...
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an important debate, because it's a debate about the credibility
of tax plans,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush advocates a five-year, $483 billion tax cut, and says the only way to
be certain that projected budget surpluses aren't spent by the government is to
refund most of the money to taxpayers. McCain's alternative is a $237 billion
overall cut, the closing of what he calls tax loopholes to offset part of the
cost, and the commitment of additional budget surpluses to secure the financial
future of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain says Bush would spend more than the projected surpluses, without
putting aside a penny of it for Social Security. The Arizona senator boasted of
a new poll indicating that most Republicans would prefer a smaller tax cut with
more money set aside for Social Security and to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The Time-CNN poll showed 63 percent of Republicans felt that way, 29 percent
wanted more money to go into tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This poll confirms that Republicans agree with me,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest round in their tax argument gets into the fine print of the tax
code, dealing with what are called ``employer paid non-retirement fringe
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
	   By the Bush campaign's account, the McCain tax proposal would impose income
taxes on things like employer-subsidized education, commuting costs, discounted
meals and purchases, parking and life insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said his plan would not do that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I'm saying is that the guy who owns the corporation isn't going to
get his tax break for his golf club membership,'' McCain said on CNN. ``He's not
going to get his spa fees written off and he's not going to get free parking.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congress already has barred tax deductions for perks like country club dues.
The IRS code says that there can be no deduction ``for amounts paid or incurred
for membership in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation or other
social purposes.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Spitzer said there are still loopholes, and McCain wants them closed.
For example, he said, a company can give an executive pricey tickets to a
National Basketball Association game and deduct them as a corporate cost,
although the individual isn't taxed on them.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain told the Rotary Club in Rochester, N.H., that his tax proposal would
be a step toward a flatter, simpler tax code. ``Every time we pass a tax bill,
we put in a special deal, a special benefit for a big-money contributor special
interest,'' McCain said. He said he'd put an end to that.

<HEADLINE> A-Bomb Physicist Dies At Age 85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- Robert Rathbun Wilson, an influential nuclear physicist
who was a leader in the Manhattan Project, died Sunday of complications of a
stroke he suffered last year. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   By 1940, he earned a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, and
only two years later was collaborating with Enrico Fermi at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology on experiments that would lead to the atomic bomb.
Wilson's job was designing particle accelerators.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one was more aware of the technical subtlety of accelerators, no one
more ingenious in practical design, no one paid more attention to their
aesthetic qualities,'' said physicist Bruce McDaniel. ``He thought of
accelerator builders as the contemporary equivalent of the builders of the great
cathedrals in France and Italy, but it was the physics potential that came
first.''
</P>
<P>
	   The work at MIT was a precursor to the secretive World War II effort known
as the Manhattan Project. Wilson invented an electromechanical method for
separating uranium isotopes that became known as the Isotron method, according
to Cornell, where Wilson researched and taught.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1943, Wilson and colleagues from Princeton moved a cyclotron, which
smashed atoms, to Los Alamos, New Mexico. There he headed the Experimental
Nuclear Physics Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years later, the atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima, Japan, and
killed 140,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1947, Wilson joined the physics faculty at Cornell. Its Wilson Synchotron
Laboratory was named for him.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson also served as director of the National Accelerator Laboratory in
Batavia, Ill., which, at four-miles-long, was the largest-ever physics facility.
He was Fermilab's director until 1978.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton meets with Sharpton on King Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The long-awaited meeting between Hillary Rodham Clinton
and the Rev. Al Sharpton took place Monday at a Martin Luther King Jr.
celebration, but the only person who took any flak during the event was somebody
who wasn't there - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
<P>
	   "The only mayor of a big city that could not go into an African-American
community on Martin Luther King Day is the mayor of this city," Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani held a prayer breakfast at Gracie Mansion Monday morning and was
one of several Republican officials who attended a dinner Monday night given by
the Congress of Racial Equality, which is led by the conservative black activist
Roy Innis.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor skipped a King tribute at the Brooklyn Academy of Music that he
has attended for the past few years because Mrs. Clinton decided to attend it.
</P>
<P>
	   "It became a political event once they invited Mrs. Clinton," Ms. Mindel
said. She added that the mayor spent the day working on the city budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton also spoke at the Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Harlem. At
all three events, she recalled having met King when she was 15 in 1963, having
been brought with her church youth group to hear him speak in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   "He took my hand and shook it and I felt my life would never be the same,"
she said, adding that King's stirring speech that night - titled "Remaining
Awake Through a Great Revolution" - inspired her to "dedicate my life to public
service."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton noted there has been progress in blacks achieving equality, but
added: "There is still a need for affirmative action." She quoted her husband,
President Clinton, saying of affirmative action, "We need to mend it, not end
it."
</P>
<P>
	   She was accompanied to Sharpton's headquarters by former Mayors David
Dinkins and Ed Koch, along with a number of other elected Democratic officials.
The audience of about 300 repeatedly interrupted her remarks with cheers,
applause and occasional cries of "Run Hillary run!"
</P>
<P>
	   Afterwards, she met privately with Sharpton and several others, including
the parents of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed African immigrant who was killed by
four white police officers in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had a few private moments with them and expressed my personal sympathy
and condolences and shared my hope that justice is done," Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial of the officers who killed Diallo is set to begin soon in Albany.
It was moved from the Bronx because an appellate court concluded the officers
could not get a fair trial there. Sharpton and U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel of
Harlem have asked the U.S. Justice Department to consider a federal
investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there is a role for the federal government, I would certainly encourage
and urge that that would occur," said Mrs. Clinton. But she said it was too
early to say whether federal intervention is merited.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton did not agree on every issue raised at the Sharpton event, at
one point defending sanctions against Iraq despite murmurs of disapproval.
</P>
<P>
	   "She did very well," Sharpton said afterwards. "She did not show any
reluctance at all to deal with the issues."
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly before Mrs. Clinton entered Sharpton's headquarters, another
speaker, Rev. Charles Norris, said he had missed one of King's demonstrations
because he was working. Referring to his former employers, Norris said: "Miller
No. 1 was a Jew. Miller No. 2 was a Jew. I was then employed by yet another Jew
by the name of Jesus ... and will not be fired until he thinks it's necessary."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton later told reporters that before she arrived, "I heard that one
of the speakers made some divisive comments, which I soundly reject."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton said he had not heard Norris' remarks.

Gore, Bradley Clash on Racial Issues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In their sixth and final debate before next
Monday's kickoff Iowa caucuses, presidential hopefuls Bill Bradley and Vice
President Al Gore addressed several racial issues today in hopes of appealing to
voters in other states with a large minority population. Perched on stools on a
debate stage in Iowa's capital city, both men said firmly they oppose racial
profiling, the practice by which some police target racial minorities for
traffic stops. Bradley challenged Gore to demand the Clinton administration
issue an immediate order banning racial profiling.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Striking back on the issue of gays in the military, a gay
rights group is unveiling a new ad that goes after Republicans who would keep
them out of the armed forces. The ads, being shown tomorrow in New Hampshire and
Iowa, respond to a campaign by the Republican National Committee. The group
accuses Republicans of exploiting Vice President Al Gore's position on the issue
and hopes its own ad campaign will help focus attention on the merits of his
views -- that gays should be allowed to serve openly in the military.

Congo Loyalists Break Rebel Blockade
</SUBHEAD>

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Troops loyal to Congo President Laurent Kabila broke
through rebel lines, ending a two-month siege on a strategic government-held
town, the warring sides said. The breakthrough came early Sunday in Ikela, 400
miles northeast of the capital, Kinshasa. The fighting prompted neighboring
Rwanda to call for U.N. peacekeepers to prevent an outright collapse of Congo's
fraying cease-fire. Kabila and his allies, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, signed
a cease-fire in July with Rwanda and Uganda, the countries that back Congo's
rebels. The rebel factions signed the pact the following month. But fighting has
flared on several fronts since then, and the warring sides frequently accuse
each other of violating the pact.

minor. The blast came during a critical phase in Israel's peace talks with the
Palestinians and Syria. The Clinton administration was forced Monday to put off

the two sides over a projected Israeli pullback on the Golan Heights.

Clinton Aims To Improve AIDS Funds

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for $175 million for
AIDS treatment and prevention programs in his 2001 budget proposal,
administration officials said today. Clinton wants $125 million for Ryan White
Comprehensive AIDS Resources Act grants. The 10-year-old program, provides money
for health clinics treating low-income AIDS patients and for training for those
caring for HIV-infected individuals. The president also will ask Congress to
approve $50 million to fund state and local AIDS prevention programs
administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's the most
the administration has ever sought for prevention, which AIDS groups say is
woefully underfunded by the government.

<HEADLINE> Santana Wins Best-Album Award  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana's band won best-album honors at Monday's
American Music Awards for "Supernatural," a commercial comeback that put the
rock guitar maestro on top of the charts for the first time in his 30-year
career.
</P>
<P>
	   Shania Twain won two awards, for best pop-rock female artist and best
country female artist.
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernatural," mixing Santana's searing instrumentals with vocals by such
collaborators as Dave Matthews and Lauryn Hill, beat out two teen sensations,
the Backstreet Boys' "Millennium" and Britney Spears' "... Baby One More Time."
</P>
<P>
	   Later in the evening, the Backstreet Boys topped Santana and 'N Sync for
favorite pop-rock band, duo or group.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana took the stage to a standing ovation. After thanking his parents,
siblings and wife, he invited his producer, Clive Davis, to join him. "Your
music has soared," Davis told Santana. "To musicians everywhere, this is a
special moment, because it's this man."
</P>
<P>
	   Backstage, the 52-year-old Santana said, "A lot of people told me they
didn't want to work with me because I'm old. Mr. Davis believed in me. We both
believed we had a masterpiece in our belly."
</P>
<P>
	   Spears won for favorite new pop-rock artist. "This has been such an amazing
adventure for me, this whole year," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   TLC was chosen as favorite soul-rhythm and blues artist on the strength of
the album "FanMail."
</P>
<P>
	   Country winners included: Brooks &AMP; Dunn, favorite band, duo or group;
Montgomery Gentry, new artist; and Garth Brooks, album for "Double Live."
</P>
<P>
	   "They say live albums never do anything. Thank you once again for not
listening to the rules," Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
	   DMX won for favorite rap-hip hop artist. "I wouldn't have done this without
Lord and savior Jesus Christ," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three awards were announced before the show, Red Hot Chili Peppers for
favorite alternative artist, Phil Collins for adult contemporary artist and
"Wild Wild West for soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitney Houston, who tied with Twain and Spears for most nominations with
three, was departing for Europe on Monday night or Tuesday and did not plan on
attending the show, awards spokesman Paul Shefrin said. He said her absence was
unrelated to an incident in Hawaii last week, when airport security guards said
they found about half an ounce of marijuana in her bag but she boarded her
flight before police arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   Nominees for the 27th annual awards were chosen by music industry
representatives. The winners were decided by about 20,000 music fans nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides awards in 20 regular categories, the show featured results of an
Internet poll on listeners' favorite musical artists for each decade from the
1950s through the 1980s. Elvis Presley was named favorite artist of the 1950s,
the Beatles were picked for the 1960s and Stevie Wonder won for the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   The show also included an Award of Merit for Gloria Estefan, who was honored
with a musical tribute featuring 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariah Carey received an Award of Achievement for her "rare and
distinguished accomplishments." Michael Jackson and Prince are the only previous
winners of that award.

<HEADLINE> 4-alarm fire raging in Newark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A raging, four-alarm fire visible for miles tore
through a candle factory Monday evening, threatening nearby homes, sending
plumes of choking smoke for miles and forcing the evacuation of about 10
families.
<P>
	   No injuries were reported, said Fire Chief James Langenbach.
</P>
<P>
	   The block-long commercial building housing the Mercury Candle Co., near
Interstate 78 and the Irvington border, began burning just after 3 p.m,
Langenbach said. Within an hour, the four-alarm fire drew as many as 130
firefighters from 29 surrounding fire companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters were hampered by subfreezing temperatures and gusting winds.
But the winds died down about 7 p.m., and the fire was declared under control at
8:14 p.m., Langenbach said.
</P>
<P>
	   Electricity was cut to about 50 customers shortly after the fire began, said
PSE&AMP;G spokeswoman Valorie Ferrara. Some will have power restored on Tuesday, but
Ferrara said others will have to wait an "extended period" as repairs to burned
wires are made.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents without power were staying at a Red Cross shelter established at a
nearby elementary school.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we were all going to burn. But we got out OK," said employee
Maria Cuevas.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just went outside, and I heard two explosions," said Meg Batta, who was
working in a Pathmark supermarket a block and a half from the fire. "There's
heavy black smoke all over here. If the wind shifts, we might have to close."
</P>
<P>
	   Flames leapt from the building's roof, and heavy plumes of smoke obscured
motorists' vision on Route 78.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lord, it was so black you couldn't see a thing," said Myrtle Turner, who
lives two blocks from the fire on Fabyan Place. "There was fire all over. It was
terrible."
</P>
<P>
	   "We saw the flames, and heard sirens and ambulances," added Audrey Anderson,
an employee of The Rainbow Shop, a dress store on Lyons Avenue in Irvington,
also a block and a half from the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The building also contained a business that made kitchen equipment, said an
employee who declined to identify himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Langenbach said cold air had not frozen firefighters' hoses, but water was
freezing upon contact with the ground.

<HEADLINE> Cold keeps MLK celebration inside but doesn't stop it  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - It may have been cold outside but spirits were
warmed on the inside all around upstate New York, as people everywhere
celebrated Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of equality and nonviolence.
<P>
	   "Forget about the weather outside," Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings said Monday
during the program in the Empire State Plaza Convention Center. "It's warm in
here."
</P>
<P>
	   The frigidly-cold weather in Albany - the wind chill factor at noon was -45
degrees - forced planners to cancel a march to the Martin Luther King Monument
at Albany's Lincoln Park.
</P>
<P>
	   But no one seemed to mind after inspirational songs by the Empire State King
Interdenominational Mass Choir and the Empire State Youth Orchestra, as well as
an impassioned lecture from the Rev. Calvin Butts III, pastor of the Abyssinian
Baptist Church in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Butts, who also is the president of the State University of New York at Old
Westbury, praised King, saying "the marching feet of his nonviolent army shook
the foundations of America."
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a prophet to the nation, saying that we will live together as
brothers and sisters or we will perish apart as fools," Butts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue, the highest-ranking state official at the program,
urged people to make every day a celebration of Martin Luther King's dream of
equality and civil rights. "The key is action now, today and every day," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue also accepted on behalf of the state a small crystal Martin Luther
King Jr. monument donated by Steuben Glass and the New York Power Authority. The
monument will "remind us of the past and guide us to the future," Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
	   The monument will be placed in the Empire State Plaza later this year, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone was celebrating this day, however. Members of the Center For
Law &AMP; Justice protested outside the Empire State Convention Center during the
program, trying to call attention to the growing number of prisoners being
denied parole in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Alice Green, the center's executive director, wants legislative hearings on
the state's prison systems. She says the prisons are steadily getting worse for
inmates and officials are denying inmates a chance at parole to keep a steady
low-paid work force for the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters carried signs saying "Dr. King was a prisoner too," "Parole
justice" and "Prisoners have families too." and chanted "We are family."
</P>
<P>
	   "If George Pataki is serious about Martin Luther King Day, then he would
listen to what these people have to say," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Green saw no conflict in holding protests on Martin Luther King Jr. Day,
saying peaceful protests - not acceptance of the status quo - are what Dr. King
espoused.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not here to sing and dance for the white people," Green said. "That's
what they want us to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Justyn Glowinski, an 11-year-old boy shopping in the Walden Galleria Mall in
Cheektowaga, N.Y., had his own interpretation of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "At my school there was a play on Friday about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
and maybe if he didn't live there wouldn't be black kids at my school," he said.
"And maybe we couldn't use the bathroom in the mall together."
</P>
<P>
	   Others questioned whether they should even have to think about Monday as
anything but another day off. "I mean, you don't sit around thinking about what
George Washington did when you get out of school for his birthday," said Kiesha
Moore, 15. "But I guess maybe I think about MLK a lot of days anyway, so I don't
need a day off to."
</P>
<P>
	   That kind of attitude bothers Denise Thomas, who was also in the mall.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very important day, but maybe kids should be in school today," she
said. "You know, learning about what the 60's meant to black Americans. They
aren't learning about Dr. King by shopping today. In school, maybe they would."
</P>
<P>
	   In Utica, a luncheon and awards ceremony were held along with an evening
march and memorial service at Hope Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolyn Bradley was on pins and needles in anticipation. "We were raised to
look for the good in people, not the bad," said Bradley, who met King after he
gave a speech in Kingstree, S.C., in the early 1960s. "We had a lot of love
instilled in us."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hornets 115, Raptors 94  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE MACENKA AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Charlotte Hornets smiled again Monday night,
thanks to one of the best runs in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing their first home game since the death of co-captain Bobby Phills in
a car wreck five days earlier, the Hornets rode a 25-0 surge to a 115-94 victory
over the Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
	   The run was one point short of the club record for most consecutive points
scored and it helped the Hornets end a seven-game losing skid. But those numbers
were secondary on an emotional night when the team tried to take another step in
its recovery from the shock of losing Phills.
</P>
<P>
	   The days following the wreck appeared to be hardest on point guard David
Wesley, Phills' close friend and the man police say Phills was racing at the
time of the crash near the Charlotte Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley, wearing one of Phills' sweatbands on his left arm, was wiping away
tears at the start of the game, but by late in the third quarter, he was
grinning and trading high-fives and cheers with teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte, improving to 14-2 at home, got 25 points and five steals from
Eddie Jones, 24 points and 11 rebounds from Derrick Coleman, and 23 points from
Elden Campbell. Wesley, repeatedly drawing loud cheers from the crowd of 20,278,
finished with nine points, nine assists and three rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Vince Carter, one of several Toronto players to spend much of the game in
foul trouble, also left briefly in the third quarter with a bruised right knee.
He wound up playing just 29 minutes but had 24 points, two games after scoring a
club-record 47.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte held the Raptors scoreless for more than seven minutes bridging
the second and third quarters, opening the way for the Hornets to build a 63-50
lead. At that stage, Toronto had eight players with at least three fouls.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley took over from there, contributing five points and two assists as the
Hornets stretched their lead to 79-58 with 4:29 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Raptors got no closer than 12 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The evening began with a reading of a letter of gratitude to the Hornets and
their fans from Phills' widow, Kendall, and it continued with a video tribute to
her late husband. The clip featured a mix of Phills' highlights and him hamming
for cameras with his teammates and his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   With the arena still dark, the club asked fans to take part in a moment of
silence, during which a spotlight was trained on a chair placed near the
Hornets' basket. A basketball sat on the chair and Phills' jersey was draped
over the back of the seat.
</P>
<P>
	   While practically everyone in the coliseum stood, Wesley sat on the Hornets'
bench, slumped over and crying. Several teammates tried to console him after the
lights came back up, but he still had tears in his eyes when he walked out for
the opening tip.

<HEADLINE> Devils 5, Hurricanes 2  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Rookie John Madden broke a second-period tie
with his NHL-best fourth short-handed goal and the New Jersey Devils defeated
the Carolina Hurricanes 5-2 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Brendan Morrison, Krzysztof Oliwa, Patrik Elias and Bobby Holik also scored
as the red-hot Devils won for the ninth time in 12 games (9-1-2) and opened a
seven-point lead over second-place Philadelphia in the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Brodeur had a relatively easy night making 23 saves in earning his
league-leading 27th win.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Ranheim and Martin Gelinas scored for the Hurricanes, who have lost
three straight.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Devils controlled the majority of play, Ranheim tied the game at
1-1 early in the second period, putting in the rebound of a shot from the point
by defenseman Marek Malik at 2:12.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hurricanes got a chance to take the lead a little more than six minutes
later when Scott Stevens was called for tripping.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than a minute into the power play, Madden stole the puck from Jeff
O'Neill at the New Jersey blue line, skated the length of the ice and beat Eric
Fichaud with a shot between the pads at 9:14.
</P>
<P>
	   Madden is now one shy of the Devils team and franchise record for
short-handed goals, set by Brian Rolston last season and Wilf Paiement in
1976-77.
</P>
<P>
	   Oliwa made his mother, visiting from Poland, cry with a power-play goal at
4:55 of the third and Elias iced the game five minutes later with his 16th goal,
including his 10th in the last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Gelinas and Holik scored in the closing minutes as the Devils beat Carolina
for the second time in as many games this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Morrison, who had eight assists in the last five games, gave the Devils a
1-0 lead by scoring on a back-hander in front just five seconds after Carolina
defenseman Steve Halko was penalized for interference.
</P>
<P>
	   Fichaud had 27 saves in his first start since Dec. 23.

<HEADLINE> Virginia 80, No. 6 NC State 73  </HEADLINE>
    By ELIZABETH A. DAVIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Renee Robinson scored 19 points, including four free
throws down the stretch, and Svetlana Volnaya added 18 to help Virginia beat No.
6 North Carolina State 80-73 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Telisha Quarles scored a career-high 21 points to lead Virginia (13-4, 5-1
Atlantic Coast Conference), which extended its winning streak to nine.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolfpack (14-2, 5-2 ACC), which lost its second in a row, dropped three
places in The Associated Press Top 25 poll Monday following its first loss,
71-56 to Clemson on Thursday. That loss snapped a 14-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Summer Erb scored 18 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Kaayla Chones added
18 for N.C State.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolfpack, losing by as much as 21 after halftime, went on a 9-2 run
keyed by Tynesha Lewis' first 3-pointer and five points by Terah James, trimming
Virginia's lead to 70-66 with 3:57 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cavaliers pushed the lead back to 77-68 with Volnaya's 3-pointer and two
free throws by Robinson with 1:29 left. Robinson made two more foul shots with
25.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Quarles came out strong for Virginia in the first half with 14 points and
hit 4-of-4 3-pointers. Her third basket from behind the arc with 15:08 left put
the Cavaliers ahead 13-12. Robinson's 3-pointer with 11:57 to go in the first
half gave Virginia a 21-16 lead, which the Cavaliers did not relinquish.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia closed the final 8:09 of the first half with a 15-8 run during
which N.C. State was held scoreless for a four-minute span. Elena Kravchenko's
basket put the Cavaliers up 30-22. James hit a jumper with 3:27 to cut
Virginia's lead to 35-27, but Kravchenko answered with a lay-in and Volnaya made
a fast-break lay-up to increase the Cavaliers' lead to 39-27.
</P>
<P>
	   Erb, who had 10 points in the first half, didn't during a seven-minute
stretch of the half as the Cavaliers built their lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, N.C. State's leading scorer with an average 13.5 points a game,
missed all eight shots she tried from the floor and made only two points off
free throws in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia is the only ACC team that leads in its series against N.C. State,
26-23.

<HEADLINE> Sheppard DNA Test Inconclusive  </HEADLINE>
   By M.R. KROPKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A state-ordered DNA test aimed at trying to prove Dr. Sam
Sheppard killed his wife proved inconclusive, a prosecutor said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William D. Mason had ordered a DNA test of the
fetus carried by Sheppard's wife, Marilyn Sheppard, when she was killed at her
home in 1954.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sheppards' son, Sam Reese Sheppard, has been trying for a decade to
clear his father's name in his mother's violent death. He is suing to have his
father declared innocent, a finding that could lead to Ohio being held
financially liable for wrongful imprisonment. The civil trial is scheduled to
start Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason had hoped a determination that Sheppard was not the father could be
used to show a motive for murder.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mason said tests on DNA from the fetus were inconclusive because the
samples tested had degraded over time. While he was still awaiting the final
report, Mason said Sheppard could have been the father, but that the information
was not conclusive.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyer Terry Gilbert, who represents Sam Reese Sheppard, would not comment
prior to the release of the coroner's report. But he said Sam and Marilyn
Sheppard were happy about the pregnancy and that there was never any evidence of
marital discord concerning it.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Sheppard's body, and that of the male fetus she was carrying, were
exhumed Oct. 5, more than 45 years after being laid to rest in a suburban
Cleveland cemetery.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor was convicted of his wife's murder in 1954 and spent 10 years in
prison before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the verdict and Sheppard was
acquitted at a retrial. The case was one of the most highly publicized of its
day and inspired ``The Fugitive'' television series.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Sheppard, who died in 1970, always claimed a bushy-haired intruder
killed his wife and then knocked him unconscious when he ran to her aid.

<HEADLINE> Fires, Flooding Hit South Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Army troops and air force helicopters helped
fight wildfires Monday that destroyed more than 50 homes and left a thick pall
of smoke over Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
	   While the fires burned for the third day in dry conditions in the western
part of the country, much of the rest of South Africa was drenched with
torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
	   In rural Northern Province, a rain-soaked hut collapsed Monday, killing a
4-year-old girl and injuring her 7-year-old sister, the South African Press
Association reported. Days of steady rain in central, northern and eastern
regions caused flooding that closed roads.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Cape Town area, fires hit beachside towns, a township and surrounding
wine country. Many of the blazes were sparked by smoldering cigarettes or
carelessly maintained barbecue fires combined with very hot, dry weather,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Weary firefighters said the fires were the worst in the region in 30 years.
The army was called in some areas to help fight the blazes, and air force
helicopters dumped water on fires raging on high mountain ridges.
</P>
<P>
	   Several fires were still burning Monday evening, but those near residential
areas were under control, fire officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- On the eve of what could be a record day in salary
arbitration, eight more players settled Monday and free agent John Burkett
agreed to a deal with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventy-nine players were set to exchange proposed salaries with their teams
Tuesday and the focus was on a pair of New York Yankees: shortstop Derek Jeter
and closer Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeter won $5 million in arbitration last winter and Rivera $4.25 million. It
was possible Jeter could exceed the record amount requested, $9 million by
teammate Bernie Williams in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   New York countered Williams at $7.5 million that winter, the most offered by
a team, and the sides settled at $8.25 million. After the season, when Williams
was a free agent, the Yankees signed him to an $87.5 million, seven-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Last January, when just 38 players swapped numbers with their teams, the
most asked for was $6.5 million, by Toronto first baseman Carlos Delgado.
</P>
<P>
	   Most players and teams settle before hearings. The highest award by an
arbitrator was the $5.3 million pitcher Jack McDowell got from the Chicago White
Sox in 1994 -- when he lost his case.
</P>
<P>
	   Settling Monday were San Diego right-handers Donne Wall ($2 million for two
years) and Brian Boehringer ($830,000), Toronto right-hander John Frascatore
($1.85 million for two years), Padres outfielder Ruben Rivera ($700,000),
Chicago Cubs left-hander Felix Heredia ($625,000), Cincinnati left-hander Gabe
White ($630,000) and Milwaukee outfielder Mark Sweeney ($515,000).
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco reliever Felix Rodriguez got a two-year contract extension.
Cincinnati also got around to announcing a $1.6 million, one-year contract with
left-hander Ron Villone, a deal agreed to before players filed for arbitration
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay, seeking to bolster its pitching after trading Rolando Arrojo,
agreed to a minor league contract with Burkett, who would get an $850,000 deal
if he's added to the roster and the chance to make $2,175,000 more in
performance bonuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Burkett, a 35-year-old right-hander, went 9-8 with a 5.62 ERA in 30 games
for Texas last year, including 5-1 with a 3.51 ERA in his last seven outings.
</P>
<P>
	   In 10 seasons with the Rangers, San Francisco and Florida, Burkett has
averaged 12 wins, 31 starts and 194 innings while going 119-101 with a 4.31 ERA.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the end of the season, the Devil Rays have acquired third baseman
Vinny Castilla from Colorado and signed pitchers Juan Guzman ($12.5 million for
two years) and Steve Trachsel ($1 million guaranteed), and outfielders Greg
Vaughn ($34 million for four years) and Gerald Williams ($5.75 million for two
years).
</P>
<P>
	   Catcher Tyler Houston, cut by Cleveland last month, agreed to a $835,000,
one-year contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston, a 29-year-old left-handed hitter, batted .233 (58-for-249) with
nine homers and 27 RBIs for the Chicago Cubs last season, then was obtained by
Cleveland on Aug. 31 for minor league pitcher Richard Negrette.
</P>
<P>
	   After the deal, Houston hit .148 for the Indians (2-for-27) with one homer,
three RBIs and 11 strikeouts.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Pack To Make Sherman Coach  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Mike Sherman, the Seattle Seahawks' offensive
coordinator and a former Green Bay assistant, will be hired as the new coach of
the Packers, a team source told The Associated Press on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman likely will be introduced at a news conference on Tuesday, the
source told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   A longtime college assistant coach with just three years of NFL experience,
Sherman suddenly emerged as general manager Ron Wolf's choice when the GM's
early favorites -- former Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer and Rams offensive
coordinator Mike Martz -- took themselves out of the running.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post-Crescent of Appleton and ESPN first reported Sherman's hiring.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman and his agent were on their way to Green Bay on Monday night, the
source said. Wolf was returning to Green Bay from Mobile, Ala., where he was
scouting at the Senior Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf fired Ray Rhodes and his staff on Jan. 3 after the Packers completed an
8-8 season, Rhodes' first in Green Bay. The GM cited a team-wide lack of
discipline and focus, and he vowed his new coach would create a
"well-disciplined, tough and hard-nosed football team."
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman, who has no head coaching experience, spent two years as Mike
Holmgren's tight ends coach in Green Bay before moving to Seattle with Holmgren
last January, where he doubled as offensive coordinator and tight ends coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman apparently made a strong impression when Wolf interviewed him in
Green Bay on Saturday. Wolf said the search for Rhodes' replacement would be "a
lengthy process," yet he settled on Sherman just two weeks after firing Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf and team president Bob Harlan, who was traveling, did not return phone
calls Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Holmgren in 1992, Sherman comes to the Packers with no head coaching
experience, but a background in the disciplined, hard-nosed style of football
favored by Wolf.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf apparently chose a coach who would keep the West Coast offense that
brought the Packers their recent success and which three-time MVP quarterback
Brett Favre is most comfortable running.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman was popular with Green Bay's players, including tight end Mark
Chmura, who made the Pro Bowl during each of Sherman's two seasons with the
Packers. Chmura missed all but two games of the 1999 season with a neck injury,
but expects to return next season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers missed the playoffs under Rhodes for the first time since 1992,
the first of Holmgren's seven years in Green Bay. Holmgren, who also came to the
Packers with no head coaching experience, led the Packers to consecutive Super
Bowl appearances in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers broke off talks with Schottenheimer over the weekend, apparently
because Schottenheimer's salary demands would have been more than Wolf was
willing to pay. The Packers owe Rhodes and his staff at least $2 million next
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Martz signed a two-year extension with the Rams on Monday and removed
himself from consideration for any new jobs. Unlike Schottenheimer or Martz, the
Packers will not need to offer Sherman's former team compensation for his
services.
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco head coach Steve Mariucci and Oakland head coach Jon Gruden,
both former Packers assistants liked by Wolf, would have been unable to get out
of their current contracts. Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez took himself out of
the running last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Before joining Holmgren in Green Bay, Sherman was an offensive line coach at
Texas A&AMP;M and UCLA from 1989-96.
</P>
<P>
	   He was hired as Texas A&AMP;M's offensive coordinator in 1997, but left for the
Packers before the season began. Sherman also was an assistant at Holy Cross,
Tulane and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman was the offensive coordinator at Holy Cross from 1985-88. In
Seattle, he coordinated the team's offense but Holmgren called the plays, just

<HEADLINE> Gays in Military Ads To Be Aired  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Striking back on the issue of gays in the military, a gay
rights group is unveiling a new ad that goes after Republicans who would keep
them out of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads, being shown Tuesday in New Hampshire and Iowa, respond to an ad
campaign from the Republican National Committee that spotlights the controversy
surrounding Al Gore's position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republican presidential candidates are so busy fighting about who can
and cannot serve in the military, they may have forgotten the values we actually
fight for,'' says the 30-second ad produced by the Human Rights Campaign, a
Washington-based gay advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   The group is spending $30,000 to air the ad over five days in Iowa beginning
Tuesday and four days in New Hampshire from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The group accuses Republicans of exploiting Gore's position on the issue and
hopes the ad campaign will help focus attention on the merits of his views --
that gays should be allowed to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   In a debate earlier this month, Gore said he would require officers on the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to share his position on the matter. Later he backtracked,
saying that his appointees would simply be required to implement his policy.
</P>
<P>
	   But that clarification did not stop the RNC from running $10,000 worth of
ads accusing Gore of setting up a litmus test that Colin Powell and Norman
Schwartzkopf couldn't pass.
</P>
<P>
	   The gay rights ad does not name any one Republican, but includes shots from
a GOP debate of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Alan
Keyes and Gary Bauer. Bush and McCain have said they would continue President
Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which allows gays to serve in the
military as long as they do not acknowledge their homosexuality. The other GOP
candidates want to ban their service altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   The RNC ad features shots of soldiers at work, of Powell and Schwarztkopf
and ends with: ``Call Al Gore. Tell him the only litmus test ought to be for
patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley, who have essentially the same position, are competing for
liberal voters who participate in Democratic primaries and are generally
supportive of gay rights. But the RNC hopes the issue will come back to hurt the
eventual nominee in the general election, when the competition is for more
moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the gay rights group is hoping to influence not just the debate
but public opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   Its ad says that the military is fighting for core values: ``Equality,
fairness, freedom, justice -- for all Americans, including gay Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The purpose of this campaign is to refocus the debate on the core values
we think should drive it,'' said David M. Smith of the Human Rights Campaign.
``The debate has been sorely lacking of any substance. The candidates have
basically gotten away with simply platitudes.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Down at Midday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell Tuesday morning on profit-taking
following sharp gains the previous day. The dollar edged lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 249.25 points, or 1.28
percent, to 19,187.98 at the end of the morning session. On Monday, the average
rose 480.68 points, or 2.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 104.98 yen at late morning, down 0.20 yen from late Monday
in Tokyo but above its late London level of 104.78 yen. Financial markets in New
York were closed Monday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices opened lower as investors locked in profits a
day after the Nikkei closed at its highest level in 29 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's finish of 19,437.23 points was the index's highest close since Aug.
8, 1997, when it ended the day at 19,604.46.
</P>
<P>
	   "Players are adopting wait-and-see positions with U.S. equity markets on
holiday Monday, and profit-taking is hitting Nikkei 225 issues in particular,"
said Tsuguya Onozuka, a dealer at Yamatane Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 13.30 points, or 0.79 percent, to 1,668.67. The TOPIX closed up
33.73 points, or 2.05 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar moved in a narrow range in morning Asian
trading Tuesday after financial markets in New York took Monday off.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 105.96 yen, down from 106.80 yen
late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.7600
percent from Monday's finish of 1.7800 percent. Its price rose 0.17 point to
100.34.

<HEADLINE> SmithKline Workers Await Future  </HEADLINE>
    By BILL BERGSTROM AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- SmithKline Beecham urged its 9,000 Pennsylvania
employees Monday to be patient as they await word on the impact of the company's
merger with Glaxo Wellcome on individual jobs and departments.
</P>
<P>
	   "These questions cannot be answered in the first few weeks or months," said
a notice of the merger that greeted employees arriving in the lobby of
SmithKline's U.S. headquarters in downtown Philadelphia. "The months ahead will
be challenging and stressful."
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline and Glaxo are combining to form the world's largest
pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Johnson, a Philadelphia spokesman for SmithKline, said: "All U.S.-based
operations will remain in their current location."
</P>
<P>
	   The companies have said SmithKline and Glaxo, which has its U.S.
headquarters at Research Triangle Park, N.C., would keep their U.S. operations
separate.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline's chief operating officer, Jean-Pierre Garnier, who lives in the
Philadelphia area and is to become chief executive of the combined company, has
said it would remain committed to the Philadelphia area. Those comments raised
hopes for most of the 2,000 jobs at SmithKline's U.S. headquarters in the city,
2,800 at two research operations in the suburbs, 3,600 jobs in its
nonprescription drug business in Pittsburgh and several hundred scattered sales
and marketing jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Philadelphia Mayor John F. Street said, "We will do everything we can to
work with them to try to minimize the impact, but in the end I think that there
are going to be fewer jobs and we will probably lose a few."
</P>
<P>
	   Several employees in the lobby said they had been asked not to
comment.

<HEADLINE> Man nabbed at border could be daring getaway robber  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A phony passport and a sword prompted border officials
to deny a man access from Buffalo into Canada. The real surprise came later,
when the NYPD hauled him back to New York on Monday and arrested him for murder.
<P>
	   Officials were also looking into the possibility that the man, whom police
identified as 21-year-old Waftali Triplett, may be responsible for a series of
knifepoint robberies and a daredevil escape from a high-rise.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Triplett had "personal notes" with him detailing the crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Triplett was charged late Monday with second-degree murder and criminal
possession of a weapon in connection with the Dec. 26 killing of a Brooklyn
resident, said Detective Robert Samuel, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Triplett had been flown back from Buffalo earlier Monday - escorted by
several NYPD detectives - and taken in for questioning, said Deputy Chief Tom
Fahey, another spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were also investigating whether Triplett was responsible for at least
eight knifepoint robberies since Jan. 8 in midtown Manhattan. The robber fooled
police Jan. 11 after he ran into a high-rise building, jumped out a 19th floor
window onto an air conditioning unit on a nearby rooftop, disguised himself as a
food delivery person and blended into the lunchtime crowd to escape.
</P>
<P>
	   After that getaway, police declared all-out war by splashing a sketch of the
robber all over the news. One tabloid newspaper even dubbed him "Spiderman."
</P>
<P>
	   Did the notoriety send the robber out of town? Was it Triplett? That remains
to be seen, police say. But a police source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
believes the publicity spooked the robber, prompting him to hop a Greyhound bus
Sunday for Buffalo in hopes of fleeing the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   At the border Sunday, Triplett was on a bus at the Peace Bridge crossing
when he was denied access into Canada, said Janet Rapaport, a spokeswoman for
the U.S. Customs Service in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   He was allegedly sporting a phony passport, had a sword and was carrying a
6-inch dagger and a 12-inch hunting knife.
</P>
<P>
	   Into the arms of waiting Customs officials he went. A check of his personal
effects proved interesting. He had several documents with various names of them,
said the federal official.
</P>
<P>
	   "And personal notes he had indicated he was wanted by the NYPD," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Once in a holding cell in Buffalo, Triplett allegedly tried to get away
again, this time by crawling into a ceiling space after he knocked down some
tiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in New York, police were scheduling lineups, hoping a victim or witness
to the recent robberies might link the would-be border crosser to the crimes in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   Lineups could begin as early as Tuesday, police said.

<HEADLINE> Gen. Lee Portrait Vandalized in Va.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A portrait of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee hanging at
an outdoor gallery devoted to the city's history was vandalized Monday, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Joel Lawson, a police arson investigator, declined to describe the nature or
the extent of the damage to the portrait. The case was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The City Council voted last summer to display the portrait following a
debate over whether Lee's role in defending slavery in the South made his image
offensive to blacks. Lee lived briefly in Richmond after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
	   City Councilman Sa'ad El-Amin, who is black, threatened a boycott of the
entire historical display, prompting organizers to alter plans and choose a
depiction of Lee in civilian clothes.
</P>
<P>
	   The gallery is along a downtown floodwall. Other images include Abraham
Lincoln and Gabriel Prosser, who led a slave revolt before the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
	   In Virginia, Monday was Lee-Jackson-King Day, commemorating the lives of
Confederate generals Lee and Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson and civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr.

<HEADLINE> A-Bomb Physicist Dies At Age 85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- Robert Rathbun Wilson, an influential nuclear physicist
who was a leader in the Manhattan Project, died Sunday of complications of a
stroke he suffered last year. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   By 1940, he earned a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, and
only two years later was collaborating with Enrico Fermi at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology on experiments that would lead to the atomic bomb.
Wilson's job was designing particle accelerators.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one was more aware of the technical subtlety of accelerators, no one
more ingenious in practical design, no one paid more attention to their
aesthetic qualities,'' said physicist Bruce McDaniel. ``He thought of
accelerator builders as the contemporary equivalent of the builders of the great
cathedrals in France and Italy, but it was the physics potential that came
first.''
</P>
<P>
	   The work at MIT was a precursor to the secretive World War II effort known
as the Manhattan Project. Wilson invented an electromechanical method for
separating uranium isotopes that became known as the Isotron method, according
to Cornell, where Wilson researched and taught.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1943, Wilson and colleagues from Princeton moved a cyclotron, which
smashed atoms, to Los Alamos, New Mexico. There he headed the Experimental
Nuclear Physics Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years later, the atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima, Japan, and
killed 140,000 people. The United States dropped a second atomic bomb three days
later on Nagasaki, Japan, killing 70,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1947, Wilson joined the physics faculty at Cornell. Its Wilson Synchotron
Laboratory was named for him.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson also served as director of the National Accelerator Laboratory in
Batavia, Ill., which, at four-miles-long, was the largest-ever physics facility.
He was Fermilab's director until 1978.

Racial Issues Top Gore, Bradley Debate

<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In their sixth and final debate before next
Monday's kickoff Iowa caucuses, presidential hopefuls Al Gore and Bill Bradley
agreed the Confederate flag should come down from atop the South Carolina
statehouse. A number of race-related issues came up in the hour-long televised
debate, ranging from insensitive comments made by Atlanta Braves baseball player
John Rocker, to the controversial New York minister, Al Sharpton. Both men hoped
to use the forum to appeal to voters in other states with a larger minority
population.

Missile Test May Affect US Strategy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If successful, a test tomorrow of the Pentagon's
anti-missile missile could move administration officials closer to recommending
that President Clinton commit to deploying a nationwide missile defense. A
system of interceptor rockets, radars and computerized command centers could be
deployed as early as 2005, although many hurdles remain. If tomorrow's test goes
as planned, a 121-pound "smart rock" will steer itself into the path of a mock
warhead about 140 miles above the central Pacific Ocean, creating a collision
that would reduce both objects to space dust. The launch is to take place
sometime during a four-hour period that begins at 9 p.m. EST.

    MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Malik Sealy banked in a 3-pointer as time expired to
give the Minnesota Timberwolves a 101-100 victory over the Indiana Pacers on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Jackson had put Indiana ahead with a short jump shot with 1.7 seconds
to play, but Sealy took an inbounds pass from Sam Mitchell and released the
winning shot with Jalen Rose running at him. It banked off the glass and through
the net as the buzzer sounded. Wolves players and coaches raced off the bench
and mobbed Sealy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolves rallied from a 10-point deficit in the final quarter, sparked by
Kevin Garnett's career-high 37 points and Joe Smith's 13 fourth-quarter points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolves played without starting point guard Terrell Brandon, who suffered
a right calf strain in a loss Saturday to the Los Angeles Lakers. Rookie William
Avery started in his place.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett's turnaround jumper with 2:52 to play gave Minnesota its first lead
since early in the third quarter at 91-90.
</P>
<P>
	   Reggie Miller converted a four-point play with 2:24 to go to give Indiana a
94-91 lead. Smith's free throw and Garnett's turnaround jumper tied the score.
</P>
<P>
	   Dale Davis and Garnett traded baskets twice before Jackson backed his way
into the lane and released his one-handed shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Rik Smits scored 14 of his 20 points in the third quarter for the Pacers to
give Indiana what appeared to be a comfortable lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Smits, who played only six minutes in the first half because of two early
fouls, scored 10 points during a 17-10 run to end the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   But Smith scored 11 of his team's first 14 points in the fourth quarter,
then Garnett hit seven shots in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana fought back from an eight-point first-quarter deficit to lead by
three at halftime.

<HEADLINE> Hornets 115, Raptors 94  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE MACENKA AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Charlotte Hornets smiled again Monday night,
thanks to one of the best runs in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing their first home game since the death of co-captain Bobby Phills in
a car wreck five days earlier, the Hornets rode a 25-0 surge to a 115-94 victory
over the Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
	   The run was one point short of the club record for most consecutive points
scored and it helped the Hornets end a seven-game losing skid. But those numbers
were secondary on an emotional night when the team tried to take another step in
its recovery from the shock of losing Phills.
</P>
<P>
	   The days following the wreck appeared to be hardest on point guard David
Wesley, Phills' close friend and the man police say Phills was racing at the
time of the crash near the Charlotte Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley, wearing one of Phills' sweatbands on his left arm, was wiping away
tears at the start of the game, but by late in the third quarter, he was
grinning and trading high-fives and cheers with teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte, improving to 14-2 at home, got 25 points and five steals from
Eddie Jones, 24 points and 11 rebounds from Derrick Coleman, and 23 points from
Elden Campbell. Wesley, repeatedly drawing loud cheers from the crowd of 20,278,
finished with nine points, nine assists and three rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Vince Carter, one of several Toronto players to spend much of the game in
foul trouble, also left briefly in the third quarter with a bruised right knee.
He wound up playing just 29 minutes but had 24 points, two games after scoring a
club-record 47.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte held the Raptors scoreless for more than seven minutes bridging
the second and third quarters, opening the way for the Hornets to build a 63-50
lead. At that stage, Toronto had eight players with at least three fouls.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley took over from there, contributing five points and two assists as the
Hornets stretched their lead to 79-58 with 4:29 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Raptors got no closer than 12 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The evening began with a reading of a letter of gratitude to the Hornets and
their fans from Phills' widow, Kendall, and it continued with a video tribute to
her late husband. The clip featured a mix of Phills' highlights and him hamming
for cameras with his teammates and his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   With the arena still dark, the club asked fans to take part in a moment of
silence, during which a spotlight was trained on a chair placed near the
Hornets' basket. A basketball sat on the chair and Phills' jersey was draped
over the back of the seat.
</P>
<P>
	   While practically everyone in the coliseum stood, Wesley sat on the Hornets'
bench, slumped over and crying. Several teammates tried to console him after the
lights came back up, but he still had tears in his eyes when he walked out for
the opening tip.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Benjamin ``Ben'' Masselink, a novelist, columnist and
script writer for ``Hawaii Five-O'' and ``Starsky and Hutch,'' died Thursday of
prostate cancer. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
	   Masselink wrote a column called ``Tales of an Ancient Beachcomber.'' It most
recently ran in the Daily Breeze, published in Torrance.
</P>
<P>
	   His work also appeared in the Los Angeles Times, TV Guide, Playboy, the
Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal and Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
	   Masselink wrote a series of books, and in the 1960s focused on television
writing and produced scripts for ``Dr. Kildare,'' ``Marcus Welby, M.D.,''
``Barnaby Jones,'' ``Hawaii Five-O'' and ``Starsky and Hutch.''
John Newland
</P>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Newland, the dignified host of the old ``Alcoa
Presents'' television series, died Jan. 10. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Newland directed and was the host of all 99 segments of ``Alcoa Presents,''
which ran from 1959-61. The show dramatized case histories of supposed occult
phenomena. It later went into syndication as ``One Step Beyond.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also had roles on ``Robert Montgomery Presents,'' ``Philco Playhouse,''
``Studio One'' and ``Kraft Theater.''
</P>
<P>
	   He directed TV movies and episodes of many shows, including ``The Loretta
Young Show,'' ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' ``Wonder Woman'' and ``Fantasy
Island.''
</P>
<P>
	   He was 51 when he directed his first film, ``My Lover, My Son,'' a 1969
British feature about incest starring Romy Schneider.
Susumu Ohno
</P>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Susumu Ohno, a pioneering geneticist whose research
focused on the role of genes in evolution and sex determination, died Thursday
from complications of lung cancer. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
	   Ohno is credited with developing the theory that evolution is strongly
linked to redundancy in the sequence of chemical building blocks that make up
genes. He also discovered that one of the two X-chromosomes in female mammals is
inactive.
</P>
<P>
	   Ohno published more than 350 scientific papers in the United States and
abroad. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and, in 1992, he
was elected to the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.
John Morris Rankin
</P>
<P>
	   MARGAREE HARBOUR, Nova Scotia (AP) -- John Morris Rankin, a member of the
musical family that helped popularize Cape Breton-style Celtic music, was killed
Sunday when his truck ran off a road into the ocean. He was 40.
</P>
<P>
	   Rankin died while driving his son and two other teen-agers to a morning
hockey game. The three youths were all rescued unharmed from the frigid ocean
water off Nova Scotia in eastern Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Rankin played fiddle and piano with his four siblings in groups known first
as The Rankin Family and then the Rankins. Their music drew from the strong
traditional Celtic roots of Cape Breton island, a part of Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
	   The group sold more than 2 million records and won five Juno Awards, the
Canadian equivalent of the Grammy. The Rankins broke up last summer so members
could pursue independent careers.
Ion Ratiu
</P>
<P>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Ion Ratiu, a former presidential candidate who
once chained himself to the railings outside London's Ritz Hotel to protest the
plight of Romanians under communism, died Sunday of esophagus cancer. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratiu was a diplomat who left the country in 1940. He settled in Britain,
where he worked as a journalist for the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   When former communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu visited Britain in 1977 and
was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, Ratiu chained himself to the railings
outside the Ritz Hotel in protest Britain's treatment of Ceausescu's repressive
regime.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratiu returned to his homeland in 1990 after the collapse of communism. He
ran for president, but many Romanians distrusted the man they called ``Mr.
Bow-tie,'' partly because of his English manners and partly because he hadn't
suffered the same hardships as millions of Romanians.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of his death, he headed the Romanian delegation of the
Parliamentary Assembly of NATO.
Irving Stone
</P>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Irving Stone, who started working in his family's greeting
card business at age 5 and helped transform it into American Greetings Corp.,
one of the world's largest card makers, died Monday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone's father, Jacob Sapirstein, founded American Greetings Corp. in 1906
by selling picture postcards from his wagon.
</P>
<P>
	   By age 9, Stone had become a partner in the company and handled the every
aspect of the business, from sales to delivery to billing, for two months while
his father was ill. He was the company's bookkeeper by age 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Dissatisfied with the quality of cards the family was buying for resale,
Stone got the company to begin designing and printing its own cards in the
1930s. One of his earliest verses, ``From Someone Who Likes To Remember Someone
Too Nice To Forget,'' has sold more cards than any other in the company's
history and is still part of the line.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone became company president in 1960, and was promoted to chairman of the
board and chief executive officer in 1978.
Charles Joseph Tiano
</P>
<P>
	   KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Charles Joseph Tiano, sports editor of the Kingston
Daily Freeman for more than 25 years, died Saturday. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
	   Tiano worked for the Freeman from 1945 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Tiano is survived by his wife and his daughter.
Robert Rathbun Wilson
</P>
<P>
	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- Robert Rathbun Wilson, an influential nuclear physicist
who was a leader in the Manhattan Project, died Sunday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1942, he collaborated with Enrico Fermi at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology on experiments that would lead to the atomic bomb. Wilson's job was
designing particle accelerators.
</P>
<P>
	   The work at MIT was a precursor to the secretive World War II effort known
as the Manhattan Project. Wilson invented an electromechanical method for
separating uranium isotopes that became known as the Isotron method.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1943, Wilson and colleagues from Princeton moved their work to Los
Alamos, New Mexico. There he headed the Experimental Nuclear Physics Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson also served as director of the National Accelerator Laboratory in
Batavia, Ill., which, at four-miles-long, was one of the world's largest physics
facility.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Indians Want President Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Groups of Indians blocked highways in several
Ecuadorean provinces Monday, the latest in a series of protests aimed at forcing
the resignation of President Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   Security forces quickly cleared the roads of tree trunks and rocks in the
eight provinces and there were no reports of clashes with the demonstrators,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad has been the target of increasing calls from across the political
spectrum to resign because of his failure to stop Ecuador's economic decline.
Inflation topped 60 percent last year, the highest in Latin America, and the
economy shrank 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to stabilize the economy, the government last week replaced the
national currency, the sucre, with the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   Protest organizers said the currency change was also a focus of Thursday's
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Adopting the dollar will mean that the poor will all die of hunger, misery
and poverty,'' said Antonio Vargas, president of the Indigenous Confederation.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador's economic woes have prompted several recent demonstrations, and the
government declared a state of emergency, allowing it to deploy troops to keep
order.

Interstate 78 and the Irvington border, began burning just after 3 p.m,
Langenbach said. Within an hour, the four-alarm fire drew as many as 130
firefighters from 29 surrounding fire companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters were hampered by subfreezing temperatures and gusting winds.
But the winds died down about 7 p.m., and the fire was declared under control at
8:14 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Langenbach said firefighters expected to be putting out hotspots into the
early morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Electricity was cut to about 50 customers shortly after the fire began, said
PSE&AMP;G spokeswoman Valorie Ferrara. Some will have power restored on Tuesday, but
Ferrara said others will have to wait an "extended period" as repairs to burned
wires are made.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents without power were staying at a Red Cross shelter established at a
nearby elementary school.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we were all going to burn. But we got out OK," said employee
Maria Cuevas.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just went outside, and I heard two explosions," said Meg Batta, who was
working in a Pathmark supermarket a block and a half from the fire. "There's
heavy black smoke all over here. If the wind shifts, we might have to close."
</P>
<P>
	   Flames leapt from the building's roof, and heavy plumes of smoke obscured
motorists' vision on Route 78.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lord, it was so black you couldn't see a thing," said Myrtle Turner, who
lives two blocks from the fire on Fabyan Place. "There was fire all over. It was
terrible."
</P>
<P>
	   "We saw the flames, and heard sirens and ambulances," added Audrey Anderson,
an employee of The Rainbow Shop, a dress store on Lyons Avenue in Irvington,
also a block and a half from the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Langenbach refused to comment on a possible cause for the blaze, but said it
was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The building also contained a business that made kitchen equipment, said an
employee who declined to identify himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Langenbach said cold air had not frozen firefighters' hoses, but water was
freezing upon contact with the ground.

<HEADLINE> Haitian Kids To Be Reunited With Mom  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL NORTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- The two Haitian children still lack passports,
but they have a more valuable treasure: permission to join their mother in
Florida and, possibly, begin a new life far from the privations of their native
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
	   Marc Yvens Dieubon, 9, and Germanie, 8, were typically polite and reserved
as they waited Monday for exit papers from the Haitian government. But they
turned giddy when they thought about their reunion with their mother, who is in
a Florida hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You are always on my mind,'' was the message Germanie asked to send to her
mother. ``I am longing to see you again.''
</P>
<P>
	   The siblings were separated from their mother, Yvena Rhinvil, after a
smuggling boat packed with 411 would-be migrants ran aground off the Florida
coast on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Rhinvil, 33, who is pregnant, was one of four people brought ashore for
medical treatment. Her children were left on the boat and were among the 407
people returned to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They took our mother away. We cried, but nobody asked us why,'' said Marc,
who along with his sister rode in different section of the rickety vessel,
squeezed together so tightly that they had to sleep hunched over on a bench.
They hardly moved during the several days they spent at sea.
</P>
<P>
	   The siblings became the focus of an intense lobby by Haitian-Americans who
contrasted their plight with the immense attention given Elian Gonzalez, the
6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba's government is demanding that Gonzalez, rescued after a smuggling
accident off Florida, be returned to his father in Cuba. Gonzalez's relatives in
Miami, backed by Cuban-American exile leaders, are demanding he be allowed to
remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The two cases underscored what critics say is a double standard between
Cubans and others who seek refuge in the United States. Thanks to a 1966 law,
Cubans who reach shore usually are allowed to stay. Haitians and others are
usually repatriated unless they successfully navigate the complex and difficult
political asylum process.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service granted the children
humanitarian parole on Thursday. INS officials say U.S. Coast Guard officers
didn't know Rhinvil had children on board before they took her from the boat.
</P>
<P>
	   Enthusiastically, Marc and Germanie showed off the English they'd learned
from Coast Guard officers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One, two, three, four,'' they counted in proud and happy unison. Dark eyes
gleaming, they rattled off the numbers all the way to 10 in the offices of the
National Coalition for Haitian Rights, which has given them haven in an
undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
	   The identity and location of their father isn't known.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvena Rhinvil has applied for political asylum, said Pierre Esperance,
director of the Haitian rights group. He said he was optimistic that she will
succeed.

<HEADLINE> No. 7 Kansas 78, Texas A&AMP;M 57  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL A. LUTZ AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Kenny Gregory scored 15 points and led a
second half run as No. 7 Kansas used its superior height to beat Texas A&AMP;M 78-57
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas (15-2, 4-0 in Big 12) led 45-39 with 16:51 before breaking away with
a 27-9 run. Texas A&AMP;M (5-10, 1-3) was coming off a controversial 88-86 victory
over Texas Tech on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jayhawks outrebounded the Aggies 55-32, led by Drew Gooden, who had 10
points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas has won seven games in a row since losing to Illinois 84-70 on Dec.
18. The Jayhawks' 15-2 start is their best start since they were 16-1 to start
the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
	   The balanced Kansas offense didn't score at its usual 86-point per game
pace, but the defense shut down the Aggies. Tomas Ress hit a basket in the
closing seconds for 10 points, Texas A&AMP;M's only scorer in double figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas guard Jeff Boschee went 0-for-5 from 3-point range, ending a string
of 38 consecutive games with at least one 3-pointer. Kansas was 2-for-11 on
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Aggies tried to jump on the Jayhawks from the start and their
aggressiveness netted them four steals in the first 8:28. They even managed an
early 14-10 lead before an excited Reed Arena crowd of 12,175, a record for the
two-year old arena.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kansas' 11-man rotation paid off and the Jayhawks took the lead for good
on a basket by Gooden with 7:56 to go in the half. Kansas built a 36-26 edge
late in the first half as the Aggies had only three points over the final 4:12.

<HEADLINE> 4-alarm candle factory fire brought under control  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A raging, four-alarm fire visible for miles tore
through a candle factory Monday evening, threatening nearby homes, sending
plumes of choking smoke for miles and forcing the evacuation of about 10
families.
<P>
	   No injuries were reported, said Fire Chief James Langenbach.

<HEADLINE> Santana Wins Best-Album Award  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana's band won best-album honors at Monday's
American Music Awards for "Supernatural," a commercial comeback that put the
rock guitar maestro on top of the charts for the first time in his 30-year
career.
</P>
<P>
	   Shania Twain won two awards, for favorite pop-rock female artist and country
female artist. Garth Brooks also won two awards, for favorite country male
artist and country album for "Double Live."
</P>
<P>
	   "They say live albums never do anything. Thank you once again for not
listening to the rules," said Brooks, who also received a special honor as
artist of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The other double winner was Lauryn Hill for favorite soul-rhythm and blues
female artist and top soul-R&AMP;B album for "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill."
</P>
<P>
	   Will Smith won for pop-rock male artist.
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernatural," mixing the veteran Santana's searing instrumentals with
vocals by such collaborators as Hill and Dave Matthews, beat out two teen
sensations, the Backstreet Boys' "Millennium" and Britney Spears' "...Baby One
More Time."
</P>
<P>
	   Later in the evening, the Backstreet Boys topped Santana and 'N Sync for
favorite pop-rock band, duo or group.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana took the stage to a standing ovation after winning the album honor,
the evening's first award. After thanking his parents, siblings and wife, he
invited his co-producer, Clive Davis, to join him. "Your music has soared,"
Davis told Santana. "To musicians everywhere, this is a special moment, because
it's this man."
</P>
<P>
	   "'Supernatural' would never have been manifested without the heart and soul
of this gentleman," said Santana, who leads contenders for next month's Grammys
with 10 nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   Backstage, the 52-year-old Santana said "a lot of people told me they didn't
want to work with me because I'm old. Mr. Davis believed in me. We both believed
we had a masterpiece in our belly."
</P>
<P>
	   Spears won for favorite new pop-rock artist.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has been such an amazing adventure for me, this whole year," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   TLC were chosen as favorite soul-rhythm and blues artist on the strength of
their album "FanMail." Tyrese took the honors for new soul-rhythm and blues
artist.
</P>
<P>
	   "No way!" Tyrese bellowed when he came on stage.
</P>
<P>
	   R. Kelly, who won for favorite male soul-rhythm and blues artist, sang a
ribald ditty in his acceptance speech. One of the milder lines was, "Betcha I
can make your body talk to me."
</P>
<P>
	   DMX won for favorite rap-hip hop artist. On stage he thanked Jesus, but
backstage, he grumbled that with two hit albums out previously, he should have
won an award before this. "I feel I should have won a few awards," DMX said.
"Give it all to me."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitney Houston, who tied with Twain and Spears for most nominations with
three, was departing for Europe on Monday night or Tuesday and had not planned
on attending the show, awards spokesman Paul Shefrin said. He said her absence
was unrelated to an incident in Hawaii last week, when airport security guards
said they found about half an ounce of marijuana in her bag but she boarded her
flight before police arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   Nominees for the 27th annual awards were chosen by music industry
representatives. The winners were decided by about 20,000 music fans nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The show also featured results of an Internet poll that named Elvis Presley
favorite artist of the 1950s, the Beatles of the 1960s, Stevie Wonder of the
1970s and Michael Jackson of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   An Award of Merit went to Gloria Estefan, who was honored with a musical
tribute featuring 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariah Carey received an Award of Achievement for her "rare and
distinguished accomplishments." Michael Jackson and Prince are the only previous
winners of that honor.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announcing New Gun Program  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is taking a new tack in the fight
against gun violence by asking Congress for $280 million to hire 500 more ATF
agents and expand a system to track firearms through ballistics tests, officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The president was to announce the program Tuesday in Boston. The appearance
at the Orchard Gardens Community Center in Boston's Roxbury section also was
expected to highlight Clinton's community policing initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   After a spate of high-profile shooting attacks by troubled killers at high
schools and other places, Clinton pushed for tougher gun-control measures in
Congress. Lawmakers refused to close the gun show loophole in the Brady law or
require safety locks on handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   Outlining plans for his final year in office, Clinton last week alluded to
new projects aimed at curbing gun violence. The administration already announced
a request for $10 million to develop ``smart guns'' that fire only when held by
their owners.
</P>
<P>
	   The new plans for the budget for fiscal year 2001, which begins Oct. 1,
represent an effort to invest more in enforcement of laws aimed at combating the
illegal use and possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
	   People familiar with Clinton's plan, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he would ask Congress to hire more Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
agents and inspectors and for money to improve federal investigators' ability to
track crimes through improved ballistics testing.
</P>
<P>
	   By maintaining records of unique markings each gun barrel leaves on bullets,
investigators could track firearms used in crimes to their purchasers, even if
that person had passed the weapon to another individual.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I want us to do is to put our partisan divisions aside to complete
the unfinished business of the last century,'' Clinton said, ``including things
like ... sensible legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and
children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Boston's homicide rate dropped to a 38-year low in 1999, thanks in part to a
program that allied law enforcement, the clergy, community leaders and gang
members against crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort, called the Boston Pilot Project, is credited with forcing the
homicide toll down from 132 slayings in 1990 to 31 in 1999. A strong economy and
declining use of crack cocaine also contributed to improved neighborhood
security.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Thomas Menino and Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, both
Democrats, and several religious and community leaders were expected to attend
the address at the Orchard Gardens, in an area where crime was down more than 65
percent last year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In his Roxbury appearance, Clinton also was expected to stress the success
of his 1994 crime-fighting package, which provided money for 100,000 community
police officers. The fiscal 2000 budget includes funds for 50,000 more.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Tuesday, Clinton was addressing a Democratic National Committee
fund-raising reception at a private residence in a Boston suburb.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic is Horse of the Year  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.-
AP Racing Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	Charismatic, who broke a leg while straining for a victory in the Belmont
Stakes and the Triple Crown champion, was honored as the Horse of the Year for
1999 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	The strapping chestnut colt, a claiming horse in February and a Kentucky Derby
and Preakness winner in the spring, won the Eclipse Award as racing's top
performer in a split vote with Europe-based Daylami, winner of the Breeders' Cup
Turf on Nov. 6 in his only U.S. start.
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic finished third in the Belmont Stakes, 1 1/2 lengths behind winner
Lemon Drop Kid, while sustaining two fractures of his left front leg. The
breakdown apparently happened with about an eighth-mile remaining. His record
for the year was four wins, two seconds and a third, with earnings of
$2,007,404.
</P>
<P>
	Eclipse Award winners were honored Monday night at the Beverly Hills Hilton in
Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic registered 21 points to 16 for Daylami, who won the King George II
and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in England and the Irish Champion Stakes. Overall,
Daylami had four wins in seven starts.
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic received 10-point first-place votes from the Daily Racing Form and
the National Thoroughbred Writers Association, and one point for a third-place
vote from the National Thoroughbred Racing Association. Daylami got 10 points
from the NTRA, five from the DRF and one from the NTWA.
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis and trained by D. Wayne Lukas, was
the unanimous choice as 3-year-old champion, while Daylami was unanimous pick as
male turf champion.
</P>
<P>
	Daylami is owned by the Godolphin Racing operation of brothers Mohammed,
Maktoum and Hamdan al Maktoum of Dubai of the United Arab Emirates, and trained
by Saeed bin Suroor.
</P>
<P>
	Bob Baffert beat Lukas for Trainer of the Year. Baffert got the votes of the
DRF and NTRA while the NTWA voted for Lukas. Each vote in the human Eclipse
categories was worth one point.
</P>
<P>
	Baffert trains two Eclipse champions -- Chilukki, 2-year-old filly, and
Silverbulletday, 3-year-old filly.
</P>
<P>
	Other equine winners were Anees, 2-year-old colt or gelding; Victory Gallop,
older colt, horse or gelding; Beautiful Pleasure, older filly or mare; Artax,
sprinter; Soaring Softly, female turf horse; and Lonesome Glory, steeplechase
horse.
</P>
<P>
	All of them were unanimous selections except Victory Gallop, who got 25 points
on first-place votes by the DRF and NTRA. Behrens got the NTWA's first-place
ballot and totaled 20 points.
</P>
<P>
	Other human award winners were Jorge Chavez, jockey; Ariel Smith, apprentice
jockey; Frank Stronich, owner; and William S. Farish and partners, breeder.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Seek AIDS Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for $175 million in
additional funding for AIDS treatment and prevention programs in his 2001 budget
proposal, administration officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton wants an increase of $125 million in spending on grants ubder the
Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Act. The 10-year-old program, named for
the Indiana boy whose battle with AIDS attracted national attention, provides
money for health clinics treating low-income AIDS patients and for training for
those caring for HIV-infected individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will ask Congress to approve $50 million more to fund
state and local AIDS prevention programs administered by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. It's the most the administration has ever asked for
prevention, which AIDS groups say is woefully underfunded by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, CDC prevention programs are receiving $695 million and the Ryan
White grant program $1.6 billion, although budget cuts Clinton agreed to with
Congress last year could reduce those amounts.
</P>
<P>
	   While the number of AIDS deaths has dropped dramatically in recent years
thanks to new treatments, the decline in deaths slowed last year and the disease
is hitting minority groups and women hard.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacks, who make up about 13 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for
49 percent of AIDS deaths in 1998, according to the CDC. Thirty-two percent of
deaths were among whites and 18 percent were among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 23 percent of AIDS diagnoses reported in 1998 were among women.
</P>
<P>
	   Activists who have been calling on the government to put more money into
prevention said Clinton's 2001 budget proposal falls short.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have gone from closing their eyes to giving prevention a passing
glance,'' said Steven Fisher, spokesman of the advocacy group AIDS Action.
``It's not enough to make a dent in the 40,000 new infections every year, half
of which are among young people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal comes as the Ryan White program celebrates its 10th anniversary
this week. Since it started in 1990, the program has received $6.4 billion in
federal funding. More than 500,000 people -- many of whom have no insurance --
have received care each year through the program.

Gore, Bradley Clash in 6th Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley challenged Vice President Al Gore
Monday night to demand the administration issue an immediate order banning
racial profiling, but Gore shot back in campaign debate, "I don't think
President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley" on standing up for
blacks and Hispanics. Perched on stools on a debate stage in Iowa's capital
city, both men said firmly they oppose racial profiling, the practice by which
some police offers target racial minorities for traffic stops. A number of
racially sensitive issues came up in the hour-long televised debate on the
federal holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King, Jr.

Poll: Democrats Hold Edge Over GOP
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Private Republican polling shows Democrats hold an edge
on top election-year concerns, and 25 percent of George W. Bush's support
"prefers Democrats on the issues by a significant margin." Democrats were
favored, 44 percent to 31 percent, when the survey asked potential voters which
party cares more about them, according to the poll shown recently to about 50
GOP members of the House. At the same time, the findings suggested several ways
for House Republicans to gain an advantage, including opening a "new issue
front" on such subjects as government waste or retiring the national debt. The
GOP is trying to retain its narrow majority in the House.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Groups of Indians blocked highways in several
Ecuadorean provinces Monday, the latest in a series of protests aimed at forcing
the resignation of President Jamil Mahuad. Mahuad has been the target of
increasing calls from across the political spectrum to resign because of his
failure to stop Ecuador's economic decline. Ecuador's economic woes have
prompted several recent demonstrations, and the government declared a state of
emergency, allowing it to deploy troops to keep order.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Malik Sealy banked in a 3-pointer as time expired to
give the Minnesota Timberwolves a 101-100 victory over the Indiana Pacers on
Monday night. Mark Jackson had put Indiana ahead with a short jump shot with 1.7
seconds to play, but Sealy took an inbounds pass from Sam Mitchell and released
the winning shot with Jalen Rose running at him. It banked off the glass and
through the net as the buzzer sounded. The Wolves played without starting point
guard Terrell Brandon, who suffered a right calf strain in a loss Saturday to
the Los Angeles Lakers. Rookie William Avery started in his place.

Charismatic is Horse of the Year
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   Charismatic, who broke a leg while straining for a victory in the Belmont
Stakes and the Triple Crown champion, was honored as the Horse of the Year for
1999 on Monday night. The strapping chestnut colt, a claiming horse in February
and a Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner in the spring, won the Eclipse Award
as racing's top performer in a split vote with Europe-based Daylami, winner of
the Breeders' Cup Turf on Nov. 6 in his only U.S. start. Charismatic finished
third in the Belmont Stakes, 1 1/2 lengths behind winner Lemon Drop Kid, while
sustaining two fractures of his left front leg. The breakdown apparently
happened with about an eighth-mile remaining. His record for the year was four
wins, two seconds and a third, with earnings of $2,007,404.
