Stars' playerZubov arrested, accused of assaulting wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPPELL, Texas (AP) _ Dallas Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov was
arrestd early Sunday on charges of assaulting his wife.
	   Zubov, 27, was charged with aggravated assault and family
violence, a second-degree felony.
	   It was not known if Zubov's wife, Irina, was injured.
	   Coppell police said they went to Zubov's house in the middle of
the night after someone at the home dialed 911 and hung up.
	   Police said officers determined that Zubov had exhibited a
deadly weapon _ which police refused to identify _ and they took
him into custody. The Russian player was released sometime Sunday,
a department dispatcher said.
	   The hockey team issued a three-sentence statement from general
manager Bob Gainey.
	   ``The Dallas Stars and the National Hockey League are
cooperating fully with the authorities and are offering our
assistance and support to both Sergei and Irina,'' Gainey's
statement read.
	   The club said it would have no further comment.

Jazz will remember Bulls finish
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ It wasn't just the score that bothered Utah coach
Jerry Sloan, it was how the game ended.
	   ``They were shooting 3-pointers there at the end to see if they
could bury you,'' Sloan said. ``That should make it easy to play
the next game.''
	   The Chicago Bulls humiliated the Utah Jazz 96-54 Sunday. It was
the fewest points ever scored in an NBA game, playoff or regular
season, since the inception of the shot clock.
	   The Bulls made four 3-pointers over the final 7:47 of the game,
and Jud Buechler missed another attempt from long range. Chicago's
bench also was rooting for Bill Wennington to make a basket in the
closing seconds so every Bull on the roster would score. Wennington
hit a jumper with five seconds left for the final margin.
	   Chicago wasn't trying to run up the score, coach Phil Jackson
insisted.
	   ``Michael didn't play the fourth quarter, Scottie kind of guided
that crew, we had four guys off the bench playing,'' Jackson said.
``That wasn't the case and I'm sure Jerry didn't mention that.''
	   As if the high score wasn't bad enough, the Bulls also were
goofing off on the bench for everyone to see. Michael Jordan and
Ron Harper were giggling at the fan limbo contest on the giant
scoreboard screen, with Jordan even joining in at one point.
	   Jordan also threw a towel in NBC commentator Ahmad Rashad's
face.
	   ``No one in this business feels sorry for you, but you watch a
game and endings of games like this, and you should be ready to
play the next game,'' Utah forward Karl Malone said. ``We're not
going to be talking about running the scores up and all that, but
like I said, it's just one of those things.
	   ``If you're not ready to play after the things that went on out
there, you shouldn't be in this profession.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; AIR BALLS: Utah's 26 turnovers matched the NBA's all-time
playoff high. ... Only five players scored in double figures in
Game 3, tying the NBA Finals record for fewest players over 10
points. ... Scottie Pippen moved into third place on the NBA
Final's career steals list. Pippen had two Sunday, giving him a
total of 61.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WORM WATCH: The Chicago Bulls are back home for the playoffs,
and that can only mean one thing: Dennis Rodman is going to be
late.
	   Rodman continued his own little playoff ritual, strolling into
the United Center about an hour before the tipoff for Game 3.
Players are supposed to be in the locker room 90 minutes before the
game, but Rodman has been showing up late since the Eastern
Conference finals began.
	   He's also been ducking back into the locker room when the game
starts, a move that's been criticized as disruptive to the team.
Rodman goes back to ride a bicycle to keep his muscles loose, but
he's never on the bench when Phil Jackson wants him, forcing the
coach to send a trainer to fetch him.
	   Jackson said before the game that he and Rodman have discussed
the Worm's antics, and everything is fine. Rodman went back to the
locker room Sunday, but he was on the bench when Jackson looked for
him.
	   ``He's 37, playing in a career which he's played a lot of
minutes and to get stiff, sometimes you don't loosen up for a
couple of minutes and that can be a critical couple of minutes. So,
I can understand that,'' Jackson said of Rodman's warmup habits.
	   Besides, it's not like Rodman is the only player who does this.
When Luc Longley picked up his fifth foul in Game 2, Jackson sent
him back to the locker room to stay loose.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HABLA ESPANOL? The NBA is going south of the U.S. border.
	   The Los Angeles Clippers and San Antonio Spurs will play Dec. 12
in Mexico City as part of the NBA's effort to expand its
international market. The Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks
played at Mexico City's Palacio de los Deportes last year before a
crowd of 20,635 _ the largest crowd to ever see a basketball game
in that country.
	   The NBA has also played regular season games in Japan, and has
had exhibition games in Mexico, Italy, France, Germany, Spain and
the United Kingdom. The Miami Heat will play an exhibition game on
Oct. 12 in Israel.

Mahathir's party backs his critique of money policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ New voices within Malaysia's
ruling party appear to be joining the prime minister's attack on
high interest rates, which his deputy argues are needed to
stabilize the economy.
	   ``We urge the government to take quick measures to reduce the
current high interest rate,'' a leader of the youth wing of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's United Malays National Organization was
quoted as saying by New Straits Times Monday.
	   The tight monetary policy was ``leaving behind an array of
problems,'' Abdul Rahim Mohamed Ghouse said.
	   More than 25,000 small industries were in dire straits because
high rates were choking cash flows and preventing them from running
businesses profitably, he said at a party meeting.
	   While Mahathir's deputy and finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim has
backed the central bank-prescribed rates, saying these were needed
to prevent a run on reserves and spiraling inflation, Mahathir has
repeatedly differed.
	   The issue reportedly divided officials at a recent Cabinet
meeting, with some people criticizing Anwar's solutions.
	   On Friday, Mahathir, who returned from Tokyo after a series of
speeches criticizing high interest rates, denied there was a rift
between him and Anwar on economic policy.
	   But he also refused to budge from his position.
	   ``I do not necessarily endorse Bank Negara's tight monetary
policy,'' he said. Bank Negara is the central bank.
	   Mahathir has routinely chided the International Monetary Fund
for recommending high interest rates as a panacea for economic
ills. IMF prescriptions often bring more pain to struggling
economies, he has said, citing Indonesia.
	   Malaysia should not follow IMF policies too closely, Mahathir
said in an interview in the June 8 issue of Time magazine.
	   ``Someone accused us of following the IMF prescription too
closely. Why do we raise interest rates? Why do we squeeze credit?
I replied: because we are frightened,'' he told Time.
	   ``If we were to follow the IMF any closer, we would bankrupt all
our companies.''
	   Malaysia's economy is battered by the same crisis that sent
Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia into recession and is now
threatening Hong Kong.
	   The government this month announced that gross domestic product
in the first quarter of 1998 had shrunk by 1.8 percent. Two
subsequent quarters of contraction usually mean recession.

China bracing for floods, other disasters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Alarmed by a series of floods, earthquakes and
other disasters that have killed hundreds of people this year, the
government has stepped up preparations for relief work, the
state-run newspaper China Daily said Monday.
	   More than 300 people were killed in floods that have struck 10
provinces, including usually arid Ningxia in the northwest and
Hunan, the worst-hit region, where some 648,000 homes have been
destroyed, the report said.
	   Floods triggered by torrential summer rains are an annual
scourge for much of southern China. But this year, unusually heavy
rainfall means that floods that usually peak in July and August are
expected to hit earlier and harder.
	   In eastern Jiangsu province, near Shanghai, the rainfall has
been 2.5 times heavier than normal, the report noted.
	   The Civil Affairs Ministry has allocated 850 million yuan (dlrs
102.9 million) to disaster relief, but even more was needed, the
report cited ministry official Zhou Ming as saying.
	   ``We need to put in more effort considering the frequency of
natural disasters this year,'' Zhou said.
	   But Zhou also said that those affected by calamities so far had
been provided with sufficient food, clothing and shelter and that
no major epidemics had broken out in disaster stricken areas.

Report: Malaysia bans more foreign nurses in state hospitals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The government has banned
recruitment of nurses from overseas in state-run hospitals in an
attempt to halt the outflow of foreign exchange amid an economic
crisis, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The shortage of nursing staff in government-run hospitals would
be made good by increasing domestic recruitment, Star newspaper
reported, quoting Health Minister Chua Jui Meng.
	   More than 3,000 nurses being trained in Malaysia would be
recruited, he said.
	   Many foreign workers repatriate their savings to their home
countries after converting them into dollars, thus depleting the
nation's foreign exchange reserves.
	   About 300 nurses from India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Indonesia
who are currently working in government hospitals could be asked to
leave soon, the minister said on Sunday. An exception would be made
for highly specialized nurses.
	   Since Malaysia's economic crisis deepened this year, the country
has deported 30,000 Indonesians found working without valid papers,
the home ministry said. Most workers deported have been from the
construction industry.

Japan ready to provide dlrs 1 billion for North Korean energy
</HEADLINE>
project &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is ready to provide dlrs 1 billion, or nearly
one-fourth of the expected cost, for an international project to
construct nuclear reactors in North Korea, Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi said Monday.
	   Speaking in Parliament, Obuchi thus became the first official to
express Japan's intention to extend the funds for the project, a
Foreign Ministry official said.
	   In 1994, North Korea agreed to freeze and eventually dismantle
its nuclear weapons program in exchange for two light-water nuclear
power plants and 500,000-ton annual fuel shipments until the
facilities are completed.
	   That agreement, reached after intensive negotiations between the
United States and North Korea, was aimed at controlling nuclear
proliferation and preventing the reclusive state's ability to
produce nuclear weapons-grade material.
	   ``Efforts are under way in Japan to cooperate with dlrs 1
billion, although the nation's fiscal situation remains severe,''
Kyodo News quoted Obuchi as telling a parliamentary committee.
	   Officials from the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization, or KEDO, held talks in New York earlier this month.
They agreed to meet again in Brussels on June 29-30 to try to
resolve differences over sharing the cost of supplying the two
reactors.
	   South Korea wants to reduce its share of the construction costs,
much of which has been calculated in the South Korean currency,
because of a sharp devaluation in the won due to the Asian
financial crisis.
	   The project is eventually expected to total somewhere between
dlrs 4 billion and dlrs 5 billion, down slightly from an original
forecast of dlrs 5.2 billion, said the ministry official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The project has taken on new urgency since India and Pakistan
conducted nuclear test explosions last month, raising international
worries that the international non-nuclear proliferation system
might be jeopardized.
	   But Obuchi said there has been ``no clear sign'' at present of
North Korea's nuclear development progressing with alleged
technology cooperation from Pakistan, Kyodo reported.
	   KEDO comprises the United States, Japan, South Korea and the
European Union.

Bishop who played central role retires from Chiapas peace efforts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ GUZMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Blaming the government
for stalled peace talks with armed rebels, Bishop Samuel Ruiz
stepped down as the central figure in efforts to resolve the
conflict in southern Mexico.
	   ``It is clear to me that a chapter in the peace process has
ended,'' the Roman Catholic bishop said in his Sunday homily. ``I
am grateful to all who have accompanied me in my mediation tasks.''
	   Ruiz's resignation as president of the church mediation team
formed after the Zapatista rebel uprising 4 1/2 years ago
underscores growing pessimism about peace efforts in the southern
state of Chiapas.
	   Several hours later, the church mediation commission announced
its dissolution, also blaming the government for ``dismantling the
necessary conditions for dialogue and negotiation.''
	   It cited growing militarization and violence by the government
and its agents in the region. Forty-five unarmed residents of a
pro-rebel village, many of them children, were killed in December
by gunmen linked to Mexico's governing party.
	   Mediation commission members also cited recent criticism of
their group by government leaders, including President Ernesto
Zedillo.
	   The bishop has been the central figure in peace efforts since
the Zapatista National Liberation Army staged a brief uprising in
January 1994, demanding greater rights for the region's
impoverished Indian farmers.
	   In March of that year, Ruiz invited the rebel's top military
leader Subcomandante Marcos and government peace envoy Manuel
Camacho Solis to the first series of talks, televised nationally
from this mountain community's centuries-old cathdral.
	   After talks broke down, Ruiz continued to urge both sides back
to negotiations. But the bishop said that unless the government
changes, more talks are impossible.
	   ``There will have to be constructed another chapter in which the
conditions for peace can be created,'' Ruiz said.
	   The government's backing off on a signed treaty to grant Indian
autonomy has resulted in ``a heavy, final silence'' from the
Zapatistas, said the bishop. He said that the government, in turn,
has read the rebels' silence as a rejection of dialogue.
	   Chiapas state and Mexico's federal governments have become
increasingly frustrated with the stalemate. For several years,
their primary strategy has been to surround them in one region with
thousands of troops.
	   Recent attempts to further marginalize the Zapatistas have
included expelling foreigners accused of rebel sympathies, and the
breaking up of pro-rebel parallel governments in Chiapas
municipalities.
	   Some 1,000 police officers and soldiers swarmed into a small
town early Wednesday, firing tear gas, breaking down doors and
arresting 167 rebel sympathizers.

Four-year-old girl buried alive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Police said Monday they had arrested a man
who buried alive his wife's four-year-old daughter, whom he
apparently hated because she had a different father.
	   The girl, Cao Thi Be, was found dead in a hole about 0.7 meters
(two feet) deep near her home last Tuesday in the central province
of Binh Thuan. An autopsy showed she died of suffocation.
	   Her parents, Pham Van Tho and Cao Thi Hiep were married seven
years ago, but the girl was fathered by another man when Tho was in
prison serving a five-year term for assault.
	   Tho, 33, hated and often beat Be, police said. On May 31, he
returned home drunk, beat his wife and took the child away. Police
believe he put her in the hole, dug by local people to catch
salamanders, and buried her.
	   Tho fled but was tracked down and arrested Sunday. Police said
that local people were outraged over the crime.

Singapore stock market and currency down on yen's fall, bad news
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's stocks and currency were both down
sharply Monday morning as regional and local developments depressed
the markets.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index was down 2.6
percent at noon (0400 GMT), about 30 points off its 1168.46
opening. It dropped to a low of 1127.33 in late morning trading
before recovering slightly.
	   The Singapore dollar was also sharply lower, breaking the
psychologically important 1.70 level against the U.S. currency. In
late morning trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 1.7125 against
the greenback, up from 1.6945 late Friday in Asia.
	   The markets were reacting to the continued weakness of the
Japanese yen and other regional currencies, along with news over
the weekend that a local property company defaulted on a payment
deadline for a development plot.
	   The U.S. dollar broke above the psychologically important 140
yen level as the market opened in Tokyo, and the Singapore dollar
slumped Monday morning in sympathy.
	   News that a Singapore-Hong Kong joint venture missed a deadline
for a 68.6 million Singapore dollar (dlrs 40 million) payment on a
plot of land to develop condominiums also dampened sentiment.
	   The company, a joint venture between Singapore's Eltech
Electronics and Hong Kong's Lai Sun Development, missed the last
deadline Friday to pay the remaining 75 percent of the bid it made
last July.
	   Mounting fears that Singapore could head into a recession this
year are also depressing the stock market, according to dealers.
	   The chairman of United Overseas Bank, Wee Cho Yaw, has warned
that the Singapore economy may slip into a recession next year if
the government does not take immediate steps.
	   Dealers said they were awaiting comments by Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is also the chairman of Singapore's
de facto central bank, on the banking sector at a speech expected
after the markets close.

Bank chairman warns of Singapore recession unless government acts

 &UR; Eds: INSERTS ``next year'' in lead to clarify chairman's prediction
is not for current year &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The chairman of one of Singapore's biggest
banks warned of a recession next year if the government does not
take action now to stimulate the economy, a newspaper reported
Monday.
	   Wee Cho Yaw, chairman of United Overseas Bank, told The Straits
Times that the current economic situation in the small island
republic was the worst he had seen in his 40-year banking career.
	   The Singapore government has stood staunchly by earlier
predictions that the economy would grow at least 2.5 percent this
year.
	   But the forecast was made before the economic turmoil in
neighboring Indonesia worsened and other regional economies began
to exhibit signs of a slowdown into zero growth or outright
recession.
	   At least two private investment houses have already predicted
that the Singapore economy will fall into recession this year,
though a recent newspaper survey of 15 analysts and economists
showed an average forecast of 1.5 percent growth.
	   Finance Minister Richard Hu defended the government forecasts in
Parliament last week, though he conceded that the authorities stood
ready to implement a stimulus package soon if new figures indicate
a likely recession.
	   In his interview with The Straits Times, bank chairman Wee said
Asia's financial crisis far exceeds the last major economic
challenge Singapore faced, a recession in 1985.
	   He said the government forecast was unlikely to be achieved and
urged immediate action.
	   ``If there is no growth, or a mere 1 percent growth, then the
government will have to inject more funds into the system,'' Wee
was quoted as saying.
	   These could include tax cuts and more spending on
infrastructure, he said.

Poll: Hanson's One Nation Party saps governing conservatives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Hanson

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ With Queensland's election looming
Saturday, Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party continues to drain
support from Australia's governing conservatives, lifting the
opposition Labor Party to victory, a new poll says.
	   The Bulletin-Morgan Poll released Monday is the third major
survey in a week to predict the split in conservative ranks will
turn the government over from Premier Rob Borbidge's conservative
coalition to the Labor Party.
	   If the conservatives lose Queensland, partly because Hanson's
ultra-rightist party has cut into their appeal, it is a bad omen
for Australian Prime Minister John Howard.
	   He has to call an election by March and faces the same problem
on a national scale.
	   The 89-seat Queensland Parliament is split 44-44 between
Borbidge's conservatives and the Labor Party; Borbidge has retained
government only with the support of one independent legislator.
	   But that looks set to end Saturday, with support for the
conservatives down 19 percent with its voters flocking to Hanson's
One Nation, according to the new Bulletin-Morgan Poll.
	   Labor is poised to win, the poll found, with 54 percent support,
up 7.3 percent since the 1995 election. The conservative coalition
vote was down 7.3 percent to 46 percent, the poll results said.
	   The poll, to be published in Wednesday's Bulletin magazine, has
the National/Liberal conservative coalition on 30 percent of the
primary vote, down from 49 percent since 1995.
	   One Nation is continuing to climb at 18.5 percent, the
Bulletin-Morgan Poll said.
	   When asked who they expected to win on Saturday, 52 percent of
those polled said Labor, 30 percent said the conservative coalition
and 18 percent were undecided.
	   Asked why One Nation supporters preferred Pauline Hanson to
Premier Rob Borbidge or Labor's Peter Beattie, nearly half said she
was ``better, more trustworthy, more honest than other politicians
and knows what Australians want.''
	   Fourteen percent chose One Nation because of their anti-Asian
immigration policies, 10 percent on Aboriginal issues and 5 percent
for gun control.
	   A significant 17 percent voted for One Nation on the basis of
other issues, like being against foreign aid and protecting
Australian jobs.
	   The Bulletin-Morgan Poll was conducted by telephone to 1,255
electors throughout the state on June 6 and 7, one week before the
state election. The margin of error was not provided.

WWF: Australia failing on marine protection rhetoric
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The World Wide Fund for Nature on
Monday called on Australian governments to translate their rhetoric
on the protection of marine environments into action following the
release of a major report slamming their performance.
	   WWF conservation director Ray Nias said the Marine Protected
Areas report graded the performance of each state and territory
government, as well as the nation's establishment and management of
marine protected areas during 1997.
	   Queensland was highest ranked, with a C, and Victoria the lowest
with a D, Nias said.
	   ``We've heard a lot of rhetoric from governments about the need
to improve protection of our marine environments.
	   ``This report, released on World Oceans Day, demonstrates the
need for commonwealth, state and territory governments to translate
that rhetoric into action.''
	   The WWF conceded there had been many positive developments
during 1998, the United Nation's International Year of the Ocean,
including the opening of the Great Australian Bight Marine Park as
the first in a series of planned commonwealth marine protected
areas.
	   ``However, it is clear that the national oceans policy will need
to be strengthened in a number of areas,'' Nias said.
	   ``For example, it currently fails to establish benchmarks for
sanctuary and `no-take' zones, where marine life is protected from
damaging practices such as fishing, mining and coastal
development,'' he said.
	   The policy would not offer adequate protection for marine
wildlife and habitats without these benchmarks, he added.

Newspaper editor loyal to Cambodian leader Hun Sen shot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of previous attack, wife fears plot to
assassinate husband, grafs 5-8

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The publisher-editor of the
country's most widely-read newspaper _ which supports Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen _ was shot by an unidentified gunman Monday.
	   At least two of six bullets fired struck Thong Uy Pang, 55, in
the shoulder while he was standing outside a pagoda, his wife and
police said. His bodyguards returned fire. One was hit and so was
the gunman, who still managed to flee, witnesses said.
	   Thong Uy Phang was undergoing surgery at the capital's Calmette
Hospital. Yet Razaque, a deputy municipal police commissioner, said
the shooting was being investigated. There was no immediate known
motive.
	   Thong Uy Phang's hard-hitting Koh Santepheap (Island of Peace)
backs Hun Sen, who has often been accused of orchestrating attacks
on journalists supporting his opponents.
	   Last October, two men on a motorcycle hurled grenades inside
Thong Uy Phang's residential compound. No one was hurt, but damage
was extensive. That attack was apparently prompted by articles
about internal problems within Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party.
	   The journalist's wife, Yim Phanny, said she was standing next to
him Monday before the shooting. He was talking on a mobile phone to
an angry reader about an article criticizing the electricity
company for allegedly inflating prices.
	   Thong Uy Phang shouted, ``I'm hit!'' when the first bullet
struck him and tried to pull his own gun, but was unable to return
fire, his wife said.
	   Yim Phanny said that she thought there was a plot to assassinate
her husband but had no idea who was behind it.
	   Hun Sen is engaged in an election campaign seeking to restore
international legitimacy and aid lost since his bloody coup last
year against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   The opposition has complained of being denied access to the
broadcast media, controlled entirely by Hun Sen, and of violence
and intimidation of opposition supporters.

Clinton heads to U.N. to discuss war on drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SONYA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Armed with suggestions for halting the flow of
drugs across international borders, President Bill Clinton is
huddling with other world leaders about the problem in a special
session Monday at the United Nations.
	   Clinton was to deliver the opening address at the U.N. General
Assembly special session on drugs before representatives of about
150 countries, including 35 heads of state and government. Before
that, he was meeting privately with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
	   Among those expected to attend Monday were Presidents Jacques
Chirac of France, Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Rafael Caldera of
Venezuela, Alberto Fujimori of Peru, Hugo Banzer of Bolivia and
Ernesto Samper of Colombia.
	   The focus of the U.N. session is on curbing the laundering of
drug proceeds and reducing demand among drug users. In his address,
Clinton was to again appeal to the world's nations to unite behind
a common strategy for fighting both, White House spokesman Josh
Silverman said Sunday.
	   That would give Clinton a chance to advance his own proposal for
containing other international threats, such as terrorism, illegal
immigration, trafficking in people and global crime rings that are
a threat to newer, weaker democracies. He made the proposal last
month before the annual summit of the world's eight largest
industrialized nations in Birmingham, England.
	   The United Nations has estimated that, even with aggressive
interdiction, law enforcement agencies would be able to seize only
about 10 percent of heroin shipments and 30 percent of cocaine
shipments worldwide.
	   Worried that the fight against drugs would be too
punishment-oriented, several world figures have appealed to Annan
for discussions on shifting drug control policies more toward
public health concerns.
	   In a letter from the private Lindesmith Center, about 500
prominent people decried the routing of resources to ``ever more
expensive interdiction efforts'' without adequate attention to
``realistic proposals to reduce drug-related crime, disease and
death.''
	   Those who signed it included former Secretary of State George
Shultz, former U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
former Greek President George Papandreou, former President Oscar
Arias of Costa Rica and former German Justice Minister Sabine
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger.

Report: Suharto turns 77, lonely and upset over allegations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS possible news conference, graf 7; Suharto happy to be a
private citizen, graf 15

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's former president had his
77th birthday Monday, reportedly lonely and upset over allegations
that he and his family amassed billions of dollars illegally.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted a Suharto aide as saying few of his old
friends and associates have visited him at his home in central
Jakarta since he quit office last month.
	   Military personnel guard the house but no longer salute him,
said the aide who has worked for Suharto since the 1970s.
	   Only a pet parrot, long ago trained to say ``Good Morning Bapak
(Mister) President,'' still calls him by his former title, the Post
said.
	   On the rare occasions that he leaves his house, his car must
stop at red lights, whereas before his presidential limousine sped
through the streets of Jakarta under police escort.
	   The Post said he planned to hold a news conference Tuesday to
counter growing allegations against him. However, officials later
said nothing had been scheduled.
	   Forced to quit after mobs went on a rampage and angry protesters
demanded he be tried for corruption, Suharto has said nothing
publicly since his May 21 resignation.
	   Critics say he and his family amassed between dlrs 20 to 40
billion in assets during his 32 years in power.
	   Many want the state to seize the money and use it to help
Indonesia overcome its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Inflation and unemployment have soared, making life miserable
for many of the nation's 202 million people.
	   New President B.J. Habibie has said that an inquiry will be held
into corruption under Suharto's rule. However, he has called on
Indonesians not to seek unlawful retribution.
	   Habibie, a longtime friend and formerly the loyal deputy of
Suharto, has rolled back many of his old boss's draconian ways. He
has released some political prisoners, promised elections in 1999,
ended a ban on free labor unions and dropped restrictions on media
freedom.
	   He has also said that he hasn't talked to the aging former
autocrat since he was sworn in as the new head of state.
	   The Post said Suharto spends most of his time at home reading
newspapers, which daily run accusations of corruption and nepotism
during his time in office. He also watches television and spends
time with his grandchildren.
	   The aide said Suharto was happy to be a private citizen again.
	   Presidential security guards still stand watch over his home.
But their numbers are gradually being reduced.
	   ``As he is no longer president, they do not give him a military
salute,'' the Post quoted an unidentified aide as saying.
	   Few people still come to see Suharto because ties to the former
president are now seen as a liability in post-Suharto Indonesia,
the aide was quoted as saying.

Cambodian leader visits king amid election dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen headed
Monday for the northwestern province of Siem Reap early Monday for
a surprise audience with King Norodom Sihanouk amid a dispute that
could hurt the credibility of upcoming elections.
	   A Hun Sen adviser, Prak Sokhon, said he didn't know the purpose
of the talks. However, the topic was expected to be the deadlock in
Cambodia's highest legal appeals body, the Constitutional Council,
charged with resolving election problems.
	   The inaugural meeting of the nine-member council was stalled for
the second time last week when the king's three appointees did not
show. They appear to be protesting that the other six members of
the supposedly neutral panel are strong Hun Sen supporters.
	   In a faxed weekend statement, the king strongly denied ``any
ill-intentioned allegations'' that he was behind their boycott.
	   Hun Sen ousted the king's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, as his
co-prime minister in a bloody coup 11 months ago. He has sought new
elections to win back aid and legitimacy lost after the takeover.
	   The council, charged with determining the constitutionality of
all laws, would be called on to resolve disputes arising from
controversial electoral and political party regulations.
	   The former chairman of the Supreme Court, Chan Sok, who also
sits on the body, has warned that further deadlock could call into
question the credibility of elections, scheduled July 26.
	   Sihanouk, the country's constitutional monarch, resides at a
palace in Siem Reap, near the ancient Angkor temple complex.

Aussie dollar slides toward record low
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Updates with Aussie dollar hitting 59.75 U.S. cents, New
Zealand dollar also slumping to six-year low.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian dollar continued its
plunge toward 12-year record lows Monday despite attempts by the
Reserve Bank of Australia to halt its slide.
	   ``The Australian dollar will remain under pressure until
something fundamental changes in Asia,'' Commonwealth Bank senior
manager foreign exchange Kurt Magnus said.
	   By Monday afternoon the local currency hit a low of 59.75 U.S.
cents, a level not seen since 1986.
	   New Zealand's dollar is also on its knees, down to 50.88 U.S.
cents.
	   Since ratings agency Moody's said Friday it was reviewing New
Zealand's AA1 sovereign credit rating for a possible downgrade, the
Kiwi dollar has fallen more than one U.S. cent to a six-year low.
	   The Australian dollar fell as low as 60 U.S. cents during
offshore trading on Friday night. It closed in Sydney at 60.51 U.S.
cents.
	   Dealers said the central bank intervened in the market as
recently as Monday morning to attempt to prop up the ailing
currency by buying Aussie dollars.
	   ``We've got it on good authority that the RBA's been in to
smooth and test the currency and take some heat out of the
market,'' Macquarie Bank foreign exchange associate director Brent
Aggar said.
	   The RBA has already spent about U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion (3 billion
Australian dollars) in a largely futile attempt to prop up the
currency.
	   The Australian dollar's record low of 57.10 U.S. cents was
struck in July 1986 after then-Treasurer Paul Keating's infamous
comments that the Australian economy was nearly that of a ``banana
republic.''

Thai currency plumbs new lows; stocks down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai currency hit a 13-week low
Monday as investors dumped regional currencies after the U.S.
dollar surged to a seven-year high against the Japanese yen.
	   Thai share prices were also down in line with other Asian
bourses. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index lost 1.33 points at
the open to 316.83.
	   At mid-morning, the dollar had strengthened to 43.80 baht, up
from 43.25 at the close of trading Friday. It was the baht's
weakest level since March 10.
	   Dealers blamed the stock market and baht decline to a regional
currency sell-off as the dollar rose above 140 Japanese yen for the
first time since June 1991.
	   The weakness of the Japanese currency, dealers said, spells
trouble for crisis-hit Southeast Asian economies that have been
increasingly dependent on Japan as an export market.
	   Fears are rising that the Asian economic crisis could enter a
new, more devastating phase.

Asian stock markets mostly lower as currencies plunge on weak yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets extended last week's losses
early Monday on fears that further depreciation in the yen, which
fell to a seven-year low, could spark another round of currency
devaluations in Asia.
	   Many regional currencies also plunged through important support
levels early Monday as investors shifted their money into more
robust markets in the United States and Europe.
	   Dealers in the region said institutional investors, spooked by
the weakening regional currencies and persistent pessimism over
Japan's economy, continued to dump shares.
	   Though regional bourses were mostly lower, there were no steep
falls. The largest was in Singapore, where the benchmark Straits
Times Industrial Index was down 33.47 points, or 2.9 percent, at
1,134.99 at midday.
	   The U.S. dollar broke through the 140-yen level for the first
time in seven years in New York on Sunday, and showed no signs of
slowing in morning trading Monday in Tokyo.
	   In Tokyo, the dollar bought 140.69 yen at midday, up 1.27 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and its highest point since June 20,
1991. In New York, the dollar settled at 139.75 yen on Friday.
	   ``Further depreciation of the yen is sparking another round of
currency devaluation in Asia,'' said Joseph Yam, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Monetary Association, Hong Kong's de facto central
bank, on the sidelines of a conference in Switzerland.
	   The weaker yen also raises ``concern in fixed exchange rates
like the Hong Kong dollar and the (Chinese) yuan ,'' he added.
``That actually isn't very helpful to everybody.''
	   Officials in China and Hong Kong have vowed repeatedly to defend
the fixed exchange rates. Devaluation of the two currencies would
likely reverberate through the region's troubled economies.
	   The dollar's strength against the yen sprang from fresh evidence
of a robust U.S. economy after the Labor Department reported on
Friday that the nation's unemployment rate held to a 28-year-low of
4.3 percent in May.
	   Also supporting the U.S. currency was the diminishing likelihood
the Group of Seven industrialized nations will make a strong
statement criticizing the current dollar level at their meeting
Tuesday, traders said.
	   Elsewhere, the yen's weakness drove the Singapore dollar past
the key support level of 1.7000 to the U.S. dollar, and the
Malaysian ringgit past 4.000 to the dollar.
	   The Thai baht was at a 13-week low at midday, and Indonesia's
thinly-traded rupiah lost 2 percent in value against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The Australian dollar dropped to its lowest level against the
dollar since July 1986, hitting a low of 59.75 U.S. cents by
afternoon.
	   New Zealand's dollar was also lower, down to 50.88 U.S. cents.
	   In Taipei, the dollar also opened at an 11-year-high against the
New Taiwan dollar, but fell later amid talk of intervention by
Taiwan's central bank.
	   On other stock markets, in Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average edged down 26.03 points, or 0.17 percent, to 15,297.40 at
midday. On Friday, it had lost 103.04 points.
	   Shares in Hong Kong closed mixed at midday, with the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index rising 11.84 points to 8,581.31.
	   Meanwhile, shares in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Manila were
moderately lower, but the key index in Jakarta rose slightly on
gains of telecommunications shares.
	   In Seoul, despite the weakening won, shares opened sharply
higher on optimism that President Kim Dae-jung, currently in the
U.S., will succeed in drawing more foreign investment, analysts
said.
	   The key Korea Composite Stock Price Index opened up 11.43
points, or 3.3 percent, to 352.96.

Philippine leftists to stage separate centennial celebration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Left-wing groups said Monday they
will hold a protest parade in Manila to celebrate their version of
the 100th anniversary of the Philippines' declaration of
independence from 333 years of Spanish colonial rule.
	   The protest coincides with, and could disrupt, a
government-organized centennial parade also scheduled on Friday in
Manila.
	   Leaders of the New Nationalist Alliance said they will celebrate
the demise of Spain's colonial reign in 1898 but also highlight the
United States' subsequent takeover of the Philippines.
	   ``We would like to stress that there is an unfinished
revolution,'' said Lutgardo Jurcales of the alliance. ``This is the
fight against the vestiges of U.S. colonialism.''
	   The Philippines was a Spanish possession from 1565 to 1898.
	   Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, a former mayor who became the republic's
first president, declared independence from Spain on June 12, 1898,
at a house in Kawit in Cavite province, south of Manila.
	   Before the Philippines could gain its independence, however, the
United States acquired it after defeating Spain in the 1898
Spanish-American War.
	   The country gained its formal independence from the United
States on July 4, 1946, but American influence remained strong
thereafter.
	   Jurcales said students, activists and workers will join a march
from a statue of Philippine revolutionary hero Andres Bonifacio in
downtown Manila to the U.S. Embassy along Roxas Boulevard, where
the main government parade also will pass.
	   Police have said they plan to tightly guard the government
parade and other centennial activities, which are expected to draw
large crowds of people.
	   Jurcales said they have no plans of disrupting the main
centennial parade, which left-wing groups describe as ``elitist and
highly commercialized.''
	   The Philippine government, helped by private companies, is
spending at least 3.5 billion pesos (dlrs 92 million) on the
centennial celebrations, which are to be highlighted by a trade and
historical exposition at the Clark Special Economic Zone, a former
U.S. air base in northern Pampanga province.
	   A third of the money is going to the renovation of 16 historic
shrines and the construction of historical markers and monuments
along the ``freedom trail,'' areas where Filipinos put up
resistance against Spain.

New Zealand major staging post for smugglers of wildlife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ The world's most endangered birds
and animals are stopping over in New Zealand before being sold to
rich Americans as part of a large wildlife smuggling trade,
officials said Monday.
	   New Zealand Wildlife Enforcement Group investigator Peter
Younger said the international trade in endangered species ranked
behind drugs and guns as the highest illegal money earner.
	   Interpol has valued the illegal wildlife trade internationally
at U.S. dlrs 3 billion and identified New Zealand as a major
staging post for smuggled wildlife from Australia and other Pacific
countries to other parts of the world.
	   Following a request from American authorities, the enforcement
group _ made up of representatives from the Department of
Conservation, Customs Service and the Ministry of Agriculture _
helped to uncover a gecko-smuggling ring estimated to be worth
around U.S. dlrs 270,000.
	   The lizards _ which fetch up to U.S. dlrs 4,750 on the U.S.
market _ were being smuggled from New Caledonia in baggage that was
left in transit in New Zealand before carrying on to America,
Younger said.
	   The native tree geckos were placed in cloth bags inside
cardboard boxes.
	   An American who had regularly stopped over in New Zealand during
trips to New Caledonia was arrested in Los Angeles after he was
found with 57 of the lizards in his baggage.
	   ``We assisted the U.S. authorities with descriptions, search of
baggage and advised them of his onward travel,'' Younger said.
	   The group had earlier been contacted by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service as part of Operation Jungle Trade, a three-year
undercover investigation which resulted in the arrest in America of
40 people and the seizure of 660 endangered birds and other
animals.
	   The protected birds and animals were being smuggled across the
United States-Mexico border and being sold in nine U.S. states,
Puerto Rico and 10 other countries.
	   The seizure was estimated to be worth more than U.S. dlrs
500,000.
	   Earlier this year a New Zealand bird breeder, Roy Nichols, 40,
was sent to jail for 18 months after being found guilty on
smuggling charges involving exotic bird eggs, tortoises and
chameleons.
	   The trial in the High Court at Auckland was the first under the
Biosecurity Act to involve exotic birds.

Dollar tops 140 yen in Tokyo, stocks down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency
prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar broke through the 140-yen level for
the first time in seven years and showed no signs of slowing in
Tokyo trading on Monday. Japanese stock prices slipped.
	   The dollar bought 140.64 yen at mid-afternoon, up 1.22 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and its highest point since June 20, 1991. In
New York, the dollar settled at 139.75 yen on Friday.
	   The dollar continued gaining after crossing the 140-yen line for
the first time in thin weekend trading Sunday in New York.
	   The dollar's strength sprang from fresh evidence of a robust
U.S. economy after the Labor Department reported on Friday the
nation's unemployment rate held to a 28-year-low of 4.3 percent in
May.
	   Also supporting the U.S. currency was the diminishing likelihood
the Group of Seven industrialized nations will make a strong
statement criticizing the current dollar level, traders said.
	   Officials from the G-7 _ the United States, Japan, Germany,
Italy, Canada, Britain and France _ are scheduled to meet in Paris
on Tuesday.
	   Persistent pessimism over Japan's economy also continued to
weigh on sentiment among many investors, who have sold yen to shift
money into more robust markets in the United States and Europe.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
slipped 28.72 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 15,294.71. On
Friday, the average lost 103.04 points, or 0.67 percent.
	   The benchmark average started lower on small-lot selling as the
yen's weakening discouraged some investors about the outlook for
Japan's economy.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section fell 3.58 points, or 0.30 percent, to 1,198.36. The TOPIX
closed down 5.56 points, or 0.46 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.150 percent from Friday's 1.165 percent,
driving its price up to 112.42 yen from 112.31 yen on Friday.

Anzoil signs protocol for Hanoi basin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Anzoil has signed an agreement with
French company Maurel and Prom to participate in a production
sharing agreement in the Hanoi Basin in Vietnam.
	   Anzoil said Monday it will farm out 25 percent of the production
sharing contract to M and P for U.S. dlrs 16.66 million, which will
be put toward the costs of appraisal of the D14 gas field in the
Hanoi Basin including three new exploration wells.
	   Anzoil and M and P will also enter into a joint operating
agreement to govern their future working arrangement in the
contract, with Anzoil retaining an operator status.
	   The agreement follows the release of an independent technical
report in April which said gas and oil discoveries in the Hanoi
Basin were expected to contain 522 billion cubic feet of
recoverable gas and 19 million barrels of recoverable oil.
	   M and P holds significant interests in oil drilling operations
around the world, according to Anzoil.
	   ``Their presence and good standing in the Vietnamese community
will bring significant benefits to the Anzoil joint venture as it
prepares itself to become a substantial energy provider in
Vietnam,'' executive chairman Jaap Poll said.
	   He added that the new agreement, which is still subject to
approval by the Anzoil board and Vietnamese authorities, was a vote
of confidence in the project by a major overseas group.

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Blaming the government
for stalled peace talks with armed rebels, Bishop Samuel Ruiz
stepped down as the central figure in efforts to resolve the
conflict in southern Mexico.
	   ``It is clear to me that a chapter in the peace process has
ended,'' the Roman Catholic bishop said in his Sunday homily. ``I
am grateful to all who have accompanied me in my mediation tasks.''
	   Ruiz's resignation as president of the church mediation team
formed after the Zapatista rebel uprising 4 1/2 years ago
underscores growing pessimism about peace efforts in the southern
state of Chiapas.
	   Several hours later, the church mediation commission announced
its dissolution, also blaming the government for ``dismantling the
necessary conditions for dialogue and negotiation.''
	   It cited growing militarization and violence by the government
and its agents in the region. Forty-five unarmed residents of a
pro-rebel village, many of them children, were killed in December
by gunmen linked to Mexico's governing party.
	   Mediation commission members also cited recent criticism of
their group by government leaders, including President Ernesto
Zedillo.
	   The bishop has been the central figure in peace efforts since
the Zapatista National Liberation Army staged a brief uprising in
January 1994, demanding greater rights for the region's
impoverished Indian farmers.
	   In March of that year, Ruiz invited the rebel's top military
leader Subcomandante Marcos and government peace envoy Manuel
Camacho Solis to the first series of talks, televised nationally
from this mountain community's centuries-old cathdral.
	   After talks broke down, Ruiz continued to urge both sides back
to negotiations. But the bishop said that unless the government
changes, more talks are impossible.
	   ``There will have to be constructed another chapter in which the
conditions for peace can be created,'' Ruiz said.
	   The government's backing off on a signed treaty to grant Indian
autonomy has resulted in ``a heavy, final silence'' from the
Zapatistas, said the bishop. He said that the government, in turn,
has read the rebels' silence as a rejection of dialogue.
	   Chiapas state and Mexico's federal governments have become
increasingly frustrated with the stalemate. For several years,
their primary strategy has been to surround them in one region with
thousands of troops.
	   Recent attempts to further marginalize the Zapatistas have
included expelling foreigners accused of rebel sympathies, and the
breaking up of pro-rebel parallel governments in Chiapas
municipalities.
	   Some 1,000 police officers and soldiers swarmed into a small
town early Wednesday, firing tear gas, breaking down doors and
arresting 167 rebel sympathizers.

After drought, Malaysia braces for floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Still reeling from the effects of
its worst drought in decades, Malaysia is bracing for floods, the
national news agency reported Monday.
	   Local officials had been directed to dig pools and channels that
would drain flooded rivers and prevent farmlands from being
inundated, Deputy Agriculture Minister Mahmud Mansor was quoted as
saying by Bernama news agency.
	   Some weather experts say that the El Nino system, blamed for
causing the drought in Southeast Asia, is weakening. But it could
be replaced by the so-called La Nina, which could reverse some of
the effects and bring excessive rain. Its strength or timing is not
entirely predictable.
	   ``We have to brace ourselves for La Nina,'' Mahmud told
reporters Sunday in the northeastern city of Kuala Terengganu.
	   Agencies like the Drainage and Irrigation Department have been
put on alert in anticipation of the destructive power of the La
Nina, he said.
	   The minister said the government had allotted 400 million
ringgit (dlrs 100 million) for measures to combat floods.
	   The drought has not only caused a severe water shortage in Kuala
Lumpur, with rain-fed reservoirs drying up, but also left huge
tracts of farmland parched in the north and south.
	   The price of home-grown rice has risen by 20 percent and the
government last week said it would have to import more rice to meet
the shortfall caused by crop failures.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Diplomatic efforts were under way to
prevent the border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia from
exploding into full-scale war, with officials hoping that Monday's
summit of African leaders will produce new ideas for a settlement.
	   American, Italian, German and British planes ferried more than a
thousand foreigners out of harm's way late Saturday and early
Sunday after Ethiopia agreed to temporarily halt bombing of a
military-civilian airport on the outskirts of the Eritrean capital
Asmara.
	   African heads of state gathered for a meeting of the
Organization of African Unity in Ouagadougu, Burkina Faso, where
finding a peaceful solution to the Ethiopian-Eritrean crisis topped
their agenda.
	   ``We're anxious to see what they come up with,'' said Eritrean
government spokesman Isaac Yared.
	   The OAU, hampered by the location of its headquarters in
Ethiopia and Eritrea's disinterest in the organization, has played
a minor role since the first border clash on May 6.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice left a meeting of
OAU foreign ministers Saturday in Ouagadougu to return to the
United States. Rice is promoting a U.S.-Rwandan peace plan for the
two feuding Horn of Africa countries.
	   The plan includes a call for Eritrea to return to positions held
before May 6, when current hostilities reportedly broke out _ in
other words, to withdraw from what Ethiopia considers its
territory.
	   But Eritrea, wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea,
claims it is rightfully occupying territory defined by boundaries
drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   African leaders, including the presidents of South Africa,
Djibouti, Uganda and Kenya, called Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki over the weekend to encourage a negotiated settlement.
	   Eritrean civilians were hoping to avoid war. Ethiopia's army
outnumbers Eritrea's 40,000-strong force by about 3 to 1. Eritrea's
tiny air force is no match for Ethiopia's.
	   In Asmara, Eritreans scanned cloudless blue skies Sunday and
listened for the high-pitched whoosh of the Ethiopian MiG-23
fighters that had bombed their capital's airport Friday and
Saturday. But none came.
	   Skirmishes were reported, however, along the two countries'
disputed border. Ethiopia said Sunday it had reoccupied its border
town of Zala Anbessa, 100 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of
Asmara, after a daylong battle with Eritrean forces who captured
the town last week.
	   Eritrean government spokesman Isaac Yared said Eritrean troops
had retreated to their side of the border. ``They decided it was
time to go,'' he said.
	   Mokonnen, who uses just one name, said he was optimistic that a
peace pact would be forged between the one-time allies.
	   ``Our government wants peace, and we are struggling to solve it
peacefully,'' the 27-year-old telephone operator said.
	   Also Sunday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that the
leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea were willing to implement a Libyan
plan for a cease-fire and deploy an African peacekeeping force on
their border,
	   But Isaac, the Eritrean government spokesman, said the report
was untrue, and that Eritrea preferred to concentrate on improving
the U.S.-Rwandan plan.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991, and Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   But the two countries dispute more than a half-dozen areas along
their common border, which was drawn by Italy after it conquered
Eritrea in 1885.

Jewish settlers take over homes in Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers took over three buildings in an
Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem before dawn Monday, stringing barbed
wire and setting off angry stone-throwing clashes with Arab
neighbors.
	   It was the latest in a series of escalating confrontations in
Jerusalem's eastern sector as both sides accuse the other of trying
to grab land in the bitterly contested city.
	   At least two people were injured in Monday's clashes, including
the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini. He was
hit in the head with a stone and slightly hurt before police and
soldiers broke up the melee.
	   Adding to the volatile mix, about 20 activists from the Peace
Now group arrived at the site to protest the settlers' arrival.
Police roughly dragged them away after they refused to disperse.
	   The 15 settlers were from the Elad group, which claims it
purchased the homes legally. Israel radio said, though, that the
ownership is in contention.
	   ``We decided tonight to fulfill our ownership of these
buildings,'' said Yehuda Mali, one of the settlers who moved in
overnight. He said his group bought the property almost 10 years
ago.
	   In one skirmish, settlers kicked Arabs who tried to block them
from entering one of the buildings.
	   ``I will surrender my life before I surrender my house!''
shouted Fatima Karaeen, 62, who said she has papers showing one of
the houses belongs to her Arab family. ``The cowards!''
	   The makeup of Jerusalem's neighborhoods is an explosive issue,
with Palestinians trying to block what they say are illegal
encroachments by Jewish settlers. Both sides are constantly
jockeying for position pending negotiations on the city's final
status.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
the 1967 Mideast War, as capital of a future state. Israel insists
the city must remain undivided under Israeli sovereignty.
	   Husseini, the Palestinian official, has called for mass street
protests to block Jewish settlers, who have been stepping up
activity in recent weeks. Last month, clashes broke out after the
settler group Ataret Cohanim set up sheds near the Old City's
Herod's Gate.
	   The latest confrontation comes at a delicate moment in efforts
to restart the stalled peace process.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that no
accord was imminent on a proposed West Bank troop pullback.
	   ``I don't work according to a stopwatch,'' Netanyahu told
reporters after meeting with his Cabinet.
	   Israel's army radio however, citing sources close to the prime
minister, said an American plan for a troop withdrawal will likely
to brought to Cabinet for a vote before the end of the week.
	   The radio reported that Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh,
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and U.S. Ambassador Edward
Walker met Sunday to discuss the proposal.

Thousands of strikers rally, clash with police in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ As many as 10,000 striking workers
scuffled with and threw rocks at anti-riot police when they staged
a 10-kilometer (6-mile) march through the streets of Indonesia's
second city of Surabaya on Monday.
	   Police and witnesses said violence broke out when a line of
police blocked the path of the marchers as they approached the East
Java's provincial parliament building.
	   At least five police and three protesters were hospitalized.
Some were bleeding after being beaten with sticks or being hit with
rocks.
	   The protest was the biggest since Indonesia's new President B.J.
Habibie last week relaxed tight restrictions on labor unions and
signed an International Labor Organization convention on respect
for workers' rights.
	   Habibie, who has delivered a list of liberalizing reforms, was
sworn in May 21 after ex-President Suharto resigned following a
wave of protests and riots against his 32-year authoritarian grip
on power.
	   Police later let the crowd pass and stage a noisy rally outside
the legislature in Surabaya, about 650 kilometers (400 miles) east
of Jakarta.
	   Witnesses said the strikers damaged at least five automobiles.
Police denied one report that two police motorcycles were set
afire.
	   Police spokesman Lt. Col. Sutrisno said about 10 people were
being questioned.
	   Shops were closed but were not attacked, said witness Ludi
Lumanto.
	   The workers, employees of a household appliance manufacturer,
went on strike last Tuesday demanding higher salaries and better
conditions as the effects of Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
30 years begins to bite.
	   Among their demands was the right to observe Islamic prayers
during their working time. About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202
million people are Muslim.
	   Indonesia is now suffering runaway inflation and mass
unemployment as the economic situation worsens.
	   Meanwhile in Jakarta several smaller and peaceful
anti-government rallies were held.
	   At one demonstration about 100 protesters called for Habibie to
speed up the promised release of as many as 200 political
prisoners. So far four political prisoners have been freed.

South Korea's bankrupt Hanbo Steel to be sold to foreigners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Bankrupt Hanbo Steel Industry Co.,
South Korea's second largest steel maker, will be sold to foreign
investors later this year, its creditor banks said Monday.
	   The decision came after potential domestic investors, including
state-run Pohang Iron and Steel Corp., the nation's No. 1 steel
maker, gave up plans to take over the failed steel producer.
	   Pohang last week called back four of its executives who had
worked as court-appointed managers for Hanbo since the steel firm
collapsed under dlrs 6 billion in bank debts in January, 1997.
	   Along with the return of its officials, Pohang said it also had
stopped selling Hanbo products through its sales networks under an
arrangement with Hanbo's creditors.
	   The decision to sever ties with Hanbo was aimed at avoiding
trade friction with foreign countries, the statement said.
	   The United States and other countries have accused South Korea
of unfair trade practices by allowing a state-owned company to help
keep Hanbo afloat.
	   Hanbo, which once produced 3 million tons of steel a year,
borrowed heavily from banks to finance its aggressive expansion
programs. But sales lagged early last year amid an overall economic
slowdown, producing a cash crunch.
	   In mid-1997, Pohang offered 2 trillion won (dlrs 1.4 billion)
for key facilities of Hanbo, excluding its debts. Creditor banks
rejected the offer, saying the price was too low.
	   On Monday, creditors said they will soon select a lead manager
for the planned sell-off of Hanbo and complete takeover
negotiations before the end of this year.
	   So far, about nine foreign steel companies, including USX Corp.
of the United States, have shown interest in Hanbo, they said.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai stock prices hit an 11-year low at
midday Monday as investors dumped the stock of the country's
biggest finance company after it decided to sell half of its
securities subsidiary.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand veered from a low of 311.70
points to a high of 317.25. Dealers said the index hasn't seen such
lows since 1987, blaming the drop on regional currency woes and the
move by Phatra Thanakit PCL.
	   Phatra Thanakit announced last week that it would sell a 51
percent stake in a subsidiary, Phatra Securities Co., to Merrill
Lynch and Co.
	   Dealers said it could be the beginning of the end of Phatra's
listing on the exchange, since top Phatra executives said they were
considering merging the company's finance operations into those of
Thai Farmers Bank PCL, its biggest shareholder.
	   Earlier, Thai baht hit a 13-week low of 43.80 to the U.S.
dollar, off from 43.25 at Friday's close, as investors dumped
regional currencies after the dollar surged to a seven-year high
against the Japanese yen.
	   The weakness of the Japanese currency, dealers said, spells
trouble for crisis-hit Southeast Asian economies that have been
increasingly dependent on Japan as an export market.
	   Fears are rising that the Asian economic crisis could enter a
new, more devastating phase.

Report: Body of Indonesian shooting victim exhumed, bullet removed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Officials investigating the deaths of
four student protesters, allegedly shot by security personnel last
month, have exhumed the body of one the victims and removed a
bullet from it, the Jakarta Post newspaper reported Monday.
	   It said the body of Heri Hartanto was taken from its grave in a
Jakarta cemetery on Saturday and brought to a hospital where a
bullet was taken from the man's chest.
	   The military has charged 18 police officers in the fatal
shootings. Court martial proceedings against two started on
Saturday.
	   Government critics claim that military personnel might have also
been involved in the deaths, which have been solely blamed on the
police.
	   Prosecutors say police should have only used rubber bullets.
	   Mum'im Idries, a physician who examined all four victims before
burial, said they died of wounds from real bullets.
	   He said he removed one bullet from the body of another victim
before it was buried. Bullets that hit two others had passed
through their bodies.
	   The protesters died when shots were fired at Jakarta's Trisakti
University as an anti-government rally took place.
	   The deaths caused an uproar in the capital, Jakarta, and were
followed by a wave of rioting.
	   Almost 1,200 people died in the violence, which helped force
ex-President Suharto to resign after 32 years in power.

China's commercial banks increase loans for housing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Mortgage loans by China's commercial banks rose
only by a sliver in the first quarter of 1998, despite the
government's announcement of a program encouraging private
apartment purchases, the China Securities News reported Monday.
	   Housing loans by the four state-owned commercial banks rose 0.3
percent or 834 million yuan (dlrs 100.97 million) to 264.3 billion
(dlrs 32 billion) in the first three months over the same period
last year, the report said.
	   Of the total, loans to individuals amounted to 33.7 billion
(dlrs 4.08 billion), it said.
	   China's four state-owned commercial banks _ the Industrial &AMP;
Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank
of China and the China Construction Bank _ are intended to be at
the vanguard of reforms intended to build a commercially sound
banking system.
	   To boost flagging economic activity and fend off the economic
doldrums that have stricken much of Asia, the government has
declared the housing industry a key area of growth.
	   Earlier this year, the People's Bank of China, the central bank,
said banks can allocate up to 15 percent of their loan portfolios
to mortgages. The central bank has also raised ceilings for housing
debt so banks could accommodate more mortgage lending.

Indonesian human rights watchdog group wants more dissidents freed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's National Human Rights
Commission called Monday on new President B.J. Habibie to make good
a promise to release more political prisoners put behind bars by
his authoritarian predecessor, Suharto.
	   Commission member Marzuki Darusman told reporters after meeting
with Habibie the commission would hold talks with the Justice
Ministry with the aim of speeding up the release of inmates.
	   The commission was appointed by Suharto in 1993, but has a
proven track record for investigating human rights abuses.
	   Suharto ended 32 years in office on May 21 when he quit and was
replaced by Habibie.
	   Within days the new leader ordered the release of four high
profile dissidents who had been jailed for criticizing Suharto's
regime. Habibie said more would be released in the future, but gave
no timetable.
	   Private human rights groups say at least 200 political prisoners
are still locked up.
	   Darusman declined to tell reporters how many prisoners might be
freed but said the commission wanted more releases as soon as
possible.
	   Also on Monday about 100 protesters staged a peaceful rally
outside the Justice Ministry demanding the prisoners' immediate
release.
	   Some carried a banner that read: ``Hey government! What about
your promise to release more political prisoners?''
	   ``It seems that the government isn't really serious about
granting amnesties to more political prisoners,'' said Bonar Tigor
Naipospos, a former jailed dissident who now heads the Indonesian
Society for Humanity.

Philippine labor officials call meeting to resolve pilots' strike
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Labor officials called an emergency
meeting Monday to try to resolve a strike by more than 600 pilots
at Philippine Airlines which has plunged the financially troubled
flag-carrier into crisis.
	   PAL fired all the striking pilots on Sunday, calling their
action illegal, except for a few who had complied with an airline
order to return to work to avoid dismissal.
	   Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano said the Philippine
government is intervening in the dispute because it affects the
national interest. Representatives of PAL's management and the
620-strong Airline Pilots Association of the Philippines were
summoned to the meeting.
	   Trajano said he ordered the strikers to return to work and the
airline to accept them back. He also urged both sides to refrain
from further hostile actions.
	   The union is protesting a new management policy of firing pilots
who have reached 20 years of service or flown 20,000 hours,
regardless of age. The policy puts about 200 pilots in danger of
forced retirement, the union said.
	   The financially beleaguered airline has said it must cut
expenses by as much as 40 percent, slash flights, and sharply
reduce its work force in order to survive. The airline hasn't
disclosed an estimate for its manpower reduction, but employees
fear it could be as much as 30 percent.
	   The strike began Friday, forcing cancellations of more than 200
international and domestic flights and affecting thousands of
passengers.
	   PAL fired all 29 officers of the union on Saturday and warned
remaining members would also be dismissed if they didn't return to
work by noon Sunday. The 620 striking pilots represent the
airlines' total pilot force.
	   Virtually all of the pilots, however, defied the order and PAL
announced Sunday it was firing all the strikers, plunging the
airline into one of its most serious crises. PAL said it has
started to process job applications of new pilots.
	   PAL called the strike illegal because the Department of Labor
had earlier assumed jurisdiction over the dispute and barred both
sides from committing any hostile actions.
	   The airline said the strike was embarrassing the country, citing
pilots who abandoned a PAL plane in Bangkok at the start of the
strike.
	   PAL scheduled one flight each to Hong Kong and Tokyo on Monday
but indefinitely canceled all flights to the United States, Europe
and Australia. One return flight each from Hong Kong and Singapore
also was scheduled, along with 14 domestic flights.
	   Most of the flights were being flown by management pilots, who
are senior pilots who train other pilots.
	   Over the past four years, the airline has incurred annual losses
ranging from 451.4 million pesos (dlrs 11.3 million) to 2.5 billion
pesos (dlrs 62.5 million), in part because of large debts, an aging
fleet and Asia's currency crisis.
	   Angel Sambo, a PAL spokesman, denied union allegations that the
dismissals could be a way of achieving a reduction of PAL's
workforce.
	   ``Why would PAL go into that? We have no pilots to fly our
planes now,'' he said.
	   PAL is controlled by Chinese Filipino tycoon Lucio Tan. It had
been completely owned by the Philippine government from 1941 until
it was partly sold in 1992.

	   PARIS (AP) _ South Korea is recharging its strength to play
Mexico in its opening France 98 match. Advancing to the second
round is the goal, but chances may ride on whether striker Hwang
Sun-hong recovers from a knee injury.
	   The South Koreans, who arrived in Paris on Friday, are quietly
preparing, practicing and planning in a remote area in the
outskirts of Paris in the hopes of optimizing their chances of
winning the nation's first match in five World Cup appearances.
	   While Belgium is regarded as the other ``weakling'' in Group E,
South Korea figures to have its best chance of a first-round
victory against Mexico. The Netherlands is the seeded team in the
group.

Myanmar opposition activists sentenced to 14 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two pro-democracy activists have been
sentenced by Myanmar's military regime to 14 years' imprisonment
for distributing a letter from a rebel army.
	   The pair were handing out copies of the letter, which was
addressed to Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the powerful head of military
intelligence, during a meeting in late March at the home of Nobel
Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   Sources in Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy said a court
had passed sentence on the pair last Monday. The letter was from
the Shan State Army, a rebel group of the ethnic Shan minority. Its
contents have not been divulged.

	   ABOARD THE U.S. COAST GUARD CUTTER DALLAS (AP) _ On the front
line of the war on drugs, Seaman Chris Taylor casts a fishing line
into roiling waters from the stern of his 380-foot (115-meter)
ship.
	   ``It breaks up the monotony of the patrol,'' the 26-year-old
native of Nashville, Tennessee, said with a laugh. ``Sometimes
we'll get a couple hundred pounds of dolphin and take them in and
they'll grill them up.''
	   A couple hundred pounds of cocaine would be better.
	   But neither drug smugglers nor fish _ at least on this day _ are
biting. The Dallas, command ship for an ambitious drug interdiction
effort in the Caribbean, hadn't made a bust in weeks.
	   Welcome to ``Operation Frontier Lance,'' a 3-month-old, dlrs 2.5
million effort to stop South American smugglers from using Haiti
and the Dominican Republic to ship cocaine into Puerto Rico and the
southeastern United States.
	   Capt. James W. Underwood, the Dallas' commander, admitted he
faced an uphill battle against nimble smugglers who use
hard-to-detect speedboats to crisscross the Caribbean _ the route
for 40 percent of the cocaine that reaches the United States.
	   ``Getting real solid intelligence would be fabulous,'' he
sighed.
	   A favorite strategy of smugglers has been to focus on Puerto
Rico. Since it is a U.S. territory, drug smugglers can proceed to
the American mainland without dealing with customs or borders.
	   When U.S. agencies began cracking down around Puerto Rico last
year, traffickers shifted 100 miles (160 kilometers) west to
Hispaniola, the underpoliced island shared by Haiti and the
Dominican Republic that lies about halfway between Colombia and
Florida. Some gangs staged nighttime airdrops in isolated parts of
Haiti, too.
	   Once in Hispaniola, smugglers wait for the right moment to
spirit shipments via speedboat across the narrow Mona Channel into
Puerto Rico _ or even to the U.S. mainland.
	   Under Frontier Lance, U.S. intelligence tries to track ships and
planes while U.S. Navy and Coast Guard officers direct as many as a
dozen ships swarming around Hispaniola _ American, Dominican,
occasionally British.
	   In all, U.S. officials believe they intercepted about one-third
of the estimated 430 tons of cocaine shipped from South America to
the United States last year.
	   It's not entirely clear whether the new operation has made a
serious difference, admitted A.P. Bennett, a combat systems officer
on the Dallas, which is based in Charleston, South Carolina.
	   Since March 1, the Coast Guard has seized only 1 1/2 tons of
cocaine and eight smuggler boats and arrested 27 people. The Coast
Guard says it seizes a global average of dlrs 1.5 million worth of
cocaine and marijuana a day.
	   The chief of U.S. anti-drug efforts, Barry McCaffrey, claims
cocaine shipments into Puerto Rico have dropped from as high as 14
tons a month last year to seven tons.
	   Yet the street price in Puerto Rico remains relatively constant,
at dlrs 8,600-dlrs 11,400 a pound (450 grams), said William
Santiago, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent in San Juan.
	   McCaffrey said chasing the smugglers farther from Puerto Rico is
a victory in itself, by making it more difficult for them.
	   Some have moved as far west as the Central American nation of
Honduras, where the Coast Guard has seized more than three tons of
cocaine this year. Smugglers have even organized illegal trips of
boat people to divert the Coast Guard, Dominican newspapers
reported.
	   ``It's a constant game of move, countermove,'' said Commodore
John W. Young, commander of the U.S. Navy's Destroyer Squadron Six
based in Pascagoula, Mississippi.
	   Occasionally, there are flashes of excitement:
	   _In March, following an 18-hour chase, a Colombian speedboat
crashed into rocks near Haiti. The Coast Guard recovered 200 pounds
of cocaine; the boatmen escaped.
	   _In April, a Coast Guard ship fired across the bow of a
speedboat during another 18-hour chase back south to Colombia,
where the Colombian navy finally arrested the smugglers.
	   _Off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, an engine room fire on the
31-year-old Dallas slightly injured two sailors.
	   For the 170-odd men and women on the Dallas, most days are
devoted to routine: ship maintenance, fire drills, launching
helicopters, watching videos, catching fresh air on deck.
	   Over three recent days, the Dallas rarely crept above 9 mph (14
kph) while cruising off the cloud-shrouded Haitian island of
Gonave. An anticipated drug shipment never materialized.
	   Lt. Ernesto G. Rubio gazed from the ship, lights out as it
prowled, under a nighttime sky dotted with stars.
	   ``If we're deterring them, then I guess we're doing what the
American taxpayer is paying us to do,'' he said.

Investors postpone Singapore-Indonesian resort development
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Stung by the economic crisis gripping Southeast
Asia, major investors have postponed further development of a
resort complex on the nearby Indonesian island of Bintan, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   Started seven years ago, Singapore and Indonesian investors
planned to turn 23,000 hectares (57,000 acres) into the Bintan
Beach International Resort, with hotels, golf clubs, and housing
units.
	   But investment groups have shelved their plans indefinitely,
putting on hold developments worth more than one billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 585 million), according to The Business Times.
	   About 2 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.17 billion) have
already been committed to the project, according to the newspaper.
	   The first phase covering 6,000 hectares (14,800 acres) has been
launched, and about 240 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 140
million) has already been spent on island infrastructure.
	   Four major investor groups _ including Singapore
government-linked companies like Sembawang Corp. and the Wah Chang
group _ have completed sizable projects, the daily said.
	   Bintan Beach International Resort is owned by Bintan Resort
Corp., whose shareholders include Indonesia's Salim Group and a
Singapore consortium which includes government-linked conglomerate
Singapore Technologies Industrial Corp. and four major banks.

Newspaper editor loyal to Cambodian leader Hun Sen shot

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The publisher-editor of the
country's most widely-read newspaper _ which supports Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen _ was shot by an unidentified gunman Monday.
	   At least two of six bullets fired struck Thong Uy Pang, 55, in
the shoulder while he was standing outside a pagoda, his wife and
police said. His bodyguards returned fire. One was hit and so was
the gunman, who fled, witnesses said.
	   Thong Uy Phang was undergoing surgery at the capital's Calmette
Hospital. Yet Razaque, a deputy municipal police commissioner, said
the shooting was being investigated. There was no immediate known
motive.
	   Thong Uy Phang's hard-hitting Koh Santepheap (Island of Peace)
backs Hun Sen, who has often been accused of orchestrating attacks
on journalists supporting his opponents.
	   Last October, two men on a motorcycle hurled grenades inside
Thong Uy Phang's residential compound. No one was hurt, but damage
was extensive. That attack was apparently prompted by articles
about internal problems within Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party.
	   The journalist's wife, Yim Phanny, said she was standing next to
him Monday before the shooting. He was talking on a mobile phone to
an angry reader about an article criticizing the electricity
company for allegedly inflating prices.
	   Thong Uy Phang shouted, ``I'm hit!'' when the first bullet
struck him and tried to pull his own gun, but was unable to return
fire, his wife said.
	   Yim Phanny said that she thought there was a plot to assassinate
her husband but had no idea who was behind it.
	   Hun Sen is engaged in an election campaign seeking to restore
international legitimacy and aid lost since his bloody coup last
year against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   The opposition has complained of being denied access to the
broadcast media, controlled entirely by Hun Sen, and of violence
and intimidation of opposition supporters.
	   Chum Kanal, president of the League of Cambodian Journalists, a
media association sympathetic to Hun Sen, condemned the attack,
said he thought opposition politicians might be resorting to
violence to obstruct the electoral campaign.
	   ``This is a barbarous act which is unacceptable,'' said Chum
Kanal. ``I consider this to be politically motivated terrorism, and
I ask the authorities to find the culprit.''
	   He said that in recent months attacks against journalists have
calmed, but that with the return of opposition politicians _ who
fled the country in fear following last year's coup d'etat _ he now
sees a return to ``terrorist tactics.''

Farmers pull sick panda from dangerous river bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A farmer who spotted a sick panda moving
perilously close to the edge of a turbulent river dashed down the
bank and wrestled the animal to safety, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported Monday.
	   Yang Yanfang grabbed the panda and rolled down the riverbank
with it, breaking the fall a few meters (yards) above the rushing
water by grabbing a tree branch, Xinhua said. Other farmers helped
him to control the animal and send it to a local forestry bureau
for medical treatment.
	   Yang suffered cuts on his arms. The panda recovered and was
returned to the Labahe Nature Reserve in Sichuan province in
southwest China.
	   Sichuan is home to the roughly 1,000 endangered pandas remaining
in the wild in China.

Japanese and Chinese Communists seek rapprochement in Beijing talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The Japanese and Chinese Communist parties are
seeking to end more than 30 years of estrangement in talks that
began Monday in Beijing.
	   The head of the Japanese Communist Party's international
department, Hikaru Nishiguchi, met with his Chinese counterpart,
Dai Binggou, to discuss ways to revive ties severed in 1967, a
party official said on condition of anonymity.
	   During the 1966-1976 ultraleftist Cultural Revolution, China
declared the Japanese Communist Party an enemy because it refused
to ascribe to the utopian dogma ordered by then-leader Mao
Tse-tung.
	   An attempt to reach rapprochement failed in 1985 during talks in
Europe.
	   Early this year, the two groups resumed efforts to settle their
differences. The Japanese Communist Party group now in Beijing is
the first such delegation to visit China since 1966.
	   The talks are to prepare for a visit to China later this summer
by Japanese Communist Party Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa for the
announcement of a joint statement on normalizing ties between the
two parties, the official said.
	   The newspaper of the Japanese Communist Party, the Akahata (Red
Flag), reopened its bureau in Beijing this year for the first time
since 1967.
	   Increasingly isolated in Japanese politics, the Japanese
Communist Party is seeking to develop relations with kindred
communist parties elsewhere.

57 students in southeast China poisoned by pesticides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Pesticide residues sickened 57 students in two
cases of food poisoning this month in southeastern China's Fujian
province, a Chinese newspaper reported Monday.
	   Twenty-four primary school students in the city of Changle
suffered headaches and vomiting on June 3 after eating
pesticide-tainted yangmei, or red bayberry, the China Youth Daily
reported.
	   A day earlier, 33 students in Xiamen fell ill after eating
pesticide-contaminated watercress, the report said. Students in
both cities were hospitalized, it said.
	   Agricultural officials say there are many cases of improper use
of farm chemicals on China's small family farms.

Seoul official offers to provide surplus electricity to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A top South Korean government energy
official offered in an interview published Monday to provide
surplus electricity to energy-starved North Korea.
	   ``In promoting economic cooperation, electricity can be as
important as food,'' Chang Young-shik, head of the state-run Korea
Electric Power Corp., was quoted as saying by the Moonhwa Ilbo
newspaper.
	   ``Technically, the process is very simple and the work can be
done within a year, if the two governments reach such a deal,'' he
said.
	   Chang, a former economics professor at New York State
University, has stressed the importance of cooperation with North
Korea since being named to head the state-run utility in April.
	   South Korea, with a total generating capacity of 43 million
kilowatts, can produce 20 percent more electricity than it needs
daily.
	   ``A small fraction of the surplus electricity can help North
Korea in a big way,'' Chang said in the interview.
	   South Korean officials say most of North Korea's aging power
plants are fossil-fired and only produce about 1.5 million
kilowatts daily, about one-fifth of their total capacity, because
of fuel shortages.
	   ``Except for about 100 hours in the summer when electricity
demands reach their peak, we have enough surplus to provide them
almost throughout the year,'' Chang said.
	   About 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past
three years and all complained of acute food and fuel shortages in
their communist country.
	   Foreign tourists have reported frequent power outages, even in
Pyongyang, the capital.

Prosecutors seek arrest warrant for ex-telecommunications minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In an ongoing corruption probe of past
government officials, prosecutors sought an arrest warrant Monday
for an ex-telecommunications minister charged with bribery.
	   Former Information and Telecommunications Minister Lee Suk-chae
was accused of receiving dlrs 20,000 in bribes from local companies
trying to win government licences for lucrative cellular phone
projects.
	   If convicted, Lee could face a prison term of up to five years.
	   Lee has ignored prosecutors' repeated calls to return home from
Hawaii to face investigation. Prosecutors plan to subpoena Lee
through the U.S. Justice Department after obtaining an arrest
warrant.
	   The United States and South Korea have no extradition treaty.
	   Prosecutors declined to comment, but local media reported that
officials of LG Telecom and Hansol PCS also will be indicted on
charges of giving bribes to Lee and other government officials.

Indian, Pakistani leaders may meet at July 9-11 South Asian summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan officials said Monday they
have proposed July 9-11 for a South Asian summit at which the
leaders of rivals India and Pakistan counld sit down together for
the first time since their nuclear tests.
	   Tension in the region has been high since India's tests May 11
and 13, followed two weeks later by retaliatory tests from
Pakistan. The two countries have fought three wars since their
independence from Britain in 1947, and fears their rivalry could
escalate to nuclear war have prompted the U.N. Security Council to
call on them to talk about their differences, particularly their
disputing claims to the border region of Kashmir.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif have said they want talks, but no dates
have been set. Both are, though, expected to attend next month's
summit of the seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo.
	   Although SAARC meetings focus on multilateral trade and policy
matters, leaders can hold informal bilateral talks if they desire.
Members are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka.
	   At last year's summit, Sharif and Inder Kumar Gujral, then prime
minister of India, agreed to open negotiations on a number of
disputes. Those negotiations never got much beyond the stage of
bureaucrats wrangling over the agenda. The centrist Gujral was
replaced two months ago by Vajpayee who, though considered a
moderate, leads the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party known for
Pakistan-bashing.
	   Speaking Sunday on condition of anonymity in Bangladesh, a
senior aide to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Hasina will try to
bring India and Pakistan closer together during the summit.
	   The date for the summit is arranged by mutual consent of the
leaders of the seven member states.
	   Hasina has already agreed to the dates suggested by Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the Sri Lankan foreign ministry
said Monday in a press release.
	   Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar will next visit
India and Nepal to formally propose the dates, and later this month
Maldives and Pakistan.
	   Sri Lanka's Deputy Foreign Minister Lakshman Kiriella will
deliver the invitation to Bhutan next week.

Roche withdraws heart drug Posicor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche
announced Monday it is withdrawing the drug Posicor, prescribed for
high blood pressure and chronic angina pain.
	   The voluntary withdrawal is ``based on evolving information
concerning the potential for drug interactions, some of them
serious, which may occur when Posicor is taken together with some
other medications,'' Roche said in a statement.
	   It advised patients to consult their doctors about ``appropriate
alternative therapy'' and not to simply discontinue treatment with
the drug. Roche also warned patients against adding any new
medication to their present treatment without advice.
	   The decision followed analysis of the preliminary results of a
three-year study of the drug in congestive heart failure, the
company said.
	   In December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned
doctors not to prescribe the drug for patients with low heart rates
or who are taking certain cholesterol-lowering drugs.
	   The warnings were prompted by reports that seven patients
suffered drug-associated muscle injury as the result of taking
Posicor together with the cholesterol-lowering medication
simvastatin.
	   ``In principle, drug interactions can be addressed by
appropriate labeling,'' Roche said. But in this case, ``the
complexity of such a prescribing information would make it too
difficult to implement.''
	   Known also as mibefradil, the drug was first launched in
mid-1997 and is available in 38 countries.

Center-right batters left in Italian regional elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Candidates backed by Italy's center-right opposition
swept to victory in regional run-off elections, final results
showed Monday, dealing a further blow to the center-left which
emerged defeated in the first round.
	   The center-right, led by media magnate and former premier Silvio
Berlusconi, claimed 10 of the 16 mayoralties in the provincial
capitals where a second round of voting was required.
	   Center-left parties, which form premier Romano Prodi's governing
coalition, won five. A new moderate movement created by former
president Francesco Cossiga put a mayor in office in Oristano,
Sardinia.
	   Even the traditional leftist strongholds of Parma, Piacenza and
Lucca, wealthy towns in central Italy, succumbed to the
center-right.
	   Some 3.5 million Italians were elegible to vote Sunday in 73
mayoral races up and down the country, and three provincial
presidencies.
	   Candidates who captured more than 50 percent in the first round
of ballotting May 24 were declared winners.
	   Partially turning around a sweep by the right in Sicilian
provincial elections, the center-left grabbed seats in Syracuse and
Caltanisetta from center-right incumbents. The left now holds three
of the nine provincial presidencies on the island.
	   Umberto Bossi's autonomy-minded Northern League clinched the
provincial presidency in Treviso, an industrial city in Italy's
north.
	   Voter turnout dropped from 76.6 percent in the first round to
53.4 percent Sunday.

Poor overseas sales may push organizers to sell more at home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ More tickets for the Kuala Lumpur
Commonwealth Games may have to be sold within Malaysia because of
the poor response overseas, the chief organizer said Monday.
	   Hashim Ali, executive chairman of the 1998 games committee, said
organizers might increase Malaysia's share of sales to 80 percent
if overseas purchases do not pick up.
	   Organizers had hoped to sell 30 percent of the 1.28 million
tickets overseas and the remaining in Malaysia. ``We will monitor
ticket sales until the end of this month,'' Hashim said.
	   So far, 31,000 tickets had been sold locally and 29,000 in other
countries, mostly within the Commonwealth, a grouping of former
British colonies.
	   Hashim blamed ticket agents appointed by the London-based
Commonwealth Games Federation for the poor response. The agents had
tried to package tickets in a tour along with air fares and
accommodation.
	   Now, the Federation had permitted the local organizers to try
and sell tickets overseas, he said. Agents would be appointed to
sell in Australia and New Zealand.
	   More than 4,100 athletes from 67 nations are expected to
participate in the 10-day event that begins on Sept. 11.
	   Last week, organizers said they were battling to meet a 33
million ringgit (dlrs 8.9 million) shortfall, caused mostly by the
poor response to the advance sale of tickets.

Opposition calls for coalition to prevent `police state'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Four opposition parties announced
Monday an effort to form a coalition that would safeguard against
Malaysia becoming a ``police state.''
	   The parties said freedom of speech and assembly had been badly
eroded in the last several weeks, after three public meetings were
denied police permits.
	   The Democratic Action Party, Malaysian Socialist Party, Islamic
Party of Malaysia and People's Party announced the formation of the
Council for Justice, Freedom, Democracy and Good Governance to
mobilize public support for their cause.
	   ``We hope that like-minded individuals in other groups will join
us in this struggle for justice, freedom and democracy,'' said Lim
Kit Siang, the opposition leader in Parliament and head of the DAP.
	   Last week, the police banned a consumer rights group from
organizing a public meeting to discuss the severe water rationing
in the capital, where nearly 2 million people have suffered dry
faucets for three months.
	   The previous Sunday, more than 50 police officers in riot gear
broke up a gathering organized by the DAP party leaders.
	   Police said the meeting in a city hotel was illegal as the
organizers had not applied for a police permit. But the party said
it had informed the police.
	   Lim and his son, Lim Guan Eng, were to speak at that meeting
about the younger Lim's 18-month prison sentence for printing a
pamphlet that criticized the government. Lim Guan Eng is also one
of nine DAP members of Parliament.
	   Lim said police in riot gear also broke up a meeting on June 2
organized by the DAP in the central state of Malacca.
	   There is no blanket ban in Malaysia on demonstrations and
protests, but police permission is required. The law states that a
meeting of more than five people who intend to hold a public
gathering requires a permit.
	   Several hours after the Council's news conference, the Malaysian
Trades Union Congress, with a half-million members, announced it
would publicly endorse the coalition Tuesday.
	   ``We feel that the crackdown on public forums is a big step back
in our bid for more freedom and democracy in the country,'' said
MTUC spokesman Premesh Chandran.
	   The call for an opposition coalition comes on the heels of a
potentially divisive crisis within the DAP, the leading opposition
party in Malaysia. Three senior officials were sacked last week for
``causing disunity'' among the party leadership by criticizing Lim
at several party meetings.
	   The infighting could erode what little political opposition
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad faces before general elections in
2000.
	   Lim worries that Mahathir could call for early elections so that
the governing party wins a new mandate before the economic crisis
further eats away its popularity.

Asian stock markets mostly lower as currencies plunge on weak yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with key index in Bangkok hitting an 11-year low &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets extended last week's losses
early Monday on fears that further depreciation in the yen, which
fell to a seven-year low, could spark another round of currency
devaluations in Asia.
	   The key index in Bangkok hit an 11-year low at midday as
investors dumped the stock of the Thailand's biggest finance
company after it decided to sell half of its securities subsidiary.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand veered from a low of 311.70
points to a high of 317.25. Dealers said the index hasn't seen such
lows since 1987, blaming the drop on regional currency woes and the
move by Phatra Thanakit PCL.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index was
down 33.47 points, or 2.9 percent, at 1,134.99 at midday.
	   Many regional currencies also plunged through important support
levels early Monday as investors shifted their money into more
robust markets in the United States and Europe.
	   Dealers in the region said institutional investors, spooked by
the weakening regional currencies and persistent pessimism over
Japan's economy, continued to dump shares.
	   The U.S. dollar broke through the 140-yen level for the first
time in seven years in New York on Sunday, and showed no signs of
slowing in morning trading Monday in Tokyo.
	   In Tokyo, the dollar bought 140.69 yen at midday, up 1.27 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and its highest point since June 20,
1991. In New York, the dollar settled at 139.75 yen on Friday.
	   ``Further depreciation of the yen is sparking another round of
currency devaluation in Asia,'' said Joseph Yam, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Monetary Association, Hong Kong's de facto central
bank, on the sidelines of a conference in Switzerland.
	   The weaker yen also raises ``concern in fixed exchange rates
like the Hong Kong dollar and the (Chinese) yuan ,'' he added.
``That actually isn't very helpful to everybody.''
	   Officials in China and Hong Kong have vowed repeatedly to defend
the fixed exchange rates. Devaluation of the two currencies would
likely reverberate through the region's troubled economies.
	   The dollar's strength against the yen sprang from fresh evidence
of a robust U.S. economy after the Labor Department reported on
Friday that the nation's unemployment rate held to a 28-year-low of
4.3 percent in May.
	   Also supporting the U.S. currency was the diminishing likelihood
the Group of Seven industrialized nations will make a strong
statement criticizing the current dollar level at their meeting
Tuesday, traders said.
	   Elsewhere, the yen's weakness drove the Singapore dollar past
the key support level of 1.7000 to the U.S. dollar, and the
Malaysian ringgit past 4.000 to the dollar.
	   The Thai baht was at a 13-week low at midday, and Indonesia's
thinly-traded rupiah lost 2 percent in value against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The Australian dollar dropped to its lowest level against the
dollar since July 1986, hitting a low of 59.75 U.S. cents by
afternoon.
	   New Zealand's dollar was also lower, down to 50.88 U.S. cents.
	   In Taipei, the dollar also opened at an 11-year-high against the
New Taiwan dollar, but fell later amid talk of intervention by
Taiwan's central bank.
	   On other stock markets, in Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average edged down 26.03 points, or 0.17 percent, to 15,297.40 at
midday. On Friday, it had lost 103.04 points.
	   Shares in Hong Kong closed mixed at midday, with the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index rising 11.84 points to 8,581.31.
	   Meanwhile, shares in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Manila were
moderately lower, but the key index in Jakarta rose slightly on
gains of telecommunications shares.
	   In Seoul, despite the weakening won, shares opened sharply
higher on optimism that President Kim Dae-jung, currently in the
U.S., will succeed in drawing more foreign investment, analysts
said.
	   The key Korea Composite Stock Price Index opened up 11.43
points, or 3.3 percent, to 352.96.

Money shortage continues to stall Russian component of new space

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's cash-strapped government is dragging its
feet on funding a key component of the new international space
station, which could mean more delays in finishing the project,
officials said Monday.
	   ``The financial issue hasn't been resolved yet,'' said Anatoly
Kiselyov, director of the Khrunichev Company, which is building the
station's service module _ the crucial segment which will be the
crew's living quarters.
	   Kiselyov said the government has not paid 1.3 billion rubles
(dlrs 211 million) to make the module ready for launching.
	   Last month, representatives of all 16 countries involved in the
new station decided to push the launch of the first part of the
station back from June to November because of Russia's money
problems.
	   The first part, a cargo module built by Khrunichev under
contract with Boeing, has been completed and taken to the Baikonur
cosmodrome in the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan in
preparation for launching in November.
	   NASA is to follow Dec. 3 with the second part, a connecting
passageway.
	   The service module, financed by the Russian government, was
scheduled to follow in December, but its launch has been postponed
until next April.
	   The station's segments will be assembled in orbit and, if
everything goes as planned, the first American-led crew is expected
to board the station in July 1999, more than a year later than
originally planned.
	   The dlrs 21 billion space station is a joint project of Russia,
the United States, the European Space Agency, Canada and Japan.
	   When asked whether the fund shortage might cause new delays,
Kiselyov was cautious, saying the crew module has been virtually
completed but it must still undergo tests.
	   ``It will become clear in about three months after the tests are
completed,'' he said at a news conference.
	   Kiselyov reiterated that Russia will discard its Mir space
station in the fall of 1999 after the new international space
station is in orbit. He said that NASA had been able to gain
``invaluable'' experience by putting seven astronauts on Mir.
	   The U.S. space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to undock later on
Monday from the Russian space station, bringing home the last
American to live on Mir, Andrew Thomas.

Cambodian leader visits king amid election dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS details on king's response in 5th and 6th

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen headed
Monday for the northwestern province of Siem Reap early Monday for
a meeting with King Norodom Sihanouk amid a dispute that could hurt
the credibility of upcoming elections.
	   A Hun Sen adviser, Prak Sokhon, said he didn't know the purpose
of the talks. However, the topic was expected to be the deadlock in
Cambodia's highest legal appeals body, the Constitutional Council,
charged with resolving election problems.
	   The inaugural meeting of the nine-member council was stalled for
the second time last week when the king's three appointees did not
show. They appear to be protesting that the other six members of
the supposedly neutral panel are strong Hun Sen supporters.
	   In a faxed weekend statement, the king strongly denied ``any
ill-intentioned allegations'' that he was behind their boycott.
	   Sihanouk's denial came after Hun Sen told his Cabinet that if
the deadlock continued it would appear that the king was behind the
boycott.
	   A furious Sihanouk threatened to pack up to leave Cambodia, but
was asked by Hun Sen's Cabinet to stay, said an aide to the king
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Hun Sen ousted the king's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, as his
co-prime minister in a bloody coup 11 months ago. Hun Sen has
sought new elections to win back aid and legitimacy lost after the
takeover.
	   The council, charged with determining the constitutionality of
all laws, would be called on to resolve disputes arising from
controversial electoral and political party regulations.
	   The former chairman of the Supreme Court, Chan Sok, who also
sits on the body, has warned that further deadlock could call into
question the credibility of elections, scheduled July 26.
	   Sihanouk, the country's constitutional monarch, resides at a
palace in Siem Reap, near the ancient Angkor temple complex.

Myanmar opposition activists sentenced to 14 years

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two pro-democracy activists have been
sentenced by Myanmar's military regime to 14 years' imprisonment
for distributing a letter from a rebel army.
	   The pair were handing out copies of the letter, which was
addressed to Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the head of military
intelligence, during a meeting in late March at the home of Nobel
Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   Sources in Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy said a court
had passed sentence on the pair last Monday. The letter was from
the Shan State Army, a rebel group of the ethnic Shan minority. Its
contents have not been released.
	   An official newspaper in April indicated that the government was
unhappy with Aung Thein and Ko Hla Myint, members of Suu Kyi's
party, for distributing the letter.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar topped 140 yen for the first time
in seven years in Tokyo trading on Monday as investors soured
further on Japan's torpid economy. Tokyo stocks slipped in
lackluster trading.
	   The dollar bought 140.56 yen at late afternoon, up 1.14 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and its highest point since June 20, 1991. In
New York, the dollar settled at 139.75 yen on Friday.
	   The U.S. currency soared past the benchmark 140-yen level as
investors sold their yen for dollars to invest in a U.S. economy
that shows no signs of slowing down. On Friday, the Labor
Department said the U.S. jobless rate held at a 28-year-low of 4.3
percent in May.
	   The yen, meanwhile, looks less and less attractive to investors
as Japan's economy teeters on the brink of outright recession.
Investment returns are miserable with stock and property prices
mired in an eight-year slump.
	   Japanese officials including Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga
warned yet again about the dollar's ``excessive'' strength and
threatened ``decisive measures'' to reverse its rise. But traders
said that until the government shows itself willing to back the
comments up with intervention in currency markets, the yen will
keep on falling.
	   ``All those remarks are basically a repetition of what they've
been saying. Words alone can't stem the current trend,'' said
Ryuichi Takami, a senior trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   Also supporting the U.S. currency was the diminishing likelihood
finance officials from the Group of Seven top industrialized
nations will make a strong statement against the dollar when they
meet in Paris on Tuesday, traders said.
	   The dollar traded as high as 140.73 yen and as low as 139.89 yen
during the day.
	   Tokyo stocks followed the yen lower as investors dumped Japanese
stocks to shift funds into better-performing U.S. and European
assets.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
slipped 28.72 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 15,294.71. On
Friday, the average lost 103.04 points, or 0.67 percent.
	   Investors ``are focusing on the currency, and the potential
reactions to the currency,'' said Geoffrey Bennett, a senior
salesman at the Tokyo office if ING Barings Securities.
	   A weaker yen also spooks foreign investors by driving down the
dollar value of Japanese stocks and bonds.
	   Trading was sparse, with an estimated 251 million shares trading
on the first section, down from 291 million of Friday. Declining
issues outnumbered gainers 3-to-2.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section fell 3.58 points, or 0.30 percent, to 1,198.36. The TOPIX
closed down 5.56 points, or 0.46 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.145 percent from Friday's 1.165 percent,
driving its price up to 112.46 yen from 112.31 yen on Friday.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In a corruption probe of past
government officials, prosecutors obtained a court-issued arrest
warrant Monday for an ex-telecommunications minister charged with
bribery.
	   Lee Suk-chae, who served as information and telecommunications
minister under the previous government of President Kim Young-sam,
was accused of receiving dlrs 20,000 in bribes from local companies
trying to win government licences for lucrative cellular phone
projects.
	   If convicted, Lee could face a prison term of up to five years.
	   Lee has ignored prosecutors' repeated calls to return home from
Hawaii to face investigationsend prosecutors' . Prosecutors said
they will subpoena Lee through the U.S. Justice Department.
	   The United States and South Korea have no extradition treaty.
	   Prosecutors declined to comment, but local media reported that
officials of LG Telecom and Hansol PCS also will be indicted on
charges of giving bribes to Lee and other government officials.

Alleged Bosnian Croat paramilitary chief goes on U.N. trial

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An alleged Bosnian Croat
paramilitary leader charged with allowing a subordinate to rape a
prisoner went on trial Monday before the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal.
	   Anto Furundzija, 28, was arrested in December by Dutch troops in
the central Bosnian town of Vitez. He has pleaded innocent to two
war crimes charges alleging that he stood by and watched as a
prisoner under interrogation was raped by one of his troops in May
1993.
	   Rape has been considered a war crime in other cases before the
U.N. court, but Furundzija's trial is the first to deal
specifically with sexual assault inflicted during the course of an
interrogation.
	   Although Furundzija is a relatively minor figure from the 3
1/2-year Bosnian conflict, tribunal prosecutors are keen to
establish case law involving sexual assault as a war crime.
	   He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted.
	   The alleged rapist, whose identity has not been released, has
not been arrested.
	   Furundzija allegedly commanded a paramilitary group called The
Jokers, which took part in a campaign by Bosnian Croat forces loyal
to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to drive Muslims out of the
central Bosnian Lasva River Valley in 1993.
	   After opening the case, presiding judge Florence Mumba of Zambia
immediately called a closed session to discuss a prosecution
motion.
	   Before the trial began, the court publicized a stinging rebuke
by judges of prosecutors in the case, accusing them of ``a
consistent pattern of noncompliance with the orders of the trial
chamber.''
	   Listing six occasions that the prosecution had failed to comply
with court orders, the three-judge panel charged the prosecution of
``conduct close to negligence.''
	   The judges sent their written complaints to Chief Prosecutor
Louise Arbour ``to be dealt with as she sees fit.''
	   Furundzija's trial, the tribunal's sixth, could be one of its
shortest to date. Prosecutor Patricia Viseur-Sellers said she only
planned to call five or six witnesses. Other cases have dragged on
for months and heard evidence from dozens of witnesses.
	   Set up in 1993 to prosecute atrocities committed during
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, the war crimes tribunal has
indicted 60 suspects and has 27 in custody.
	   Its most wanted suspects, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, remain
free.

Roche withdraws heart drug Posicor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche
announced Monday it is withdrawing the drug Posicor, prescribed for
high blood pressure and chronic angina pain.
	   The voluntary withdrawal is ``based on evolving information
concerning the potential for drug interactions, some of them
serious, which may occur when Posicor is taken together with some
other medications,'' Roche said in a statement.
	   It advised patients to consult their doctors about ``appropriate
alternative therapy'' and not simply to discontinue treatment with
the drug. Roche also warned patients against adding any new
medication to their present treatment without advice.
	   The decision followed analysis of the preliminary results of a
three-year study of the drug in congestive heart failure, the
company said.
	   In December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned
doctors not to prescribe the drug for patients with low heart rates
or who are taking certain cholesterol-lowering drugs.
	   The warnings were prompted by reports that seven patients
suffered drug-associated muscle injury as the result of taking
Posicor together with the cholesterol-lowering medication
simvastatin.
	   ``In principle, drug interactions can be addressed by
appropriate labeling,'' Roche said. But in this case, ``the
complexity of such a prescribing information would make it too
difficult to implement.''
	   Known also as mibefradil, the drug was first launched in
mid-1997 and is available in 38 countries.

Controversial war criminal film tops box office in Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A movie that depicts Japan's top war criminal as a
hero was the leading domestic film at Japanese box offices in the
first six months of the year, the movie's producer said Monday.
	   The film ``Pride'' is about World War II leader Gen. Hideki
Tojo. It was released last month and immediately provoked an outcry
from neighboring countries which were occupied by Japanese troops,
such as China.
	   ``All of the debate about it has helped boost its popularity at
the box office,'' said Toei Co. spokeswoman Chika Inamoto.
	   As Japan's prime minister from 1941 to 1944, Tojo authorized the
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. He was found guilty of war crimes
after Japan's 1945 surrender and was hanged.
	   Toei declined to provide sales figures, but said ``Pride'' was
the top-grossing Japanese-made movie in the January-June period and
is on track to become the year's biggest domestic hit.
	   The film has made roughly 200 million yen (dlrs 1.43 million) in
Japan's five biggest cities, according to industry estimates. That
is well behind the 8.5 billion yen (dlrs 61 million) earned in the
same cities by Hollywood blockbuster ``Titanic'' since its release
late last year.
	   ``Pride'' cost 1.5 billion (dlrs 11 million) to make, three
times Toei's usual budget.
	   The film portrays Tojo as a peaceful man who went to war in
self-defense and to liberate Asia from Western colonialism _ a
popular view among Japanese who defend the country's wartime role.
	   The audience for the film consists largely of middle-aged males,
but also includes many 20-year-olds, the Toei spokeswoman said.
	   Toei hopes to release ``Pride'' overseas, but does not have a
set schedule yet for overseas distribution, she said.

	   HONG KONG (A) - Share prices in Hong Kong closed generally mixed
in light trading Monday.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 17.16 points, or 0.2 percent, to 8,586.63. On Friday, the
index gained 11.04 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 4.55 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
583 million), compared with Friday's 3.48 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 445 million).
	   Brokers said share prices fell in the morning despite sharp
gains on Wall Street on Friday because market sentiment was
dampened by the weakness of the Japanese currency.
	   The yen, which breached the level of 140 to the U.S. dollar,
triggered a rise in Hong Kong's interbank market rates, as banks
feared more regional uncertainty.
	   Selective bargain-hunting late in the session sent the index
into positive territory, brokers said.
	   Among gainers, HSBC Holdings rose 4.00 Hong Kong dollars to
190.50, Hang Seng Bank rose 1.00 dollar to 51.75, and Hong Kong
Telecom rose 15 cents to 13.80.
	   Among losers, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 70 cents to 34.00,
Cheung Kong fell 50 cents to 38.20, and Hutchison Whampoa fell 20
cents to 37.80.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Labor officials called an emergency
meeting Monday to try to resolve a strike by more than 600 pilots
at Philippine Airlines which has plunged the financially troubled
flag-carrier into crisis.
	   PAL fired all the striking pilots on Sunday, calling their
action illegal, except for a few who had complied with an airline
order to return to work to avoid dismissal.
	   Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano said the Philippine
government is intervening in the dispute because it affects the
national interest. Representatives of PAL's management and the
620-strong Airline Pilots Association of the Philippines were
summoned to the meeting.
	   Trajano said he ordered the strikers to return to work and the
airline to accept them back. He also urged both sides to refrain
from further hostile actions.
	   The union is protesting a new management policy of firing pilots
who have reached 20 years of service or flown 20,000 hours,
regardless of age. The policy puts about 200 pilots in danger of
forced retirement, the union said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the world jumped more
than tenfold in the first 20 days of May as a failing domestic
economy slashed demand for foreign products, the Finance Ministry
said Monday.
	   Japan's merchandise trade surplus _ the amount of goods the
country exports minus its imports _ soared to 360.9 billion yen
(dlrs 2.6 billion) from 34.9 billion yen (dlrs 250 million) during
the same period last year, the ministry said.
	   Imports dropped by 14.3 percent to 1.9 trillion yen (dlrs 13.6
billion) amid dwindling demand for raw materials like oil and wood.
The ministry said such sharp declines are unlikely to continue.
	   Exports remained a robust 2.3 trillion yen (dlrs 16 billion), up
0.3 percent, as strong overseas sales of cars and photographic film
offset a drop in demand for computer chips and electronics.
	   Measured on a monthly basis, Japan's surplus has risen for the
last 13 months, as a weakening yen made the country's exports
cheaper in key markets like the United States and a moribund
domestic economy eroded imports.
	   In the most recent monthly figure, Japan posted a 1.2 trillion
yen surplus in April.
	   ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The chairman of one of Singapore's biggest
banks warned of a recession next year if the government does not
take action now to stimulate the economy, a newspaper reported
Monday.
	   Wee Cho Yaw, chairman of United Overseas Bank, told The Straits
Times that the current economic situation in the small island
republic was the worst he had seen in his 40-year banking career.
	   The Singapore government has stood staunchly by earlier
predictions that the economy would grow at least 2.5 percent this
year.
	   But the forecast was made before the economic turmoil in
neighboring Indonesia worsened and other regional economies began
to exhibit signs of a slowdown into zero growth or outright
recession.
	   At least two private investment houses have already predicted
that the Singapore economy will fall into recession this year,
though a recent newspaper survey of 15 analysts and economists
showed an average forecast of 1.5 percent growth.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Bankrupt Hanbo Steel Industry Co.,
South Korea's second largest steel maker, will be sold to foreign
investors later this year, its creditor banks said Monday.
	   The decision came after potential domestic investors, including
state-run Pohang Iron and Steel Corp., the nation's No. 1 steel
maker, gave up plans to take over the failed steel producer.
	   Hanbo, which once produced 3 million tons of steel a year,
borrowed heavily from banks to finance its aggressive expansion
programs. But sales lagged early last year amid an overall economic
slowdown, producing a cash crunch.
	   In mid-1997, Pohang offered 2 trillion won (dlrs 1.4 billion)
for key facilities of Hanbo, excluding its debts. Creditor banks
rejected the offer, saying the price was too low.
	   On Monday, creditors said they will soon select a lead manager
for the planned sell-off of Hanbo and complete takeover
negotiations before the end of this year.
	   So far, about nine foreign steel companies, including USX Corp.
of the United States, have shown interest in Hanbo, they said.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Mortgage loans by China's commercial banks rose

apartment purchases, the China Securities News reported Monday.
	   Housing loans by the four state-owned commercial banks rose 0.3
percent or 834 million yuan (dlrs 100.97 million) to 264.3 billion
(dlrs 32 billion) in the first three months over the same period
last year, the report said.
	   Of the total, loans to individuals amounted to 33.7 billion
(dlrs 4.08 billion), it said.
	   China's four state-owned commercial banks _ the Industrial &AMP;
Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank
of China and the China Construction Bank _ are intended to be at
the vanguard of reforms intended to build a commercially sound
banking system.
	   To boost flagging economic activity and fend off the economic
doldrums that have stricken much of Asia, the government has
declared the housing industry a key area of growth.
	   Earlier this year, the People's Bank of China, the central bank,
said banks can allocate up to 15 percent of their loan portfolios
to mortgages. The central bank has also raised ceilings for housing
debt so banks could accommodate more mortgage lending.

	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ South Australian wines are well
placed to increase their share of the lucrative Japanese market,
state Premier John Olsen said Monday.
	   Speaking from Japan after visiting the South Australian Wine
Week exhibition in Okayama, Olsen said while local wines were
competing with those from France and Germany, South Australia had
lifted its exports of premium varieties.
	   ``Japan is Australia's largest export market in Asia with South
Australian wine accounting for more than two-thirds of national
exports,'' the premier said.
	   ``While the market in Japan is small, sales have grown
dramatically and we intend to capitalize on that.
	   ``More Japanese people are drinking dry red wine, with a volume
increase of 218 percent over the last year.''
	   Olsen was in Japan for a three-day business mission promoting
aquaculture, wine, tourism and education.

Angry clashes as Jewish settlers move into Arab neighborhood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes, attorney general to look into
ownership, other details &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers moved into three buildings in
Arab east Jerusalem before dawn Monday, stringing barbed wire,
hanging Israeli flags and setting off angry stone-throwing clashes
with Palestinian neighbors.
	   It was the latest in a series of escalating confrontations in
Jerusalem's eastern sector as both sides accuse the other of trying
to grab land in the bitterly contested city.
	   At least two people were injured in Monday's clashes in the
Silwan neighborhood, including the top Palestinian official in
Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini. He was hit in the head with a stone and
slightly hurt before police and soldiers broke up the melee.
	   ``I see things getting worse,'' said Husseini, who has called
for massive Palestinian protests to block Jewish settlement
activity. ``This provocation is pushing the situation to the edge
of disaster.''
	   Adding to the volatile mix, about 20 activists from the Peace
Now group turned out at the site to protest the settlers' arrival.
Police roughly dragged them away after they refused to disperse.
	   The 15 settlers were from the Elad group, which claims it
purchased the homes legally. Settler leader Yehuda Mali said Jews
had a biblical claim to the area, overlooking the Kidron Valley
just outside the Old City walls.
	   ``It was the home of King David, here he wrote the Psalms, and
here Jews are not allowed to live?'' he said.
	   Police and soldiers tried to keep the two sides apart, but
repeated shoving and shouting matches broke out. In one skirmish,
settlers kicked Arabs who tried to block them from entering one of
the buildings.
	   ``I will surrender my life before I surrender my house!''
shouted Fatima Karaeen, 62, who said she has papers showing one of
the houses belongs to her Arab family. ``The cowards!''
	   Her lawyer said he was meeting with Israel's attorney general
later Monday to present the family's ownership claim.
	   The makeup of Jerusalem's neighborhoods is an explosive issue,
with Palestinians trying to block what they say are illegal
encroachments by Jewish settlers. Both sides are constantly
jockeying for position pending negotiations on the city's final
status.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
the 1967 Mideast War, as capital of a future state. Israel insists
the city must remain undivided under Israeli sovereignty.
	   Settlers have been stepping up activity in recent weeks. Last
month, clashes broke out after the settler group Ataret Cohanim set
up sheds near the Old City's Herod's Gate.
	   Those sheds were dismantled, but the settlers were allowed to
stay on as guards and volunteers in an archeological dig that got
under way on Monday.
	   The latest confrontation comes at a delicate moment in efforts
to restart the stalled peace process. Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been under American pressure to accept
a U.S.-authored troop withdrawal plan, said Sunday no accord was
imminent.
	   ``I don't work according to a stopwatch,'' Netanyahu told
reporters after meeting with his Cabinet.
	   Israel's army radio, citing sources close to the prime minister,
said the American plan will likely be brought to the Cabinet for a
vote before the end of the week.
	   The radio reported that Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh,
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and U.S. Ambassador Edward
Walker met Sunday to discuss the proposal.

EU Foreign Ministers debate investment ban, assets freeze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The EU may ban investments in Serbia and
freeze the country's assets abroad on Monday, tightening sanctions
that have so far failed to get Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to reach a negotiated settlement in Kosovo.
	   The foreign ministers of the 15 European Union nations discussed
these measures to punish Milosevic for cracking down on his
independence-minded southern province and prevent another Bosnia.
	   They have already banned arms exports and restricted travel
visas for Yugoslav officials.
	   However _ at Washington's urging _ they have held off on
freezing Yugoslav assets abroad and the investment ban to give
Milosevic a chance to reach a peaceful settlement in Kosovo.
	   That has not worked and the escalating violence in Kosovo of
late has drawn parallels with West European waffling in 1991 and
1992 as Bosnia sank into civil war.
	   EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek said it was
more critical at this stage that the NATO ``defense ministers
accelerate their work.''
	   On Thursday and Friday, those defense ministers meet in Brussels
to consider a military response to Milosevic though in recent weeks
that option has sparked little enthusiasm.
	   And in London, on Friday, the foreign ministers of the G-8
nations _ United States, Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and
Russia _ meet to discuss Kosovo.
	   Russia's involvement in any debate about sanctions or an allied
intervention of whatever kind is seen as crucial.
	   ``It gives us an opportunity to have dialogue with Russia and
for the Russian foreign minister to clearly understand the strength
of feeling in the rest of the international community,'' British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said before coming here.
	   He said the EU expects Russia to ``be putting pressure on
Belgrade to understand both the strength of feeling condemning what
they have done and the growing consensus for action preventing it
from happening again.''
	   Cook, chairman of the EU meeting, said an investment ban would
``make clear how much we condemn the use of full army weaponry
against the civilian population'' in Kosovo.
	   In Kosovo, ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the 2.2
million-strong population. Most demand to secede from Serbia, which
along with Montenegro makes up Yugoslavia. Western powers oppose
any change of borders, but want the Serbs to cease their offensive
and return to Kosovo the autonomy the region enjoyed within Serbia
until 1989.
	   NATO military planners have been drafting contingency plans,
including the holding of joint maneuvers in Albania and Macedonia
and help for these countries to seal their borders. The plans
include _ as a last resort _ the dispatch of as many as 20,000
allied troops to the region.

Air France pilots' strike enters second week
</HEADLINE>

unacceptable, Labor Minister saying talks could continue until last

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Striking Air France pilots have offered to work for
free to fly foreign fans to the World Cup, but their walkout showed
no sign of ending Monday as it entered its second week.
	   The unexpected gesture came as the conflict appeared to harden
Sunday night, with Air France management expressing exasperation
with the pilots who walked off the job June 1.
	   No new talks were in sight, and Air France said the strike
already had cost 1 billion francs (dlrs 166 million).
	   France's flagship carrier says it will take three days for
service to return to normal once the strike ends, meaning the
walkout was sure to disrupt the World Cup, which begins Wednesday.
	   Christian Paris, spokesman for the SNPL, the main pilots' union,
proposed that Air France organize special flights for foreign World
Cup ticket holders and said the pilots would work without pay so
the fans would not miss the soccer championship.
	   Air France said it would study the measure.
	   But Bernard Stasi, a government mediator in the talks, said the
offer was ``unacceptable.''
	   ``This is a party which France is offering for the world.
Anything that might spoil the party would be a crime by France,''
he added in an interview with Europe-1 radio network on Monday.
	   Despite the goodwill gesture, the conflict was deadlocked Sunday
night.
	   Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the director general of Air France, said
the airline had ``exhausted its capacity of understanding with
regard to the pilots.''
	   Meanwhile, the company sought to contain the strike by meeting
with 19 unions representing other airline workers who feel left out
of salary talks between Air France and the pilots.
	   Both sides are under pressure to end the strike from the
government, which has offered to intervene but has not put forward
concrete proposals.
	   Labor Minister Martine Aubry said the negotiations could go down
to the wire.
	   ``I believe in negotiation. Even if there are just a few minutes
left to talk, I'm convinced an agreement can be reached,'' she said
in an interview with France 3 television channel.
	   Rene Monory, president of the French Senate, said Sunday the
pilots were giving the country a ``lamentable image.''
	   Talks between Air France and the pilots were suspended Saturday
after the pilots walked out of negotiations.
	   The strike has inconvenienced thousands, including foreigners
fleeing fighting in Eritrea.
	   The pilots are protesting planned pay cuts of 500 million francs
(dlrs 83 million) Air France says are needed to modernize the
company.
	   Obstacles to an agreement are proposed salary reductions and a
plan to give pilots stock in exchange for the pay cut, as well as a
two-tier pay scale in which younger pilots earn less.
	   Only about 25 percent of Air France's flights were expected to
take off Monday.
	   Trains were expected to run on schedule Monday after strikes
disrupted service this weekend. Trains conductors have threatened a
walkout Wednesday.
	   Taxi drivers in Paris planned demonstrations Monday to protest
the recent killing of a taxi driver.

Seoul subway threatens to go on strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Seoul's subway union theatened on
Monday to send its 9,000 members out on strike this week to press
for pay hikes and better working conditions.
	   The union said the indefinite strike will begin Wednesday unless
management accepts its demands for a 7.8 percent pay hike and a
reduction in work hours from the present 42 to 40 a week.
	   Management has rejected the demands, saying that the subway
keeps losing money.
	   Management asked the government's labor arbitration committee to
intervene but the union said it would not honor the committee's
role. In past labor disputes, the union rejected the committee as
pro-management.
	   Both sides said they would meet again Tuesday to try to avert
the strike.

Paul McCartney wants memorial service for late wife to be

celebration &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Memorial service starts at 1930 GMT. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul McCartney says he wants a public memorial
service for his late wife Linda to be a celebration that will
underscore her passions: animals, vegetarianism, music, photography
and her family.
	   Former Beatles George Harrison and Ringo Starr were invited to
attend the memorial service today at the historic St.
Martin-in-the-Fields church overlooking Trafalgar Square.
	   McCartney's office said Harrison and Starr were invited to be
part of a congregation that will sing the Beatles hit, ``Let it
Be,'' but that there were no plans for the three former Beatles to
sing together. John Lennon, the fourth Beatle, was shot to death in
New York City in 1980.
	   Mrs. McCartney, a crusader for vegetarianism and animal rights
and an acclaimed photographer, died from breast cancer on April 17.
She was 56.
	   McCartney will be accompanied by their children, Heather, 36,
his wife's daughter by her first marriage, and Mary, 27, Stella,
26, and James, 21.
	   Attendance will be by invitation only and will reflect Linda's
lifelong love of music, family, animals, vegetarianism and
photography.
	   Hundreds of animal activists are expected to join fans outside
the church for a candlelight vigil.
	   Writer Carla Lane, a longtime family friend, said she will
represent them inside.
	   ``I will be reading a message to Linda from the people in the
square,'' she said. ``I believe there will be a brief mourning and
then a celebration of Linda's life. Paul does not want it to be a
morbid affair.''

Slovaks start up controversial nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Despite hefty protest from
anti-nuclear campaigners, Slovakia on Monday started up its
controversial nuclear power plant at Mochovce.
	   The plant is just 120 kilometers (72 miles) east of Austria,
which has campaigned strongly against its activation, arguing that
certain features of the heavy water pressure reactor make it
unsafe. Austria is the only country in the world to have built a
nuclear power plant, then voted in 1978 by referendum against
putting it online or having nuclear power.
	   Mochovce is a 440 MW Soviet-designed plant subsequently equipped
with Western technology.
	   Plant spokesman Rastislav Petrech said it received a go-ahead
from the Slovak nuclear authority on Sunday to activate its nuclear
fuel rods, as the authority deemed the plant ``met all the safety
and technical conditions.''
	   Last month, a team of 22 international experts inspected the
plant and noted safety changes made at the station, but also
complained that the company operating it had failed to release
necessary documents.
	   Wolfgang Kromp, the Austrian head of that international team,
told the Austria Press Agency Monday he regretted that Slovakia had
gone ahead at Mohovce, but emphasized ''there is currently no
risk'' involved.
	   Austria is worried that a Chernobyl-type disaster at Mochovce _
or other nuclear plants in neighboring Slovakia and the Czech
Republic _ would have affect hundreds of thousands of its citizens.
	   Austria is particularly worried that the Czech-produced pressure
vessel made of special steel is safe for only the first five years,
and that nuclear reaction will weaken its quality.
	   Slovak officials angrily dismiss all the Austrian criticism.
	   ``Our plant is perfectly safe. We wouldn't be jepardizing the
lives of our families, would we?'' Petrech told The Associated
Press. ``The Austrians could never say of any nuclear power plant
that it was safe.''
	   According to a press statement, fuel will be fully activated and
the the plant's No. 1 reactor become critical this month.
	   ``Which means Slovakia will have another reliable, effective and
ecologically clean source of electric energy for another 30
years,'' the press release quoted Tibor Mikus, the director of
Slovakia's electricity company, as saying.

Villagers in Caucasus hold bus to avenge alleged abduction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Angry villagers in Russia's southern republic of
North Ossetia on Monday detained dozens of passengers from a bus
after the alleged kidnapping of several neighbors, officials said.
	   People from the village of Zamankul in North Ossetia detained
two buses with some 40 residents of the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia, but later let one vehicle go, Ossetian officials said.
	   Ossetian officials said the villagers' action came after the
abduction of seven Zamankul residents on Sunday was blamed on
Ingushs. The seven villagers were still missing Monday, officials
said.
	   Lev Zugayev, a spokesman for North Ossetian leader Alexander
Dzasokhov, said officials were holding talks with villagers to
persuade them to release the bus passengers.
	   North Ossetia, a republic of about 500,000 people in the North
Caucasus, is near the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
	   Predominantly Orthodox Christian, it has maintained warmer
relations with Moscow than other places in the region and served as
a base for the Kremlin's 1994-96 campaign against Chechen
separatists.
	   North Ossetia and neighboring Muslim Ingushetia fought a short
but bloody war in 1992. Hundreds of people were killed and most
ethnic Ingush were expelled from North Ossetia.
	   Both sides have blamed each other for numerous kidnapping
incidents.

Russian Communists to request impeachment discussions in
</HEADLINE>
parliament &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament's Communist faction will file a formal
petition on Tuesday to put an impeachment motion against President
Boris Yeltsin on the legislature's agenda, a leading Communist said
Monday.
	   The Communist Party's No. 2 man, Valentin Kuptsov, said his
faction will ask members of the agenda-setting Duma Council on
Tuesday to schedule discussions of an impeachment motion before
June 19, when parliament goes on a week-long break, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   If the motion is put on the agenda, the next step would be to
set up a committee to study the proposal. The Russian Constitution
puts no time limit on how long the commission may take to review
the proposal, and it's likely to be months before the motion goes
for a second discussion in parliament.
	   Only 150 signatures are required to put an impeachment motion on
the Duma agenda, but 300 votes are needed to actually initiate the
proceedings.
	   Impeachment proceedings are long and complex, and even if the
motion is approved by the Duma, it would still need to clear
several legal hurdles to become effective.
	   Supporters of the motion _ the Communist, Agrarian and People's
Power factions _ have said they have collected 212 signatures, but
have postponed requesting that the motion be put on the agenda,
claiming they were still collecting signatures.
	   Together, the three factions have 210 members in the 450-seat
State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
	   Several previous impeachment drives have fizzled, in part
because Russia's Constitution gives the president the upper hand in
confrontations with parliament.
	   Communists and their allies launched the latest impeachment
campaign last month. They have accused Yeltsin of a range of
transgressions, including instigating the Soviet collapse,
launching the botched war in Chechnya and ruining the country's
economy.
	   Their frustrations intensified in April during a long test of
wills with Yeltsin, who threatened to disband the legislature
unless lawmakers approved his candidate for prime minister.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with closing price of Aussie dollar on local market &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian dollar plunged further
toward 12-year record lows Monday despite attempts by the Reserve
Bank of Australia to halt its slide.
	   ``The Australian dollar will remain under pressure until
something fundamental changes in Asia,'' Commonwealth Bank senior
manager foreign exchange Kurt Magnus said.
	   At the end of local trade Monday, the currency was 59.68 U.S.
cents, a level not seen since 1986.
	   New Zealand's dollar is also on its knees, down to 50.88 U.S.
cents.
	   Since ratings agency Moody's said Friday it was reviewing New
Zealand's AA1 sovereign credit rating for a possible downgrade, the
Kiwi dollar has fallen more than one U.S. cent to a six-year low.
	   Dealers said the central bank intervened in the market as
recently as Monday morning to attempt to prop up the ailing
currency by buying Aussie dollars.
	   ``We've got it on good authority that the RBA's been in to
smooth and test the currency and take some heat out of the
market,'' Macquarie Bank foreign exchange associate director Brent
Aggar said.
	   The RBA has already spent about U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion (3 billion
Australian dollars) in a largely futile attempt to prop up the
currency.
	   The Australian dollar's record low of 57.10 U.S. cents was
struck in July 1986 after then-Treasurer Paul Keating's infamous
comments that the Australian economy was nearly that of a ``banana
republic.''

Singapore stock market and currency down on yen's fall, bad news
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 1-2 with market close; MOVES UP reference to
deputy PM speech; ADDS other recession predictions in last graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's stocks and currency plunged further
Monday on news of the republic's first major property development
default and the persistent weakness of the Japanese yen and other
regional currencies.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index closed 3.4 percent
down, about 40 points off its 1168.46 opening. It dropped to a low
of 1127.33 and recovered only slightly, setting the stage for a
third straight week of dropping indexes.
	   Dealers said they were awaiting comments by Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong, also the chairman of Singapore's de facto
central bank, who planned a speech to bankers after the markets
closed.
	   The Singapore dollar was also sharply lower, breaking the
psychologically important 1.70 level against the U.S. currency. The
U.S. dollar broke above the benchmark 140 yen level as the market
opened in Tokyo, and the Singapore dollar followed suit.
	   News that a Singapore-Hong Kong joint venture missed a deadline
for a 68.6 million Singapore dollar (dlrs 40 million) payment on a
plot of land to develop condominiums also dampened sentiment.
	   The company, a joint venture between Singapore's Eltech
Electronics and Hong Kong's Lai Sun Development, missed the last
deadline Friday to pay the remaining 75 percent of the bid it made
last July.
	   Mounting fears that Singapore could head into a recession this
year are also depressing the stock market, according to dealers.
	   The chairman of United Overseas Bank, Wee Cho Yaw, warned in a
newspaper interview published Monday that the Singapore economy may
slip into a recession next year if the government does not take
immediate steps.
	   Several foreign investment houses have made the recession
forecast, but the government has said it would not change its
prediction of at least 2.5 percent growth until May's results are
available.

 &UR; JAMAICA: Group of 43 Haitians lands near hotel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A group of 43 Haitians trying to reach
Miami landed instead on a beach in one of Jamaica's northern resort
areas, police reported Sunday.
	   The group of 36 men, 6 women and a 7-month-old baby had been at
sea for nine days on a 30-foot sailboat and had gone six days
without food, authorities said. Staff at the Golden Seas Beach
Hotel in Oracabessa, a town on the north coast, found the Haitians
after they landed Saturday morning.
	   Hotel officials said the migrants were hungry but in good
health. The Haitians told police they had left from Port-au-Prince,
the Haitian capital, on May 29 but had run out of food three days
later.
	   Bad weather blew them off course, they said.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: President to present drug-control plan to
United Nations
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Dominican President
Leonel Fernandez left Sunday for a United Nations meeting in which
he will present a regional drug-control proposal for the western
Caribbean.
	   He will present the plan Monday at a meeting of the
organization's General Assembly in New York City.
	   Drug experts say cocaine smuggling through the Dominican
Republic and adjacent Haiti has increased recently, and U.S.
officials have estimated that 25 percent of the cocaine reaching
the United States comes by way of Puerto Rico and the Dominican
Republic.
	   A United Nations report released Friday claimed money laundering
in the country has tripled in the last three years, with most of
the money finding its way into real estate, car sales and shipping
deals.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Prison escapee killed in shootout
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A man who escaped from prison in March
and held a place on Jamaica's list of most wanted criminals was
killed during a shootout with police, authorities reported Sunday.
	   Sheldon Macintosh, 19, was found injured next to a 9mm
semi-automatic pistol after the shootout Friday, police said. He
was carrying another .38-caliber pistol.
	   Macintosh died on the way to a Kingston hospital, they reported.
	   Police said they were patrolling crime-plagued West Kingston
when they were fired upon by unidentified gunmen. They fired back,
injuring Macintosh.
	   Macintosh was one of 23 inmates who escaped from the Remand
Center jail in March. He was awaiting trial on two counts of
murder.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Island to get third telephone system
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Joining a rush of U.S. telephone
companies to Puerto Rico, New Jersey-based KMC Telecom Inc. says it
will begin construction within two months on the island's third
local telephone network.
	   KMC Vice Chairman Gary Lasher was quoted by weekly newspaper
Caribbean Business as saying the first lines would probably be laid
in the San Juan metropolitan area, where 40 percent of the U.S.
territory's population lives.
	   Eventually the network will cover the entire island and offer
intra-island long distance, off-island long distance service and
Internet service, Lasher said.

14 arrested for beatings at factory that killed 1, injured 6
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Workers suspected of stealing three computer hard
disks at a Shenzhen electronics plant were beaten so severely that
one died and six others were seriously injured, state-run media
reported Monday.
	   Managers and guards at the Yida Electronics Co. plant tortured
the workers almost all day on May 20, beating them with iron and
wooden bars, flashlights and their fists, the China Daily reported.
	   Fourteen people, including Sun Shiqiang of Hong Kong, the
factory boss, and guards and managers of the company were arrested
and put before the public at a rally on June 3 in Shenzhen, the
Workers Daily reported. Shenzhen, a booming special economic zone,
borders Hong Kong.
	   The newspaper accounts said factory managers suspected worker Li
Chaozhan of stealing the computer parts, beat him severely and
forced him to implicate others.
	   Sun threatened to kill the workers and their families if they
did not confess, and also ordered others to throw Li's body out of
a second story window to make his death look like suicide, the
Workers' Daily reported.
	   China Daily said reports of physical attacks on workers at the
Yida plant ``have not been uncommon.''
	   It quoted Zhang Qiwen, a local Communist Party official, as
saying the case showed that some business people do not understand
or do not respect the laws and cannot control their guards.

Bank says world economic prospects looking up, but advises caution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Despite the economic turmoil in Asia,
prospects for growth in the rest of the world are looking positive,
according to a central bankers report out Monday.
	   Long-running economic expansion in the United States and Britain
is set to continue, says the annual report of the Basel-based Bank
for International Settlements, known as the central banker's
central bank.
	   Serious contagion of the Asian crisis to other parts of the
world has so far been avoided and the worst may be over in Asia
itself, according to the 199-page study.
	   ``Congratulations on this generally happy state of affairs might
seem in order, yet central bankers should not be complacent,''
Alfons Verplaetse, chairman of BIS' board of directors, told the
bank's annual meeting.
	   Rekindling growth in another of the world's major economies,
Japan, ``will not be easy'' and the full impact on Europe of the
Asian crisis has still to be assessed, the report says.
	   In addition, tightening labor markets, worsening trade balances
and booming prices for financial assets show inflationary risks are
on the up.
	   ``No-one should be under any illusions as to the magnitude of
the problems still to be faced and the potential difficulties along
the way,'' the report says.
	   A ``new era'' of productivity and profit growth is discernible
in recent U.S. economic statistics, notes the study. A wave of
restructuring in Europe will lead to the same result.
	   Growth rates in most industrial countries have either remained
at high levels or are starting to build significant momentum, said
Verplaetse.
	   Preparations for the transition in Europe to the new single
currency, the Euro, have been smooth, he said. Structural reforms
and more disciplined policies have generated solid growth in Latin
America, many Eastern European countries and ``significant'' parts
of Africa.
	   Japan's banking system needs to be restructured and the economy
stimulated through permanent tax cuts.
	   Economic growth, financial deregulation and low inflation should
be accompanied by vigorous but careful market opening, the study
recommends.
	   Financial systems everywhere should be strengthened to allow
them to face up to the ``larger shocks'' likely to be created in
freer markets.

EU Foreign Ministers debate investment ban, assets freeze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The EU may ban investments in Serbia and
freeze the country's assets abroad on Monday, tightening sanctions
that have so far failed to get Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to reach a negotiated settlement in Kosovo.
	   The foreign ministers of the 15 European Union nations discussed
these measures to punish Milosevic for cracking down on his
independence-minded southern province and prevent another
Bosnia-style ethnic conflict.
	   They have already banned arms exports and restricted travel
visas for Yugoslav officials.
	   However _ at Washington's urging _ they have held off on
freezing Yugoslav assets abroad and banning investment to give
Milosevic a chance to reach a peaceful settlement in Kosovo.
	   That has not worked and the escalating violence in Kosovo of
late has drawn parallels with West European waffling in 1991 and
1992 as Bosnia sank into civil war.
	   EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek said it was
more critical at this stage that the NATO ``defense ministers
accelerate their work.''
	   On Thursday and Friday, those defense ministers meet in Brussels
to consider a military response to Milosevic. In recent weeks,
however, that option has sparked little enthusiasm.
	   And in London on Friday, the foreign ministers of the United
States, Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and Russia will meet
to discuss Kosovo.
	   Russia's involvement in any debate about sanctions or an allied
intervention of whatever kind is seen as crucial.
	   ``It gives us an opportunity to have dialogue with Russia and
for the Russian foreign minister to clearly understand the strength
of feeling in the rest of the international community,'' British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said before coming here.
	   He said the EU expects Russia to ``be putting pressure on
Belgrade to understand both the strength of feeling condemning what
they have done and the growing consensus for action preventing it
from happening again.''
	   Cook, chairman of the EU meeting, said an investment ban would
``make clear how much we condemn the use of full army weaponry
against the civilian population'' in Kosovo.
	   In Kosovo, ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the 2.2
million-strong population. Most demand to secede from Serbia, which
along with Montenegro makes up Yugoslavia. Western powers oppose
any change of borders, but want the Serbs to cease their offensive
and return to Kosovo the autonomy the region enjoyed within Serbia
until 1989.
	   NATO military planners have been drafting contingency plans,
including the holding of joint maneuvers in Albania and Macedonia
and help for these countries to seal their borders. The plans
include _ as a last resort _ the dispatch of as many as 20,000
allied troops to the region.

to give Milosevic a chance to reach a peaceful settlement in
Kosovo.
	   Sources said while the investment ban well may be imposed,
France, Italy and Greece were not keen on freezing Yugoslav assets
abroad. They said these countries hold considerable assets _ bank
accounts and properties.
	   Other possible sanctions would include a ban on all flights by
JAT, the Yugoslav airline.
	   Officials said the EU ministers would unlikely make an immediate
difference. ``The fight clearly lies within the United Nations
Security Council,'' said a Dutch official.

Lorne Welch, daredevil World War II escapee, dead at 81
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lorne Welch, a daredevil British glider who was
central to two fabled escapes by British prisoners in World War II,
has died. He was 81.
	   Welch died May 15 at his home in Farnham, southwest of London,
where he lived in retirement indulging another favorite hobby,
yachting, Cause of death was not announced.
	   A test flight observer before the war, Welch, an outstanding
pilot, became a training instructor with the Royal Air Force. But
in 1942, with Britain seeking to flatten key German cities with
1,000 bombing raids, Welch flew his Wellington trainer into combat.
	   He was shot down over Nazi-occupied Holland on his fourth raid
and sent to the Stalagluft III prison camp in Silesia.. He was
later in Colditz, the huge Saxon castle where the Germans put their
most escape-prone Allied prisoners.
	   At Stalagluft III, Welch, an aeronautical engineer, put his
technical skills to work. Using parts of two beds, two duffel bags,
nine coathooks, four ice-hockey sticks, four table tennis bats and
leather from a flying boot, he built the ventilation pump for a 100
yard (90-meter) tunnel, ``Harry.'' through which 76 prisoners
escaped in 1944.
	   It was one of the largest mass breakouts by Allied prisoners,
ended in atrocity, and was made into a movie, ``The Great Escape,''
in 1963. Seventy-three of the escapees were recaptured and 50
summarily executed.
	   Before the tunnel escape, Welch had already left. On June 16,
1943, Welch and his cellmate, Walter Morison, walked out through
the main gate wearing fake Germany uniforms. They were recaptured a
week later on their second attempt to steal a German warplane and
fly to Sweden.
	   Obvious candidates for Colditz, Welch and Morison arrived at the
castle to find what might have been World War II's most audacious
escape in preparation: the construction of a full-sized, two-man
glider in a walled-off section of the castle attic.
	   Welch checked the glider for airworthiness, but before it could
be used, U.S. forces liberated Colditz in 1945. Prisoners displayed
the glider to openmouthed guards.
	   After the war, Welch was the first person to glide twice across
the English Channel, flew in four world gilding championships, and
worked as a glider test pilot and engineer.
	   Patrick Palles Lorne Elphinstone Welch, the son of an army
general, is survived by his wife, Ann, whom he married in 1953, and
their daughter.

Philippine Airlines says strike may force it to shut down

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with airline saying it may be forced to shut down
operations because strike has scared away potential foreign buyers,
other new details throughout &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines said Monday a
crippling strike by pilots has caused potential foreign buyers of
the airline to break off talks and could force the company to shut
down.
	   In an emotional statement, PAL said the 3-day-old strike by more
than 600 pilots is ``bleeding the airline dry,'' causing daily
losses of 150 million to 200 million pesos (dlrs 3.8 million to 5.1
million) in lost revenue.
	   This has pushed the cash-strapped airline ``closer to the brink
of insolvency,'' PAL said.
	   ``With the breakdown of the talks with the foreign investors,
PAL may now have no other recourse but to shut down operations,''
it said.
	   The union is protesting a new management policy of ordering
pilots to retire who have reached 20 years of service or flown
20,000 hours, regardless of age. The policy puts about 200 pilots
in danger of forced retirement, the union said.
	   The airline earlier announced it must cut expenses by as much as
40 percent, slash flights, and sharply reduce its work force to
survive.
	   PAL said Monday it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 205 million) in
the last fiscal year _ three times more than the previous year. In
March alone it lost 1 billion pesos (dlrs 25 million), it said.
	   PAL said that in an effort to stay afloat, it has been in talks
with a number of foreign carriers who were looking to take a
``significant'' stake in the airline.
	   ``But the work stoppage by the (pilots' union) ... has caused
investors to lose interest,'' it said.
	   PAL fears the breakdown in talks may have jeopardized its final
chance to staving off financial ruin. PAL didn't name the airlines
with which it had been in talks, but industry sources said the main
potential buyer was Northwest Airlines of the United States.
	   PAL fired all the striking pilots on Sunday. Labor officials
called an emergency meeting Monday to try to resolve the strike.
Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano said he ordered the strikers to
return to work and the airline to accept them back.
	   The strike began Friday, forcing cancellations of more than 200
international and domestic flights and affecting thousands of
passengers.
	   PAL fired all 29 officers of the union on Saturday and warned
remaining members would also be dismissed if they didn't return to
work by noon Sunday. The 620 striking pilots represent the
airlines' total pilot force.
	   PAL, Asia's first airline, is controlled by Chinese Filipino
tycoon Lucio Tan. It had been completely owned by the Philippine
government from 1941 until it was partly sold in 1992.

Arms banned from protest march

	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Police warned protesters Monday not to
go armed on a two-day march by opposition parties to southeastern
Bangladesh that begins Tuesday.
	   Political demonstrations often erupt into violence in
Bangladesh, and the ``Long March'' announced by seven opposition
parties focuses on a particularly volatile issue.
	   The opposition, led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, is
protesting an accord letting 2,000 Buddhist rebels end their
two-decade-old bush war in the southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts
in exchange for greater political control over the region, rich in
timber and natural gas resources. Zia says Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina gave up too much to secure peace.
	   Some march leaders have directed their party workers to carry
licensed arms in case of attack by pro-Hasina activists. But the
police, in a statement Monday, noted the country's gun laws
prohibit the carrying of even licensed arms at political rallies.
	   The statement said carrying licensed arms ``may encourage
possessor of unauthorized arms to create chaos and disorder.''
	   The protesters plan to march 400 kilometers (250 miles) from
Dhaka to Khagrachari in the Chittagong hills. Opposition leader
Anwar Zahid said more than 2,000 vehicles carrying people from
different parts of the country would converge in Dhaka Tuesday to
start the march.
	   A senior official in the Home Ministry, which overseas law and
order, said Monday that more than 5,000 soldiers and paramilitary
troops will be deployed along the march route and in Dhaka over the
next few days. He spoke on condition of anonymity.

Impasse over Kosovo deepens at Balkan foreign ministers meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Balkan foreign ministers on Monday
sought ways to pressure Yugoslavia into discussing the deepening
crisis in Kosovo and break an impasse threatening to derail the
regional meeting.
	   ``Unfortunately, this issue continues to maintain its utmost
priority for the stability and security of our region,'' said
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
	   His remarks came at a two-day meeting of foreign ministers from
Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Romania and Yugoslavia.
Bosnia and Slovenia have sent deputy ministers.
	   The meeting is part of a broad regional initiative to improve
economic cooperation. It will set the groundwork for an annual
summit of Balkan heads of states next October.
	   But the meeting has deadlocked over Yugoslavia's refusal to
allow any reference to the secessionist Albanian-dominated province
of Kosovo, which Yugoslavia insists is an internal matter.
	   All the foreign ministers seem adamant about including a
reference to Kosovo, but they are seeking a compromise.
	   Among them might be a call for the return of more than 10,000
refugees in Albania, but one tempered by a reassurance that Balkan
leaders are against changing Yugoslavia's borders.
	   Another could be giving Belgrade a diplomatic boost by referring
to a solution for Kosovo within the framework of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, instead of just Serbia.
	   Diplomats close to the talks say that so much pressure is being
applied to Yugoslav Foreign Affairs Minister Zivadin Jovanovic that
he may have no recourse but to walk out of the meeting.
	   Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, most of them Muslim, comprise 90
percent of its 2.2 million inhabitants, and most want to secede
from predominantly Orthodox Christian Serbia and Yugoslavia.
Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989 in a bid to suppress
the independence movement.
	   Yugoslavia's stance has even irked Greece, an Orthodox nation
once considered one of its staunchest Western allies.
	   The change was clear at a Monday meeting between Greek Foreign
Minister Theordoros Pangalos and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew
I, the spiritual leader of the world's 350 million Orthodox
Christians.
	   ``Let's hope the Holy Spirit will help,'' Bartholomew said.
	   ``Sometimes the Holy Spirit fails,'' Pangalos replied.
	   ``The Holy Spirit never fails,'' Bartholomew answered. ``It is
human weakness that fails.''

Bank says world economic prospects looking up, but advises caution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Despite the economic turmoil in Asia,
prospects for growth in the rest of the world are looking positive,
according to a central bankers report released Monday.
	   Long-running economic expansion in the United States and Britain
is set to continue, says the annual report of the Basel-based Bank
for International Settlements, known as the central banker's
central bank.
	   Serious spread of the Asian crisis to other parts of the world
has so far been avoided and the worst may be over in Asia itself,
according to the 199-page study.
	   ``Congratulations on this generally happy state of affairs might
seem in order, yet central bankers should not be complacent,''
Alfons Verplaetse, chairman of BIS' board of directors, told the
bank's annual meeting.
	   Rekindling growth in another of the world's major economies,
Japan, ``will not be easy'' and the full impact on Europe of the
Asian crisis has still to be assessed, the report says.
	   In addition, tightening labor markets, larger trade deficits and
booming prices for financial assets show inflationary risks are
rising.
	   ``No one should be under any illusions as to the magnitude of
the problems still to be faced and the potential difficulties along
the way,'' the report says.
	   A ``new era'' of productivity and profit growth is discernible
in recent U.S. economic statistics, notes the study. A wave of
restructuring in Europe will lead to the same result.
	   Growth rates in most industrial countries have either remained
at high levels or are starting to build significant momentum, said
Verplaetse.
	   Preparations for the transition in Europe to the new single
currency, the euro, have been smooth, he said. Structural reforms
and more disciplined policies have generated solid growth in Latin
America, many Eastern European countries and ``significant'' parts
of Africa.
	   Japan's banking system needs to be restructured and the economy
stimulated through permanent tax cuts.
	   Economic growth, financial deregulation and low inflation should
be accompanied by vigorous but careful market opening, the study
recommends.
	   Financial systems everywhere should be strengthened to let them
face up to the ``larger shocks'' likely to be created in freer
markets.

Burnt-out houses, village ruins stand silent testimony of clashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DECANI-PEC ROAD IN KOSOVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ghastly scenes
reminiscent of earlier wars in Bosnia and Croatia confronted the
first foreign diplomats allowed into the area of secessionist
Kosovo province that saw fierce fighting in the past week.
	   ``What we've seen is all sorrow, all grief... all those villages
burned and destroyed, all the people had left,'' said Dutch
ambassador Jan Sizoo.
	   The burnt-out, shelled houses and deserted villages seemed
likely to increase foreign pressure on Serbia to stop using its
police and army against militants battling for independence for
Kosovo's 9-to-1 ethnic Albanian majority.
	   After more than a week of clashes between Serb forces and
militants in the region of Decani, 75 kilometers (47 miles) west of
the provincial capital Pristina, a group of foreign diplomats from
Belgrade, state-run television and Tanjug news agency, as well as
one independent reporter, were escorted into the area Sunday.
	   With the main east-west artery traversing the province closed,
the diplomats' convoy, escorted by police, took several hours by
roundabout route to reach the Decani area.
	   ``We've only seen a part of what one could call a battlefield,
only a stretch of some 30-40 kilometers, we don't know what's
happening on the other side of the hill,'' Sizoo said.
	   ``We've been told that the blame is on the terrorists who
started first. But, this statement is very difficult to defend _
for a conflict you always need two parties,'' he added.
	   Last week's fighting triggered an exodus of 20,000 Kosovo
Albanians into northern Albania. Another 7,000 to 10,000 refugees
fled to the neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro and more
than 50,000 people are believed displaced within Kosovo itself.
	   More than 250 people have died in Kosovo since early March, when
Serb forces began battling militants of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which claims it is rapidly gaining ground and controls the rugged
center and west of the province.
	   Even Streoce, the first village the convoy saw some 5 kilometers
(three miles) south of Pec, in northwestern Kosovo, bore scars of
heavy fighting. More than 20 houses were completely burned or
shelled out. Apart from a few well-armed policemen, no living being
could be seen.
	   On the outskirts of Decani, a town of 35,000 inhabitants,
freshly painted-over shop windows could not conceal the UCK
graffiti _ the Albanian language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation
Army, the militants fighting to wrest the province away from
Serbia.
	   A few Serb townspeople lingered about the police station.
	   Some ethnic Albanians are said to be still in parts of Decani
untouched by fighting. But the visitors saw none.
	   ``How long will they keep burning us out? Somebody has to take
the blame for all this _ either we, they (Albanians) or the
state,'' said a 70-year-old Serb who gave only his first name,
Sreten.
	   Ilinka, a 47-year-old woman from the nearby Serb settlement of
Babaloc, said she was trapped three weeks ago when she came to
Decani, and fighting broke out. Her children and family remained
behind and she has had no word of them.
	   At the police station, the diplomats were shown an array of
weapons police said were confiscated from militants in the
fighting.
	   Further along the Decani road leading to Djakovica, the scenery
recalled some of the worst of Bosnia and Croatia.
	   Many heavily damaged houses were totally burned out. Cartridges
of different caliber littered streets.
	   ``They (the KLA) used houses built of concrete transformed into
real military bunkers,'' Maj. Gen. Sreten Lukic of the Serbian
police told the visitors. If able to, the ethnic Albanians carried
away their dead and wounded, he added, without giving any estimate
of casualties.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have said more than 50 people were
killed and that some 200 men were missing and presumed captured
following the offensive.
	   In Prilep, 7 kilometers (four miles) south of Decani, stray
cattle roamed the ghostly village. Houses were peppered with bullet
scars. Some had gashing holes made by grenades.

Jordanian pilots to train in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An agreement between Turkey and Jordan to
hold joint military training exercises may draw further ire from
Arab countries already angry over a similar deal with Israel, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   The report in the daily Cumhuriyet came a day after Jordan's
King Hussein confirmed his country will cooperate with Israel and
Turkey, prompting speculation a regional alliance was emerging
between the three.
	   An agreement allowing Jordanian and Turkish jets to train in
each others airspace was signed in Amman during a visit by Turkey's
air force chief last week, the paper said.
	   Turkish officials would neither confirm nor deny the report.
	   Military ties between Turkey and Israel have been rapidly
developing since Turkey and Israel signed a training deal in 1996.
	   Jordan and Turkey have conducted several joint maneuvers in the
last few years, but they were not made public in order not to anger
Syria.

Bomb rips through jewelry store injuring 20 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A bomb tore apart a jewelry store in
eastern Punjab province on Monday injuring 20 people, several of
them seriously, police officials said.
	   The explosion was the third to shatter Pakistan since last
Friday, when a bomb exploded in a theater in the eastern city of
Lahore, killing three people.
	   On Sunday a powerful bomb ripped through a train in southern
Sindh province, killing 26 people and injuring 45 others more.
	   The Pakistan government has come out strong against its uneasy
neighbor India, accusing New Delhi of sending infiltrators into
Pakistan to carry out acts of terrorism.
	   No one has taken responsibility for Monday's explosion in
Khanewal, in the heart of Punjab province, some 550 kilometers (330
miles) south of the federal capital of Islamabad.
	   The injured were in the jewelry store or walking past at the
time of the explosion, said police.
	   While there was no immediate comment from the government here,
it accusing New Delhi on Sunday of ``fomenting terrorism.''
	   India has denied the charges. Both countries routinely accuse
each other of carrying out acts of terrorism.
	   Pakistan and India have been uneasy neighbors since the British
left the Asian subcontinent in 1947 granting India its independence
and creating Pakistan as a homeland for the Muslims of the region.
	   They two neighbors have fought three wars since 1947.
	   Last month both India and Pakistan carried out underground
nuclear tests generating worldwide condemnation and threats of
economic sanctions. It also sparked fresh worries of a nuclear
confrontation between the two neighbors.
	   In a statement issued on Sunday Information Minister Mushahid
Hussein accused India of carrying out these terrorist acts to ``put
pressure on Pakistan ... and to divert attention away from domestic
political and economic frustrations.''
	   India's Hindu nationalist government, Hussein said ``is
apparently rattled by the restoration of the strategic balance in
South Asia (following Pakistan's nuclear explosions) ... and is now
resorting to terroristic actions.''

Threat of war muffles OAU's message of peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ A pan-African summit touted as
a forum for peace was focusing instead on the potential for war
between Ethiopia and Eritrea as heads of state from across the
continent began meetings Monday.
	   Amid heavy security with soldiers lining the streets, at least
16 leaders had arrived in Burkina Faso's capital of Ouagadougou for
the Organization of African Unity summit.
	   Other leaders, including South Africa's President Nelson Mandela
and Burundi's Pierre Boyoya were expected here later Monday as the
three-day summit opened amid high security.
	   The conference is followed by several days of consultation talks
between African ministers and technical experts. The talks quickly
shifted focus from developing peace to avoiding war.
	   On Saturday, foreign ministers gathered in Burkina Faso broke
from their scheduled talks and issued an urgent appeal for Ethiopia
and Eritrea to adopt a peace plan.
	   ``The Council of Ministers appeals to the two parties to put an
end to all hostilities,'' their statement said.
	   Ethiopian warplanes struck out at Eritrean targets over the
weekend.
	   South Africa's Mandela and the presidents of Djibouti, Uganda
and Kenya, called Eritrea's leadership over the weekend to
encourage a negotiated settlement.
	   Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki, who has accused Ethiopia of
declaring war, dispatched his foreign minister, Haile Woldensae, to
Burkina Faso.
	   It was unclear if Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi would follow
through with a promise to attend the summit.
	   The OAU has had little impact on the border clash since it began
on May 6.
	   Diplomats in Burkina Faso said summit delegates plan to draft a
resolution on the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea after
making rough recommendations to their leaders over the weekend.
	   Although hosts Burkina Faso have dubbed the event a ``summit for
change,'' so far the OAU has done little more than call for an end
to hostilities and offer support for a U.S.-Rwandan peace proposal.
	   OAU Assistant Secretary-General Pascal Gayama told journalists
that the organization would work closely with Rwandan and U.S.
mediators.
	   Other African conflict zones, such as Sudan where southern
animist rebels are fighting a protracted guerrilla war against the
northern Muslim government, are not expected to figure highly at
the summit.
	   In addition to African heads of state, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is also attending the summit.

Cambodian leader visits king amid election dispute

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen met King
Norodom Sihaouk on Monday amid a dispute that could hurt the
credibility of upcoming elections.
	   The contents of the 1 1/2-hour meeting in the northwestern
province of Siem Reap were not released, but the two were expected
to discuss a deadlock in Cambodia's highest legal appeals body, the
Constitutional Council, charged with resolving election problems.
	   The inaugural meeting of the nine-member council was stalled for
the second time last week when the king's three appointees did not
show. They appear to be protesting that the other six members of
the supposedly neutral panel are strong Hun Sen supporters.
	   In a faxed weekend statement, the king strongly denied ``any
ill-intentioned allegations'' that he was behind their boycott. Hun
Sen had earlier told his Cabinet that if the deadlock continued, it
would appear the king was behind it.
	   Sihanouk, furious, threatened leave Cambodia, but was asked by
the Cabinet to stay, said an aide to the king on condition of
anonymity.
	   Hun Sen ousted the king's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, as his
co-prime minister in a bloody coup 11 months ago. Hun Sen has
sought new elections to win back aid and legitimacy lost after the
takeover.
	   The council, charged with determining the constitutionality of
all laws, would be called on to resolve disputes arising from
controversial electoral and political party regulations.
	   The former chairman of the Supreme Court, Chan Sok, who also
sits on the body, has warned that further deadlock could call into
question the credibility of elections, scheduled July 26.
	   Sihanouk, the country's constitutional monarch, resides at a
palace in Siem Reap, near the ancient Angkor temple complex.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers moved into two buildings in
Arab east Jerusalem before dawn Monday, stringing barbed wire,
hanging Israeli flags and setting off angry stone-throwing clashes
with Palestinian neighbors.
	   It was the latest in a series of escalating confrontations in
Jerusalem's eastern sector as both sides accuse the other of trying
to grab land in the bitterly contested city.
	   At least two people were injured in Monday's clashes in the
Silwan neighborhood, including the top Palestinian official in
Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini. He was hit in the head with a stone and
slightly hurt before police and soldiers broke up the melee.
	   The settlers took over five apartments in two buildings, plus a
plot of land.
	   ``I see things getting worse,'' said Husseini, who has called
for mass street protests by Palestinians to block Jewish settlement
activity. ``This provocation is pushing the situation to the edge
of disaster.''
	   Adding to the volatile mix, about 20 activists from the Peace
Now group turned out at the site to protest the settlers' arrival.
Police roughly dragged them away after they refused to disperse.
	   The 15 settlers were from the Elad group, which claims it
purchased the homes legally. Settler leader Yehuda Mali said Jews
had a biblical claim to the area, overlooking the Kidron Valley
just outside the Old City walls.
	   ``It was the home of King David, here he wrote the Psalms, and
here Jews are not allowed to live?'' he said.
	   Police and soldiers tried to keep the two sides apart, but
repeated shoving and shouting matches broke out. In one skirmish,
settlers kicked Arabs who tried to block them from entering one of
the buildings.
	   ``I will surrender my life before I surrender my house!''
shouted Fatima Karaeen, 62, who said she has papers showing one of
the houses belongs to her Arab family. ``The cowards!''
	   Her lawyer said he was meeting with Israel's attorney general
later Monday to present the family's ownership claim.
	   Palestinian lawmaker Ziad Abu Ziad accused the Netanyahu
government of acting in complicity with the settlers, but Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh denied that the prime minister's
office was involved in organizing or planning the settler action.
	   The makeup of Jerusalem's neighborhoods is an explosive issue,
with Palestinians trying to block what they say are illegal
encroachments by Jewish settlers. Both sides are constantly
jockeying for position pending negotiations on the city's final
status.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
the 1967 Mideast War, as capital of a future state. Israel insists
the city must remain undivided under Israeli sovereignty.
	   Settlers have been stepping up activity in recent weeks. Last
month, clashes broke out after the settler group Ataret Cohanim set
up sheds in the Old City near Herod's Gate. Those sheds were
dismantled, but the settlers were allowed to stay on as guards and
volunteers in an archeological dig that got under way on Monday.
	   The latest confrontation comes at a delicate moment in efforts
to restart the stalled peace process. Israel's army radio, citing
sources close to the prime minister, said an American plan for an
Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank will likely be brought to
the Cabinet for a vote before the end of the week.
	   The radio reported that Naveh, Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat and U.S. Ambassador Edward Walker met Sunday to discuss the
proposal.

India says U.N. resolution on nuclear, missile programs
</HEADLINE>
unacceptable &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
reiterated his country's angry objections to pressure from the U.N.
Security Council to scrap its nuclear weapons program, telling
lawmakers India would not let anyone tell it what to do.
	   His statement in India's upper house of Parliament was quoted by
local news agencies. It came two days after the 15-member Council
asked both India and Pakistan, longtime rivals who escalated their
arms race with a series of tit-for-tat nuclear tests last month, to
resume talks to solve their disputes, especially over the Himalayan
territory of Kashmir they both claim.
	   The Indian government on Saturday released a statement calling
the Security Council resolution ``coercive and unhelpful.''
	   Monday, Vajpayee reiterated his oft-repeated statement since his
May 11-13 nuclear tests that India will not let any other nation
mediate in the Kashmir dispute. India has consistently resisted
international pressure on Kashmir, while Pakistan welcomes
intervention because it feels at a disadvantage in one-on-one talks
with its much larger and more powerful neighbor.
	   India had sought to hold talks with Pakistan since January, but
Islamabad has not replied to New Delhi's proposals, Vajpayee told
Parliament.
	   The Security Council also called on India and Pakistan to sign
the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and a test ban accord.
	   India has repeatedly refused to sign the treaties because they
do not require the traditional nuclear powers _ Britain, China,
France, Russia and the United States _ to give up their nuclear
arsenals. Pakistan says it will sign the treaty only if India does
so.
	   Vajpayee said Monday that India's nuclear policy would be
dictated by its security concerns. He has said in the past that
India went nuclear because of its fears of being surrounded by the
nuclear weapons of neighbors China and Pakistan.
	   In its response to the Security Council, Pakistan said Sunday
that it cannot be compelled to sign the nuclear arms control
treaties. It also expressed disappointment that the council's
resolution did not offer concrete steps toward resolving the
Kashmir dispute.
	   Two of the three wars India and Pakistan have fought in the last
50 years were over Kashmir, a former kingdom that had a Muslim
majority and a Hindu ruler. Officially Islamic Pakistan holds
one-third of Kashmir, and India's two-thirds is the only
Muslim-majority state in the predominantly Hindu country.

	   The previous forecast was made in February, before a clear
picture of the severity of Asia's economic slump had emerged. Since
then, the turmoil in neighboring Indonesia has worsened and other
regional economies have begun to show signs of hitting zero growth
or outright recession.
	   Prior to the announcement, the Singapore government had insisted
that the economy would grow at least 2.5 percent this year, though
occasionally had said it was ready to revise the forecast if
necessary.
	   At least two private investment houses have already predicted
that the Singapore economy will fall into outright recession this
year, though a recent newspaper survey of 15 analysts and
economists showed an average forecast of 1.5 percent growth.
	   Finance Minister Richard Hu defended the government forecasts in
Parliament last week, though he conceded that the authorities stood
ready to implement a stimulus package soon if new figures indicate
a likely recession.
	   Such measures would include tax rebates, and the acceleration of
infrastructure projects, Hu said.

	   The chairman of one of Singapore's biggest banks warned of a
recession next year if the government does not take action now to
stimulate the economy, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Wee Cho Yaw, chairman of United Overseas Bank, told The Straits
Times that the current economic situation in the small island
republic was the worst he had seen in his 40-year banking career.
	   He said Asia's financial crisis far exceeds the last major
economic challenge Singapore faced, a recession in 1985.
	   He said the previous government forecast was unlikely to be
achieved and urged immediate action.
	   ``If there is no growth, or a mere 1 percent growth, then the
government will have to inject more funds into the system,'' Wee
was quoted as saying.
	   These could include tax cuts and more spending on
infrastructure, he said.

Bank says world economic prospects looking up, but advises caution

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ The worst economic turmoil in Asia may
be over and prospects for growth in the rest of the world are
looking positive, but there are still problems, according to a
central bankers report out Monday.
	   Long-running economic expansion in the United States and Britain
is set to continue, says the annual report of the Basel-based Bank
for International Settlements, known as the central banker's
central bank.
	   Serious contagion of the Asian crisis to other parts of the
world has so far been avoided and the worst may be at an end in
Asia itself, according to the 199-page study.
	   ``Congratulations on this generally happy state of affairs might
seem in order, yet central bankers should not be complacent,''
Alfons Verplaetse, chairman of BIS' board of directors and
Belgium's national bank governor, told the bank's annual meeting.
	   Rekindling growth in another of the world's major economies,
Japan, ``will not be easy'' and the full impact on Europe of the
Asian crisis has still to be assessed, the report says.
	   In addition, tightening labor markets, worsening trade balances
and booming prices for financial assets show inflationary risks are
on the up.
	   ``No-one should be under any illusions as to the magnitude of
the problems still to be faced and the potential difficulties along
the way,'' says the study.
	   Growth rates in most industrial countries have either remained
at high levels or are starting to build significant momentum, said
Verplaetse.
	   A ``new era'' of productivity and profit growth is discernible
in recent U.S. economic statistics, the report notes. A wave of
restructuring in Europe will lead to the same result.
	   Preparations for the transition in Europe to the new single
currency, the Euro, have been smooth, Verplaetse said. Structural
reforms and more disciplined policies have generated solid growth
in Latin America, many Eastern European countries and
``significant'' parts of Africa.
	   Forecasts by the International Monetary Fund and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development indicate the
United States will bear most of the burden resulting from an
expected improvement in Asian trade deficits, pushing the current
account deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product to
near-record levels, the report says.
	   However, there is a danger markets will lose patience with the
accumulation of U.S. external debt and drive the dollar sharply
lower.
	   A further danger, stemming from the strong dollar, is a possible
movement to protectionist policies in the United States.
	   ``While the robust economy has kept such sentiments below the
surface, a marked slowing of growth could easily change this
situation,'' says the study.
	   In Asia's emerging markets, politically committed responses to
the International Monetary Fund's recommended financial reforms
would do more to revive growth prospects ``than anything else,''
the study says.
	   The BIS urged an early, transparent and politically neutral
restructuring of domestic banking systems to raise liquidity in
many Asian economies.
	   Japan's banking system needs to be restructured and the economy
stimulated through permanent tax cuts, it said.
	   Economic growth, financial deregulation and low inflation should
be accompanied by vigorous but careful market opening, the study
recommends.
	   Financial systems everywhere should be strengthened to allow
them to face up to the ``larger shocks'' likely to be created in
freer markets.

2.5 percent and 4.5 percent growth, despite worrying indications
that the regional slowdown was deepening and the country was
sliding into recession.
	   ``The Ministry of Trade and Industry intends to revise this
growth forecast when data for the second quarter becomes
available,'' the Prime Minister's Office said.
	   The previous forecast was made in February, before a clear
picture of the severity of Asia's economic slump had emerged. Since
then, the turmoil in neighboring Indonesia has worsened and other
regional economies have begun to show signs of hitting zero growth
or outright recession.
	   Prior to the announcement, the Singapore government had insisted
that the economy would grow at least 2.5 percent this year, though
occasionally had said it was ready to revise the forecast if
necessary.
	   At least two private investment houses have already predicted
that the Singapore economy will fall into outright recession this
year, though a recent newspaper survey of 15 analysts and
economists showed an average forecast of 1.5 percent growth.
	   Finance Minister Richard Hu defended the government forecasts in
Parliament last week, though he conceded that the authorities stood
ready to implement a stimulus package soon if new figures indicate
a likely recession.
	   Such measures would include tax rebates, and the acceleration of
infrastructure projects, Hu said.
	   The chairman of one of Singapore's biggest banks warned of a
recession next year if the government does not take action now to
stimulate the economy, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Wee Cho Yaw, chairman of United Overseas Bank, told The Straits
Times that the current economic situation in the small island
republic was the worst he had seen in his 40-year banking career.
	   He said Asia's financial crisis far exceeds the last major
economic challenge Singapore faced, a recession in 1985.
	   He said the previous government forecast was unlikely to be
achieved and urged immediate action.
	   ``If there is no growth, or a mere 1 percent growth, then the
government will have to inject more funds into the system,'' Wee
was quoted as saying.
	   These could include tax cuts and more spending on
infrastructure, he said.

U.N. peacekeepers protest to Israel over shelling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ The U.N. peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon protested to the Israeli army after a mortar shell fired by
Israeli-allied militiamen hit a peacekeepers' position, a U.N.
official said Monday.
	   There were no casualties in the incident last Thursday, the
official said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   He said a 120mm mortar shell, with Hebrew markings, was fired by
the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia from Beit Leif
village on the edge of Israel's occupation zone in the south.
	   The shell struck a U.N. Nepalese post in the village of Hariss,
damaging prefabricated offices, the official added. Beit Leif, a
predominantly Shiite Muslim village, is across from the occupied
zone four kilometers (2.5 miles) north of the Israeli border.
	   Since it was sent to south Lebanon in 1978 after an Israeli
invasion, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon has been caught in the
crossfire between Lebanese guerrillas and Israeli occupation
forces.
	   A total of 222 members of the nine-nation, 4,500-strong force
have died in fighting and accidents.

Bomb rips through jewelry store injuring 20 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A bomb tore apart a jewelry store in
eastern Punjab province on Monday injuring 20 people, several of
them seriously, police officials said.
	   The explosion was the third to shatter Pakistan since last
Friday, when a bomb exploded in a theater in the eastern city of
Lahore, killing three people.
	   On Sunday a powerful bomb ripped through a train in southern
Sindh province, killing 26 people and injuring 45 others more.
	   The Pakistan government has come out strong against its uneasy
neighbor India, accusing New Delhi of sending infiltrators into
Pakistan to carry out acts of terrorism.
	   No one has taken responsibility for Monday's explosion in
Khanewal, in the heart of Punjab province, some 550 kilometers (330
miles) south of the federal capital of Islamabad.
	   The injured were in the jewelry store or walking past at the
time of the explosion, said police.
	   While there was no immediate comment from the government here,
it accusing New Delhi on Sunday of ``fomenting terrorism.''
	   India has denied the charges. Both countries routinely accuse
each other of carrying out acts of terrorism.
	   Pakistan and India have been uneasy neighbors since the British
left the Asian subcontinent in 1947 granting India its independence
and creating Pakistan as a homeland for the Muslims of the region.
	   They two neighbors have fought three wars since 1947.
	   Last month both India and Pakistan carried out underground
nuclear tests generating worldwide condemnation and threats of
economic sanctions. It also sparked fresh worries of a nuclear
confrontation between the two neighbors.
	   In a statement issued on Sunday Information Minister Mushahid
Hussein accused India of carrying out these terrorist acts to ``put
pressure on Pakistan ... and to divert attention away from domestic
political and economic frustrations.''
	   India's Hindu nationalist government, Hussein said ``is
apparently rattled by the restoration of the strategic balance in
South Asia (following Pakistan's nuclear explosions) ... and is now
resorting to terroristic actions.''

U.S. insurance firm plans to invest dlrs 1 billion in Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The U.S. insurance giant Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co. plans to buy a 50-percent stake in Korea Life
Insurance Co. for dlrs 1 billion, Korea Life officials said Monday.
	   A memorandum of understanding to be signed in New York on
Tuesday calls for Metropolitan to offer management and technical
know-how, they said.
	   Currently, Korea Life Insurance is owned 27.7 percent by its
chairman, Choi Soon-young, and 21.8 percent by his relatives. The
rest is owned by small local investors.
	   Korea Life Insurance, the nation's third largest life insurance
company, sold policies worth dlrs 5.6 billion last year _ 16
percent of the nation's dlrs 35 billion life insurance market.
	   ``Through the deal, we can learn advanced operational know-how
of Metropolitan, not to mention we can improve our financial status
significantly,'' said Choi Ji-ho, a spokesman for Korea Life
Insurance.
	   The deal, if successful, would enable Metropolitan to expand its
business in South Korea's fast-growing life insurance market, which
grew by 21 percent last year and is expected to expand by 14
percent this year.
	   Metropolitan already has a wholly owned life insurance
subsidiary in Seoul, called MetLife Insurance Korea Ltd., which
held less than 1 percent of the local life insurance market last
year.

Bank says world economic prospects looking up, but advises caution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CHANGES 4th graf to clarify that the annual meeting is that of
BIS, not the Belgian national bank. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ The worst economic turmoil in Asia may
be over and prospects for growth in the rest of the world are
looking positive, but there are still problems, according to a
central bankers report out Monday.
	   Long-running economic expansion in the United States and Britain
is set to continue, says the annual report of the Basel-based Bank
for International Settlements, known as the central banker's
central bank.
	   Serious contagion of the Asian crisis to other parts of the
world has so far been avoided and the worst may be at an end in
Asia itself, according to the 199-page study.
	   ``Congratulations on this generally happy state of affairs might
seem in order, yet central bankers should not be complacent,''
Alfons Verplaetse, chairman of BIS' board of directors and
Belgium's national bank governor, told BIS' annual meeting.
	   Rekindling growth in another of the world's major economies,
Japan, ``will not be easy'' and the full impact on Europe of the
Asian crisis has still to be assessed, the report says.
	   In addition, tightening labor markets, worsening trade balances
and booming prices for financial assets show inflationary risks are
on the up.
	   ``No-one should be under any illusions as to the magnitude of
the problems still to be faced and the potential difficulties along
the way,'' says the study.
	   Growth rates in most industrial countries have either remained
at high levels or are starting to build significant momentum, said
Verplaetse.
	   A ``new era'' of productivity and profit growth is discernible
in recent U.S. economic statistics, the report notes. A wave of
restructuring in Europe will lead to the same result.
	   Preparations for the transition in Europe to the new single
currency, the Euro, have been smooth, Verplaetse said. Structural
reforms and more disciplined policies have generated solid growth
in Latin America, many Eastern European countries and
``significant'' parts of Africa.
	   Forecasts by the International Monetary Fund and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development indicate the
United States will bear most of the burden resulting from an
expected improvement in Asian trade deficits, pushing the current
account deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product to
near-record levels, the report says.
	   However, there is a danger markets will lose patience with the
accumulation of U.S. external debt and drive the dollar sharply
lower.
	   A further danger, stemming from the strong dollar, is a possible
movement to protectionist policies in the United States.
	   ``While the robust economy has kept such sentiments below the
surface, a marked slowing of growth could easily change this
situation,'' says the study.
	   In Asia's emerging markets, politically committed responses to
the International Monetary Fund's recommended financial reforms
would do more to revive growth prospects ``than anything else,''
the study says.
	   The BIS urged an early, transparent and politically neutral
restructuring of domestic banking systems to raise liquidity in
many Asian economies.
	   Japan's banking system needs to be restructured and the economy
stimulated through permanent tax cuts, it said.
	   Economic growth, financial deregulation and low inflation should
be accompanied by vigorous but careful market opening, the study
recommends.
	   Financial systems everywhere should be strengthened to allow
them to face up to the ``larger shocks'' likely to be created in
freer markets.

Hundreds of thousands of honeybees block Transylvania highway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of honeybees
blocked a national highway for a third day Monday after a truck
transporting 130 beehives overturned, a police officer said.
	   ``We had to re-route the traffic because the bees were attacking
the drivers, but we did not want to kill them,'' Lt. Rozalia
Slatean of the Satu Mare Police said by telephone.
	   The truck transporting the hives to a Transylvanian bee farm
overturned near the town of Decebal, 450 kilometers (281 miles)
northwest of Bucharest.
	   Slatean said bee farmer Ioan Bal is moving the damaged
honeycombs and the queen bees to new hives in an effort to lure the
bees away from the overturned truck.
	   Bal told police the accident resulted in lei 80 million (almost
dlrs 10,000) in damages. No one was injured.

Dozens of protesters demand Washington help speed up IMF bailout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About a dozen demonstrators staged a
peaceful protest outside U.S. Embassy on Monday, demanding
Washington speed up the reintroduction of a dlrs 43 billion
international economic bailout.
	   The protest, the latest in a series outside the embassy in
recent days, coincided with the arrival of an International
Monetary Fund team in Jakarta.
	   The team is to assess the state of Indonesia's battered economy
as the IMF considers whether to restart the payment of installments
under the plan.
	   The bailout was suspended several weeks ago amid political
turmoil, rioting and protests that climaxed on May 21 with the
resignation of ex-President Suharto.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, who has introduced
wideranging political reforms, has promised full cooperation with
the IMF.
	   However, U.S. officials have cautioned that outside economic
assistance won't work unless there is political stability.
	   Monday's protesters waved banners and chanted: ``People are
hungry, how about the money!''
	   Police and army personnel kept watch from a distance.
	   Last week, a protester was arrested after he allegedly tore a
American flag at the U.S. consulate in Surabaya, Indonesia's second
largest city.

World Cup: Midfielder carries a burden for this tournament

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ Claudio Reyna no longer is
the future of U.S. soccer. More than anyone else, the midfielder is
counted on to carry the Americans' offense, which seems to sputter
without him.
	   ``I do feel pressure and I do feel responsible for how the team
does,'' Reyna said Sunday as roosters crowed in the courtyard of
the U.S. team's hotel.
	   Reyna, 24, had four goals in 28 games last season with VfL
Wolfsburg in Germany's Bundesliga. He was the youngest player on
the '94 U.S. team after leading Virginia to an unprecedented three
straight NCAA titles from 1991-93, twice winning the college player
of the year award.
	   He played for the U.S. team in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and
was set to make a breakthrough at the 1994 World Cup, but he pulled
his right hamstring 10 days before the opener and missed the entire
tournament.
	   At the time, he was looked at as the future star of American
soccer. The injury clearly frustrated him.
	   ``I was 20 years old. I thought I'd never get another chance
again,'' Reyna said.
	   This time, he's the center of the team. In 1994, John Harkes and
Tab Ramos did most of the playmaking, but after two major knee
operations, Ramos isn't close to his old form.
	   Harkes, the captain the past three years, was cut by coach Steve
Sampson in April, partly because he wouldn't assume a defensive
role and allow Reyna to be the playmaker.
	   Sampson then adopted a 3-6-1 formation in which the Americans
start three defenders, six midfielders and a lone forward. It's
perfectly suited to Reyna's passing skills.
	   When there are at least two holding midfielders behind Reyna,
``it gives him the freedom to attack more, and a player with that
kind of freedom welcomes it, and you saw the result in Austria,''
Sampson said.
	   Reyna scored a goal and set up two others in the Americans' 3-0
victory at Vienna on April 22. But since then, his right hamstring
has bothered him again, an injury from the Bundesliga season.
	   With Reyna in the lineup, the Americans beat Kuwait 2-0 last
month. But when he sat out exhibition games against Macedonia and
Scotland, the U.S. team wound up with a pair of scoreless ties.
	   ``There are certain players that need to play well for us to
succeed as a team,'' Sampson said, ``and he is one of them.''
	   Reyna was ranked 25th among 311 players in the Bundesliga last
season, and an exceptional World Cup could turn him into a big
star.
	   Still, Reyna's coach at Wolfsburg, Wolfgang Wolf, said the
midfielder had to toughen up. ``If he gets hit three times, he's
basically taken out of the game. I want Claudio to show more
spirit,'' Wolf said.
	   Reyna said the criticism came after he played a poor game and he
could take it. He also expects a lot of pushing and shoving from
Germany, the opening opponent for the Americans on June 15.
	   ``German players play aggressively against anyone,'' he said.
``They kill each other in practice.''

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Diplomatic efforts were under way to
prevent the border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia from
exploding into full-scale war, with officials hoping that Monday's
summit of African leaders will produce new ideas for a settlement.
	   American, Italian, German and British planes ferried more than a
thousand foreigners out of harm's way over the weekend after
Ethiopia agreed to temporarily halt bombing of a military-civilian
airport on the outskirts of the Eritrean capital Asmara.
	   Despite a daylong lull after Ethiopian warplanes bombed Asmara's
military-civilian airport Friday and Saturday, President Isaias
Afwerki's office accused Ethiopia of declaring war.
	   ``As far as we're concerned, Ethiopia has declared a state of
war. Things have not changed on the ground. Just because there are
no air strikes today, it doesn't mean there are not going to be air
strikes tomorrow,'' said Yemani Gebremeskel, presidential
spokesman.
	   African heads of state gathered at a summit of the Organization
of African Unity in Ouagadougu, Burkina Faso where finding a
peaceful solution to the Ethiopian-Eritrean crisis topped the
agenda.
	   ``We're anxious to see what they come up with,'' said Eritrean
government spokesman Isaac Yared. Afwerki did not go, but sent
Foreign Minister Haile Woldensae.
	   It was not immediately clear who would represent Ethiopia.
	   The OAU, somewhat compromised because its headquarters is in the
Ethiopian capital and because of Eritrea's lack of interest in the
53-nation organization, has played a minor role in the dispute.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice left a meeting of
OAU foreign ministers Saturday in Ouagadougu to return to the
United States. Rice is promoting a U.S.-Rwandan peace plan for the
two feuding Horn of Africa countries.
	   The plan includes a call for Eritrea to return to positions held
before May 6, when current hostilities reportedly broke out _ in
other words, to withdraw from what Ethiopia considers its
territory.
	   But Eritrea, wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea,
claims it is rightfully occupying territory defined by boundaries
drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   African leaders, including the presidents of South Africa,
Djibouti, Uganda and Kenya, called Afwerki over the weekend to
encourage a negotiated settlement.
	   Eritrean civilians were hoping to avoid war. Ethiopia's army
outnumbers Eritrea's 40,000-strong force by about 3 to 1. Eritrea's
tiny air force is no match for Ethiopia's.
	   In Asmara, Eritreans scanned cloudless blue skies Sunday and
listened for the high-pitched whoosh of the Ethiopian MiG-23
fighters that had bombed their capital's airport Friday and
Saturday. But none came.
	   Skirmishes were reported, however, along the two countries'
disputed border. Ethiopia said Sunday it had reoccupied its border
town of Zala Anbessa, 100 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of
Asmara, after a daylong battle with Eritrean forces who captured
the town last week.
	   Eritrea's Yared (cq) said Eritrean troops had retreated to their
side of the border. ``They decided it was time to go,'' he said.
	   Also Sunday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that the
leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea were willing to implement a Libyan
plan for a cease-fire and deploy an African peacekeeping force on
their border,
	   But Yared, the Eritrean government spokesman, said the report
was untrue, and that Eritrea preferred to concentrate on improving
the U.S.-Rwandan plan.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991, and Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   But the two countries dispute more than a half-dozen areas along
their common border, which was drawn by Italy after it conquered
Eritrea in 1885.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai stock prices plumbed an 11-year
low Monday as investors dumped the stock of the country's biggest
finance company after it decided to sell half of its securities
subsidiary.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand closed down 5.79 points to
312.37. Dealers said the index hasn't seen such lows since 1987,
blaming the drop on regional currency woes and the move by Phatra
Thanakit PCL.
	   Phatra Thanakit announced last week that it would sell a 51
percent stake in a subsidiary, Phatra Securities Co., to Merrill
Lynch and Co.
	   Dealers said it could be the beginning of the end of Phatra's
listing on the exchange, since top Phatra executives said they were
considering merging the company's finance operations into those of
Thai Farmers Bank PCL, its biggest shareholder.
	   Earlier, Thai baht hit a 13-week low of 43.80 to the U.S.
dollar, off from 43.25 at Friday's close, as investors dumped
regional currencies after the dollar surged to a seven-year high
against the Japanese yen.
	   The weakness of the Japanese currency, dealers said, spells
trouble for crisis-hit Southeast Asian economies that have been
increasingly dependent on Japan as an export market.
	   Fears are rising that the Asian economic crisis could enter a
new, more devastating phase.

Algerian helicopter pilot granted temporary stay in Spain

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain _ Spanish police kept an Algerian military
helicopter pilot under observation Monday while the interior
ministry dealt with his request for political asylum.
	   The lieutenant, who was not identified by Spanish officials,
flew to Spain Sunday during military maneuvers, landing at the
Ibiza airport where he surrendered to authorities.
	   A foreign ministry spokeswoman said the pilot would be granted a
temporary stay under police observation while his request for
asylum is being reviewed by the interior ministry, a procedure that
usually takes several months.
	   Algeria sent a military crew to Spain to fly the helicopter back
home.
	   It was the first known case of asylum being requested by an
active member of the Algerian military forces, although many other
Algerians have sought asylum to escape poverty and alleged threats
from Islamic fundamentalists, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, who
declined to be identified, said.
	   At least 75,000 people have died in Algeria during an insurgency
resulting from the cancellation of the 1992 parliamentary elections
by the military-backed regime, apparently to head off victories by
Islamic candidates.
	   The revolt has worsened living conditions for many Algerians,
who have sought immigration visas at the embassies of Spain and
other European countries.

Philippine President-elect Estrada promises help to landless

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada took
off his formal shirt, ate with his hands and promised protesting
farmers Monday they will get a fair hearing in a court case over
ownership of 100 hectares (250 acres) of land.
	   The legal appeal by the farmers for the return of fields awarded
under a land reform program but then taken away on a technicality
is seen as a test case for Estrada, who won the May 11 presidential
election on a ``pro-poor'' platform.
	   ``I am no longer campaigning, the elections are over,'' Estrada
said to 13 farmers and four children camped outside the agrarian
reform building in suburban Quezon City. ``I am here to really help
you.''
	   Estrada and his incoming agrarian reform secretary, Horacio
``Boy'' Morales, a former Communist leader, talked with the farmers
over a lunch of rice, cheap fried fish, boiled beans and sauteed
vegetable greens.
	   Estrada, Morales and the farmers ate with their hands while
several old women shooed away flies hovering over them.
	   Estrada told the farmers he cannot tell the Supreme Court how to
rule on the appeal, but promised the farmers they will get a fair
hearing.
	   ``It is very important to decide on the merits of the case and
not on a technicality,'' he said.
	   On November 1997, the farmers were awarded the land in Sumilao
in Bukidnon province.
	   The owner of the property, however, appealed to the Supreme
Court, which withdrew the award after the agrarian reform office
submitted its opinion on the case a day after the court-imposed
deadline. The farmers have appealed for a reconsideration of the
ruling.
	   Estrada, a former actor, small-town mayor and senator, will be
inaugurated June 30 as the Philippines' third president since the
late dictator Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in 1986.
	   Art Banzuela, leader of a support group for the farmers, said
sharing a meal with Estrada was important for them.
	   ``This was to show that Estrada is one of us,'' he said. ``This
is a symbol of his unity with the farmers.''

Eurovision winner pleads innocent to disorderly conduct charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's transsexual pop diva Dana
International, winner of this year's Eurovision song contest,
pleaded innocent Monday to charges that she attacked a spectator
and a waitress at a performance two years ago.
	   The singer is accused of throwing a bottle of mineral water at a
spectator's head and attacking a waitress during a November 1995
performance, Israel's Army Radio said.
	   The singer is charged with disorderly conduct in Magistrate's
Court in Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv. Her next hearing will be in
about six months, according to court spokesman Moshe Gorali.
	   Dana International, who was known as Yaron Cohen until
undergoing a sex change operation five years ago, won the 25-nation
Eurovision song contest last month with the song ``Diva.''
	   The singer's selection as Israel's representative was denounced
by Orthodox leaders, who called her a disgrace to the Jewish state.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ JP Morgan and Credit Suisse First
Boston have tentatively agreed to act as lead managers for a dlrs 2
billion loan South Korea's Export-Import Bank plans to introduce
this year, Seoul officials said Monday.
	   The deal is still in an early stage and details including
whether it will be a syndicate loan or bonds, when it will mature,
and how much interest it will carry have not been discussed yet,
South Korean bank officials said.
	   The South Korean government plans to use the money to help local
exporters and importers.
	   South Korea is anxious to attract foreign investment and loans
to revive its economy, which was bailed out by the International
Monetary Fund in December.

Estrada quits last vice _ smoking _ three weeks ahead of schedule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Vice President Joseph Estrada says he
has quit his last vice _ cigarette smoking _ three weeks ahead of a
June 30 deadline, when he loses the ``vice'' in his title and
becomes the country's 13th president.
	   ``I advanced the quitting of my smoking,'' Estrada said after
receiving an award from the Knights of Rizal, a local association
which reveres the country's national hero, Jose Rizal. ``If I
cannot discipline myself earlier, how can I discipline my people?''
	   Estrada said that when he has the urge to smoke, he now eats
menthol candy instead.
	   But quitting has increased his appetite, he said. The
already-portly Estrada says he now eats a second helping at every
meal.
	   Estrada had promised to quit smoking on June 30, when he takes
over from outgoing President Fidel Ramos. Estrada was the runaway
winner of the May 11 presidential election against nine other
contenders.
	   He agreed to quit smoking after being asked to serve as an
example for other Filipinos on World No Tobacco Day on May 30, but
asked for one month to prepare.
	   Estrada, 61, a mustachioed ex-actor, admits to being a former
heavy-drinking womanizer and gambler, but says he has reformed.
	   He said he used to smoke three packs a day but slowly cut back
before finally quitting.

Philippine peso, stocks weaken on yen decline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso weakened against
the U.S. dollar Monday, following the trend of other regional
currencies after the dollar broke through the critical level of 140
Japanese yen, dealers said.
	   The dollar averaged 39.649 pesos, up 49.5 centavos from Friday's
39.154 pesos.
	   The dollar's gain against the peso was moderated, however, by
subdued corporate demand for the U.S. currency, dealers said.
	   A dealer for a large local bank said the peso could hit 40 to
the dollar if the yen depreciates further against the dollar.
	   The dealer said currency traders are closely watching Tuesday's
meeting of deputy finance ministers from the Group of Seven
industrialized nations to determine where the yen is headed.
	   If the G-7 meeting fails to address the yen's fall against the
dollar, the trader said the yen could slump further and that would
weigh down other Asian currencies, including the peso.
	   On the stock market, the weaker Asian currencies and prospects
for higher local interest rates pushed shares lower, analysts said.
	   Higher interest rates and a volatile currency make fixed-income
investments and the dollar more attractive alternatives to stocks.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange retreated 27.17 points or
1.4 percent to 1,930.59 after gaining 3.88 points Friday.
	   The index slid by as much as 42 points as sellers remained the
dominant force. Only last-minute buying kept the main index from
closing at its low.
	   ``Foreigners are mostly sellers. Even locals aren't bottom
fishing,'' said Ramon Lucas, a trader for Kim Eng Securities.
	   Analysts see domestic interest rates rising after several weeks
of decline after inflation in May hit a 23-month high of 9.2
percent from April's 7.8 percent. Under a new consumer price index
that uses 1994 as a base year that was introduced by the government
Friday, inflation in May was 10.3 percent.
	   Vicente Unson, analyst for Dharmala Securities, said an active
currency market and prospects of higher rates in Monday's treasury
bill auction prompted investors still in the market to sell.
	   He said these developments compounded apprehensions over the
outlook of the Philippine economy, which has so far bucked a
region-wide contraction.
	   ``People are still concerned whether we can maintain our
growth,'' said Unson, referring to the country's first quarter
gross national produce growth of 2.5 percent. Growth was 5.4
percent in the same period last year.

Two MiGs collide in mid-air, no casualties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Two fighter planes collided in
mid-air Monday, one of them crashing near a densely populated area,
slightly injuring six people, defense ministry officials said.
	   The two planes collided at 9:25 a.m. in heavy clouds over the
city of Ceske Budejovice, 130 kilometers (81 miles) south of
Prague, Petr Sykora a ministry press official said. No further
details were immediately given.
	   One of the planes crashed near an apartment complex, setting
three buildings on fire, local police officials said. The plane
first hit several parked cars and then slid towards the buildings,
damaging one of them heavily.
	   Six people were slighlty injured in the accident, but no
casulaties were reported.
	   The other plane crashed in an uninhabited area near the complex,
causing no immediate damages, CTK news agency said.
	   Residents were evacuated and given gas masks to prevent
inhalation of poisionous gasses from burning plastic in the
buildings.
	   At least 200 police and firemen brought the fire under control
within two hours, CTK reported.
	   One of the planes was a two-seat Russian-made MiG 21U and the
other was a MiG 21 with a single pilot. All three men ejected
safely, but were taken to a nearby hospital to be examinated,
Sykora said.

Asian stock markets mostly lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with all closing figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets closed lower Tuesday on
fears that further depreciation in the yen, which fell to a
seven-year low, could spark another round of currency devaluations
in the region.
	   Thai stock prices tumbled, with the key index closing at an
11-year low as investors dumped the stock of the country's biggest
finance company, Phatra Thanakit PCL, after it decided to sell half
of its securities subsidiary.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index closed down 5.79 points, or
1.8 percent, to 312.37, its lowest level since late 1987.
	   Dealers blamed the drop on regional currency woes and the move
by Phatra Thanakit PCL.
	   Earlier, Thai baht hit a 13-week low of 43.80 to the U.S.
dollar, off from 43.25 at Friday's close.
	   Singapore shares fell 3.4 percent, reacting to news of the
republic's first major property development default and the
continued weakness of the Japanese yen and other regional
currencies.
	   The Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index fell
39.89 points to 1,128.57.
	   News that a Singapore-Hong Kong joint venture missed a deadline
for a 68.6 million Singapore dollar (dlrs 40 million) payment on a
plot of land to develop condominiums dampened market sentiment.
	   The Singapore dollar was also sharply lower, breaking the
psychologically important 1.70 level against the U.S. currency.
	   In Tokyo, the dollar bought 140.56 yen at late afternoon, up
1.14 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and its highest point since June
20, 1991. In New York, the dollar settled at 139.75 yen on Friday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
slipped 28.72 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 15,294.71. On
Friday, the average lost 103.04 points, or 0.67 percent.
	   The Australian stock market was closed for a holiday, but the
Australian dollar fell to its lowest level against the dollar since
July 1986, hitting a low of 59.75 U.S. cents by afternoon.
	   New Zealand's dollar was also lower, down to 50.88 U.S. cents.
	   In Indonesia, the dollar was trading at 11,725 rupiah, compared
with its close Friday at 11,550.
	   In Taipei, the dollar also opened at an 11-year-high against the
New Taiwan dollar, but fell later amid talk of intervention by
Taiwan's central bank.
	   Dealers in the region said institutional investors, spooked by
the weakening regional currencies and persistent pessimism over
Japan's economy, continued to dump shares.
	   The dollar's strength against the yen sprang from fresh evidence
of a robust U.S. economy after the Labor Department reported on
Friday that the nation's unemployment rate held to a 28-year-low of
4.3 percent in May.
	   Malaysian share prices closed lower, with the key slipping to
its lowest point in nearly six months. The Composite Index fell
7.26 points, or 1.4 percent, to 497.79.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower. The market's key Weighted
Stock Price Index fell 45.46 points, or 0.59 percent, to 7,591.27.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed following as a surge
in local interest rates. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 31.30
points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,104.40.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower, affected by declining
Asian currencies and prospects of an increase in domestic interest
rates. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks
fell 27.17 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,930.59.
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed generally mixed in light trading.
The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips, rose
17.16 points, or 0.2 percent, to 8,586.63.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed higher on expectations that President
Kim Dae-jung will be able to attract more foreign investment into
the country during his trip to the United States. The Korea
Composite Stock Price Index rose 4.35 points, or 1.2 percent, to
345.88.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower. The Composite Index slipped
0.097 point to 409.419.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Diplomatic efforts were under way to
prevent the border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia from
exploding into full-scale war, with officials hoping that Monday's
summit of African leaders will produce new ideas for a settlement.
	   American, Italian, German and British planes ferried more than a
thousand foreigners out of harm's way over the weekend after
Ethiopia agreed to temporarily halt bombing of a military-civilian
airport on the outskirts of the Eritrean capital Asmara.
	   Despite a daylong lull after Ethiopian warplanes bombed Asmara's
military-civilian airport Friday and Saturday, President Isaias
Afwerki's office accused Ethiopia of declaring war.
	   ``As far as we're concerned, Ethiopia has declared a state of
war. Things have not changed on the ground. Just because there are
no air strikes today, it doesn't mean there are not going to be air
strikes tomorrow,'' said Yemani Gebremeskel, presidential
spokesman.
	   African heads of state gathered at a summit of the Organization
of African Unity in Ouagadougu, Burkina Faso where finding a
peaceful solution to the Ethiopian-Eritrean crisis topped the
agenda.
	   ``We're anxious to see what they come up with,'' said Eritrean
government spokesman Isaac Yared. Afwerki did not go, but sent
Foreign Minister Haile Woldensae.
	   Ethiopia sent Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin.
	   The OAU, somewhat compromised because its headquarters are in
the Ethiopian capital and because of Eritrea's lack of interest in
the 53-nation organization, has played a minor role in the dispute.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice left a meeting of
OAU foreign ministers Saturday in Ouagadougu to return to the
United States. Rice is promoting a U.S.-Rwandan peace plan for the
two feuding Horn of Africa countries.
	   The plan includes a call for Eritrea to return to positions held
before May 6, when current hostilities reportedly broke out _ in
other words, to withdraw from what Ethiopia considers its
territory.
	   But Eritrea, wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea,
claims it is rightfully occupying territory defined by boundaries
drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   African leaders, including the presidents of South Africa,
Djibouti, Uganda and Kenya, called Afwerki over the weekend to
encourage a negotiated settlement.
	   Eritrean civilians were hoping to avoid war. Ethiopia's army
outnumbers Eritrea's 40,000-strong force by about 3 to 1. Eritrea's
tiny air force is no match for Ethiopia's.
	   In Asmara, Eritreans scanned cloudless blue skies Sunday and
listened for the high-pitched whoosh of the Ethiopian MiG-23
fighters that had bombed their capital's airport Friday and
Saturday. But none came.
	   Skirmishes were reported, however, along the two countries'
disputed border. Ethiopia said Sunday it had reoccupied its border
town of Zala Anbessa, 100 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of
Asmara, after a daylong battle with Eritrean forces who captured
the town last week.
	   Eritrea's Yared (cq) said Eritrean troops had retreated to their
side of the border. ``They decided it was time to go,'' he said.
	   Also Sunday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that the
leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea were willing to implement a Libyan
plan for a cease-fire and deploy an African peacekeeping force on
their border,
	   But Yared, the Eritrean government spokesman, said the report
was untrue, and that Eritrea preferred to concentrate on improving
the U.S.-Rwandan plan.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991, and Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   But the two countries dispute more than a half-dozen areas along
their common border, which was drawn by Italy after it conquered
Eritrea in 1885.

Jordanian pilots to train in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An agreement between Turkey and Jordan to
hold joint military training exercises may draw further ire from
Arab countries already angry over a similar deal with Israel, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   The report in the daily Cumhuriyet came a day after Jordan's
King Hussein confirmed his country will cooperate with Israel and
Turkey, prompting speculation a regional alliance was emerging
between the three.
	   An agreement allowing Jordanian and Turkish jets to train in
each others airspace was signed in Amman during a visit by Turkey's
air force chief last week, the paper said.
	   Turkish officials would neither confirm nor deny the report.
	   Military ties between Turkey and Israel have been rapidly
developing since Turkey and Israel signed a training deal in 1996.
	   Jordan and Turkey have conducted several joint maneuvers in the
last few years, but they were not made public in order not to anger
Syria.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's stocks and currency plunged further
Monday, reacting to news of the republic's first major property
development default and the weakness of the Japanese yen and other
regional currencies.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index closed 3.4 percent
down to 1128.57, about 40 points off its 1168.46 opening. It
dropped to an intra-day low of 1122.58 and recovered only slightly,
setting the stage for a third straight week of dropping indexes.
	   Dealers said they were awaiting comments by Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong, also the chairman of Singapore's de facto
central bank, who planned a speech to bankers after the markets
closed.
	   The Singapore dollar was also sharply lower, breaking the
important support level of 1.70 against the U.S. currency. The U.S.
dollar broke above the benchmark 140 yen level as the market opened
in Tokyo, and the Singapore dollar slumped in sympathy.
	   News that a Singapore-Hong Kong joint venture missed a deadline
for a 68.6 million Singapore dollar (dlrs 40 million) payment on a
plot of land to develop condominiums also dampened sentiment.
	   The company, a joint venture between Singapore's Eltech
Electronics and Hong Kong's Lai Sun Development, missed the last
deadline Friday to pay the remaining 75 percent of the bid it made
last July.
	   Mounting fears that Singapore could head into a recession this
year are also depressing the stock market, according to dealers.
	   The chairman of United Overseas Bank, Wee Cho Yaw, warned in a
newspaper interview published Monday that the Singapore economy may
slip into a recession next year if the government does not take
immediate steps.
	   Several foreign investment houses have also made the recession
forecast, and the government announced Monday that it would soon
revise its growth forecasts for the year.

Indonesian president to release more political prisoners

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie plans to
release 16 more political prisoners later this week, bringing to 20
the number freed since his authoritarian predecessor Suharto quit
last month, Indonesia's justice minister said Monday.
	   ``I cannot give more details about their identity or from which
prisons they will be released, but the president has approved the
plan,'' Justice Minister Muladi told reporters after a meeting with
Habibie.
	   Earlier, members of Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission
urged Habibie to speed up the release of political prisoners.
	   The commission was appointed by Suharto in 1993, but has a
proven track record for independently investigating human rights
abuses.
	   Suharto ended 32 years in office on May 21 when he resigned and
was replaced by Habibie.
	   Within days the new leader ordered the release of four high
profile dissidents who had been jailed for criticizing Suharto's
regime. Habibie said more would be released in the future, but gave
no timetable.
	   Private human rights groups say at least 200 political prisoners
are still locked up.
	   Also on Monday about 100 protesters staged a peaceful rally
outside the Justice Ministry demanding the prisoners' immediate
release.
	   Some carried a banner that read: ``Hey government! What about
your promise to release more political prisoners?''
	   ``It seems that the government isn't really serious about
granting amnesties to more political prisoners,'' said Bonar Tigor
Naipospos, a former jailed dissident who now heads the Indonesian
Society for Humanity.
	   Last month Muladi said that most prisoners would be released.
	   However, the inmates to remain in prison would be those
convicted of working against the national philosophy Pancasila,
plotting against the state or simply of violent criminal acts.
	   They include many East Timorese rebels who have fought a
guerrilla war since 1975 against Indonesia's annexation of the
former Portuguese colony.
	   Among them are rebel leader Xanana Gusmao who is serving a
20-year prison term.
	   Last week United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan wrote to
Habibie urging him to release Gusmao.
	   However, the Indonesia's government maintains that he is a
violent criminal, not a political prisoner.
	   Pancasila is a five-point creed adopted when Indonesia declared
independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945. It calls for social
tolerance among Indonesia's 202 million ethnically diverse people
scattered over 17,000 islands.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets closed lower Tuesday on
fears that further depreciation in the yen, which fell to a
seven-year low, could spark another round of currency devaluations
in the region. Thai stock prices tumbled, with the key index
closing at an 11-year low as investors dumped the stock of the
country's biggest finance company, Phatra Thanakit PCL, after it
decided to sell half of its securities subsidiary. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index closed down 5.79 points, or 1.8 percent,
to 312.37, its lowest level since late 1987. Singapore shares fell
3.4 percent, reacting to news of the republic's first major
property development default and the continued weakness of the
Japanese yen and other regional currencies. The Singapore's
benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index fell 39.89 points to
1,128.57. News that a Singapore-Hong Kong joint venture missed a
deadline for a 68.6 million Singapore dollar (dlrs 40 million)
payment on a plot of land to develop condominiums dampened market
sentiment. In Hong Kong,share prices closed generally mixed in
light trading. The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of
blue chips, rose 17.16 points, or 0.2 percent, to 8,586.63. (ASIAN
MARKETS)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ In a sign Singapore will abandon predictions
for healthy economic growth this year, the government announced
Monday it will soon revise previous forecasts. Until now, the
government had stood by projections for between 2.5 percent and 4.5
percent growth, despite worrying indications that the regional
slowdown was deepening and the country was sliding into recession.
The previous forecast was made in February, before a clear picture
of the severity of Asia's economic slump emerged. Prior to the
announcement, the Singapore government had insisted that the
economy would grow at least 2.5 percent this year, though
occasionally had said it was ready to revise the forecast if
necessary. (SINGAPORE-RECESSION)
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Despite the economic turmoil in Asia,
prospects for growth in the rest of the world are looking positive,
according to a central bankers report released Monday. Long-running
economic expansion in the United States and Britain is set to
continue, says the annual report of the Basel-based Bank for
International Settlements, known as the central banker's central
bank. Serious spread of the Asian crisis to other parts of the
world has so far been avoided and the worst may be over in Asia
itself, according to the 199-page study. Rekindling growth in
another of the world's major economies, Japan, ``will not be easy''
and the full impact on Europe of the Asian crisis has still to be
assessed, the report says. In addition, tightening labor markets,
larger trade deficits and booming prices for financial assets show
inflationary risks are rising. (BANKERS-ECONOMY)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines said Monday a
crippling strike by pilots has caused potential foreign buyers of
the airline to break off talks and could force the company to shut
down. In an emotional statement, PAL said the 3-day-old strike by
more than 600 pilots is ``bleeding the airline dry,'' causing daily
losses of 150 million to 200 million pesos (dlrs 3.8 million to 5.1
million) in lost revenue. The union is protesting a new management
policy of ordering pilots to retire who have reached 20 years of
service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age. The policy puts
about 200 pilots in danger of forced retirement, the union said.
The airline earlier announced it must cut expenses by as much as 40
percent, slash flights, and sharply reduce its work force to
survive. PAL said Monday it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 205 million)
in the last fiscal year _ three times more than the previous year.
(PHILIPPINES-AIRLINE STRIKE)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Bankrupt Hanbo Steel Industry Co.,
South Korea's second largest steel maker, will be sold to foreign
investors later this year, its creditor banks said Monday. The
decision came after potential domestic investors, including
state-run Pohang Iron and Steel Corp., the nation's No. 1 steel
maker, gave up plans to take over the failed steel producer. Pohang
last week called back four of its executives who had worked as
court-appointed managers for Hanbo since the steel firm collapsed
under dlrs 6 billion in bank debts in January, 1997. Along with the
return of its officials, Pohang said it also stopped selling Hanbo
products through its sales networks under an arrangement with
Hanbo's creditors. The decision to sever ties with Hanbo was aimed
at avoiding trade friction with foreign countries, the statement
said. (SKOREA-HANBO STEEL)

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Diplomatic efforts were under way to
prevent the border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia from
exploding into full-scale war. Officials hope Monday's summit of
African leaders will produce new ideas for a settlement. African
heads of state gathered for a meeting of the Organization of

``We're anxious to see what they come up with,'' said Eritrean
government spokesman Isaac Yared. The OAU, hampered by the location
of its headquarters in Ethiopia and Eritrea's disinterest in the
organization, has played a minor role since the first border clash
on May 6. (ERITREA-ETHIOPIA)
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The EU may ban investments in Serbia and
freeze the country's assets abroad on Monday, tightening sanctions
that have so far failed to get Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to reach a negotiated settlement in Kosovo. The foreign
ministers of the 15 European Union nations discussed these measures
to punish Milosevic for cracking down on his independence-minded
southern province and prevent another Bosnia-style ethnic conflict.
The EU has already banned arms exports and restricted travel visas
for Yugoslav officials. But at Washington's urging, they have held
off on freezing Yugoslav assets abroad and the investment ban to
give Milosevic a chance to reach a peaceful settlement in Kosovo.
(EU-KOSOVO)
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An alleged Bosnian Croat
paramilitary leader charged with allowing a subordinate to rape a
prisoner went on trial Monday before the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal. Anto Furundzija, 28, was arrested in December by Dutch
troops in the central Bosnian town of Vitez. He has pleaded
innocent to two war crimes charges alleging that he stood by and
watched as a prisoner under interrogation was raped by one of his
troops in May 1993. Rape has been considered a war crime in other
cases before the U.N. court, but Furundzija's trial is the first to
deal specifically with sexual assault inflicted during the course
of an interrogation. (BOSNIA-WAR CRIMES)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers moved into two buildings in
Arab east Jerusalem before dawn Monday, stringing barbed wire,
hanging Israeli flags and setting off angry stone-throwing clashes
with Palestinian neighbors. It was the latest in a series of
escalating confrontations in Jerusalem's eastern sector as both
sides accuse the other of trying to grab land in the bitterly
contested city. At least two people were injured in Monday's
clashes in the Silwan neighborhood, including the top Palestinian
official in Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini. He was hit in the head with
a stone and slightly hurt before police and soldiers broke up the
melee. The settlers took over five apartments in two buildings,
plus a plot of land. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
reiterated his country's angry objections to pressure from the U.N.
Security Council to scrap its nuclear weapons program, telling
lawmakers India would not let anyone tell it what to do. His
statement in India's upper house of Parliament was quoted by local
news agencies. It came two days after the 15-member Council asked
both India and Pakistan, longtime rivals who escalated their arms
race with a series of tit-for-tat nuclear tests last month, to
resume talks to solve their disputes, especially over the Himalayan
territory of Kashmir they both claim. The Indian government on
Saturday released a statement calling the Security Council
resolution ``coercive and unhelpful.'' Monday, Vajpayee reiterated
his oft-repeated statement since his May 11-13 nuclear tests that
India will not let any other nation mediate in the Kashmir dispute.

 &UR; Algerian helicopter pilot granted temporary stay in Spain &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish police kept an Algerian military
helicopter pilot under observation Monday while the interior
ministry dealt with his request for political asylum.
	   The lieutenant, who was not identified by Spanish officials,
flew to Spain Sunday during military maneuvers, landing at the
Ibiza airport where he surrendered to authorities.
	   A foreign ministry spokeswoman said the pilot would be granted a
temporary stay under police observation while his request for
asylum is being reviewed by the interior ministry, a procedure that
usually takes several months.
	   Algeria sent a military crew to Spain to fly the helicopter back
home.
	   It was the first known case of asylum being requested by an
active member of the Algerian military forces, although many other
Algerians have sought asylum to escape poverty and alleged threats
from Islamic fundamentalists, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, who
declined to be identified, said.
	   At least 75,000 people have died in Algeria during an insurgency
resulting from the cancellation of the 1992 parliamentary elections
by the military-backed regime, apparently to head off victories by
Islamic candidates.
	   The revolt has worsened living conditions for many Algerians,
who have sought immigration visas at the embassies of Spain and
other European countries.

Soldiers get officers' TV sets to watch World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ In an attempt to keep army discipline
high during the World Cup, the defense ministry has ordered
television sets removed from the offices of commanders to soldiers'
barracks, private Nova TV reported Monday.
	   Over the weekend, the TV station broadcast the removal of
several television sets from offices in the ministry building in
Sofia. A duty officer was quoted as saying 130 television sets
would be removed from the capital alone.
	   ``This is a smart move. Otherwise the barracks will be empty
during the games of the national team,'' said Stoyan Garvanov, 23,
who was doing his compulsory military service during the last World
Cup in 1994.
	   After a series of sensational victories then, Bulgaria's soccer
team made it to the semi-finals, causing an unprecedented outbreak
of mass jubilation.
	   Expectations are again high, although the Bulgarian squad is now
aging and faces a tough group: heavily favored Spain; Nigeria, gold
medalist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics; and Paraguay.

Russian border guards kill two suspected Chinese poachers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards shot and killed two
suspected Chinese poachers after they allegedly resisted arrest and
attacked the Russians, the border guard command said Monday.
	   Commander of the Russian Far Eastern border district Alexander
Golbakh said he has notified the Chinese government of the
incident, which occurred June 4 in Russia's Makarikha Bay, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Golbakh said that during an attempt to detain the fishermen, one
of them attacked a Russian border guard with an axe, and the
officer was forced to open fire with a machine gun. Both Chinese
fishermen died from wounds, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Last month, a Russian border patrol boat opened fire on a
Chinese fishing boat in the Bering Sea, off the Kamchatka
Peninsula, killing two people and wounding five.
	   China acknowledged the boat was in a Russian zone, but
criticized the border guards' response, saying the deaths could
have been avoided.

Police arrest nine more suspects in anti-terror sweep; public

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities arrested nine more suspects
Monday in a Europe-wide effort to thwart a possible terrorist
attack during the World Cup, and they urged the public to watch out
for bombs.
	   The suspects were considered close to aides of Hassan Hattab, a
leader of the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria, who allegedly ordered
an attack during the games that begin Wednesday, authorities said.
	   The contacts between the suspects and the Algerian militants
``led us to believe that they could take action,'' said Interior
Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement.
	   The ministry pointed out that the new arrests came ``on the eve
of the opening ceremony of World Cup of soccer,'' being played in
10 cities across France.
	   ``We have to be vigilant, every citizen must be vigilant without
losing their sang-froid,'' Chevenement told reporters. ``If you see
something suspect, first get away, then call 17 (the emergency
police number).''
	   Seven of the suspects were arrested in the Paris area, while two
otherg people were apprehended in the southern city of Carpentras
and the northern city of Roubaix, police said.
	   The suspects were linked to two Hattab aides arrested in Germany
on May 26, in sweeps that have rounded up about 100 suspects in
France, Belgium, Italy and Switzerland as well as Germany.
	   The aides arrested were Omar Saiki, 29, in Cologne, and Abdel
Mechat, in Meckenheim.
	   Mechat faces an international arrest warrant filed by French
anti-terrorist Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere.
	   Known by its French initials GIA, the Armed Islamic Group is the
most violent movement in a six-year-old Muslim militant insurgency
in Algeria that has left more than 75,000 people dead.
	   Algerian militants have staged terrorist attacks in France to
pressure Paris to cut its ties with the military-backed government
of the petroleum-rich North African nation.

Reports: Loyalist troops in Guinea-Bissau attack holed-up rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Heavy gunfire could be heard in the
capital of Guinea Bissau, West Africa, early Monday as troops loyal
to the government apparently tried to dislodge renegade soldiers
from two military barracks, news reports said.
	   The gunfire was centered on the Bissau suburb of Bra where an
unknown number of soldiers were holed up at a military base after
clashing with other troops on Sunday, the Portuguese state-run news
agency Lusa reported in a dispatch monitored here.
	   Troops and police ordered inhabitants of Bra to leave the area
where automatic weapons and heavy artillery were being used to oust
the rebels, Lusa said.
	   The military complex is also a weapons depot and the rebels were
believed to be heavily armed.
	   In a sign that the revolt could be spreading outside the
capital, Lusa reported an unidentified local source as saying that
fighting had also broken out at Mansoa, 60 kilometers (37 miles)
from Bissau.
	   The rebels, reportedly led by a former head of the armed forces
who was angered at being dismissed, took refuge at the Bra barracks
after sporadic clashes which began early Sunday at the military
high command building. Ten soldiers were killed in the fighting,
according to Lusa.
	   The capital reportedly was calm late Sunday, but fresh fighting
was reported in Bra at 2:30 a.m. (0230 GMT) Monday when government
forces apparently launched a first attack on the Bra barracks. A
second attack was launched at 5:30 a.m. (0530 GMT), according to
Lusa.
	   Few people were on the streets of the capital, where there was a
heavy troop presence, but no clashes were reported outside the Bra
suburb.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira said Sunday that former armed
forces chief Brig. Ansumane Mane was leading the revolt and was
backed by members of political opposition parties.
	   In a statement read on public radio, Vieira vowed to ``use all
possible means'' to quash the revolt.
	   Mane was fired six months ago during an official investigation
into the trafficking of arms to the separatist rebels of Casamanca,
a Senegalese province that borders north Guinea-Bissau.
	   Mane formally stepped down and was replaced at a ceremony in
Bissau last Saturday.
	   Reports said that troops had set up roadblocks on routes to the
presidential palace and other government buildings and military
installations.
	   Guinea Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, has a population of
about 1 million.

Taiwan to keep liberalizing currency market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The Taiwan dollar hit an 11-year low
against the U.S. dollar on Monday, but a top economic planner said
the drop won't prompt tighter regulation of the currency market.
	   The government will continue to let the market set the exchange
rate while attempting to keep speculation to a minimum, said Chiang
Pin-kung, chairman of the Council of Economic Planning and
Development.
	   ``We will respect the market,'' Chiang said at a briefing for
foreign reporters.
	   Reacting to the Japanese yen's dive and flagging exports, the
Taiwan dollar dropped to 34.69 to U.S. dlrs 1 on Monday, the lowest
level since March 1987.
	   Though anchored by solid fundamentals and U.S. dlrs 83 billion
in foreign currency reserves, Taiwan is feeling aftershocks from
the crisis in markets and currency shaking much of Asia. Japan's
economic woes are piling additional stress on the economy.
	   The local currency has fallen by about 18 percent since June
1997, and exports fell by 6.7 percent in the first four months of
1998, the CEPD announced.
	   But Taiwan's market is so open that it has become unfeasible to
defend the currency with foreign reserves, Chiang said, citing
rules permitting citizens to remit up to U.S. dlrs 5 million
overseas each year.
	   Even so, the Central Bank has also sought to deter speculators,
and banned trade in the non-deliverable forward market on May 22.
	   With the regional crisis still roiling, it will ``not be easy,''
for Taiwan to achieve 6 percent gross domestic product growth in
1998, Chiang said. The GDP grew by an estimated 6.8 percent last
year, and the CEPD had originally set a target of 6.7 percent
growth in 1998.
	   A cheaper yen has worsened Taiwan's already massive trade
deficit with Japan by motivating Japanese firms to make goods at
home instead of ordering them from Taiwan, Chiang said. That
contributed to a widening of the deficit with Japan to U.S. dlrs
1.39 billion in May, compared to 1.11 billion in May 1997.
	   Taiwan will look to domestic investment in infrastructure and
other areas to keep the economy moving, Chiang said.

Hundreds of thousands of honeybees block Transylvania highway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of honeybees
blocked a national highway for a third day Monday after a truck
transporting 130 beehives overturned, a police officer said.
	   ``We had to reroute the traffic because the bees were attacking
the drivers, but we did not want to kill them,'' Lt. Rozalia
Slatean of the Satu Mare Police said by telephone.
	   The truck transporting the hives to a Transylvanian bee farm
overturned near the town of Decebal, 450 kilometers (281 miles)
northwest of Bucharest.
	   Slatean said bee farmer Ioan Bal is moving the damaged
honeycombs and the queen bees to new hives to lure the bees away
from the overturned truck.
	   Bal told police the accident resulted in lei 80 million (almost
dlrs 10,000) in damages. No one was injured.

Lorne Welch, daredevil World War II escapee, dead at 81
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lorne Welch, a daredevil British glider who was
central to two fabled escapes by British prisoners in World War II,
has died. He was 81.
	   Welch died May 15 at his home in Farnham, southwest of London,
where he lived in retirement indulging another favorite hobby,
yachting, Cause of death was not announced.
	   A test flight observer before the war, Welch, an outstanding
pilot, became a training instructor with the Royal Air Force. But
in 1942, with Britain seeking to flatten key German cities with
1,000 bombing raids, Welch flew his Wellington trainer into combat.
	   He was shot down over Nazi-occupied Holland on his fourth raid
and sent to the Stalagluft III prison camp in Silesia.. He was
later in Colditz, the huge Saxon castle where the Germans put their
most escape-prone Allied prisoners.
	   At Stalagluft III, Welch, an aeronautical engineer, put his
technical skills to work. Using parts of two beds, two duffel bags,
nine coathooks, four ice-hockey sticks, four table tennis bats and
leather from a flying boot, he built the ventilation pump for a 100
yard (90-meter) tunnel, ``Harry.'' through which 76 prisoners
escaped in 1944.
	   It was one of the largest mass breakouts by Allied prisoners,
ended in atrocity, and was made into a movie, ``The Great Escape,''
in 1963. Seventy-three of the escapees were recaptured and 50
summarily executed.
	   Before the tunnel escape, Welch had already left. On June 16,
1943, Welch and his cellmate, Walter Morison, walked out through
the main gate wearing fake Germany uniforms. They were recaptured a
week later on their second attempt to steal a German warplane and
fly to Sweden.
	   Obvious candidates for Colditz, Welch and Morison arrived at the
castle to find what might have been World War II's most audacious
escape in preparation: the construction of a full-sized, two-man
glider in a walled-off section of the castle attic.
	   Welch checked the glider for airworthiness, but before it could
be used, U.S. forces liberated Colditz in 1945. Prisoners displayed
the glider to openmouthed guards.
	   After the war, Welch was the first person to glide twice across
the English Channel, flew in four world gilding championships, and
worked as a glider test pilot and engineer.
	   Patrick Palles Lorne Elphinstone Welch, the son of an army
general, is survived by his wife, Ann, whom he married in 1953, and
their daughter.

EU bans new investments in Serbia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by Kinkel; picks up 12th graf pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The EU banned new investments in Serbia Monday
and denounced Belgrade for staging ``widespread house-burning and
indiscriminate artillery attacks on whole villages'' in the
province of Kosovo.
	   Serbia ``is engaged in a campaign of violence going far beyond
what could legitimately be described as a targeted anti-terrorist
operation,'' the EU foreign ministers said in a statement.
	   There was no word of freezing Yugoslav assets abroad, something
France, Italy and Greece opposed.
	   The EU urged Belgrade and Kosovo independence activists to seek
a negotiated solution to their conflict, but said President
Slobodan Milosevic bore ``special responsibility'' for that as the
Yugoslav head of state.
	   Citing ``the grave deteriorating situation on the ground,
involving the excessive use of force by the Serb security forces,''
it banned all new investments in Serbia.
	   The EU promised ``other measures'' unless the violence is
halted. It has already banned arms exports and restricted travel
visas for Yugoslav officials. But at Washington's urging, had held
off on the investment ban to give Milosevic a chance to reach a
peaceful settlement in Kosovo.
	   That has not worked. Further sanctions could include a ban on
all flights by JAT, the Yugoslav airline.
	   The EU move was unlikely make an immediate difference. ``The
fight (to get Milosevic to ease up on Kosovo) clearly lies within
the United Nations Security Council,'' said a Dutch official.
	   Escalating violence in Kosovo in recent weeks has drawn
parallels with West European waffling in 1991 and 1992 as Bosnia
slipped into civil war.
	   EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek said it was
more critical at this stage that the NATO ``defense ministers
accelerate their work'' to forge a military response to Milosevic.
	   On Thursday and Friday, those defense ministers meet in Brussels
to consider such a response though in recent weeks that option has
sparked little enthusiasm.
	   And on Friday the foreign ministers of the G-8 nations _ Canada,
United States, Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and Russia _
will discuss Kosovo in London.
	   Russian support for any action against Milosevic is crucial.
``It is very important we include Russia in our efforts,'' said
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel but added to reporters ``that
will be difficult.''
	   Kinkel was to meet later Monday in Bonn with Yevgeny Primakov,
his Russian counterpart.
	   At the EU meeting, he and Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schussel proposed similar road maps to peace in Kosovo through a
series of confidence-building steps, such as the deployment of
observers, a cease fire, an orderly return of refugees and
international mediation.

Freed unionist: another protest possible in 2 weeks

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Newly freed Indonesian labor unionist Muchtar
Pakpahan said Monday another national demonstration may be held in
two weeks' time ``to stop (President B.J.) Habibie.''
	   ``Our struggle is not yet ended,'' Pakpahan told a news
conference. He called for ``credible government,'' through the
convening of a special assembly to elect a transition president and
pave the way for fully democratic elections next year.
	   Habibie has said electoral reforms will be in place by August
this year and parliamentary and presidential elections held before
December 1999.
	   ``The government cannot solve all the problems itself without
involving civil society,'' Pakpahan said.
	   Massive riots in May killed 500 people and helped force
ex-President Suharto to quit, ending his iron-fisted three decades
in power.
	   Habibie, a former Suharto aide, is tainted by corruption and
nepotism, Pakpahan said.
	   Pakpahan, president of the independent Indonesian Welfare Labor
Union, was released from prison last month. He had served two years
of a three-year sentence for allegedly organizing a 1994 workers'
riot in Sumatra.
	   Last week, Habibie's government recognized Pakpahan's union and
said it would soon ratify an International Labor Organization
convention on workers' rights.
	   Pakpahan, who is attending an ILO conference in Geneva, said he
would not run for president in an election. The union could help in
establishing new political parties but wouldn't itself take a
political role, he said.
	   The International Monetary fund should halt aid to Indonesia
unless the government accounts for its use of the money, Pakpahan
said.
	   	   Habibie's government has pledged to abide by requirements of the
IMF's dlrs 43 billion bailout of the economy, suspended during the
uncertain days of political upheaval.
	   ``If there is no transparency, do not give the aid,'' Pakpahan
said.

Algerian helicopter pilot granted temporary stay in Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish police kept an Algerian military
helicopter pilot under observation Monday while the interior
ministry dealt with his request for political asylum, a procedure
that usually takes several months, a foreign ministry spokeswoman
said.
	   The lieutenant, who was not identified by Spanish officials,
flew Sunday to Spain during military maneuvers, landing at the
Ibiza airport where he surrendered to authorities.
	   Algeria sent a military crew to Spain to fly the helicopter back
home.
	   It was the first known case of asylum being requested by an
active member of the Algerian military forces, although many other
Algerians have sought asylum to escape poverty and alleged threats
from Islamic fundamentalists, said the foreign ministry
spokeswoman, who declined to be identified.
	   At least 75,000 people have died in Algeria during an insurgency
resulting from the cancellation of the 1992 parliamentary elections
by the military-backed regime, apparently to head off victories by
Islamic candidates.
	   The revolt has worsened living conditions for many Algerians,
who have sought immigration visas at the embassies of Spain and
other European countries.

World Cup: Platini says French authorities don't care about World
</HEADLINE>
Cup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Michel Platini, co-president of the World Cup
organizing committee, says French authorities have turned their
back on the soccer tournament and aren't providing enough support.
	   ``France has done what it had to do, but nothing more,'' Platini
said in an interview published Monday by the newspaper Le Parisien.
	   ``Take the big party in Paris on `Day One,' for example. Can you
believe that it's been hard to get authorizations? They don't give
a damn,'' he was quoted in the interview.
	   Platini said it had cost 50 million francs (dlrs 8.3 million) to
organize festivities on Tuesday night (June 9) _ ``Day One'' _
featuring huge processions and concerts around the capital.
	   The tournament kicks off the next day with the opening match
between Brazil and Scotland at Stade de France stadium in the Paris
suburb of Saint-Denis.
	   The World Cup, with 32 nations competing in the biggest-ever
final field, has already been undermined by a strike by Air France
pilots, threatening to disrupt travel during the month-long
tournament.
	   Platini said France could win the World Cup for the first time
and that 10 teams were in the running.
	   ``I think France can,'' he predicted in the interview. ``Never
has a World Cup been so open. Ten teams stand a chance of
winning.''
	   But France's greatest player and former national coach said
there was a laissez-faire attitude toward the tournament in general
in France.
	   ``Not everybody feels concerned by this event. For example the
Culture Ministry doesn't give a damn. We have no links with them,''
he was quoted. ``So in many areas nothing has been planned.''
	   Preparations at many of the 10 venues depended solely ``on the
personality of the (local) mayor,'' he was quoted saying.

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ A pan-African summit touted as
a forum for peace was focusing instead on the potential for war
between Ethiopia and Eritrea as heads of state began meeting
Monday.
	   Amid heavy security with soldiers lining the streets, at least
16 leaders had arrived in Burkina Faso's capital of Ouagadougou for
the Organization of African Unity summit.
	   Other leaders, including South Africa's President Nelson Mandela
were expected here later Monday as the three-day summit opened.
	   ``The continent received as a shock and with concern the news of
the crisis,'' OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said Monday
of the conflict in the Horn of Africa. ``This unfortunate
development constitutes a severe setback to our efforts at forging
peace, security and stability.''
	   OAU talks quickly shifted from developing peace to avoiding war.
On Saturday, OAU foreign ministers broke from their scheduled talks
and urgently appealed for Ethiopia and Eritrea to adopt a peace
plan.
	   ``The Council of Ministers appeals to the two parties to put an
end to all hostilities,'' their statement said.
	   Ethiopian warplanes struck out at Eritrean targets over the
weekend.
	   South Africa's Mandela and the presidents of Djibouti, Uganda
and Kenya, called Eritrea's leaders over the weekend to encourage a
negotiated settlement.
	   Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki, who has accused Ethiopia of
declaring war, dispatched his foreign minister, Haile Woldensae, to
Burkina Faso. Ethiopia's President Meles Zenawi also sent his
foreign minister, Seyoum Mesfin.
	   The OAU has had little impact on the border clash since it began
on May 6.
	   Diplomats in Burkina Faso said summit delegates plan to draft a
resolution on the conflict after making recommendations to their
leaders over the weekend.
	   Although host Burkina Faso have dubbed the event a ``summit for
change,'' so far the OAU has done little more than call for an end
to hostilities and offer support for a U.S.-Rwandan peace proposal.
	   OAU Assistant Secretary-General Pascal Gayama told journalists
that the organization would work closely with Rwandan and U.S.
mediators.
	   Other African conflict zones such as Sudan, where southern
animist rebels are fighting a protracted guerrilla war against the
northern Muslim government, are not expected to figure prominently
at the summit.
	   In addition to African heads of state, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is also attending.

Thai Food and Drug Administration approves Viagra, with conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Food and Drug Administration
conditionally approved the sale of the new impotence drug Viagra on
Monday.
	   Pfizer, the maker of Viagra, had been seeking FDA approval since
February, but company officials had complained the Thai agency was
moving too slowly to test and register the medication.
	   Consequently, a black market in the drug had emerged, with a
single pill selling for 1,800 baht (dlrs 45), FDA officials said.
	   Mongkol na Songkhla, secretary general of the FDA, said Viagra
would be available in Thailand in one or two months. Pfizer must
first put a label on its medicine warning against use by children,
women and heart patients, and clarify marketing procedures before
the drug will receive final approval.
	   Even then, Viagra will not be available in drug stores, but will
only be sold in hospital pharmacies with a prescription from either
a urologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist or psychiatrist.
	   The pill will then be priced at 400 baht (dlrs 10) each, the
same as in the United States.
	   Mongkol estimated there are about 100,000 Thais who qualify for
prescriptions.
	   He said the FDA will continue to monitor the drug after its
approval because of questions about its safety, although he added
there was no proof at this point it is dangerous.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As Europe banned investment in
Serbia and weighed other ways to halt violence in Kosovo, Serbs
reported fresh clashes in the secessionist province Monday and a
U.S. diplomat and ethnic Albanian leader toured a battle-torn area.
	   European Union foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, banned
investment in Serbia for ''a campaign of violence going far
beyond'' a legitimate strike against terrorists.
	   Britain, currently chairman of the EU, is sounding increasingly
determined to engage NATO troops in the southern Balkans, both to
stop the Kosovo violence spilling over into neighboring Macedonia
and Albania and maybe in Kosovo itself.
	   Washington also wants to stop Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic using police and army against militants battling for
independence for Kosovo's Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   ``A credible discouragement in the direction of President
Milosevic is indispensible,'' said British foreign secretary Robin
Cook at the EU meeting.
	   ``I also hope for support in the steps Britain is taking to get
the measures within the United Nations and NATO agreed to stop the
violence in Kosovo,'' he added.
	   In Pristina Monday, a daily march by Kosovo Albanians for peace
passed off without incident. On Sunday, more than 100 Serbian
police broke up the demonstration, injuring at least six Albanians.
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, joined
ethnic Albanian Fehmi Agani on a trip to the Decani region in
western Kosovo, scene of fierce fighting last week.
	   A convoy of diplomats, joined by journalists for Serbian
state-run media and one independent journalist, toured the region
Sunday and saw ghastly scenes reminiscent of the earlier wars in
Bosnia and Croatia.
	   Independent journalist Aleksandar Vasovic said the group saw
many houses that had been shelled or burned out, and several
deserted villages. Serbian police said the militants started the
fighting, but Dutch ambassador Jan Sizoo was skeptical.
	   Up to 20,000 refugees from the Decani area have fled into
neighboring Albania. Another 7,000 to 10,000 are in Montenegro, the
only other Yugoslav republic, and some 50,000 are thought to be
displaced within Kosovo itself.
	   Many of that group are hiding out in the Drenica region in the
center of the province, where Serbian police began their crackdown
in early March. Since then, more than 250 people have been killed.
	   The Serbian Media Center, which is close to Kosovo authorities,
said militants attacked Drenica's last two Serb villages Monday.
But villagers returned fire, and no injuries were reported, the
Media Center said.
	   On Sunday, Serb forces reportedly continued shelling suspected
militant positions in western Kosovo. The diplomats' convoy saw no
fighting in areas it visited.
	   Ethnic Albanian officials say the campaign in the west has
killed at least 50 people and 200 others have gone missing since
late May.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the 2.2 million
inhabitants of Kosovo, and most want to secede from Serbia. Western
powers oppose any change of borders, but want Serbia to restore the
broad autonomy it took away in 1989.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Sunday and they agreed to send a ``strong message'' that
the Serb offensive is unacceptable, a Blair aide said.
	   The United States and others planned deliberations this week on
what steps to take. British newspapers said the powers might
discuss military intervention.
	   In Washington, a top U.S. senator said Sunday that Kosovo ``has
the potential to become another Bosnia.''
	   ``We cannot allow this slaughter to occur. Once again the
Serbians are out of control. Something should be done,'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott said on CNN's ``Late Edition.''
	   Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, said he would not rule out
the use of American troops. He said the United States should
``always be reluctant to use military force,'' but ``I'm not saying
we should not consider troops if it continues the way it is
going.''
	   Balkan foreign ministers were meeting in Turkey Monday and may
discuss Kosovo. NATO is due to weigh its moves later this week, and
the foreign ministers of the Contact Group _ the United States,
Britian, France, Germany and Russia, joined by Canada and Italy _
is to consider further steps Friday.

New Zealanders warm up to meet England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Embattled England rugby coach Clive
Woodward was on hand to watch a polished display by the likely All
Blacks squad in New Zealand's trial match on Monday.
	   The All Blacks will play two tests against England, which
suffered its biggest ever beating in Saturday's 76-0 loss to
Australia. While New Zealand talk back radio callers suggested the
English should play New Zealand's World Cup winning women's team,
instead of the All Blacks, Woodward maintained his optimism.
	   ``When you play rugby and get beaten by a score like that then
all you want to do is play again and set the record straight,''
Woodward said Monday. ``We're looking forward immensely to our next
game, and every other game on this tour.''
	   England plays five matches in New Zealand, starting with a game
against New Zealand A on Saturday.
	   That team will be based around the A team beaten 55-14 by the
shadow All Blacks squad Monday.
	   In a match which lacked the intensity and ruggedness of last
year's trial the All Blacks, playing as the New Zealand Barbarians
in a red strip, showed they would be a most dangerous proposition
for England.
	   New Zealand A lacked cohesion and teamwork, but looked a team
that will improve dramatically with time together ahead of next
Saturday's game against England in Hamilton.
	   The standout feature of the match was the performance by
Canterbury center Mark Mayerhofler who worked tirelessly and showed
himself to be a most accomplished player in the midfield.
	   The other player under pressure was scrum half Ofisa Tonu'u who
kept things simple in this match and did what was expected ahead of
Tuesday's naming of the test team.
	   There were a lot of mistakes in the game with the Barbarians
making the most of endless turnovers by the New Zealand A side.
	   ``We knew it would be intense, but it was a pity that the
conditions were slippery tonight,'' All Blacks captain in waiting
and Barbarians leader Taine Randell said.
	   ``The New Zealand A side wanted to run the ball, but it was too
slippery but we're happy with the win in the end. ``I think we were
a bit rusty to start but our defense picked up and we know England
had a bad game but they'll get better.''

Lorne Welch, daredevil World War II escapee, dead at 81
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lorne Welch, a daredevil British glider who was
central to two fabled escapes by British prisoners in World War II,
has died. He was 81.
	   Welch died May 15 at his home in Farnham, southwest of London,
where he lived in retirement indulging another favorite hobby,
yachting, Cause of death was not announced.
	   A test flight observer before the war, Welch, an outstanding
pilot, became a training instructor with the Royal Air Force. But
in 1942, with Britain seeking to flatten key German cities with
1,000 bombing raids, Welch flew his Wellington trainer into combat.
	   He was shot down over Nazi-occupied Holland on his fourth raid
and sent to the Stalagluft III prison camp in Silesia.. He was
later in Colditz, the huge Saxon castle where the Germans put their
most escape-prone Allied prisoners.
	   At Stalagluft III, Welch, an aeronautical engineer, put his
technical skills to work. Using parts of two beds, two duffel bags,
nine coathooks, four ice-hockey sticks, four table tennis bats and
leather from a flying boot, he built the ventilation pump for a 100
yard (90-meter) tunnel, ``Harry.'' through which 76 prisoners
escaped in 1944.
	   It was one of the largest mass breakouts by Allied prisoners,
ended in atrocity, and was made into a movie, ``The Great Escape,''
in 1963. Seventy-three of the escapees were recaptured and 50
summarily executed.
	   Before the tunnel escape, Welch had already left. On June 16,
1943, Welch and his cellmate, Walter Morison, walked out through
the main gate wearing fake German uniforms. They were recaptured a
week later on their second attempt to steal a German warplane and
fly to Sweden.
	   Obvious candidates for Colditz, Welch and Morison arrived at the
castle to find what might have been World War II's most audacious
escape in preparation: the construction of a full-sized, two-man
glider in a walled-off section of the castle attic.
	   Welch checked the glider for airworthiness, but before it could
be used, U.S. forces liberated Colditz in 1945. Prisoners displayed
the glider to openmouthed guards.
	   After the war, Welch was the first person to glide twice across
the English Channel, flew in four world gilding championships, and
worked as a glider test pilot and engineer.
	   Patrick Palles Lorne Elphinstone Welch, the son of an army
general, is survived by his wife, Ann, whom he married in 1953, and
their daughter.

Under veil of secrecy, Palestinian casino is going up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ The curtains are tightly drawn at the
Seven Trees restaurant to keep what many in this Muslim town would
consider a shameful secret _ young Palestinians are training to
deal blackjack and spin roulette wheels.
	   The croupiers are to go to work this fall in a luxury casino
hotel being built in the desert near biblical Jericho and just
across the road from the mud-brick huts of the Aqabat Jaber refugee
camp.
	   Yasser Arafat's government considers the dlrs 46 million casino
is an important marker on the Palestinians' long road from
dependence on international handouts to prosperity.
	   But Islamic militants _ led by the Hamas group, Arafat's most
powerful political rival _ say they will try to scuttle the
project. Gambling is ``haram,'' or forbidden by Islam, they say.
	   At stake is more than a Palestinian mini-Las Vegas.
	   The casino planners, headed by Mohammed Rashid, Arafat's
free-wheeling economic adviser, believe Palestinians will have an
economic future only if they can attract large numbers of tourists
and develop a service industry.
	   Hamas fears that would lead to the dismantling of traditional
Palestinian society. ``We consider this project a serious challenge
to Islam and to Muslims,'' said Ismail Hanieh, a Hamas leader.
	   The casino planners are trying to keep things under wraps until
the opening, tentatively set for late August.
	   No billboards announce that the gray concrete colossus going up
next to the Jerusalem-Jericho highway will be a 200-room, five-star
hotel with 220 slot machines and 28 gaming tables.
	   In Jericho, the training of the casino staff is kept quiet, too.
In recent weeks, would-be croupiers, cashiers and security guards
have been learning their trade behind drawn curtains in a hall of
the Seven Trees garden restaurant otherwise used for weddings.
	   During a recent visit, a reporter caught a glimpse of blackjack
and roulette tables in the hall and job applicants filling out
forms at outdoor tables, but was not permitted to interview any of
them.
	   Instructors from Britain, Denmark and elsewhere were brought in
by the lead contractor, Casinos Austria International Ltd., which
is based in Brisbane, Australia.
	   Its parent company runs 12 casinos in Austria and is involved in
an additional 100 gaming halls worldwide. Palestinian investors and
Arafat's Palestinian Authority are junior partners in the Jericho
project.
	   Rashid said the casino hotel and an adjacent golf course would
eventually employ 1,200 people, 98 percent of them Palestinians.
	   Already, the project has proven a boon for Aqabat Jaber, a
refugee camp of 4,000 people and few jobs. Every morning, workers
from the camp trudge across the road to the construction site.
Others stream in from Jericho and other West Bank towns.
	   Those less lucky sit near the camp's main square, pondering
whether it is more important to feed a family or observe the edicts
of Islam.
	   Abdel Rahman Yaghi, a blacksmith, said he sought spiritual
advice when offered a two-day welding job at the casino. The camp
preacher said no, but Yaghi, a father of six, went anyway. ``We
have to work, and we have to live,'' he said, sipping mint tea
outside his idle workshop.
	   Jericho's preacher, Sheik Harb Jaber, has allowed members of his
flock to do construction work at the site, but said it was
absolutely ``haram'' to seek employment in the casino itself.
	   ``Gambling is the work of the devil,'' Jaber said during an
interview in his Jericho home.
	   Claiming most townsfolk agree with him, Jaber said he will keep
preaching against the casino, but do no more than that.
	   Rashid said he didn't mind criticism but warned that the
Palestinian Authority would not tolerate any violence aimed at the
casino.
	   ``We are not forcing anyone to work there. We are not forcing
anyone to visit,'' Rashid said.
	   Casino officials are evasive about whether they will bar
Palestinians from gambling as a peace offering to Hamas.
	   Casinos Austria said in a statement it will try to attract
gamblers from ``Israel and international markets, i.e.
non-Palestine passport holders.''
	   Most Israelis are reluctant to enter Palestinian-governed areas,
fearing attacks by Islamic radicals. However, the lure of slot
machines is powerful, especially now that the casinos in Turkey,
once a popular destination for Israeli gamblers, have shut down.
	   The Jericho casino is conveniently close _ just a little over an
hour's drive from Tel Aviv and 30 minutes from Jerusalem. From the
nearest Israeli military outpost, it's just 200 yards (meters) to
the roulette tables.
	   Most foreign visitors to the Holy Land now book into Israeli
hotels and spend only a few hours in Palestinian towns. Rashid
wants to tempt them to stay longer.
	   In addition to building the casino, he plans to celebrate the
millennium in Bethlehem, Jesus' traditional birthplace, with an
international beauty pageant and a world class soccer tournament.
	   ``To attract tourists, you don't only take them to see where
Jesus was born. You have to give them attractions,'' he said.

Burnt-out houses, village ruins stand silent testimony of clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DECANI-PEC ROAD IN KOSOVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ghastly scenes
reminiscent of earlier wars in Bosnia and Croatia confronted the
first foreign diplomats allowed into the area of secessionist
Kosovo province that saw intense fighting over the past week.
	   The burnt-out, shelled houses and deserted villages seemed
likely to increase foreign pressure on Serbia to stop using its
police and army against militants battling for independence for
Kosovo's 9-to-1 ethnic Albanian majority.
	   ``What we've seen is all sorrow, all grief ... all those
villages burned and destroyed, all the people had left,'' said
Dutch ambassador Jan Sizoo.
	   After more than a week of clashes between Serb forces and
militants in the region of Decani, a group of foreign diplomats
from Belgrade, Serbian journalists and a correspondent from The
Associated Press were escorted Sunday into the area.
	   With the main east-west artery traversing the province closed,
the diplomats' convoy, escorted by police, took several hours by
roundabout route to reach the Decani area, 75 kilometers (50 miles)
west of the provincial capital Pristina.
	   After seeing only ``part of what one could call a battlefield,''
Sizoo said : ``We've been told that the blame is on the terrorists
who started first. But, this statement is very difficult to defend
_ for a conflict you always need two parties.''
	   Last week's fighting triggered an exodus of 20,000 Kosovo
Albanians into northern Albania. Another 7,000 to 10,000 refugees
fled to the neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro and more
than 50,000 people are believed displaced within Kosovo itself.
	   More than 250 people have died in Kosovo since early March, when
Serb forces began battling militants of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which claims it is rapidly gaining ground and controls the rugged
central and western parts of the province.
	   Even Streoce, the first village the convoy saw just outside Pec,
in northwestern Kosovo, bore scars of heavy fighting. More than 20
houses were completely burned or shelled out. Apart from a few
well-armed policemen, no living being could be seen.
	   On the outskirts of Decani, a town of 35,000 inhabitants,
freshly painted-over shop windows could not conceal the UCK
graffiti _ the Albanian language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is fighting to wrest the province away from Serbia.
	   At the police station, the diplomats were shown an array of
weapons police said were confiscated from militants in the
fighting.
	   Some ethnic Albanians are said to be still in parts of Decani
untouched by fighting. But the visitors saw none.
	   ``How long will they keep burning us out? Somebody has to take
the blame for all this _ either we, they (Albanians) or the
state,'' said a 70-year-old Serb who gave only his first name,
Sreten.
	   Further along the Decani road leading to Djakovica, the scenery
recalled some of the worst of Bosnia and Croatia.
	   Many heavily damaged houses were totally burned out. Cartridges
littered the streets.
	   The KLA ``used houses built of concrete transformed into real
military bunkers,'' Maj. Gen. Sreten Lukic of the Serbian police
told the visitors. He said the ethnic Albanians carried away their
dead and wounded, whenever possible, making it difficult to
estimate the number of casualties.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have said more than 50 people were
killed and that some 200 men were missing and presumed captured
following the offensive.
	   In Prilep, seven kilometers (four miles) south of Decani, stray
cattle roamed the ghostly village. Houses were peppered with bullet
scars. Some had gashing holes made by grenades.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ In an attempt to keep army discipline
high during the World Cup, Bulgaria's defense ministry has ordered
television sets removed from the offices of commanders to soldiers'
barracks, private Nova TV reported Monday.
	   Over the weekend, the TV station broadcast the removal of
several television sets from offices in the ministry building in
Sofia. A duty officer was quoted as saying 130 television sets
would be removed from the capital alone.
	   ``This is a smart move. Otherwise the barracks will be empty
during the games of the national team,'' said Stoyan Garvanov, 23,
who was doing his compulsory military service during the last World
Cup in 1994.
	   After a series of sensational victories then, Bulgaria's soccer
team made it to the semifinals, causing an unprecedented outbreak
of mass jubilation.
	   Expectations are again high, although the Bulgarian squad is now
older and faces a tough group: heavily favored Spain; Nigeria, gold
medalist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics; and Paraguay.

Indonesians to probe human rights abuses in Irian Jaya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Investigators will probe allegations
that villagers were killed after a 1996 military operation to free
hostages held by separatists in remote Irian Jaya, a human rights
official said Monday.
	   Asmara Nababan, one of 25 members of Indonesia's National
Commission on Human Rights, said a three-person team was scheduled
to leave Jakarta on Wednesday for Jayapura, the provincial capital.
	   The investigation will focus on recent reports by three local
church leaders about violations following the rescue in May 1996 of
six foreigners _ four Britons, two Dutch _ and three Indonesians
held by rebels.
	   The six were rescued by Indonesian troops after being held for
four months by the Free Papua Movement, a rebel group fighting
Indonesian rule in the western New Guinea.
	   According to the Church leaders, at least 11 villagers were shot
dead and some were missing following the rescue. Some churches and
houses were also burned down in the villages of Bella, Alama, and
Jila, about 3,452 kilometers (2,157 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   More than 150 students recently occupied the local council in
demanding the investigation of the alleged killings.

Top Hong Kong adviser: Hong Kong might see budget deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong could see its first budget deficit in
three years as the region's economic woes spill over into the
territory, a top government adviser said Monday.
	   Chung Sze-yuen, convenor of the Executive Council, Hong Kong
leader Tung Chee-hwa's de facto cabinet, told reporters ``it is of
course very possible'' that the budget for fiscal year 1998-9 may
end in the red.
	   Reduced revenues from land sales will strain the government's
budget this year, which has been characterized by extensive tax
cuts and higher public spending, he said.
	   Public spending also may exceed budget estimates as the
government pushes infrastructure projects ahead of schedule to
stimulate the economy and create jobs.
	   Pressure has been mounting for the government to adopt a deficit
budget next financial year as the local economy continues to suffer
from slumping property prices, sluggish retail sales and high
interest rates.
	   Last week, leaders of seven major political parties from across
the political spectrum agreed at a rare meeting to back a deficit
budget if necessary.
	   Frustrated with the government, the parties came up with their
own six-measure stimulus package, including cuts in government fees
and a refund of pre-paid taxes to taxpayers to boost consumer
spending.
	   The parties, which together won more than two-thirds of the 60
seats in last month's legislative election, are seen to have a
significant influence on Tung.
	   But despite the growing pressure, Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang told reporters Monday that it was too early to say whether a
deficit budget was needed next year.
	   ``One year's deficit is not going to solve the problem. The most
important task ahead is to improve the business environment in Hong
Kong,'' to attract foreign investment, Tsang said.
	   The economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter, the first
contraction since 1985, which prompted the government to admit that
its initial annual forecast of 3.5 percent was unattainable.
Unemployment is at a 13-year high of 3.9 percent.
	   In February, Tsang forecast a fiscal surplus of 10.7 billion
Hong Kong dollars, based on a projected economic growth of 3.5
percent. He had declined to give a revised forecast.

Reports: Loyalist troops in Guinea-Bissau attack holed-up rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Heavy gunfire could be heard in the
capital of Guinea Bissau, West Africa, early Monday as troops loyal
to the government apparently tried to dislodge renegade soldiers
from two military barracks, news reports said.
	   The gunfire was centered on the Bissau suburb of Bra where an
unknown number of soldiers were holed up at a military base after
clashing with other troops on Sunday, the Portuguese state-run news
agency Lusa reported in a dispatch monitored here.
	   Troops and police ordered inhabitants of Bra to leave the area
where automatic weapons and heavy artillery were being used to oust
the rebels, Lusa said.
	   The military complex is also a weapons depot and the rebels were
believed to be heavily armed.
	   In a sign that the revolt could be spreading outside the
capital, Lusa reported an unidentified local source as saying that
fighting had also broken out at Mansoa, 60 kilometers (37 miles)
from Bissau.
	   The rebels, reportedly led by a former head of the armed forces
who was angered at being dismissed, took refuge at the Bra barracks
after sporadic clashes which began early Sunday at the military
high command building. Ten soldiers were killed in the fighting,
according to Lusa.
	   The capital reportedly was calm late Sunday, but fresh fighting
was reported in Bra at 2:30 a.m. (0230 GMT) Monday when government
forces apparently launched a first attack on the Bra barracks. A
second attack was launched at 5:30 a.m. (0530 GMT), according to
Lusa.
	   Few people were on the streets of the capital, where there was a
heavy troop presence, but no clashes were reported outside the Bra
suburb.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira said Sunday that former armed
forces chief Brig. Ansumane Mane was leading the revolt and was
backed by members of political opposition parties.
	   In a statement read on public radio, Vieira vowed to ``use all
possible means'' to quash the revolt.
	   Mane was fired six months ago during an official investigation
into the trafficking of arms to the separatist rebels of Casamanca,
a Senegalese province that borders north Guinea-Bissau.
	   Mane formally stepped down and was replaced at a ceremony in
Bissau last Saturday.
	   Reports said troops set up roadblocks on routes to the
presidential palace and other government buildings and military
installations.
	   Guinea Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, has a population of
about 1 million.

Government troops kill 81 rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Sri Lankan rebels said Monday they beat
back government troops trying to take a strategic northern town,
killing at least 11 soldiers and losing 20 of their own fighters.
	   Newspaper reports in Sri Lanka said government troops killed 81
guerrillas in the fighting Sunday.
	   In a statement faxed to news agencies in New Delhi from their
London office, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam said rebels
recovered the bodies of 11 soldiers after weekend fighting in
Mankulam and the nearby village of Ampakamam.
	   Mankulam, 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of the capital,
Colombo, is heavily fortified with mines, underground bunkers,
razor wire and booby traps. It is the largest town along a
77-kilometer (48-mile) road the army has been trying to capture
since May, 1997 in the longest and bloodiest offensive of its
15-year-old civil war against the Tamil Tigers.
	   The road would link Jaffna, a former rebel stronghold captured
by the army two years ago, with the rest of the country. Since the
army takeover, Jaffna's half million people have had to rely on air
and sea deliveries for food and other supplies.
	   A military spokesman in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, said
only that rebels fired mortars at troops near Ampakamam, but said
there were no casualties on either side.
	   No independent assessment of the battle situation was available
since the government bars journalists from independently visiting
the war zone. The government also censors reports about the
fighting in Sri Lanka.
	   The rebels among Sri Lanka's Tamil minority say they are
discriminated against in Sinhalese-majority country. The government
denies the charge and says that Tamils have equal rights and
opportunity to prosper.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines said Monday a
crippling strike by its pilots has caused potential foreign buyers
of the airline to break off talks and could force it to shut down.
	   In a dramatic statement, PAL said the 3-day-old strike by more
than 600 pilots is ``bleeding the airline dry,'' causing daily
losses of 150 million to 200 million pesos (dlrs 3.8 million to 5.1
million) in lost revenue.
	   This has pushed the cash-strapped airline ``closer to the brink
of insolvency,'' PAL said.
	   ``With the breakdown of the talks with the foreign investors,
PAL may now have no other recourse but to shut down operations,''
it said.
	   The union is protesting a new management policy of ordering
pilots to retire who have reached 20 years of service or flown
20,000 hours, regardless of age. The policy puts about 200 pilots
in danger of forced retirement, the union said.
	   The airline earlier announced it must cut expenses by as much as
40 percent, slash flights, and sharply reduce its work force to
survive.
	   PAL said Monday it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 205 million) in
the last fiscal year _ three times more than the previous year.
	   PAL said that in an effort to stay afloat, it has been in talks
with a number of foreign carriers who were looking to take a
``significant'' stake in the airline.
	   ``But the work stoppage by the (pilots' union) ... has caused
investors to lose interest,'' it said.
	   PAL fears the breakdown in talks may have jeopardized its final
chance to stave off financial ruin. PAL didn't name the airlines
with which it had been in talks, but industry sources said the main
potential buyer was Northwest Airlines of the United States.
	   PAL fired all the striking pilots on Sunday, except for a few
who had complied with an airline order to return to work. Labor
Secretary Cresenciano Trajano said he issued orders to the strikers
to return to work and to the airline to accept them back.
	   Trajano called an emergency meeting Monday to try to resolve the
strike but the two union representatives refused to accept the
return-to-work order and said they had no decision-making
authority, Trajano said.
	   ``We have no other options but to find ways of keeping the
problem from worsening,'' he said.
	   The strike began Friday, forcing cancellations of more than 200
international and domestic flights and affecting thousands of
passengers.
	   PAL fired all 29 officers of the union on Saturday and warned
remaining members would also be dismissed if they didn't return to
work by noon Sunday. The 620 striking pilots represent the
airlines' total pilot force.
	   PAL had tried to recover from its spiraling losses with an
ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program in 1996, ordering 36
new aircraft. But Asia's currency crisis sharply reduced passenger
numbers and bloated the airline's debt in local currency terms.
	   PAL, Asia's first airline, is controlled by Chinese Filipino
tycoon Lucio Tan. It had been completely owned by the Philippine
government from 1941 until it was partly sold in 1992.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A local leader of Benazir Bhutto's
centrist party was shot dead Monday in the southern port city of
Karachi.
	   It wasn't immediately clear whether Mohammed Budha, a Karachi
leader of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party, was targeted
because of his political affiliation, police said.
	   No one has taken responsibility for the shooting, and Ms. Bhutto
has not made any comment.
	   Budha was outside his home in Karachi when two men on a
motorcycle drove up and opened fire. A companion standing nearby
was wounded.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As Europe banned investment in
Serbia and weighed other ways to halt violence in Kosovo, Serbs
reported fresh clashes in the secessionist province Monday and a
U.S. diplomat and ethnic Albanian leader toured a battle-torn area.
	   European Union foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, banned
investment in Serbia and froze the country's assets abroad for ''a
campaign of violence going far beyond'' a legitimate strike against
terrorists.
	   A Kosovo Albanian leader welcomed the sanctions but said they
were only a ``small step'' compared to the situation on the ground.
	   ``NATO should become involved in Kosovo, because the Serbian
regime has had practice with sanctions and knows ways of bypassing
them,'' said Nekibe Kelmendi, head of the Albanians' largest party,
the Democratic League of Kosovo. ``It is a regime that only
respects the language of force.''

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with closing quotes for Taiwan dollar, graf 13 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets closed lower Tuesday on
fears that further depreciation in the yen, which fell to a
seven-year low, could spark another round of currency devaluations
in the region.
	   Thai stock prices tumbled, with the key index closing at an
11-year low as investors dumped the stock of the country's biggest
finance company, Phatra Thanakit PCL, after it decided to sell half
of its securities subsidiary.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index closed down 5.79 points, or
1.8 percent, to 312.37, its lowest level since late 1987.
	   Dealers blamed the drop on regional currency woes and the move
by Phatra Thanakit PCL.
	   Earlier, Thai baht hit a 13-week low of 43.80 to the U.S.
dollar, off from 43.25 at Friday's close.
	   Singapore shares fell 3.4 percent, reacting to news of the
republic's first major property development default and the
continued weakness of the Japanese yen and other regional
currencies.
	   The Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index fell
39.89 points to 1,128.57.
	   News that a Singapore-Hong Kong joint venture missed a deadline
for a 68.6 million Singapore dollar (dlrs 40 million) payment on a
plot of land to develop condominiums dampened market sentiment.
	   The Singapore dollar was also sharply lower, breaking the
benchmark 1.70 level against the U.S. currency.
	   In Tokyo, the dollar bought 140.56 yen at late afternoon, up
1.14 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and its highest point since June
20, 1991. In New York, the dollar settled at 139.75 yen on Friday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
slipped 28.72 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 15,294.71. On
Friday, the average lost 103.04 points, or 0.67 percent.
	   The Australian stock market was closed for a holiday, but the
Australian dollar fell to its lowest level against the dollar since
July 1986, hitting a low of 59.75 U.S. cents by afternoon.
	   The Taiwan dollar fell to 34.69 against the U.S. dollar, its
lowest level since March 1987.
	   New Zealand's dollar was also lower, down to 50.88 U.S. cents.
	   In Indonesia, the dollar was trading at 11,725 rupiah, compared
with its close Friday at 11,550.
	   Dealers in the region said institutional investors, spooked by
the weakening regional currencies and persistent pessimism over
Japan's economy, continued to dump shares.
	   The dollar's strength against the yen sprang from fresh evidence
of a robust U.S. economy after the Labor Department reported on
Friday that the nation's unemployment rate held to a 28-year-low of
4.3 percent in May.
	   Malaysian share prices closed lower, with the key slipping to
its lowest point in nearly six months. The Composite Index fell
7.26 points, or 1.4 percent, to 497.79.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower. The market's key Weighted
Stock Price Index fell 45.46 points, or 0.59 percent, to 7,591.27.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed following as a surge
in local interest rates. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 31.30
points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,104.40.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower, affected by declining
Asian currencies and prospects of an increase in domestic interest
rates. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks
fell 27.17 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,930.59.
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed generally mixed in light trading.
The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips, rose
17.16 points, or 0.2 percent, to 8,586.63.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed higher on expectations that President
Kim Dae-jung will be able to attract more foreign investment into
the country during his trip to the United States. The Korea
Composite Stock Price Index rose 4.35 points, or 1.2 percent, to
345.88.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower. The Composite Index slipped
0.097 point to 409.419.

Germany's outspoken government spokesman regrets
</HEADLINE>
`misunderstandings' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl stuck by his
controversial government spokesman on Monday, even as the new
appointee promised to watch his words more carefully.
	   In office less than two weeks, Otto Hauser came under fire last
week after warning eastern Germans in a June 3 newspaper interview
that continuing to vote for former communists was ``over-straining
the solidarity of the west Germans.''
	   Coming just months before a federal election, his words were
widely interpreted as implying that continued financial support for
rebuilding the east was dependent on how east Germans voted.
	   Opposition politicians and even some members of Kohl's ruling
coalition criticized the comments as inappropriate for a government
spokesman.
	   Hauser, a conservative member of parliament and former
journalist, insisted he was expressing a widely held opinion in the
west and not government policy _ a position that Kohl has backed.
	   But in a television interview Sunday, Hauser said he regretted
the misunderstandings and would ``stick to the rules'' in the
future and ``concentrate on presenting government policies.''
	   After a meeting of party leaders Monday, Kohl said again he was
``in complete agreement'' with Hauser's remarks.
	   The chairman of the Bonn press corps, Heinz Schweden, said after
meeting with Hauser on Monday that his weekend remarks had helped
clear the air. But he said Hauser would continue to have problems
if he tried to constantly switch hats when making statements.
	   ``He has to see that he will always be taken as the government
spokesman when he says something,'' Schweden said.
	   Kohl dismissed his former spokesman, Peter Hausmann, last month
after more than three years on the job. He gave no reason, but
apparently blamed Hausmann in part for the government's poor
standing in the polls.

Communists claim unpaid teachers take local leader hostage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communist Party claimed Monday that a
group of Siberian teachers was holding a local government leader
hostage to demand overdue wages, but police said they had no
information about such an incident.
	   Russian media often report cases of ``hostage-taking'' by unpaid
workers, but the incidents rarely involve violence. Sometimes the
supposed hostages stay with their captors voluntarily, even after
they are told they are free to leave.
	   A statement released by parliament's Communist faction said
teachers from 12 out of 14 schools in the Maiminsky region of
Russia's republic of Altai seized the regional leader in his office
on Monday and were demanding three months of back wages in return
for his release.
	   A spokesman for Russia's Interior Ministry, Yevgeny Ryabtsev,
said he had no information to corroborate the report.
	   Officials in Altai, some 3,500 kilometers (2,000 miles) and four
times zones away from Moscow, could not be reached for comment
Monday afternoon.

Eurovision winner pleads innocent to disorderly conduct charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's transsexual pop diva Dana
International, winner of this year's Eurovision song contest,
pleaded innocent Monday to charges that she attacked a spectator
and a waitress at a performance two years ago.
	   The singer is accused of throwing a bottle of mineral water at a
spectator's head and attacking a waitress during a November 1995
performance, Israel's Army Radio said.
	   The singer is charged with disorderly conduct in Magistrate's
Court in Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv. Her next hearing will be in
about six months, according to court spokesman Moshe Gorali.
	   Dana International, who was known as Yaron Cohen until
undergoing a sex change operation five years ago, won the 25-nation
Eurovision song contest last month with the song ``Diva.''
	   The singer's selection as Israel's representative was denounced
by Orthodox leaders, who called her a disgrace to the Jewish state.

the last elections, many feared only Muslim candidates would win in
Sunday vote, driving Christians out of local politics in Lebanon's
largest city.
	   But a half-Christian, half-Muslim ticket backed by Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri swept to victory for the 24-member city
council, the results showed.
	   Hariri and other moderate Sunnis had campaigned feverishly to
urge a Muslim vote for Christians so that the delicate sectarian
balance could be maintained in the city, as it is in senior
government posts in this country of 18 religious sects.
	   Smelling victory from early returns, Hariri told the leading
newspaper An-Nahar overnight that national consensus has been
preserved, showing that the Lebanese have ``abandoned the logic of
war and upheld democracy.''
	   In the south, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah that is the major
guerrilla group fighting Israel scored major gains, chipping away
at the power base of the pro-Syrian Amal faction of Parliament
Speaker Nabih Berri.
	   Amal is estimated to have won 46 municipalities and Hezbollah
18, a further signal that it has succeeded in transforming itself
from a guerrilla force into a populist movement.
	   Hezbollah-backed candidates appear to have won in the teeming
market town of Nabatiyeh, while Amal appeared victorious in the
southern city of Tyre.
	   Municipal elections have not been held since 1963 because the
1975-90 sectarian civil war and the political tensions that led to
and followed the conflict.
	   Local elections have been held in various parts of the country
for the past two weeks and another round will be held next Sunday.
Official results from Beirut and the south were still not available
since vote counting is manual.
	   Not all were happy with the Beirut outcome. The leftist As-Safir
newspaper on Monday criticized the sectarian character of the
Beirut election campaign.
	   ``It is difficult to speak about democracy in the light of
dominating religious slogans and sectarian fever,'' As-Safir
publisher Talal Salman said in a front-page editorial.
	   ``This is Lebanon after civil war,'' he wrote, adding ``it is
difficult to build a nation'' based on such sectarian feelings.
	   The Beirut election was marred by a low turnout among the
400,000 eligible voters _ as low as 20 percent in Christian areas
and up to 40 percent in Muslim sectors.
	   Turnout was heavy in south Lebanon, estimated at over 60 percent
of the 380,000 eligible voters. The battle in the region was for
control over Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the largest sect of
Lebanon 3.2 million people.
	   But the vote was inconclusive in deciding the main Shiite power.
A battle is expected in the Shiite-populated Bekaa Valley of
eastern Lebanon on Sunday, the last of the four-stage municipal
polls.

Jewish settlers move into Arab neighborhood; Palestinians protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In what Palestinians called a fresh threat to
the already tattered peace process, Jewish settlers took over a
pair of buildings in Arab east Jerusalem on Monday, clashing with
Palestinians as they did so.
	   At least two people were hurt in the melee, including Faisal
Husseini, the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem, who was
slightly injured when he was hit in the head by a rock.
	   The clash in the Silwan neighborhood was the latest in an
escalating series of confrontations in Jerusalem's eastern sector.
Each side accuses the other of trying to grab land in the bitterly
contested city.
	   Moving in before dawn, the settlers took over five apartments in
two buildings, plus a plot of land. They trucked in furniture,
strung barbed wire, and hung Israeli flags.
	   ``I see things getting worse,'' said Husseini, who has called
for mass street protests by Palestinians to block such settlement
activity. ``This provocation is pushing the situation to the edge
of disaster.''
	   About 20 activists from the Israeli group Peace Now staged a
protest at the site. Police dragged them away after they ignored
orders to disperse.
	   The 15 settlers were from the Elad group, which claims it
purchased the homes legally. Settler leader Yehuda Mali said Jews
had a biblical claim to the area, overlooking the Kidron Valley
just outside the Old City walls.
	   ``It was the home of King David, here he wrote the Psalms, and
here Jews are not allowed to live?'' he said.
	   Police and soldiers tried to keep the two sides apart, but
repeated shoving and shouting matches broke out. In one skirmish,
settlers kicked Arabs who tried to block them from entering one of
the buildings.
	   ``I will surrender my life before I surrender my house!''
shouted Fatima Karaeen, 62, who said she has papers showing one of
the houses belongs to her Arab family. ``The cowards!''
	   The makeup of Jerusalem's neighborhoods is an explosive issue,
with Palestinians trying to block what they say are illegal
encroachments by Jewish settlers. Both sides are constantly
jockeying for position pending negotiations on the city's final
status.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
the 1967 Mideast War, as capital of a future state. Israel insists
the city must remain undivided under Israeli sovereignty.
	   Settlers have been stepping up activity in recent weeks in
Jerusalem.
	   Last month, clashes broke out after the settler group Ataret
Cohanim set up sheds in the Old City near Herod's Gate. Those sheds
were dismantled, but the settlers were allowed to stay on as guards
and volunteers in an archeological dig that got under way on
Monday.
	   The latest confrontation comes at a delicate moment in efforts
to restart the stalled peace process. Israel's army radio said an
American plan for an Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank will
likely to brought to the Cabinet for a vote before the end of the
week.
	   Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert told army radio the settler move to
Silwan was legal.
	   ``I don't wake up in the morning and ask myself what will please
the Palestinians,'' he said. ``People can buy wherever they want.''
	   But opposition Israeli lawmaker Yossi Beilin called the
settlers' actions a provocation.
	   ``It does all it can to make the relationship between Jews and
Arabs more tense in Jerusalem and elsewhere,'' he said.

Alleged Bosnian Croat paramilitary chief goes on U.N. trial

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An alleged Bosnian Croat
paramilitary commander stood and watched as one of his troops
repeatedly raped a Muslim woman, prosecutors claimed Monday as his
war crimes trial began.
	   The suspected commander, Anto Furundzija, 28, has pleaded
innocent to two war crimes charges relating to his alleged
involvement in the May 1993 rapes.
	   Dressed in a dark suit, Furundzija looked calm as his trial
opened before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. He faces a maximum
life sentence if convicted.
	   Although rape has been considered a war crime in other cases
before the U.N. court, Furundzija's trial is the first to deal
specifically with sexual assault inflicted during an interrogation.
	   The alleged rapist, identified Monday by the names Cicko and
Bralo, has not been arrested. Furundzija was arrested in December
in the central Bosnian town of Vitez, near where his alleged
offenses were committed.
	   Furundzija allegedly was interrogating the victim, identified as
``Witness A,'' as she was raped at the headquarters of his unit,
called ``The Jokers.''
	   The Jokers allegedly took part in a violent campaign by Bosnian
Croat forces to drive Muslims out of the central Bosnian Lasva
River Valley in 1993.
	   ``Shortly after the interrogation started the other member of
The Jokers forced her to undress and began what turned out to be a
prolonged series of physical, mental and serious sexual abuses
including repeated rapes,'' prosecutor Michael Blaxill charged in
his opening statement.
	   By failing to stop the rapes, Furundzija became a ``direct
perpetrator committing the crimes of torture and outrages upon
personal dignity,'' Blaxill added.
	   Defense attorney Luka Misetic said the prosecution's case was
built on faulty recollections of the victim.
	   ``Her testimony will not convince you beyond a reasonable doubt
that Anto Furundzija is guilty as charged, and, make no mistake,
the prosecution's entire case is based on her testimony,'' Misetic
said.
	   The trial, the sixth to begin at the tribunal, could be its
quickest. Prosecutors will only call five witnesses _ including the
alleged victim. The first witness, a Muslim community leader from
Vitez, testified Monday about the background of the conflict.
	   Although Furundzija is a minor figure from the 3 1/2-year
Bosnian conflict, prosecutors at the U.N. court are keen to
establish case law involving sexual assaults as a war crime.
	   Before the trial began, judges publicized a stinging rebuke of
prosecutors in the case, accusing them of ``a consistent pattern of
noncompliance with the orders of the trial chamber.''
	   Set up in 1993, the war crimes tribunal has indicted 60 suspects
and has 27 in custody. Its most-wanted suspects, former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen.
Ratko Mladic, remain at large.

State employees stage warning strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of
government workers staged a brief warning strike Monday after the
government refused to increase their wages.
	   Nearly 800,000 state employees abandoned their posts in state
and municipal offices for an hour starting at 9 a.m. (0700GMT),
demanding a 20 percent pay increase.
	   Pay negotiations between the government and 10 trade unions
representing state workers failed to reach an agreement last month.
	   During the strike, teachers organized debates with students
instead of teaching and road workers blocked roadways at dozens of
points. Nearly a dozen of the country's border crossings also
closed temporarily, the CTK news agency said.
	   Alena Vondrova, a spokeswoman for the trade unions, warned the
public could expect more strikes if their demands are ignored, CTK
said. She dismissed politicians' claims that the state does not
have the funds needed to satisfy the protesters.
	   ``The state just must find the money,'' Vondrova said.
	   On average, state employees in the Czech Republic earn about
1,500 koruna (dlrs 50) less than the average monthly salary of
10,438 koruna (dlrs 317).
	   The strike came less than two weeks before early parliamentary
elections scheduled for June 19-20.

Air France pilots' strike enters second week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with smaller unions rejecting proposal for special
flights. ADDS Air France to hold extraordinary meeting.
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Striking Air France pilots have offered to work for
free to fly foreign fans to the World Cup, but their walkout showed
no sign of ending Monday as it entered its second week.
	   The unexpected gesture came as the conflict appeared to harden
Sunday night, with Air France management expressing exasperation
with the pilots who walked off the job June 1.
	   No new talks were in sight, and Air France said the strike
already had cost 1 billion francs (dlrs 166 million).
	   France's flagship carrier says it will take three days for
service to return to normal once the strike ends, meaning the
walkout was sure to disrupt the World Cup, which begins Wednesday.
	   Christian Paris, spokesman for the SNPL, the main pilots' union,
proposed that Air France organize special flights for foreign World
Cup ticket holders and said the pilots would work without pay so
the fans would not miss the soccer championship.
	   Air France said it would study the measure, but three smaller
pilot unions on Monday rejected the proposal, saying they would
advise members not to collaborate.
	   Bernard Stasi, a government mediator in the talks, said the
proposal was ``unacceptable.''
	   ``This is a party which France is offering for the world.
Anything that might spoil the party would be a crime by France,''
he added in an interview with Europe-1 radio network on Monday.
	   Despite the goodwill gesture, the conflict appeared deadlocked.
	   Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the director general of Air France, said
the airline had ``exhausted its capacity of understanding with
regard to the pilots.''
	   Air France said Monday it would hold an extraordinary meeting
later this week _ once the World Cup is underway _ to discuss the
impasse.
	   Meanwhile, the company sought to contain the strike by meeting
with 19 unions representing other airline workers who feel left out
of salary talks between Air France and the pilots.
	   Both sides are under pressure to end the strike from the
government, which has offered to intervene but has not put forward
concrete proposals.
	   Labor Minister Martine Aubry said the negotiations could go down
to the wire.
	   ``I believe in negotiation. Even if there are just a few minutes
left to talk, I'm convinced an agreement can be reached,'' she said
in an interview with France 3 television channel.
	   Rene Monory, president of the French Senate, said Sunday the
pilots were giving the country a ``lamentable image.''
	   Talks between Air France and the pilots were suspended Saturday
after the pilots walked out of negotiations.
	   The strike has inconvenienced thousands, including foreigners
fleeing fighting in Eritrea.
	   The pilots are protesting planned pay cuts of 500 million francs
(dlrs 83 million) Air France says are needed to modernize the
company.
	   Obstacles to an agreement are proposed salary reductions and a
plan to give pilots stock in exchange for the pay cut, as well as a
two-tier pay scale in which younger pilots earn less.
	   Only about 25 percent of Air France's flights were expected to
take off Monday.
	   Trains were running on schedule Monday after strikes disrupted
service this weekend. Train conductors have threatened a walkout
Wednesday.

Slovaks start up controversial nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Despite hefty protest from
anti-nuclear campaigners, Slovakia on Monday started up its
controversial nuclear power plant at Mochovce.
	   The plant is just 120 kilometers (72 miles) east of Austria,
which has campaigned strongly against its activation, arguing that
certain features of the heavy water pressure reactor make it
unsafe. Austria is the only country in the world to have built a
nuclear power plant, then voted in 1978 by referendum against
putting it online or having nuclear power.
	   Mochovce is a 440 MW Soviet-designed plant subsequently equipped
with Western technology.
	   Plant spokesman Rastislav Petrech said it received a go-ahead
from the Slovak nuclear authority on Sunday to activate its nuclear
fuel rods, as the authority deemed the plant ``met all the safety
and technical conditions.''
	   Last month, a team of 22 international experts inspected the
plant and noted safety changes made at the station, but also
complained that the company operating it failed to release
necessary documents.
	   Wolfgang Kromp, the Austrian head of that international team,
told the Austria Press Agency on Monday that he regretted that
Slovakia had gone ahead at Mohovce, but emphasized ``there is
currently no risk'' involved.
	   Austria is worried that a Chernobyl-type disaster at Mochovce _
or other nuclear plants in neighboring Slovakia and the Czech
Republic _ affect hundreds of thousands of its citizens.
	   Austria is particularly worried that the Czech-produced pressure
vessel made of special steel is safe for only the first five years,
and that nuclear reaction will weaken its quality.
	   Slovak officials angrily dismiss all the Austrian criticism.
	   ``Our plant is perfectly safe. We wouldn't be jepardizing the
lives of our families, would we?'' Petrech told The Associated
Press. ``The Austrians could never say of any nuclear power plant
that it was safe.''
	   Fuel will be fully activated, and the the plant's No. 1 reactor
will become critical this month, ``which means Slovakia will have
another reliable, effective and ecologically clean source of
electric energy for another 30 years,'' according to a press
release quoting Tibor Mikus, the director of Slovakia's electricity
company.

Thousands take part in protests in Indonesia; Suharto turns 77
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES material from Indonesia-Political Prisoners,
Indonesia-Labor Protest, Indonesia-Suharto Birthday &QL; 
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Despite promises of sweeping reforms
by Indonesia's new president, more than 20,000 people took to the
streets in separate protests in two cities Monday.
	   As many as 10,000 striking workers scuffled with and threw rocks
at anti-riot police when they staged a 10-kilometer (6-mile) march
through the streets of Indonesia's second city of Surabaya.
	   On the tourist island of Bali, about 10,000 students and others
marched peacefully to the local legislature, demanding the
resignation of the provincial governor and other politicians
accused of corruption and collusion.
	   Pressure to speed up reforms continues to mount against
President B.J. Habibie despite his plan to hold elections in 1999
and to stage a general inquiry into graft and other misdeeds
committed during the 32-year rule of former President Suharto, who
stepped down last month.
	   The government said Habibie planned to release 16 more political
prisoners on Thursday, bringing to 20 the number fred since Suharto
quit on May 21.
	   Suharto, meanwhile, celebrated a lonely 77th birthday on Monday.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted an unidentified Suharto aide
as saying few of his friends and associates have visited him at his
home in central Jakarta since he was forced to quit. Formerly
lucrative ties to the former president are now seen as a liability.
	   Only a pet parrot, long ago trained to say, ``Good Morning
(Mister) President,'' still calls him by his former title, the Post
said.
	   Presidential security guards still stand watch over his home.
But their numbers are gradually being reduced, and they no longer
salute him, the aide was quoted as saying.
	   Not even Habibie has visited Suharto, though the two men are
longtime friends and allies.
	   The Post said Suharto is happy to a private citizen and spends
his days reading newspapers, full of accusations against him,
watching television and being with his grandchildren.
	   On the rare occasions that he leaves his house, Suharto's car
must stop at red lights _ not like the old days, when the
presidential limousine sped through the streets of Jakarta under
police escort.
	   In Surabaya, about 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta,
violence broke out when a line of police blocked the path of
thousands of striking workers as they approached the East Java's
provincial parliament building.
	   Witnesses and police said at least five police and three
protesters were hospitalized. Some were bleeding after being beaten
with sticks or being hit with rocks.
	   The protest was the biggest since Habibie last week relaxed
tight restrictions on labor unions and signed an International
Labor Organization convention on respect for workers' rights.
	   Police later let the crowd pass and stage a noisy rally outside
the legislature.
	   The workers, employees of a household appliance manufacturer,
went on strike last Tuesday demanding higher salaries and better
conditions as the effects of Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
30 years begins to bite.
	   Indonesia is now suffering runaway inflation and mass
unemployment as the economic situation worsens.

Czechs and Slovaks to give up favorite holiday destination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A cold reception last season and economic
recession will cut tourist arrivals from Slovakia and the Czech
Republic by as much as 40 percent, tour operators said Monday.
	   Last summer, more than 579,000 Czechs and over 153,000 Slovaks
flocked to the shores of the Croatian Adriatic, their most popular
holiday spot also in the Communist era.
	   However, the Croatian Tourist Association, has already
registered a 30-40 percent drop in bookings as the peak season
approaches, compared with the same time last year.
	   Atlas, one of the prime tourist agencies, has canceled charter
flights to the ancient resort town of Dubrovnik, considered
Croatia's tourist jewel.
	   Other agencies have replaced larger airplanes with smaller ones
to reduce costs and cater for fallen demand.
	   Tihomir Studko, a public relations officer of the Tourist
Agency, attributed the drop to economic reforms in both Slovakia
and the Czech Republic, which he said have tightened family
budgets.
	   But he also said measures such as a new ban on food imports
worth more than 90 German marks (dlrs 50) may also have discouraged
guests.
	   Money-strapped Czech and Slovak tourists were the target of
stares and sour jokes last summer, as they brought their food for
the entire trip rather than pay significantly more in Croatia.
	   Tourists from former socialist countries are usually frowned
upon by Croats for their weaker spending power, unlike their richer
western neighbors Germany, Austria and Italy, for whom many are
prepared to roll out the red carpet.
	   Tour operators are hoping for a strong rise in arrivals from
west European countries, who avoided Croatia's pristine coastline
and islands during the precarious war years.

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Ethiopia's foreign minister
launched a diplomatic assault Monday on neighboring Eritrea,
accusing it of provoking war by deploying forces into disputed
territory along their common border.
	   ``The first thing to be done is for Eritrea to withdraw its
troops and return to the status quo,'' Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Meslin said. Eritrea is ``imposing war on Ethiopia by
occupying certain territories.''
	   Seyoum made the comments in Burkina Faso's capital of
Ouagadougou on the opening day of a pan-African heads of state
summit.
	   Ethiopian warplanes bombed Eritrean targets over the weekend in
retaliation for what it called a violation of existing border
agreements.
	   The summit touted as a forum for peace was focusing instead on
the potential for war between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   Amid heavy security African leaders were gathering in Burkina
Faso's capital of Ouagadougou for the Organization of African Unity
summit.
	   Others, including South Africa's President Nelson Mandela were
expected later Monday for the three-day summit.
	   ``The continent received as a shock and with concern the news of
the crisis,'' OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said Monday
of the conflict in the Horn of Africa. ``This unfortunate
development constitutes a severe setback to our efforts at forging
peace, security and stability.''
	   OAU talks quickly shifted from developing peace to avoiding war.
On Saturday, OAU foreign ministers broke from their scheduled talks
and urgently appealed for Ethiopia and Eritrea to adopt a peace
plan.
	   ``The Council of Ministers appeals to the two parties to put an
end to all hostilities,'' their statement said.
	   South Africa's Mandela and the presidents of Djibouti, Uganda
and Kenya, called Eritrea's leaders over the weekend to encourage a
negotiated settlement.
	   Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki, who earlier accused Ethiopia
of declaring war, dispatched his foreign minister, Haile Woldensae,
to Burkina Faso. Ethiopia's Seyoum was representing President Meles
Zenawi.
	   The OAU has had little impact on the border clash since it began
on May 6.
	   Diplomats in Burkina Faso said summit delegates plan to draft a
resolution on the conflict after making recommendations to their
leaders over the weekend.
	   Although host Burkina Faso have dubbed the event a ``summit for
change,'' so far the OAU has done little more than call for an end
to hostilities and offer support for a U.S.-Rwandan peace proposal.
	   OAU Assistant Secretary-General Pascal Gayama told journalists
that the organization would work closely with Rwandan and U.S.
mediators.
	   Other African conflict zones such as Sudan, where southern
animist rebels are fighting a protracted guerrilla war against the
northern Muslim government, are not expected to figure prominently
at the summit.
	   In addition to African heads of state, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is also attending.
	   There was much speculation about whether Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, who is also trying to broker a peace accord between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, would attend the OAU summit.

Heat wave kills more than 2,500 in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's worst heat wave in the past 50
years has killed more than 2,500 people in the past month, Press
Trust of India news agency said Monday.
	   In the worst-affected eastern coastal region of Orissa, where
temperatures soared as high as 47 Celsius (116 Fahrenheit) last
week, PTI reported 97 deaths Sunday. A total of 1,131 people have
died from the heat since May 12.
	   The southern state of Andhra Pradesh reported 943 deaths, PTI
said. Other deaths have been recorded mainly in the northern states
of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
	   Meantime, the seasonal monsoon rains have hit the coast of
southern India, bringing some respite. The rains will take another
month and a half to reach the plains of northern India that have
been hard hit by the heat wave.
	   Pre-monsoon rains have started bringing down the temperatures.
Dust storms accompanied by light showers over the weekend brought
the mercury down from a peak of 46.5 Celsius (115 Fahrenheit) to 41
Celsius (105 Fahrenheit) in New Delhi, the Indian capital.

Number of registered HIV cases in Russia tops 8,100
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ AIDS is spreading rapidly in Russia, with a total
of 8,138 people registered as testing positive for HIV, officials
said Monday.
	   According to figures announced by the Health Ministry, the
number includes 367 children, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
HIV cases have been registered in 85 of Russia's 89 regions, the
ministry said.
	   Some 4,300 of new HIV cases were registered in Russia last year
_ a three-fold increase from the year before, it said.
	   Russian officials have repeatedly warned that the actual number
of HIV cases may be as much as 10 times higher. Russia still lacks
comprehensive diagnostic and treatment programs.
	   HIV and AIDS came to Russia late, but are quickly making up for
lost time. Officials say more than 90 percent of people testing
positive for HIV are intravenous drug users who have caught the
virus through infected syringes.
	   The vast plurality of HIV cases has been registered in Russia's
small Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad, whose 400,000 residents
account for a disproportionate 2,705 cases of HIV.
	   The next highest concentration is in the southern region of
Krasnodar, with 1,269 cases, ITAR-Tass said. Moscow has 823
registered HIV cases, it said.
	   Russia, which has no federal anti-AIDS program, received dlrs
170,000 in assistance from the United Nations AIDS program this
year to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment, ITAR-Tass
said.

German man being held in death of wife, whose remains were cooked
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ A German man was being held without
bail on a murder charge Monday after his wife's cooked bones and
skull were found in the ceiling of their house over the weekend.
	   Thoman Adolf Florin, 36, who is believed to be from the Bonn
area, had been making hurried arrangements to return to Germany
with his two children, aged 3 and 5, and already had bought the
plane tickets when he was arrested, police said.
	   An unidentified friend of Monica Florin, 32, had told police she
was missing. They found nothing amiss, said police Inspector
Hieronymus Goraseb.
	   ``But (Mrs. Florin's) friend went back to the house and noticed
something wet in the ceiling,'' Goraseb said. ``The police then
found some bones and her skull. Everything had been cooked.''
	   Most of the body had been disposed of in the sea, Goraseb said,
adding it was unclear why the remains had been cooked.
	   The children have returned to Germany where relatives plan to
care for them, authorities said.
	   Florin had lived in this southwest African country for some
time, operating a hotel and a pig farm.

Orthodox offended by dance featuring seminudity, prayer shawls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Orthodox Jews on Monday denounced modern
dancers who performed clad only in prayer shawls during a cultural
festival in Jerusalem.
	   It was the latest dispute involving art and culture between the
country's secular majority and ultra-religious minority.
	   Earlier this year, Israel's premier modern dance troupe,
Batsheva, bowed out performing at the country's 50th anniversary
celebrations rather than alter a seminude dance number, as
religious lawmakers demanded.
	   The prayer shawl performance, staged over the weekend by a
troupe from central Israel, was meant as a protest against
religious coercion, choreographer Ido Tadmor told the Maariv
newspaper.
	   Shlomo Benizri, a lawmaker from an ultra-religious party, said
the dance was a disgrace.
	   ``It's people taking something holy and dancing with it in a
shameful way,'' Benizri told The Associated Press. ``It's against
Judaism.''
	   The festival's director of public relations, Ora Lapidot, said
the dance provoked no protest from the audience, and in fact won
loud applause.

London shares up after New York's rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices were sharply higher on the London Stock
Exchange at midday Monday, with investors encouraged by Friday's
big rally on Wall Street.
	   The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was
up 68.4 points, or 1.2 percent, at 6,015.7 in the early afternoon.
	   Despite overnight weakness on many Asian markets, London traders
took heart from a rise of 1.9 percent by the Dow Jones Industrial
Average on Friday _ and they were waiting to see whether the New
York market could hang onto those gains when it opened on Monday.
	   Provisional volume came to 343.4 million shares.

	   In balloting two days before the start of the World Cup, Blatter
defeated Lennart Johansson when the Swedish president of UEFA
conceded after the first round.
	   ``The game is over,'' Johansson said. ``I wish Mr. Blatter
luck.''
	   Neither man received the two-thirds vote needed for a
first-ballot victory, but Blatter piled up a clear majority,
111-80, and Johansson would have needed a massive defection in the
second round, when a simple majority would have won.
	   The vote ended a bitter and expensive campaign to succeed Joao
Havelange, the Brazilian industrialist who has been FIFA's chief
since 1974.
	   Havelange backed Blatter's candidacy.
	   Johansson and Blatter, general secretary of FIFA, accused each
other of being puppets for other interests, and spent more than
dlrs 1 million combined on very public campaigns that usually are
waged quietly and privately.

	   After Johansson's concession, Blatter and Havelange appeared
before the FIFA Congress. Havelange called Johansson ``a
gentleman.''
	   Johansson's strength was in Europe and Africa, while Blatter's
strongholds were Asia and the Americas.
	   Blatter, who formally joined the race just 2 1-2 months ago, and
Johansson, the sole candidate for more than a year before that,
both had said in recent days that they were confident of victory.
	   Each had surrounded himself with soccer stars of the past, with
Pele supporting Havelange and Michel Platini backing Blatter. Each
of those endorsements was in keeping with the personal nature of
the campaign _ Pele has had a long-running feud with Havelange, his
Brazilian countryman, while Platini is co-chairman of the French
World Cup and has been reluctant to share any stage with Johansson.

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ The worst economic turmoil in Asia may
be over and prospects for growth in the rest of the world are
looking positive, but there are still problems, a central bankers
report said Monday.
	   Long-running economic expansion in the United States and Britain
is set to continue, says the annual report of the Basel-based Bank
for International Settlements, known as the central banker's
central bank.
	   Serious contagion of the Asian crisis to other parts of the
world has so far been avoided and the worst may be at an end in
Asia itself, according to the 199-page study.
	   ``Congratulations on this generally happy state of affairs might
seem in order, yet central bankers should not be complacent,''
Alfons Verplaetse, chairman of BIS' board of directors and
Belgium's national bank governor, said at the BIS' annual meeting.
	   Rekindling growth in another of the world's major economies,
Japan, ``will not be easy'' and the full impact of the Asian crisis
on Europe has still to be assessed, the report says.
	   In addition, tightening labor markets, worsening trade balances
and booming prices for financial assets show inflationary risks are
rising.
	   ``No-one should be under any illusions as to the magnitude of
the problems still to be faced and the potential difficulties along
the way,'' says the study.
	   Growth rates in most industrial countries have either remained
at high levels or are starting to build significant momentum, said
Verplaetse.
	   A ``new era'' of productivity and profit growth is discernible
in recent U.S. economic statistics, the report notes. A wave of
restructuring in Europe will lead to the same result.
	   Preparations for the transition in Europe to the new single
currency, the Euro, have been smooth, Verplaetse said. Structural
reforms and more disciplined policies have generated solid growth
in Latin America, many Eastern European countries and
``significant'' parts of Africa.
	   Forecasts by the International Monetary Fund and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development indicate the
United States will bear most of the burden resulting from an
expected improvement in Asian trade deficits, pushing the current
account deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product to
near-record levels, the report says.
	   However, there is a danger markets will lose patience with the
accumulation of U.S. external debt and drive the dollar sharply
lower.
	   A further danger, stemming from the strong dollar, is a possible
movement to protectionist policies in the United States.
	   ``While the robust economy has kept such sentiments below the
surface, a marked slowing of growth could easily change this
situation,'' says the study.
	   In Asia's emerging markets, politically committed responses to
the International Monetary Fund's recommended financial reforms
would do more to revive growth prospects ``than anything else,''
the study says.
	   The BIS urged an early, transparent and politically neutral
restructuring of domestic banking systems to raise liquidity in
many Asian economies.
	   Japan's banking system needs to be restructured and the economy
stimulated through permanent tax cuts, it said.
	   Economic growth, financial deregulation and low inflation should
be accompanied by vigorous but careful market opening, the study
recommends.
	   Financial systems everywhere should be strengthened to allow
them to face up to the ``larger shocks'' likely to be created in
freer markets.

PARIS: with Johansson.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ``Delegates, thank you! Thank you so much,'' Blatter said. He
said Johansson ``was the type of person we need in FIFA.''
	   Blatter has said he wanted to make the job, traditionally
part-time and unpaid, a full-time, well-paid job.
	   It already is one of the two most powerful positions in
international sports, perhaps even more so than the presidency of
the International Olympic Committee.
	   It carries the flag of soccer, the game that elicits passion and
attracts sponsor dollars like no other. That attraction has led
critics to question how the FIFA presidency might have added to
Havelange's personal wealth; a recent article in the German
newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau said the outgoing president rang up
dlrs 2.7 million in travel, hotel and other expenses in the past
four years, about 4 percent of FIFA's budget.
	   Name-calling and personal attacks have been prominent in this
campaign. Johansson has accused Blatter of stealing his platform
and acting as a straw man for Havelange; Blatter, in turn, has said
that Johansson was a puppet of the German soccer federation and
Antonio Matarese, the powerful head of the Italian federation who
probably would take over at UEFA if the Swede is elected FIFA
president.
	   And not only has the campaign been nasty, it's been expensive.
Blatter said he has spent dlrs 300,000, and estimates put
Johansson's campaign costs at up to dlrs 800,000, much of it
financed by UEFA.
	   Havelange, who has had a long feud with Johansson and openly
supported Blatter, his key aide for almost 18 years, said he was
not dismayed at the conflicts that have arisen.
	   ``I have said before that FIFA is not a dictatorship, and to
have an election you need two candidates. I wish we had four or
five,'' he said. ``To have free competition is very good for
football. I would hope that my successor would carry on our good
results.''
	   The new president won't have to worry about money. Havelange
said FIFA had a cash reserve of dlrs 4 million, with dlrs 800
million in sponsorships and uncounted millions more in TV rights
fees.
	   ``Enough to stage two World Cups,'' Havelange said.

Defense attorney charges state with shirking responsibility
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The state's role in the collapse of a
footbridge that killed four Australian athletes should be
investigated, an attorney for the bridge's engineer said Monday.
	   ``We maintain that the state is shaking off responsibility for
this disaster,'' Avraham Landstein told The Associated Press
following a court hearing.
	   Landstein is defending the bridge's engineer, Micha Bar-Ilan,
who is among five people charged with negligence in the July 14
collapse during the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah Games.
	   About 100 Australian athletes were on the footbridge when it
buckled, plunging the athletes into a narrow river below, injuring
dozens. Four Australians died in the aftermath.
	   Police inspector Yonatan Silberman testified Monday that police
were not prepared for such an accident.
	   ``We were prepared for the event of an explosion or a similar
disaster, but no one expected something like this to happen,''
Silberman said.
	   Pathologist Yehuda Hiss, testifying on the cause of death of
Yettie Benis, blamed the chemical-laden polluted water she
swallowed.
	   The engineer, along with two contractors, the director of the
event, and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing committee, have
been charged with negligent homicide and building without proper
permits.
	   They face up to three years in prison if convicted.

World Cup: Belgium ready for more underdog surprises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTHIEUX, France (AP) _ Belgium traveled to its fifth World Cup
finals in a row Monday, bent on proving yet again that small
countries need not be pushovers in soccer's global championship.
	   Despite a string of good preparation results, the Red Devils
started out with a long tradition _ talking themselves into the
role of underdog. Belgium plays its opening match Saturday against
its neighbor, the Netherlands, and if one takes the Belgians at
their word, it should be no contest.
	   ``I'm so impressed with the Dutch,'' coach Georges Leekens said
Monday. ``It's a machine that is far better than we are.'' He
sidestepped Belgium's confident wins over Colombia and Paraguay
over the past week.
	   ``We have to be realistic. They are a lot stronger than we are.
But, we'll have to go for it,'' said midfielder Marc Wilmots of
Germany's Schalke 04.
	   Shades of the 1994 World Cup, when Belgium also belittled its
own chances against the Dutch before upsetting them 1-0 in the
first round. The Red Devils went out in the second round against
Germany.
	   After Saturday's tradition-filled clash with the Netherlands in
Saint-Denis, the Belgians play Mexico and South Korea in Group E.
	   The Belgians took the high-speed TGV train to their World Cup
base outside Lyon on Monday. The squad is heavy on experience with
both playmaker Enzo Scifo and Franky Van der Elst competing in
their fourth final in a row.
	   ``The World Cup _ it's the most beautiful thing for a soccer
player to achieve. It is a way to prove that I'm still there,''
said Scifo, 32. He was already there when Belgium reached the World
Cup semifinals in Mexico 1986 but should count himself lucky to be
back in France.
	   A bitter three-month fight with Leekens was only solved one
month ago, allowing Scifo's late entry into the team.
	   Unlike other World Cups, Belgium's strength this time lies up
front, where Fiorentina's Luis Oliveira and PSV Eindhoven's Luc
Nilis have looked dangerous.
	   In addition, Standard's brother strikers Mbo and Lokonda Mpenza
have looked good during the preparation.
	   Belgium, a small nation of 9.9 million people bordering France,
has qualified for every World Cup since 1982, an honor shared by
only five other nations.

Russian police say diplomat's son died from drowning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An autopsy on the son of a North Korean diplomat
determined Monday that the toddler died from drowning, a news
agency said.
	   The 2-year-old disappeared May 30 during a picnic with his
father and other North Korean diplomats in a park in southwestern
Moscow.
	   His body was recovered Saturday from a small tributary to the
Moscow River about 2 kilometers (more than a mile) downstream from
where he disappeared.
	   Forensic tests conducted Monday confirmed that the toddler died
from drowning, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing
unidentified police officials. Further tests will determine whether
he died in the same river where he was found.
	   Police tend to believe the death was an accident, but will wait
for final test results to reach a formal conclusion, the report
said.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Muslims and Christians endorsed religious
harmony in Beirut and militant Shiite Muslims made major inroads in
south Lebanon in municipal elections held after a break of 35
years, preliminary results showed Monday.
	   With Beirut having shifted to a Sunni Muslim majority city since
the last elections, many feared only Muslim candidates would win in
Sunday vote, driving Christians out of local politics in Lebanon's
largest city.
	   But a half-Christian, half-Muslim ticket backed by Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri swept to victory for the 24-member city
council, the results showed.
	   Hariri and other moderate Sunnis had campaigned feverishly to
urge a Muslim vote for Christians so that the delicate sectarian
balance could be maintained in the city, as it is in senior
government posts in this country of 18 religious sects.
	   Smelling victory from early returns, Hariri told the leading
newspaper An-Nahar overnight that national consensus has been
preserved, showing that the Lebanese have ``abandoned the logic of
war and upheld democracy.''
	   In the south, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah that is the major
guerrilla group fighting Israel scored major gains, chipping away
at the power base of the pro-Syrian Amal faction of Parliament
Speaker Nabih Berri.
	   Berri, in a news conference Monday, maintained that Amal alone
stood up against a coalition of Shiite militants, Communists,
leftist nationalists and traditional right-wing politicians.
	   He estimated that Amal won 51 of 75 wholly Shiite towns, tied
with Hezbollah in five others and took control of 22 mixed
Christian-Shiite towns.
	   The prize win for Amal was in the southern city of Tyre.
	   Preliminary results estimated Hezbollah won 18 municipalities, a
further signal that it has succeeded in transforming itself from a
guerrilla force into a populist movement.
	   Berri confirmed the Hezbollah gains, including the capture of
the teeming market town of Nabatiyeh.

Mahathir: Malaysia no longer concerned over fluctuations of
</HEADLINE>
ringgit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir said
Malaysia was moving towards barter trade and no longer cares about
fluctuations in the value of the ringgit against the U.S. dollar, a
news report said Monday.
	   ``What we want to do is to get away from the value of the
ringgit and this can be done easily by conducting trade on a
counter trade or through practical bartering,'' Mahathir was quoted
by Bernama news as saying.
	   The ringgit has already lost about 40 percent of its value since
Southeast Asia plunged into economic turmoil last year.
	   ``We are not very concerned anymore,'' Mahathir said when asked
about the ringgit's further decline Monday morning below the 4
ringgit mark to 4.15 ringgit against the dollar.
	   Malaysia is expected to start conducting some trade through the
counter trade or barter system in an effort to reduce dependence on
foreign currencies, especially the U.S. dollar.

French Pernod-Ricard wins bid for Yerevan brandy distillery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ France's Pernod-Ricard group will buy
the Armenian distillery whose brandy was said to be Winston
Churchill's favorite, officials said Monday.
	   Pernod-Ricard has agreed to pay dlrs 30 million for the Yerevan
Cognac Distillery and to invest 30 million francs (dlrs 5 million)
in developing vineyards in the former Soviet republic, said Vagram
Avanesian, Armenia's minister for economic reforms.
	   The government and Pernod-Ricard are discussing distribution of
profits and expect to formally sign an agreement next week,
Avanesian said at a news conference.
	   The distillery was established in 1897 by Russian wine merchant
Nikolai Shustov.
	   Distillery officials say that Josef Stalin presented Churchill
with a bottle of its 10-year-old, 100 proof brandy during the 1943
Tehran conference and that it remained the favorite of the British
wartime leader until his death.
	   Since Soviet times, Armenian brandy has been called cognac,
drawing angry protests from France, which insisted its producers
have exclusive use of the term. Pernod-Ricard agreed that the
brandy will be called Armenian Cognac or Armenian Brandy in
Armenian, English and Russia.
	   Pernod-Ricard also agreed to continue production of existing
brands of brandy, maintain production at no lower than 4.25 million
liters (1.1 million gallons) a year, use only local raw materials
and bottle the brandy in Armenia.
	   The sale has still drawn criticism from some lawmakers and
others who argued the distillery was being sold at a giveaway
price.
	   Seagram Co. of Canada was among the losing bidders for the
distillery.

Bavarian prosecutors weighing appeal in CompuServe case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian prosecutors appealing the
conviction and sentence of the former chief of CompuServe Germany
said Monday they were waiting for the judge's written decision
before deciding how to proceed.
	   Prosecutors, who had reversed course and sought an acquittal for
Felix Somm at the end of his trial, filed their intention to appeal
the May 28 conviction last Wednesday with the state's highest
court.
	   Prosecutor Manfred Wick said Monday his office needed to review
the judge's written opinion, expected in the coming weeks, before
deciding whether they would challenge the verdict on points of law
or seek a new trial.
	   He said the appeal is being made independent from defense
efforts to have the verdict overturned. ``But we're striving for
the same result,'' he said.
	   In a much-criticized decision, Somm was convicted of complicity
in the distribution of illegal pornography in 13 cases by not
blocking access to such sites on the Internet for CompuServe
customers.
	   He was given a two-year suspended sentence and ordered to pay
100,000 marks (dlrs 57,000).
	   The case began more than two years ago, when Bavarian
prosecutors raided CompuServe offices in Munich. But by the end of
the trial, prosecutors agreed with the defense that there was no
technology available at the time that would have enabled CompuServe
to block illegal content.
	   Internet experts warned that the verdict would stifle
development of the multimedia industry in Germany if allowed to
stand.

Singapore monetary authority outlines banking changes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's banks will no longer hide reserves
and bad loans, will open to foreign competition and have more
liquidity, the head of the country's de facto central bank said
Monday.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who heads the Monetary
Authority of Singapore, said the first change, reducing banks'
minimum cash balance requirement from 6 percent to 3 percent, will
take effect next month.
	   Also in July, banks will be allowed to settle payments on
individual transactions during the day, using their cash balance,
to help ``avoid the liquidity risk inherent in deferred end-of-day
settlement,'' Lee told the Association of Banks in Singapore.
	   But Lee appeared to caution nervous currency traders when he
said the reduction in the minimum cash balance does not ``signal
any easing of monetary policy or credit conditions. The target of
monetary policy in Singapore is the exchange rate, not interest
rates or money supply.''
	   The two measures will increase liquidity and provide banks more
interest income, but to avoid the chance of any run on a Singapore
bank with insufficient funds, the Monetary Authority will impose
stricter cash balance requirements on banks with financial
difficulties.
	   In announcing the changes, Lee referred to the heavily depressed
bank stocks on the Singapore exchange.
	   ``An early rebound in bank profits is unlikely,'' he said, ``and
banks will make more provisions for regional exposures.''
	   The measures should provide some short-term relief to banks that
have been hit hard by non-performing loans in Indonesia and
elsewhere.
	   Lee acknowledged that lack of full information about such
exposure makes investors nervous and said, ``We will raise our bank
disclosure norms to international standards.''
	   He said the six major banks, with the Monetary Authority's
approval, have agreed to ``stop the current practice of maintaining
hidden reserves.''
	   They have agreed to ``disclose the market value of their
investments, which have largely been valued at book cost, and hence
contributed to their hidden reserves,'' Lee said. ``They should
also disclose the level of their non-performing loans, and past and
future provisions.''
	   Over the next five years, ``we will progressively open up the
financial sector to greater foreign competition,'' he said.
	   As a ``modest first step,'' the Singapore dollar resident loan
limit on offshore banks is being raised from 200 million to 300
million Singapore dollars (dlrs 117 million to dlrs 175 million).

Bus fire in Armenia injures 11 schoolchildren, teacher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ A bus exploded and burst into flames on
a country road south of the Armenian capital, badly injuring 11
students and a teacher, officials said Monday.
	   The explosion occurred late Sunday near the village of
Bartsrashen, 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of Yerevan, when 40
students, teachers and parents were returning from a picnic.
	   Officials said the explosion was apparently caused by a gas
leak.
	   Most buses and other vehicles in Armenia run on natural gas.
Gasoline is in short supply due to an economic blockade imposed by
neighboring Azerbaijan because of the territorial conflict over
Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   The victims were hospitalized in the Yerevan Central Hospital
and some were in critical condition, said Norair Davidian, the
hospital's leading burn expert. The students were between the ages
of 12 and 14.

World Cup: Romanians train together behind locked gates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIOREL URMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALBI, France (AP) _ Looking refreshed after a night's rest from
their trip to France, seeded Romanian trained Monday at the squad's
practice site behind closed doors, guarded by more than a dozen
uniformed French policemen.
	   With reporters climbing atop cars at a distance to look over a
concrete wall around the field, the players held 1 1-2 hours of
stretching, passing and running _ with and without the ball _ for
their first practice since arriving Sunday.
	   After the practice, coach Anghel Iordanescu gave players a
lengthy speech, apparently explaining tactical plans for the
opening game against Colombia on June 15 in Lyon.
	   That game is much on the Romanians' minds, and team officials
said it well might decide which team will advance to the second
round.
	   ``If we lose, we can say goodbye and return home,'' said one
team official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Romania plays
in Group G, which also includes England and Tunisia.
	   All the 22 players took part in the practice and were declared
fit.
	   But one of the biggest problems for Iordanescu is defense, where
23-year-old Cristian Dulca of Rapid Bucharest, with only five caps,
looks likely to replace Atletico Madrid's Daniel Prodan as central
marking defender. Prodan, who is accompanying the team as an
onlooker, had surgery on his right knee last month and is still
recuperating.
	   Another problem for the Romanians is that they are short on
match practice. Iordanescu has complained that his team had been
refused the chance to attend a training camp in Switzerland and met
second-rate opponents in friendly matches, the last one against
Moldova last week.
	   ``The (Romanian Football) Federation has repeatedly told me they
do not have the necessary funds,'' he said.
	   The Romanians instead had to be content with a training camp in
the Carpathian Alps, north of Bucharest.

Russian government to layoff 231,100 state employees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government announced plans Monday to
lay off 231,100 employees this year in an attempt to cut budget
spending and reduce the deficit.
	   Government officials told lawmakers that the layoffs _ which
represent 3.6 percent of government employees _ would save about
5.86 billion rubles (dlrs 953 million), the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The government also said it would cut federal subsidies, reduce
utility supplies and lower credit limits to public organizations,
Interfax said.
	   Significant spending cuts were among the first measures
announced by Russia's new Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko after his
appointment this spring.
	   The Finance Ministry has said it plans to cut 62.4 billion
rubles (dlrs 10.2 billion) from this year's planned spending of
499.9 billion rubles (dlrs 82 billion).
	   Because of falling revenues, that would still widen budget
deficit, originally forecast at 133.9 billion rubles (dlrs 22
billion), by 1.5 billion rubles (dlrs 246 million).

	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has rejected the propaganda of the
Leader of the Opposition that the government will foil the long
march towards the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT).
	   Addressing a huge public meeting at the Paltan Maidan in the
city yesterday, the Prime Minister assured Begum Khaleda Zia that
neither the government nor the ruling party would create any
obstruction on the long march of the BNP.
	   ``Did I ever say that we will prevent the long march? Why should
I prevent her long march? I believe in democracy,'' Sheikh Hasina
said.
	   ``She (Khaleda Zia) is organising the long march to disturb the
peaceful environment in CHT and now-a-days tg march, it would be because of the
terrorists and infighting within the BNP.
	   The Awami League organised the meeting to mark the historic June
7. On this day in 1964, several persons, including Monu Mia, a
labour leader, were killed in police firing while observing a
hartal to realise the six-point demand, announced by the Father of
the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
	   The activists and supporters of the Awami League and its front
organisations gathered at the meeting venue chanting slogans. Sri
Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar also spoke at the
meeting. Twenty two leaders of the Awami League and its front
organisations addressing the meeting vowed to maintain peace in the
country at all costs. They said the peace-loving people of the
country would give a befitting reply to the BNP by holding a peace
procession against the so-called long march programme.
	   The meeting was addressed, among others, by Abdus Samad Azad,
Zillur Rahman, Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzak, Amir Hossain Amu,
Tofail Ahmed, Abdul Jalil, Mohammad Nasim, Begum Motia Chowdhury,
Muzaffar Hossain Paltu, Mohammad Hanif, Prof Abu Syed and Mofazzal
Hossain Chowdhury Maya.
	   In her presidential speech, the Prime Minister urged the people
to remain alert against the ill motives of the opposition BNP.
	   Referring to the restoration of peace in the CHT, Sheikh Hasina
said the peace accord was signed on December 2, 1997 following long
deliberations between the National Committee and the Jana Sanghati
Samity. The members of the Shanti Bahini returned to normal life
after surrendering their arms at Khagrachhari on February 10. She
said the people from all walks of life, including the tribal and
non-tribal men and women, attended the historic function on that
day ignoring the hartal called by the opposition.
	   ``The Leader of the Opposition does not accept the peace accord
and has been demanding its annulment,'' the Prime Minister said,
adding the scrapping of the peace accord would follow a war and
bloodshed there and the CHT would be again be isolated from the
rest of the country.
	   ``Does the Leader of the Opposition want to see there only dead
bodies, conflicts, terrorist activities and disturbances?'' Sheikh
Hasina asked and said: `` She (Khaleda) believes in disturbance...
The Oshanti Begum (mrs disturbance) does not feel well without
disturbance.''
	   About the movement launched by the Awami League during the BNP
regime, the Prime Minister said that at that time they had launched
the movement for the restoration of the people's right to vote and
against the corruption of the then ministers, MPs and the
plundering of national wealth by the family members of the then
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.
	   Rejecting the propaganda of Begum Khaleda Zia that the
Bangladesh territory upto Feni would become part of India in
accordance with the CHT peace accord, Sheikh Hasina said that now
they were waiting to see whether Khaleda Zia would go to the CHT by
taking Indian visa or not.
	   Sheikh Hasina said the Leader of the Opposition and other
leaders of the BNP had been spreading lies continuously to confuse
the people and to create disturbances in the country. She urged the
people to remain alert about such 'liars'.
	   In this connection, the Prime Minister said the BNP leaders had
been trying to create troubles in the country by resorting to
conspiracies. In the past, they had made attempts to increase the
prices of rice and salt through conspiracies, she added.
	   During her 25 minute speech, the Prime Minister also dealt with
the issue of electricity and the measures taken by the government
to overcome the problem.
	   ``We are aware that you are suffering because of shortage of
electricity,'' Sheikh Hasina told the people expressing her
sympathies with them.
	   But, she said, the problem has become acute as the previous BNP
government did not install any power plant despite the growing
demand for electricity in the country. The of loadshedding and the
disaster in the power sector had started since the last year of the
BNP government.
	   The Prime Minister said the BNP government did not even carryout
the overhauling and maintenance of the existing power plants
although it claimed that Taka six to seven thousand crores had been
spent in the power sector. But the present government could not
locate where the money had been spent. ``The previous government
actually misappropriated the money and failed to increase the power
generation,'' she said.
	   Sheikh Hasina said her government had taken steps to increase
the generation of electricity in the private sector on an emergency
basis. It was not possible to solve the problem overnight as the
installation of power plant is time consuming.
	   Stressing the need for shopping pilferage and wastage of
electricity, the Prime Minister said her government took measures
to minimise the sufferings of the common people by closing shops
and offices during the peak hour demand for power. In this
connection, she sought the cooperation of the people from all walks
of life.
	   The Prime Minister said the government was taking steps to
increase the generation of electricity in accordance with the
future demand.
	   ``We are working hard to build the country on the basis of the
spirit of the liberation war,'' Sheikh Hasina said, adding: ``The
21st century's Bangladesh will become a prosperous Bangladesh. We
will turn Bangladesh into 'Sonar Bangla' (prosperous Bangladesh)
which was dreamt by the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman.''

Number of malnourished children rises six-fold in southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The number of severely malnourished
children in six feeding centers in Sudan's southwestern Bahr el
Ghazal province has increased six-fold in the past three months
weeks, a humanitarian group said Monday.
	   The number of children requiring supplementary feeding has
jumped from 808 on March 22 to 5,037 May 31, Medicins Sans
Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders, said in a statement.
	   ``There is a serious deterioration in the nutritional status of
the vulnerable population in southern Sudan,'' the statement quoted
Marc Hermant, head of mission, as saying.
	   ``Over half of the children attending our feeding centers are
not improving because the distribution of food to the general
population is inadequate,'' Hermant said.
	   The statement said the MSF, which operates in the area in
conjunction with Operation Lifeline Sudan, a U.N. umbrella
organization of aid agencies, cannot deliver enough food for
930,000 needy people in areas in southern Sudan where both
government troops and the Sudan People's Liberation Army are
present.
	   Bahr el Ghazal has already suffered two consecutive poor
harvests due to fighting between the predominantly African, animist
and Christian southerners who are pressing for autonomy from the
Muslim and Arabized north.
	   ``It is crucial that sufficient food is distributed to sustain
families in the period up to and beyond the next harvest and seeds
and tools must also be in place before the onset of heavy rains,''
Hermant said.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died due to fighting and
accompanying famines.
	   Meanwhile, fighters of the National Democratic Alliance, which
is allied with the SPLA, said Monday they had captured two
garrisons near Kassala, about 425 kilometers (265 miles) east of
the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
	   A statement released in Nairobi said the battle took place
Friday and that NDA troops captured an assortment of arms from the
government forces.
	   The rebel claim could not be independently verified, and it was
not immediately possible to obtain comment from Khartoum.

	   BNP chief Begum Khaleda Zia yesterday said that the long march
to the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) would lay the foundation to
resist to conspiracies against the country's independence and
sovereignty.
	   Addressing a press conference at her Minto Road official
residence Begum Zia termed the Awami League government anti-state
and said that it had no right to continue in power any more. ``Time
has neared for it to be accountable to the people,'' she added.
	   In a seven-page written statement read out at the press
conference, the BNP chief said that the agreement on CHT was most
controversial and contrary to the Constitution and to the
fundamental rights of citizens.
	   The agreement and the laws enacted to make it effective had
endangered the territorial integrity and independence, undermined
the sovereignty of Parliament and had also put national security
under threat, she said.
	   She said that the people had once again been forced into a
struggle to save the motherland. ``We cannot allow the state,
achieved at the cost of blood of three million shaheeds, to turn
into Sikkim,'' she observed.
	   Begum Zia, however, told a questioner that they looked forward
to amending the four laws to delete the provisions that were
contrary to the Constitution and ensure equal rights for all
citizens.
	   She said that the Long March would be a ``march past to save the
country, not to capture power,'' and that the programme of
resistance would be peaceful ``because we believe in democracy and
constitutional politics.'' The responsibility for any violence by
the use of police or political workers would fall on the
government, she warned.
	   The BNP chief said that her party had invited delegates from all
districts to take part in the march to sympathise and express
solidarity with the citizens at risk and stricken by terrorism. On
the way to the CHT ``we will urge the people to pledge to resist
the enemies of the nation,'' she said.
	   Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, members of the National
Standing Committee Barrister Abdus Salam Talukdar, Col (retd) Oli
Ahmed, Abdul Matin Chowdhury, Barrister Moudud Ahmed, Dr. Khondker
Mosharraf Hossain; central leaders Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, MK
Anwar and Anwar Zahid were also present among others.
	   Begum Zia said the CHT problem had its origin in an address of
Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Rangamati in 1973 when
tribals were asked to become Bangalees. The then government had
even sought help from the Indian army to quell the rebellion, but
failed. The armed struggle turned into a separatist conflict
because of Indian support. Over 400 jawans of the army, the BDR,
Police and Ansar and thousands of Bangladeshi nationals had been
killed in the two decades of conflict, she said.
	   She said that her party had never neglected the CHT problem.
Late President Ziaur Rahman had tried to unite all including the
tribals under the banner of Bangladeshi nationalism and started
large scale development of the CHT, she said adding that her
government continued the process.
	   She said that her government had started repatriation of tribal
refugees in 1994 after having talks with India and that the Shanti
Bahini had declared a ceasefire. She said when a permanent
settlement of the problem was being reached, anarchy was created in
the country through repeated hartals. At that point, the Chakma
rebels suddenly raised some new demands that were contrary to the
Constitution and the interests of the people.
	   She said that a national problem the CHT one could only be
solved on the basis of a consensus, and within the framework of the
Constitution. All citizens, tribals and non-tribals should enjoy
equal rights, and all the people living in the area should be
directly involved in the peace process.
	   The BNP chief said that her party was the largest opposition in
Parliament in Bangladesh history but was consulted neither before
signing the treaty nor after it. Not even the Ministers and MPs of
the ruling party had been taken into confidence. The government had
not only betrayed the nation but had also thrown it into a new
crisis. The life and property of people of small tribes and of the
Bangla speaking settlers had become unsafe due to threats of Chakma
terrorists.' An extremist' Chakma group had started activities to
drive away Bangla speaking settlers by fanning separatism, she
said.
	   Begum Zia said that the government had lost control over the
CHT. The intrusion of more than one lakh Indian nationals into the
CHT had proved this, she said.
	   She said that the four new laws had termed the CHT a tribal area
and had vested the executive power of the area with a Regional
Council. The Bangla-speaking people had thus been turned into
second class citizens. Referring to the 8th Amendment to the
Constitution, knocked down by the Supreme Court for bifurcating the
highest court, she said that the creation of a Regional Council
amounted to sowing the seeds of separatism.
	   Through the agreement the government had sacrificed its
jurisdiction to order the movement of the army in the CHT where the
border now remained unguarded, she said. Acquisition of land had
also been made subject to approval of the Regional Council, she
said.
	   Provision for a tribal Minister on CHT affairs had been made in
contravention of the Constitution. Chakmas would dominate all
bodies whereas Bangla-speaking settlers who comprise 48 per cent of
the CHT population would have insignificant representation, she
said.
	   Parliament was sovereign to make laws for the whole country or
any part of it, but in formulating laws on the CHT it would have to
take prior approval of the Regional Council.
	   She said that the Constitution was against all forms of
discrimination, but that the new laws gave tribals preference in
government jobs there. The Bangla-speaking citizens would thus get
no jobs. The laws also provided that only tribals would be eligible
to become chairmen of the three hill district councils and the
Regional Council, and that Bangla-speaking citizens would have to
take 'non-tribal' certificates from Circle Chiefs. Such
discrimination had existed only under the erstwhile racist regime
of South Africa, she said.
	   She said that the agreement provided for cash grants, land,
waiving of bank loans with interest as well as clemency for crimes
like murder and terrorism for tribals; but did not ensure
compensation for Bangla-speaking citizens who had lost their
relatives, and whose homes had been burnt.
	   She alleged that the only objective of such a system of naked
discrimination opposed to fundamental rights was to drive away the
Bangla-speaking citizens and lay the foundation of a separate
state.
	   Begum Zia said that the anti-state terrorism was now not only
restricted to the CHT. The whole country was suffering. She said
that the rule of law had broken down, the economy had collapsed,
there was no electricity, no water and women and children had no
security of life. The people were under severe strain due to toll
collection and armed activities of terrorists of the ruling party,
she alleged.
	   Against this backdrop attempts were being made to plunder
natural wealth in the name of extracting the resources while bank
loans were being utilised to finance government propaganda. These
were parts of a blueprint to cripple Bangladesh and make it
dependent on foreign support, she said.

Report: Ring of Tutankhamen's queen found in Egyptian tomb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese archeologists have unearthed a ring
inscribed with the name of Egyptian king Tutankhamen's wife along
with thousands of other relics at an ancient tomb outside Cairo, a
news report said Monday.
	   Researchers from Japan's Waseda University and Tokai University
said they found the ring with Ankhesenamen's name in March in a
tomb some 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of the Egyptian
capital, Kyodo News reported.
	   ``We believe the person buried there was an extremely close
relative or an aide,'' Sakuji Yoshimura, a professor at Waseda
University who attended the excavation, was quoted as saying by
Kyodo.
	   Team members said they found the bluish ring, made of clay, in a
pit connected to the tomb's seven underground rooms. The ring is
two to three centimeters (one inch) long and about one centimeter
wide (a half inch), the report said.
	   The tomb, discovered by archaeologists after analyzing satellite
images, apparently had been broken into.
	   However, the 4,000 accessories from Tutankhamen's tomb as well
as a ring with the inscription of Tutankhamen's accession name were
apparently overlooked by the looters, the archeologists said.
	   The tomb is believed to be that of a minister-class official.
	   The team plans to resume excavation in December. They have also
found a pit believed to be connected to the room in which the
coffin is placed, team members said.

froze the country's assets abroad on Monday to punish Belgrade for
staging ``widespread house-burning and indiscriminate artillery
attacks on whole villages'' in separatist Kosovo province.
	   Serbia ``is engaged in a campaign of violence going far beyond
what could legitimately be described as a targeted anti-terrorist
operation,'' the EU foreign ministers said in a statement.
	   The EU urged Belgrade and Kosovo independence activists to seek
a negotiated solution. However, it said President Slobodan
Milosevic bore ``special responsibility'' as the Yugoslav head of
state.
	   Citing ``the grave deteriorating situation on the ground,
involving the excessive use of force by the Serb security forces,''
it banned all new investments in Serbia and froze the country's
assets in the 15 EU nations.
	   The EU promised ``other measures'' unless the violence is
halted. It has already banned arms exports and restricted travel
visas for Yugoslav officials. At Washington's urging, it earlier
held off on the investment ban and the assets freeze to give
Milosevic a chance to reach a peaceful settlement in Kosovo.
	   Further economic sanctions could include a ban on all flights by
JAT, the Yugoslav airline.
	   The EU move was unlikely to make an immediate difference. ``The
fight (to get Milosevic to ease up on Kosovo) clearly lies within
the United Nations Security Council,'' said a Dutch official.
	   Escalating violence in Kosovo in recent weeks has drawn
parallels with West European waffling in 1991 and 1992 as Bosnia
slipped into civil war.
	   NATO defense ministers are scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday
in Brussels to consider a military response to Milosevic, though in
recent weeks that option has sparked little enthusiasm.
	   In London on Friday, the foreign ministers of the G-8 nations _
Canada, United States, Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and
Russia _ will discuss Kosovo.
	   ``It is very important we include Russia in our efforts,'' said
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, but added to reporters ``that
will be difficult.''
	   Kinkel was to meet later Monday in Bonn with Yevgeny Primakov,
his Russian counterpart. Russia is a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council. Military intervention by NATO in Kosovo would
require a United Nations mandate. However, the prospect of that
emerging appeared dim.
	   Relations between Russia and NATO are already on edge since NATO
looks to expand into eastern Europe. Russia opposes using external
forces in Kosovo, saying it is an internal matter for Serbia
	   NATO military planners have been drafting contingency plans.
These include accelerating joint NATO maneuvers in Albania and
Macedonia, NATO help for these countries to seal their borders and
_ as a last resort _ deploying up to 20,000 troops to the two
countries.
	   Meantime, Kinkel and Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel
proposed similar peace efforts in Kosovo, including sending
observers, calling a cease fire and having an orderly return of
refugees and international mediation.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, chairman of the EU
meeting, warned Milosevic to ``back off'' or face a military
intervention in Kosovo, where Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent
of the 2.2 million-strong population. Most want to secede from
Serbia, which along with Montenegro, makes up Yugoslavia.

	   DOCTORS on Sunday night were battling to save the life of a
seven-year-old girl who suffered 70 per cent burns in a fire that
gutted a 12th-floor flat in Yau Ma Tei early Sunday.
	   Three other members of the family living in the flat were rushed
to hospital.
	   Lau Yeuk-ting was in critical condition in the intensive care
unit of the Kwong Wah Hospital. Her 41-year-old father, Lau
Kwok-chuen, was also in serious condition.
	   Two other family members _ Lau Hoi-ying, 4, and mother Lau
On-lee _ were said to be in stable condition.
	   A 66-year-old woman living on the 20th floor of the building was
also admitted to hospital for smoke inhalation.
	   ``The girl suffered 70 per cent burns. It can be very dangerous
because a child's body is smaller and her immune system is often
weaker,'' said the hospital's accident and emergency department
acting senior medical officer Ma Hing-man.
	   The fire broke out at 6 am and was put out in 30 minutes.

	   Joint Secretary General of Jamaat-e-Islami Muhammad
Quamaruzzaman yesterday urged the government not to intervene in
the long march and allow the peaceful termination of the opposition
action programme.
	   The Jamaat will begin the long march towards Chittagong Hill
Tracts (CHT) tomorrow from Ramna Park in the city centre at 7.30 in

	   The bilateral sea rescue operation _ the first exercise between
the two Pacific powers since World War II _ is included in a
package of proposals which have been put together by Chinese and US
diplomats preparing for the upcoming summit between presidents
Jiang Zemin and Bill Clinton.
	   The diplomats said the naval exercise would implement and extend
the ``constructive strategic partnership'' announced by both
presidents during Mr Jiang's landmark visit to Washington in
October last year. Negotiators have been working over the last few
months on proposals to implement pledges made by both presidents.
	   The package includes a series of exchanges and co-operation
between the two armies, including their military forces with
strategic implications.
	   All of these will be scrutinised and finalised by Mr Jiang and
Mr Clinton in their second summit this month in Beijing.
	   It is understood both sides are keen to engage in wider areas to
ensure that conflicts would be avoided following the crisis in the
Taiwan Straits in 1996 when Washington sent a fleet led by two
aircraft carriers to monitor Beijing's war games.
	   ``The joint navy exercise is of both symbolic and substantial
significance if it materialises,'' a Chinese diplomat said, adding
that it was the first time since the US army and the communist-led
Eighth Route Army fought together against the Japanese in World War
II.
	   However, the US army and the People's Liberation Army
subsequently fought each other in the Korean and Vietnam wars.
	   A mechanism for information exchange between the two armies _
for strategic forces and nuclear units _ will also be endorsed.
	   It is understood that regular annual visits by top officers of
the three services and various kinds of armed forces units and
warships from each side will also be pushed through.
	   Co-operation in maritime operations, civilian uses of nuclear
energy, environmental protection and the fight against
international crimes, including terrorism, will be widened. These
moves will enable more bilateral exchanges of information and
visits by experts, according to Beijing-based diplomats.
	   Chinese military officers and nuclear experts are expected to
pay a visit to the US National Laboratory for Nuclear Energy in
Arizona some time next year, with reciprocal visits by the US side
to follow.
	   Considering the current US Congressional investigation of the
Clinton administration's involvement in the alleged transfer of
missile technology to China, Chinese diplomats said some of the
proposals in the exchange package might not be made public until
the events had actually taken place.
	   Nevertheless, diplomats on both sides suggested that military
co-operation be put high on the agenda for the summit late this
month.

	   US President Bill Clinton has turned down an invitation to play
the saxophone with a group of Beijing musicians during his China
trip, saying that wants to avoid criticism ``of detracting from the
solemn atmosphere'' of the state visit.
	   Beijing bookstore proprietor Li Siqiang sent an invitation to
President Clinton inviting him to play saxophone with the store's
musicians.
	   Mr Li's privately-run bookstore, which sells books on Western
culture and political philosophy, has held jazz concerts every
weekend, attracting a throng of artists as well Western diplomats.
	   Mr Li wrote to the US embassy hoping the US President would
share his favourite songs with the Chinese people.
	   ``They recently replied to me, saying they were afraid the event
would spark criticisms from Mr Clinton's opponents, who might say
this is not in line with the solemn atmosphere required for a state
visit,'' Mr Li said.
	   The shop owner said the US embassy had given serious thought to
his proposal as it would have put the US President in direct touch
with the Chinese people. However the proposal was shunned by other
US officials.
	   Mr Li said Chinese intellectuals were looking forward to Mr
Clinton's visit and hoped that the landmark visit would bring about
a long-term open door policy.

	   The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) yesterday witnessed a big shock
and pandemonium on the street as the all share price index
nosedived by 89 points after bullish business transactions over the
last week.
	   Kerb market operators yesterday demonstrated outside the stock
exchange buildings in the afternoon and tried to enter the DSE
building forcibly. Police intervened to control the unruly kerb
traders, and the DSE's shutters remained closed for sometime to
avoid untoward incident.
	   The bourse on Saturday witnessed 81.28 points gain in the share
index recording a 11.65 per cent positive change in the day's
business over that of Thursday last. It was in continuation of a
steady rise on prices of almost all shares -- good and bad during
the last week following the previous week.
	   The DSE management was witnessing the developments with
increasing uneasiness as the market fundamentals were not
supportive of it. They were specially alarmed about the forward
trading' of shares from the Dhaka Stock Exchange floor to the
unauthorised kerb market operating on the city streets nearby.
	   Yesterday as the share index eclipsed by 11.43 per cent from the
previous day's record of a similar rise by 11.65 per cent or 81.28
points, the kerb market operators became restive. The market crash
memory of December 1996 made them nervous of losing their fresh
capital once again. The raised slogans against alleged market
manipulations and besieged the stock exchange building.
	   Earlier the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) authorities expressed
grave concern over the bullish business transactions during the
past couple of days and warned the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) about the unusual upward movement in the market
not justified by market fundamentals.
	   The market was heading for another undesirable situation, a DSE
letter informed the SEC on June 4 demanding strict surveillance of
the causes of the sudden price hike of all kinds of shares and
immediate corrective steps against irrational market behaviour to
avoid new crisis.
	   The DSE further informed the SEC of the unusual price hike of
shares of 27 companies in a separate a letter on June 4 and urged
the supervisory body to look into it.
	   The DSE also demanded an explanation of the price movements from
the issuers of these shares that were not supported either by the
prevailing market situation or the market rating of their shares,
said a source.
	   Another source said more than 50 companies were asked to explain
their share position recently in view of the soaring prices of
their shares. About 30 companies received such letters last week,
said the source.
	   The sources said that the market observers were really at a loss
as to what caused this upward price movement. Even those shares
which were totally ignored by investors previously were on the
gainers' list last week and on Saturday, the first business day of
the current week.
	   On Saturday's trading in the Dhaka stock exchange a total of 141
issues gained while only seven lost and one remained unchanged.
Contrary to it yesterday (Sunday) only five issues gained in value
while 124 lost. The market totally reversed overnight and observers
were quite confused to explain it.
	   The sources said the DSE management drew the attention of the
SEC to the missing link between the market fundamentals and the
share prices. They had also pointed to the intense activities in
the kerb market which appeared to be supplied from the DSE floor.
This was going in violation of the business rules adopted by the
SEC and the DSE.
	   Who were those violators supplying the kerb market with shares
and how a new manipulation was taking shape -- this required to be
immediately sorted out, the DSE is reported to have warned the SEC.
	   A DSE source told The Independent that fraud, counterfeiting of
shares and market manipulations might happen in the new situation
and, besides the SEC actions to stop these things, the DSE might
also caution the public about the risk of trading in the kerb
through news paper advertisement soon.
	   Explaining why the share prices were suddenly soaring, the
sources pointed to several factors. They said with the introduction
of the daily settlement of the business transactions as against
twice weekly netting system many brokers who were previously doing
business in the bourse both ``without shares and money'' now
required to possess some reserve of shares.
	   So they might have started to buy shares in the market after the
introduction of the daily settlement system.
	   Secondly, the many sponsor directors of the listed companies who
had sold part of their mandatory holding of shares earlier might be
buying shares to meet their requirement.
	   But the sudden slide in the market yesterday questioned the
validity of these reasons. Some sources said that actually the
bourse was currently exploited as a spot market to gain profits
from short term business instead of long term portfolio
investments.
	   As the price rose significantly over the last week, the lack of
investors' confidence in the market for a long term period forced
most of the buyers of the last week who even bought on Saturday to
become seller yesterday.
	   It reflected the poor confidence level of the investors although
many people wanted to invest in the bourse, said these sources.

	   Some of the major American companies have shown ``tremendous''
interest in investing in Bangladesh foreseeing it as a country with
bright development prospect.
	   ``Bangladesh has been identified as a destination for investment
by a number of US companies. And they are very much interested in
investing here,'' said Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed.
	   Talking to newsmen at the Zia International Airport on his
return from the United States on Sunday, he said US private
investment would go up to one billion dollars by the year-end.
	   ``The US investment in Bangladesh was only 25 million dollars
when we took over nearly two years back,'' said the minister
explaining the outcome of his visit to the United States.
	   He said the US companies are not only interested in the oil and
gas sector but also in downstream business like setting up of
fertiliser factory and petrochemical units.
	   Also the US companies showed their keen interest to invest in
Bangladesh's telecommunications sector and banking business, he
told journalists.
	   Tofail went to Washington on June 1, mainly to present a
key-note paper at the launch of the US-Bangladesh Business Council
(USBC), an investment catalyst forum set up by some US companies.
	   During his tour he met with US Secretary of Commerce William
Daley, the first ever meeting between a Bangladesh Commerce
Minister and his US counterpart since independence.
	   Four issues were discussed at the meeting.
	   First, Tofail said, he discussed about the planned visit of US
President Bill Clinton to Bangladesh. ``The visit is positive,'' he
said without elaborating.
	   The minister mentioned that the US investors were also
enthusiastic about the visit of Clinton because it would bring the
businesses of the two countries close.
	   The second issue was the Bangladesh proposal for raising the
quota of ready-made garment export to US market by 30 per cent.
``The matter is now under consideration,'' Tofail said.
	   Next was the debt under PL-480, he said, adding that the
Bangladesh side requested the Clinton administration to write off
8000 million dollars accumulated since 1972.
	   ``Finally we have again called upon the United States to provide
duty-free market access for the export products of the least
developed countries, including Bangladesh,'' he said.
	   The minister informed that during his meeting with US
under-secretary for Economic and Agricultural Affairs Stuart E
Eizenstat, he also discussed the same issues.
	   In another meeting with US Permanent Representative to the
United Nations Bill Richardson, the business issues dominated.
Richardson requested Tofail to facilitate US investment in
Bangladesh.
	   The Bangladesh minister had also meetings with some US
Congressmen, other business leaders and World Bank President James
D Wolfensohn during his trip to the US.
	   Wolfensohn assured that the Bank would raise its lending to
Bangladesh by 200 million US dollars from the current level of 450
million dollars and provide assistance for the development of
Chittagong Hill Tracts.
	   Tofail said all the people he met during the visit highly
appreciated Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for promoting peace in
CHT. ``They also appreciated her initiative to defuse tensions
between India and Pakistan,'' he said.
	   The minister said he was invited to attend a high-level meeting
of ECOSOC in the USA on July 6 to 7 when the trade ministers from
developed and developing countries would discuss the duty-free
access issue.

Villagers in Caucasus hold bus to avenge alleged abduction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with officials saying villagers
came from different village.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Villagers in Russia's southern republic of North
Ossetia detained 11 bus passengers on Monday in apparent
retaliation for the kidnapping of several neighbors, officials
said.
	   The bus passengers were from the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia. Ingush were blamed for abducting seven residents from
the village of Batako in North Ossetia on Sunday.
	   Both North Ossetia and Ingushetia are located in the North
Caucasus, a restive region that also includes breakaway Chechnya.
	   The Interfax news agency quoted Ossetian officials as saying
residents of Batako detained two buses with 40 residents. They let
one bus go and released women and elderly people from the second
bus.
	   Lev Zugayev, a spokesman for North Ossetian leader Alexander
Dzasokhov, said officials were holding talks with villagers to
persuade them to release the remaining 11 passengers.
	   Earlier reports quoted officials as saying the people holding
the bus came from the village of Zamankul.
	   Predominantly Orthodox Christian North Ossetia has maintained
warmer relations with Moscow than other parts of the North Caucasus
and served as a base for Russia's 1994-96 campaign against Chechen
separatists.
	   North Ossetia and neighboring Muslim Ingushetia fought a short
but bloody war in 1992. Hundreds of people were killed and most
ethnic Ingush were expelled from North Ossetia.
	   Both sides have blamed each other for numerous kidnappings.

	   The Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) has
taken up a Tk 100 crore socio-economic development project for
Pabna, Natore and Sirajganj districts.
	   The project, included in the Annual Development Programme (ADP)
of the current fiscal, aims at increasing food production,
alleviating poverty and ensuring irrigation system development in
the districts, BADC sources said.
	   The five-year project which was to have been started from July
97 would soon get off the ground, the sources added. A primary
allocation of Tk 50 lakh has already been made for the purpose.
	   Around 75 kms of canals and 300 derelict ponds would be
re-excavated and 25 cross-dams constructed in the areas. This
project would also arrange for irrigation through the installation
of a 250-cusec pump.
	   As a result, it will be possible to irrigate some 5,300 acres of
land, targeting an additional food production of 795 tonnes, valued
at nearly Tk 5 crore.
	   The project includes the installation of some 250 deep
tube-wells (DTWs), enabling irrigation of some 15,000 acres of land
for an additional output of 22,500 tonnes of food-grains worth more
than Tk 14 crore.
	   Under the project, the deep tube-wells will be sold to the
farmers in the project areas at lower prices.
	   The growers would be trained o ensue minimum wastage of
irrigation water, bringing it down from 5 per cent to 17 per cent.
An additional 17,832 acres of land would be brought under
irrigation in the three districts.
	   Some 493 deep tube-wells, currently lying inoperative will be
repaired and rehabilitated helping hectares of land a year.
Electric supply would be ensured to another 250 deep tube-wells of
the areas.
	   Around 250 power tillers would be supplied to the farmers. The
growers would be provided with seeds.
	   Some 24 fishing farms will be set up to train 1,500 owners of
ponds and fishermen. Poorer ones will be supplied with fish fry,
nets and improved breeds of ducklings.
	   Under the project 10 kms of feeder roads will be constructed in
the villages.
	   Nearly 35 lakh trees will be planted in the project areas to
stem the desertification process.
	   The literacy programme under the project would focus on some
15,000 youths and 15,000 adult people.
	   A number of non-government organisations (NGOs) will be involved
in the project.

World Cup: Injury to Helmer causing problems for Vogts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ The latest injury to hit versatile defender
and midfielder Thomas Helmer is the biggest shadow over Germany's
sunny headquarters on the French Riviera.
	   With one week to go before Germany opens its quest for a fourth
World Cup title against the United States in Paris, Helmer failed
to practice Monday because of a right thigh injury. Also missing
was wing back Christian Ziege, who is battling a fever.
	   ``It's a real, real shame for Thomas,'' coach Berti Vogts said
at his first news conference since the team's arrival Sunday.
	   ``He was being treated this morning and perhaps he can do some
light jogging this afternoon,'' Vogts said.
	   Helmer had just gotten over a thigh strain and played one half
and scored a goal in Germany's 7-0 thrashing of Luxembourg Friday.
Vogts said the new injury, a tensing of the muscle, was different
from the old one.
	   Dr. Hans-Willhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt, a team physician who also
is Helmer's club doctor at Bayern Munich, was flying in and would
examine the player before giving an update on Helmer's condition.
	   ``The doctor's arrival was planned long in advance, it has
nothing to do with this injury,'' Vogts said.
	   Helmer, the 33-year-old Bayern Munich captain, had to break off
Germany's first practice Sunday afternoon, which also was missed by
Ziege.
	   ``He was coming back very well after his original injury,
especially mentally, and I hope he doesn't get down again now,''
Vogts said.
	   Helmer is one of the team leaders who can play as a central
defender, a defensive midfielder, or even as a libero.
	   The 20 healthy players had a light workout Monday morning at the
Charles Ehrmann stadium at a Nice suburb, not far away from the
team's headquarters at the four-star Mas d'Artigny, a wooded,
secluded compound in the hills above Nice.
	   ``We have ideal conditions, from the hotel to the training
grounds and I hope we stay here a long time,'' Vogts said. The team
has reserved its rooms for a month, obviously hoping to reach at
least the semifinals.
	   Monday evening, the Germans played a charity match against a
local selection made up mostly of juniors.

Asian economic crisis may spark rise in illegal foreign labor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The Asian financial crisis is likely to spark a
surge in smuggling of illegal foreign laborers and unauthorized
cross-border movements of job-seekers, an intergovernmental
migration agency said Monday.
	   Growing hardship in Thailand, Malaysia and other countries in
the region will force more people to travel abroad to find work,
said a statement from the Geneva-based International Organization
for Migration.
	   This could fuel an increase in exploitation by unscrupulous
employers across the region, the IOM said.
	   ``The situation is ripe for smugglers to exploit people's
insecurity. This is a real worry,'' said Yorio Tanimura, the IOM's
senior expert on Asia.
	   The region lacks effective ways to manage migration, the agency
says. It wants governments to cooperate to prevent the
``potentially damaging mass movements.''
	   The region already hosts an estimated two million or more
irregular migrant workers, said the IOM, which promotes orderly
migration between countries.
	   Thailand has an estimated 943,000 irregular immigrants, three
times the number of authorized immigrants in the country.
	   The International Labor Organization has reported the number of
Indonesians caught and suspected of trying to illegally enter
Malaysia doubled in the first two months of this year compared to
the same period in 1997.
	   Indonesia's surplus of unskilled labor creates emigration
pressure which has been worsened by the recent financial crisis and
the domestic economy's severe contraction, the IOM said.
	   ``What is clear is that the intra-regional population movement
will continue to grow,'' said Tanimura. ``Unless this is done in a
regulated, orderly way, it could provide a destabilizing factor.''
	   The problem and possible solutions are due to be raised at a
regional Asia-Pacific consultation meeting in Bangkok on June 9-10.

	   A PRO-BEIJING legislator has thrown his support behind a deficit
budget for the next financial year.
	   Ng Ching-fai, re-elected without party affiliation, said on
Sunday he did not see how a deficit budget would violate the Basic
Law.
	   His remarks came after Tsang Hin-chi of the National People's
Congress Standing Committee said deficit spending was inevitable in
a slump.
	   Echoing Mr Tsang's thinking, Mr Ng said a deficit budget would
not violate the ``spirit of the Basic Law'' because the government
would seek to spend moderately only to overcome difficulties.
	   He said it was acceptable for the financial secretary to produce
a deficit budget if it was for only one year ``and that deficit is
not a huge one''.
	   But he said, ``if we are to have a budget running in the red for
the long term, of course that would not be possible''.
	   ``We have to examine the spirit of the Basic Law,'' he said.
``The mentality of the drafters at that time, according to our
understanding, was to have a moderate financial management.
	   ``If the budget is designed to avoid a deficit, then that has
fulfilled the principle of moderate planning.'' Article 107 of the
Basic Law states that the SAR ``shall follow the principle of
keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up its
budget, and strive to achieve a fiscal balance, avoid deficits and
keep the budget commensurate with the growth rate of its gross
domestic product''.

EU bans new investments in Serbia; freezes assets abroad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with comments from EU statement on possible
military action &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Worried that a new wave of ethnic cleansing
may ignite another Balkan war, the EU tightened sanctions against
Belgrade Monday and urged the NATO alliance to study a military
intervention to stop the bloodshed and suffering in Kosovo.
	   The European Union foreign ministers banned new investments in
Serbia and froze the country's assets abroad to punish it for
``widespread house-burning and indiscriminate artillery attacks on
whole villages'' in Kosovo.
	   Yet given the limited effect sanctions have had so far on
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, they urged ``international
security organizations ... to consider all options,'' including
those requiring specific United Nations Security Council support.
	   That could mean a military intervention by NATO. The sort of
actions requiring specific U.N. blessing would be the imposition of
a no-fly zone, air strikes against Serb artillery, beefing up U.N.
forces in Macedonia or _ the most extreme scenario _ sending an
allied force into Kosovo.
	   Until now, NATO has been considering only joint but small-scale
maneuvers with Albania and Macedonia and the deployment of up to
20,000 troops in Albania along the Kosovo border.
	   Looming over the Kosovo debate is the fear Serbia's crackdown
there will only ignite another Balkan war.
	   On Thursday and Friday, the NATO defense ministers meet in
Brussels to consider a military response to Milosevic, a prospect
that so far has met with little enthusiasm.
	   On Friday, the foreign ministers of the G-8 nations _ Canada,
United States, Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and Russia _
will discuss Kosovo in London bringing Russia into the
international deliberations.
	   ``It is very important we include Russia,'' German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters. ``But that will be
difficult.''
	   Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, would
be called on to endorse any NATO action under a U.N. mandate.
	   In their statement, the EU ministers said Serb security forces
have been ``engaged in a campaign of violence going far beyond what
could legitimately be described as a targeted anti-terrorist
operation.''
	   They urged Belgrade and Kosovo independence activists to seek a
negotiated solution to their conflict and spoke of ``the grave
deteriorating situation on the ground, involving the excessive use
of force by the Serb security forces.''
	   ``We are disturbed by reports that these attacks are beginning
to constitute a new wave of ethnic cleansing,'' the ministers said.
They called the flow of refugees into Albania a ``threat to
regional security and stability.''
	   The investment ban and the asset freeze come in addition to
previously announced measures including a ban on arms exports and
restricted travel visas for Yugoslav officials.
	   At Washington's urging last month, the EU held off on the
investment ban and assets freeze to give Milosevic a chance to
reach a peaceful settlement in Kosovo.
	   Escalating violence in Kosovo in recent weeks has drawn

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As Europe banned investment in
Serbia and weighed other ways to halt violence in Kosovo, Serbs
reported fresh clashes Monday in the secessionist province where a
U.S. diplomat and ethnic Albanian leader toured a battle-torn area.
	   In Luxembourg, European Union foreign ministers banned
investment in Serbia and froze the country's assets abroad for ``a
campaign of violence going far beyond'' a legitimate strike against
terrorists.
	   A Kosovo Albanian leader welcomed the sanctions but said they
were only a ``small step.''
	   ``NATO should become involved in Kosovo, because the Serbian
regime has had practice with sanctions and knows ways of bypassing
them,'' said Nekibe Kelmendi, head of the Albanians' largest party,
the Democratic League of Kosovo. ``It is a regime that only
respects the language of force.''
	   Britain, currently chairman of the EU, has become increasingly
determined to send NATO troops in the southern Balkans, both to
stop the violence from spilling over into neighboring Macedonia and
Albania and perhaps to quell the violence in Kosovo itself.
	   Washington also wants to stop Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic from using police and army against militants battling for
independence for Kosovo's Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   ``A credible discouragement in the direction of President
Milosevic is indispensible,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said at the EU meeting. ``I also hope for support in the steps
Britain is taking to get the measures within the United Nations and
NATO agreed to stop the violence in Kosovo.''
	   In Pristina on Monday, a daily march by Kosovo Albanians for
peace passed off without incident, unlike the previous day's march,
when more than 100 Serbian police broke up the demonstration,
injuring at least six Albanians.
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, joined
ethnic Albanian Fehmi Agani on a trip to the Decani region in
western Kosovo, scene of fierce fighting last week.
	   A convoy of diplomats, joined by journalists for Serbian
state-run media and one independent journalist, toured the region
Sunday and saw ghastly scenes reminiscent of the earlier wars in
Bosnia and Croatia.
	   Independent journalist Aleksandar Vasovic said the group saw
many houses that had been shelled or burned out, and several
deserted villages. Serbian police said the militants started the
fighting, but Dutch ambassador Jan Sizoo was skeptical.
	   Up to 20,000 refugees from the Decani area have fled into
neighboring Albania. Another 7,000 to 10,000 are in Montenegro, the
only other Yugoslav republic, and some 50,000 are thought to be
displaced within Kosovo itself.
	   Many of that group are hiding out in the Drenica region in the
center of the province, where Serbian police began their crackdown
in early March. Since then, more than 250 people have been killed.
	   Ethnic Albanian officials say the campaign in the west has
killed at least 50 people and 200 others have gone missing since
late May.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the 2.2 million
inhabitants of Kosovo, and most want to secede from Serbia. Western
powers oppose any change of borders, but want Serbia to restore the
broad autonomy it took away in 1989.
	   In Turkey on Monday, Balkan foreign ministers were meeting and
may discuss Kosovo. NATO is due to weigh its moves later this week,
and the foreign ministers of the Contact Group _ the United States,
Britian, France, Germany and Russia, joined by Canada and Italy _
is to consider further steps Friday.

	   THE 12 measures announced by the government to revive the
economy and ease unemployment are of little use to fresh graduates,
the Democratic Party (DP) said.
	   ``According to the latest figure provided by the Education and
Manpower Bureau, a total of 148,620 students will soon graduate
from Form 5, Form 7 classes and the tertiary institutions.
	   Among them, 70,190 will have a chance to go for higher studies .
. . It means that 78,430 graduates will enter the labour market
soon,'' Democrat Chan Kwok-leung said.
	   He said only two measures in the government's 12-point plan were
related to fresh graduates _ extending the tertiary students' loan
scheme and creating more places in post-graduate courses.
	   ``And these two measures are in fact useless in helping the
fresh graduates find new jobs.
	   ``The government did not have any practical measures in
assisting these graduates.'' Mr Chan urged the government to look
into the problem of youth unemployment because it was often over
15.5 per cent. He suggested the government improve the Labour
Department's services.
	   ``Other than just introducing jobs to people who go there, it
should offer one-on-one consulting services, especially to fresh
graduates because they may not know what they actually want to
do.'' Mr Chan also asked the government to offer more temporary
jobs to young people so that the problem of unemployment could be
eased _ temporarily at least.
	   ``But in the long run, the government should think of how to
stimulate the economy, like introducing tax cuts so that more jobs
will be created.''

	   For over 2,000 years, man has recognized the virtues of white
asparagus, prizing its large, tender, and delicately-flavored
spears as a culinary temptation of unsurpassed value.
	   Asparagus derives its name from ancient Greek, which means
``sprout'' or ``shoot''. The ancients had long considered the white
asparagus -- cousin to the onion, leek, and garlic -- a delicacy,
but it was the Romans who developed gardening techniques to grow
them. They enjoyed it in season and were the first to preserve it
by freezing. In fact, so familiar were the characteristics of white
asparagus to them that the Emperor Caesar Augustus defined
``haste'' as ``quicker than you can cook a white asparagus.''
	   Emperors and kings put a high premium on white asparagus, which
is why it has always been referred to as the ``Food of Kings.''
King Louis XIV of France, the Sun King, was so enamored of the
tender young spears of white asparagus, which are harvested as soon
as they appear above the ground, that he built special greenhouses
so he could have a ready supply year-round.
	   ``Fortunately, you don't have to be a king these days to enjoy
white asparagus,'' says The Peninsula Manila's Old Manila Chef
David Senia. ``From June 5 to 12, we are flying in white asparagus
spears fresh from Bruchsal, Germany for our food festival. The
delicate white asparagus is the most luxurious of all asparagus
varieties and has a full-flavored, delicious taste.''
	   Taking stellar turns in his White Asparagus Festival menu are
Terrine D' asperges blanche et vertes aux fois gras (White and
green asparagus terrine with duck liver), Filets de rougets a la
puree d' olives, mille feuille de chips aux asperges et piments
(Fillet of red mullet withminced black olives, layered potatoes,
and white asparagus served with chili oil), Filet mignon de veau a
la fricasse d' asperges et ecrevises Pate Touge aux Deux Jus
(Pan-fried veal loin with fricassee of asparagus and crayfish in
natural jus), and Troncon de Saumon Gratine a la Fondue d' Asperges
blanche sa sauce poulette (Gratinated salmon with foundue of white
asparagus and light chicken sauce).
	   ``For purists,'' he promises, ``there will be the classic
Asperges blanches servient et ses pomme de terre a l'anglaise
(White asparagus served with boiled potatoes, Hollandaise sauce or
butter, with side order of Black forest ham, Smoked Salmon, Cooked
Ham, Breaded Sweetbreads, Russian Sevruga Caviar, Sauteed Foie
Gras).''
	   And for a novel twist, the dessert cart will feature something
of a first for a lot of Filipinos: asparagus desserts. There will
be Moelleux a l'orange et asperges caramelisees dans son chapeau
renverse (Chocolate top hat filled with orange mousse and
caramelized asparagus), Mille-feuille d' asperges blanche a la
creme d' avocat vanillee (Mille-feuille of white asparagus and
avocado cream), and Fruits frais de saison et son sorbet aux
asperges (Tropical fruit platter with asparagus sherbet).

	   The local forex market was steady on Sunday. US dollar was
traded between
	   Taka 46.45 and Taka 46.48. Even though T-bills worth Taka 138.50
crore matured, call money rate did not fall as T-bills were already
discounted and the call rate was between 9 per cent and 10.5 per
cent, says a StanChart Bank.
	   International markets were closed on weekend on Sunday. On
Friday, in New York, US dollar gained against both yen and DEM.
Dollar gained against yen because of rumours of Bank of Japan's
high officials' scandal and weak financial structure. On the other
hand, dollar's rise against DEM was attributed to the healthy
growth in the US job market.
	   In New York, on Friday, Dollar closed at 1.7745/55 DEM,
139.60/70 yen and GBP closed against 1.6334/44 US dollar.

	   Failure of the world's top seven industrialized nations to come
up with effective measures to stop the Japanese yen from further
depreciating could lead to renewed volatility and afurther drop in
the value of the peso.
	   In an interview with The Business Daily, traders said it was
possible for the peso to return to P40 -P50 to a dollar levels
should the yenfall below the N140 to a dollar range.
	   ``The region is anticipating Group of Seven (G-7) policies to
defend the yen. Failure to do so could be a major psychological and
economic factor,''
	   a trader at a commercial bank said.
	   Analysts and investment houses said the yen's continued
depreciation could create a domino effect in the region, leading to
yet another round of wholesale depreciations of currencies.
	   Finance officials from the G-7 countries are due to meet in
Paris next week to discuss the issue.
	   The Perils of Globalization Local sources pointed at the
country's exports being hampered by more rapid depreciation in the
currencies of competitors like Indonesia, Malaysia, China, and
Thailand.
	   A particularly wary eye is cast by many on reactions by Chinese
policy makers who at an earlier meeting of international economic
experts in Davos, Switzerland, had hinted at the strong possibility
of a guided depreciation in the value of the yuan.
	   A different angle, meanwhile, was adopted by brokerage house
Goldman &AMP; Sachswho advised its clients that ``a declining yen makes
a mockery of International Monetary Fund-driven policies in
countries like South Korea and Thailand, where currency stability
is regarded as a major priority.
	   Additional yen weakness may worsen the Asian contagion to other
emerging countries like Russia, Brazil, and Mexico by weakening
commodity prices and introducing higher risk premiums to compensate
foreign investors, Goldman said.
	   It is feared by analysts that dollar bloc economies will be
impacted by correlations to the yen because of Japan's importance
as an export market and the steep slide in commodities prices.
	   Goldman &AMP; Sachs further stated it was ``inevitable at some stage
that G-7 countries will try to halt the yen's weakness, and while
the market will doubt its effectiveness, it is quite likely that
the G-7 could stabilize the yen at stronger levels until Japan's
fiscal package has an impact from Q3 onwards.''
	   Japanese policymakers believe the recently announced fiscal
stimulus plans will have a positive impact on the economy but
measures have yet to be implemented, said Goldman.
	   Without G-7 intervention, dollar/yen was expected to move toward
N142 to the dollar or lower.
	   The yen, meanwhile, was not able to sustain its recovery from
Wednesday's N137.72 to a dollar, dropping to N138.12 to a
dollarWeak Thai Baht As Culprit -- BREAKERStill an unwilling
participant in the ebb and flow of the turmoil surrounding regional
currency markets, the peso closed slightly weaker yesterday after
corporations bought dollars when the exchange rate hit the P38/$1
range.
	   Corporations are buying on dips in the dollar buying rate,'' a
trader said.
	   ``Although banks are still scared to take big positions ...
there are still some holding on their dollars,'' he added.
	   The peso was weighed down by sluggish regional currencies,
especially the Thai baht.
	   The peso closed at P39.16 to the dollar, down from P38.88 on
Wednesday.
	   Turnover was moderate at $86.5 million.
	   ``The peso went down primarily due to the baht. The baht did not
depreciate even when the yen strengthened,'' a trader said.
	   The Thai currency hit a low of 43.15 to a dollar before settling
at 42.9 to a dollar.
	   The baht fared poorly after Moody's said on Wednesday that it
was unlikely to change Thailand's Ba1 sovereign rating in the next
six to 18 months as there might be fresh difficulties if the
government was unsuccessful in implementing planned reforms.
	   Thai central bank chief Chatu Mongol Sonakul said the baht at
the 40-45 per dollar level would not hurt the economy, but added
that the central bank would be watching developments and would try
and keep baht volatility down.
	   A 'Well Behaved' BSP -- BREAKERThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
(BSP), which was expected to raise overnight rates to prevent
attacks on the peso, did not make an adjustment.
	   BSP Director for Economic Research Diwa Guinigundo stressed
central monetary authorities would not intervene in the market
unless absolutely necessary.
	   Traders had commented that the BSP was ``well-behaved,'' saying
the fall in the value of the peso did not warrant intervention.
	   Guinigundo also stressed prudent economics and a newfound market
oriented approach.
	   ``We do not subscribe to devaluation engineering as its efficacy
has been repudiated by recent events. It does not make sense to
propose absorbing capital inflows, avoid sterilization, and allow
the money supply to expand and induce interest rates to drop,'' he
said ``Where was the BSP in all these twists and turns of the peso
in recent times? Since the beginning of the year until May 8, the
BSP sold only $3 million to the foreign exchange market, while
buying $104.5 million.
	   Without such a stance, the peso could have been stronger,'' he
argued.
	   Guinigundo said BSP bought dollars to boost up its gross
international reserves and not ``to pursue a certain exchange rate
level.''
	   However, he admitted there were ``structural weaknesses''
present in varying degrees in all the regional economies, including
the Philippines.
	   ``There was undoubtedly some force that triggered the concerted
attack on regional currencies. There is no doubt, however, that the
ability of these economies to weather the storm and emerge from it,
whether bloodied or unscathed, whether sooner of later, depends
ultimately on the soundness of their policy environment,'' he said.

	   The Philippines is likely to import more grain and sugar to
cover a domestic shortfall because of drought, officials and
industry analysts said yesterday.
	   Rain in the past few days will not have an immediate impact on
crops.
	   ``At least 1.5 million tons,'' Rolando Dy, director of the
Institute of Agribusiness Development and Policy of the University
of Asia and Pacific said when asked to give his forecast on the
country's rice imports this year.
	   ``For corn, (we) have to import some more. El Nino will continue
to affect coconut and sugar in 1999,'' he added.
	   The Philippines has had below-normal rains since April 1997.
	   Officials and meteorologists said the arrival of rains starting
in the middle of May eased drought in most parts of the country but
they also raised fears that El Nino's sibling -- La Nina -- may be
on its way and with it, torrential rain and flooding.
	   Theweather bureau has predicted a 30% probability for La Nina
hitting the country later this year.
	   So far this year government has imported a record 1.35 million
tons of rice, the staple of the 71 million Filipinos.
	   On Monday, President Fidel Ramos said he expected national rice
output in the second quarter to fall 28% from the year-ago 2.283
million tons.
	   The harvest in the first quarter dropped to 2.22 million tons
from the year-ago's 2.56 million tons.
	   The corn shortage is expected to reach between 500,000 tons and
1.5 million tons this year, analysts said.
	   ``We imported a lot already because of the drought. If La Nina
turns out to be a brat, then we might have to bite the bullet and
import more,'' an executive in one of the country's largest
feedmills told Reuters.
	   Feedmillers are set to seek tenders for the supply of 80,000
tons of corn on Friday.
	   The country has so far imported 245,000 tons of yellow corn from
the US, Argentina and China since the start of the year.
	   Industry executives said they do not expect feedmillers, poultry
and hog farmers to shift to buying substitutes like sorghum, rye
and barley despite the reduction by government on the tariff on the
import of the commodities this year.
	   ``Sorghum, rye and barley are poor substitutes. They have less
carbohydrate content. We are not interested to buy these
products,'' the feedmill executive said.
	   ``We wantgovernment to bring down the tariff on corn instead,''
he added.
	   The Philippines imposes a tariff of 35% to 80% on corn imports.
	   The country is also expected to import shortly 200,000 tons of
sugar because of increased demand from the local beverage industry,
which reported a 35% rise in sales in the first quarter, sugar
industry sources said.
	   The dry weather and the run-up to the May 11 presidential
elections, when candidates distributed food and drinks, spurred
increase in beverage and ice cream consumption, they said.
	   ``The rains should change the sugar picture in the next crop
year,'' Sugar Regulatory Administration chief Michael Suarez said.
	   This would enable farmers to replant wilted crops, he added.
	   But other industry sources said too much rain may bring down
yields because of lower sucrose content of the sugarcane.
	   Suarez had earlier predicted that the Philippines will import
360,000 tons of sugar in the next crop year.
	   Farmers also said the combined effects of El Nino and La Nina
may push down coconut output by as much as 41% this year.
	   ``Coconut trees need water but not too much,'' said Efren
Villasenor, president of the National Coalition of Small Coconut
Farmers and Workers Organizations.
	   Government has predicted a 10% drop in coconut output in copra
terms this year from 2.6 million in 1997.

World Cup: Injury to Helmer causing problems for Vogts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT slug to conform to digest. &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ The latest injury to hit versatile defender
and midfielder Thomas Helmer is the biggest shadow over Germany's
sunny headquarters on the French Riviera.
	   With one week to go before Germany opens its quest for a fourth
World Cup title against the United States in Paris, Helmer failed
to practice Monday because of a right thigh injury. Also missing
was wing back Christian Ziege, who is battling a fever.
	   ``It's a real, real shame for Thomas,'' coach Berti Vogts said
at his first news conference since the team's arrival Sunday.
	   ``He was being treated this morning and perhaps he can do some
light jogging this afternoon,'' Vogts said.
	   Helmer had just gotten over a thigh strain and played one half
and scored a goal in Germany's 7-0 thrashing of Luxembourg Friday.
Vogts said the new injury, a tensing of the muscle, was different
from the old one.
	   Dr. Hans-Willhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt, a team physician who also
is Helmer's club doctor at Bayern Munich, was flying in and would
examine the player before giving an update on Helmer's condition.
	   ``The doctor's arrival was planned long in advance, it has
nothing to do with this injury,'' Vogts said.
	   Helmer, the 33-year-old Bayern Munich captain, had to break off
Germany's first practice Sunday afternoon, which also was missed by
Ziege.
	   ``He was coming back very well after his original injury,
especially mentally, and I hope he doesn't get down again now,''
Vogts said.
	   Helmer is one of the team leaders who can play as a central
defender, a defensive midfielder, or even as a libero.
	   The 20 healthy players had a light workout Monday morning at the
Charles Ehrmann stadium at a Nice suburb, not far away from the
team's headquarters at the four-star Mas d'Artigny, a wooded,
secluded compound in the hills above Nice.
	   ``We have ideal conditions, from the hotel to the training
grounds and I hope we stay here a long time,'' Vogts said. The team
has reserved its rooms for a month, obviously hoping to reach at
least the semifinals.
	   Monday evening, the Germans played a charity match against a
local selection made up mostly of juniors.

	   PRO-BEIJING party boss Jasper Tsang Yok-sing has expressed
reservations about the immediate need to amend the Basic Law to
bring forward full democracy.
	   Speaking on the RTHK program Letter To Hong Kong, the chairman
of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong said
nobody ``apart from a few demagogues'' believed the solution to
economic problems lay in holding more elections.
	   ``Many now realise we have been too pessimistic about our
political situation and too optimistic about our economy.'' Mr
Tsang, a legislator-elect, stressed that any successful political
reform must have public support.
	   He pointed out that Hong Kong people's greatest worry about
interference from the Central Government had eased one year after
the handover.
	   Although they still wanted democracy, people no longer believed
it was the answer to their most pressing economic problems, he
said.
	   ``People are unhappy with the devaluation of their property and
stocks, with the closing down of large department stores, and with
the rising unemployment rate.
	   ``The Basic Law can be changed, and the date of realising the
goal of full democracy can be brought forward, but only when the
majority of the population understand fully the implications of the
change and support it,'' he said.

	   Cha Cha is desirable and should be initiated at the earliest
time possible.
	   The consensus is that the Constitution can stand a lot of
improvement. But the process of revision should be deliberate, not
rushed.
	   Thus, with retired Supreme Court Justice Cecilia Munoz Palma
taking the lead in organizing a Constitutional Convention, we
should be able to put together a credible organization of delegates
(hopefully a majority) with vision. Planning for the assembly will
likely be as important as the convention itself.
	   Camouflaged Revisions What undoubtedly will be a major issue is
a shift from a presidential to a parliamentary system. Certainly,
both systems have their merits and shortcomings. But whichever the
assembly's final choice should ensure that current major
infirmities are totally eliminated from either of the systems and
are not reinserted as camouflaged, insidious revisions. The
fundamental change should revolve around a strong party system that
will nevertheless ensure for independent candidacies as close to
equal playing fields as possible. The mechanism should neutralize
the advantages of highest bidders.

	   TAI chi has taken centre stage in Central Park, New York, where
the Hong Kong Tourist Association launched a colourful campaign to
attract American tourists.
	   More than 1,000 lovers of the ancient Chinese martial art turned
out at the ceremony officiated by Chief Secretary for
Administration Anson Chan Fang On-sang to open the ``Hong Kong _
City of Life'' tourist promotion.
	   Mrs Chan urged New Yorkers to ``come and see for yourselves''
what made Hong Kong a city of life.
	   ``Hong Kong is at the cutting edge of Asian creativity, as New
York is the creative heartland for America,'' she said.
	   Mrs Chan attributed the attraction of Hong Kong to its
diversity, citing the availability of shopping places and the wide
variety of restaurants.
	   Of course, the most amazing experience would be to land in the
world's newest airport in Chek Lap Kok, to be opened in July, she
said.
	   ``Take the trip in the next few months, you will be among the
first to land at the world's newest airport _ Hong Kong
International at Chek Lap Kok _ a US$20 billion (HK$155 billion)
project,'' Mrs Chan told crowds at Central Park's Wollman Rink.
	   A series of Tai chi demonstrations by expatriates was staged in
the venue.
	   Tai chi is considered by foreigners as one of the mysterious
aspects of Chinese culture.
	   Hong Kong tourism has seen an unprecedented decline in the wake
of the Asian financial turmoil.

	   THE leader of the new alliance of seven political parties is to
demand a probe into why local banks have brought on a credit
crunch.
	   Liberal Party chairman Allen Lee Peng-fei on Sunday said he
would ask Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen on Tuesday
to look into why local banks were refusing to offer loans to their
customers.
	   Mr Lee, along with other party leaders, and Sir Donald will also
discuss the government's response to a package of six measures
proposed by the alliance to boost the sagging economy.
	   Mr Lee, who is also a member of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's
think-tank on long-term development strategy, told the City Forum
that the banks' practices had led to a credit crunch which had
brought ``great harm to our business environment''.
	   ``I will ask him to investigate the reasons for such practices,
and secondly, I will ask him to probe into how the banks use the
money they get from deposits,'' Mr Lee said.
	   ``The banks now refuse to offer loans to business firms, refuse
mortgages, and shrink the lending money for letters of credit,
too.'' Other speakers at the forum showed the same concern over the
credit crunch.
	   Dr Frances Lui Ting-ming, director of the Centre for Economic
Development of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,
said: ``The seriousness of the blows to the economy brought by the
shrinking of bank credit is three times that brought by
unemployment.'' Mr Lee said he would ask Sir Donald to accept all
six of the alliance proposals, stressing that there could be no
compromise.
	   The six measures include reducing property rates and government
charges, speeding up infrastructure projects, and looking into
problems of high interest rates.
	   He gave a strong hint that the legislature could make it
difficult for the government to enact its pet measures if these
proposals were not carried out.
	   However legislators who spoke at the forum said they were not
striking against the executive-led principle of SAR government.
	   Independent legislator Eric Li Ka-cheung, who represents the
Accountancy constituency, said: ``We are not forcing the government
but such a move is very meaningful because the politicians have
moved a first step to form a consensus, and the government has
emphasised they will co-operate with us.'' All speakers regarded
the government as financially able to reduce rates and public
charges with its enormous reserves.
	   Other measures suggested to ease the downturn included scrapping
the existing labour importation scheme, urging real estate owners
to reduce rents, and encouraging the private sector to start
businesses with tax rebates or subsidies.

Number of malnourished children rises six-fold in southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The number of severely malnourished
children in six feeding centers in Sudan's southwestern Bahr el
Ghazal province has increased six-fold in the past three months
weeks, a humanitarian group said Monday.
	   The number of children requiring supplementary feeding has
jumped from 808 on March 22 to 5,037 May 31, Medicins Sans
Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders, said in a statement.
	   ``There is a serious deterioration in the nutritional status of
the vulnerable population in southern Sudan,'' the statement quoted
Marc Hermant, head of mission, as saying. ``Over half of the
children attending our feeding centers are not improving because
the distribution of food to the general population is inadequate.''
	   The statement said the MSF, which operates in the area in
conjunction with Operation Lifeline Sudan, a United Nations
umbrella organization of aid agencies, cannot deliver enough food
for 930,000 needy people in areas in southern Sudan where both
government troops and the Sudan People's Liberation Army are
present.
	   Bahr el Ghazal has already suffered two consecutive poor
harvests due to fighting between the predominantly African, animist
and Christian southerners who are pressing for autonomy from the
Muslim and Arabized north.
	   ``It is crucial that sufficient food is distributed to sustain
families in the period up to and beyond the next harvest and seeds
and tools must also be in place before the onset of heavy rains,''
Hermant said.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died due to fighting and
accompanying famines.
	   Meanwhile, fighters of the National Democratic Alliance, which
is allied with the SPLA, said Monday they had captured two
garrisons near Kassala, about 425 kilometers (265 miles) east of
the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
	   A statement released in Nairobi said the battle took place
Friday and that NDA troops captured an assortment of arms from the
government forces.
	   The rebel claim could not be independently verified, and it was
not immediately possible to obtain comment from Khartoum.

	   The Chittagong Port Authority rejected the preconditions tagged
by ADB to a multi-million-dollar package investment for upgrading
the seaport, reports APB.
	   Officials said the Asian Development Bank asked for full
privatisation of port operations while holding out 43 million
dollars in loan for modernising the Chittagong and Mongla ports.
	   A few days back, ADB had submitted the final report on
``Bangladesh Port Upgrading Project'' to CPA asking them to reply
by June 10 whether they were ready to accept the terms and
conditions.
	   CPA in a meeting yesterday disapproved of the ADB preconditions
``in greater interest of the national economy as well as of the
Chittagong Port.'' CPA's acting Chairman Zahiruddin Mahmood
presided.
	   However, CPA agreed on partial offloading of the port activities
for bringing competitiveness, raising efficiency and gearing up
operations of the country's biggest seaport.
	   ``Main thrust of privatisation is on creating a competitive
atmosphere in port operations,'' the meeting observed.
	   ``But full-scale privatisation of port activities would create a
private monopoly which might breed manifold problems.''
	   Moreover, several thousand workers and employees of the port
will be jobless if the port activities, now conducted under direct
supervision of the CPA, are fully made over to the private sector.
That will spark labour unrest.
	   ``Considering all this the preconditions of full privatisation
of port activities cannot be accepted at this stage,'' the meeting
concluded.

Villagers in Caucasus hold bus to avenge alleged abduction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with 6 passengers released. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Villagers in Russia's southern republic of North
Ossetia detained five bus passengers on Monday in apparent
retaliation for the kidnapping of several neighbors, officials
said.
	   The bus passengers were from the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia. Ingush were blamed for abducting seven residents from
the village of Batako in North Ossetia on Sunday.
	   Both North Ossetia and Ingushetia are located in the North
Caucasus, a restive region that also includes breakaway Chechnya.
	   The Interfax news agency quoted Ossetian officials as saying
residents of Batako detained two buses with 40 residents. They let
one bus go and released women and elderly people from the second
bus. Six men were released after talks with government officials.
	   Talks continued to gain the release of the remaining five
passengers, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Predominantly Orthodox Christian North Ossetia has maintained
warmer relations with Moscow than other parts of the North Caucasus
and served as a base for Russia's 1994-96 campaign against Chechen
separatists.
	   North Ossetia and neighboring Muslim Ingushetia fought a short
but bloody war in 1992. Hundreds of people were killed and most
ethnic Ingush were expelled from North Ossetia.
	   Both sides have blamed each other for numerous kidnappings.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix overline garble &QL; 
 &UR; Anticensorship group criticizes Zimbabwe government control of
media &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Zimbabwe's government exercises tight control over
the mass media, and recently ordered radio and TV reporters to
highlight unfounded allegations that whites were behind
antigovernment protests, an international organization against
censorship said in a report released Tuesday.
	   The group, Article 19, said President Robert Mugabe's
government, which faces increasing unrest, and charges of
corruption and economic mismanagement, tolerates independent
newspapers as long as they cater only for a small business
readership.
	   ``Recently staff at the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation have
been reprimanded and even sacked for coverage of political protest
deemed to be too sympathetic,'' said Article 19, named after the
provision in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for freedom
of expression.
	   It added that the editor of The Herald, the main daily
newspaper, was recently fired after an editorial criticized the
government's handling of food price protests in January. Tommy
Sithole, who the report said ``was always seen as an uncompromising
defender of the government,'' was replaced by a Mugabe relative.
	   Article 19 urged broader ownership of the media, repeal of
censorship laws, a Freedom of Information Act and the right of
journalists to protect their sources.
	   The government owns all radio and TV in Zimbabwe, as well as the
main newspapers through a state-controlled trust.
	   ``The government exerts a degree of direct control over the mass
media almost without parallel in southern Africa,'' said the
report. '' ... The independent press is often outspoken but is
constantly inhibited by both legal and economic restrictions.''
	   Article 19 said the independent media has produced some skilled
and courageous journalists. It did not identify individuals, but
said many of these journalists now work on publications such as the
Zimbabwe Independent, a weekly, and Horizon, a monthly. But between
them, these publications sell fewer than 60,000 copies, compared
with the 200,000 daily circulation of The Herald and The Chronicle,
the other main daily based in the southern province of
Matabeleland.
	   Citing other forms of official censorship, Article 19 said the
mass media has been used to promote Mugabe's antipathy toward
homosexuals.
	   The group praised the Zimbabwe Supreme Court for upholding
constitutional rights, but the government responded by swiftly
amending the constitution ``when it finds itself on the wrong end
of a court decision.''

	   A DEFEATED candidate on Sunday launched a legal action to
challenge the result of the election in her functional
constituency.
	   Ann Chiang Lai-wan, who lost by just one vote to Tang Siu-tong
in the Regional Council constituency election on 24 May, has filed
a petition with the High Court seeking a new verdict on the outcome
of the poll.
	   Her lawyers are said to be solicitor Anna Wu Hung-yuk, a former
legislator, and barristers Gladys Li Chi-hei, former Bar
Association chairwoman, and Hector Poon.
	   The two defendants are Mr Tang and the returning officer of the
counting centre.
	   The controversy revolved around ballots marked with ticks
instead of numbers to indicate voter preference.
	   It is understood the returning officer deemed the votes valid.

	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said a nation cannot
raise its head with dignity and honour if it does not know the
glorious history of its independence movement and liberation war.
	   ``This museum will remain as a symbol in the national history
and project the glorious history of our liberation struggle,'' she
said inaugurating the Bangabandhu Museum at Dhaka Cantonment
yesterday morning.
	   The museum was built to preserve the memories of the historic
Agartala conspiracy case. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 34
others accused in the case were arrested and confined to this
building during the Agartala trial case.
	   The trial of the case, State versus Bangabandhu and others or
the so-called Agartala conspiracy case, began on February 21 in
1968 at a special tribunal.
	   Later, in the face of mass movement, the then Ayub regime was
forced to release Bangabandhu Mujib.
	   The building touched with the memory of Sheikh Mujib has now
turned into a museum. It preserves the room where Bangabandhu was
detained. There is a library, lobby, photo gallery, reception room,
office room and document room.
	   The lobby of the museum was decorated with photographs on the
historic six-point movement, photographs of the accused in the
Agartala conspiracy case and paper cuttings of those eventful days.
A spectacular fountain was set up in front of the museum.
	   Speaking at the function, the Prime Minister recalled the
memories of the six-point movement, the days of Bangabandhu's
confinement in the building and historic events of independence
movement.
	   ``Our independence did not come in one day, a lot of sacrifices,
bloods, movements and memories are behind it,'' she said, adding
that the nation should know the sacrifices of its heroes.
	   Hasina said the glorious history had been suppressed for a long
time, the nation was not allowed to know the sagas of its heroes.
``We want to free the nation from the grip of distorted history and
taking steps in this regard.''
	   She recalled the sacrifices of the martyrs of the independence
movement, liberation war and the democratic movements of the
country.
	   The Prime Minister thanked the members of the armed forces for
preserving the building touched with memories of the Father of the
Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
	   An accused in the Agartala case, Col (retd) Shawkat Ali, MP and
Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Mustafizur Rahman spoke at the function.
	   Later, the Prime Minister unveiled a plaque opening the museum
for the public. She went round different rooms of the museum and
talked to members of the families of some accused in the case.

	   LEADERS of the Muslim community have expressed shock over what
is being politely termed ``the indiscriminate removal of
gravestones'' and the summary sacking of two grave diggers.
	   The Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong
Kong are being accused of ignoring evidence that moving the stones
has led to at least one burial plot at the Chai Wan cemetery being
re-used.
	   Although there is no law _ religious or otherwise _ against the
re-use of grave plots in Muslim cemeteries, there is no such
understanding in Hong Kong.
	   Matters came to a head on 24 December last year when at least
one grave was exhumed and two of the grave diggers who spoke out
against re-using the plot were sacked on ``trumped up charges''.
	   The accusations come from a former appointed member of the
Muslim Cemeteries Management Committee who claims the trustees have
refused repeated requests to meet and discuss the issue.
	   He is A Ramjahn who said this indiscriminate removal of the
gravestones, especially in older sections of the cemetery where
many graves have been flattened by years of rain and soil erosion,
means ``there is no way of tracing the graves''.
	   He pointed to places along the road leading from the Cape
Collinson Crematorium down to the Muslim Cemetery, where discarded
grave markers have been unceremoniously tossed on the hillside.
	   Repeated attempts to get the trustees to look into the matter of
the missing stone grave markers were met by silence, he said.
	   The Hong Kong Standard managed to speak to the Treasurer, Rubbya
Hassan, who said she was not the right person to comment when asked
if the two workers had been sacked unfairly.
	   She promised to pass the questions on to the secretary.
	   The secretary when called, refused to answer any questions. The
chairman was not available for comment.
	   On 24 December last year, parts of a human skeleton were
unearthed by diggers preparing a ``fresh'' grave at the Chai Wan
cemetery.
	   The grave was covered up and work began on the plot next to it.
	   When bones were found in the second grave, one of the grave
diggers, Amir Bahadur, refused to defile the grave and reported the
matter to an alternate trustee who went with him the next day to
the site.
	   A second grave digger, Aijaz Mohammed, who made a similar
discovery, was not as fortunate _ he was ordered to keep working.
Mr Mohammed complied, but was refused permission to see the
trustees when he tried later to tell them what had transpired.
	   Haji A R Karamdin, to whom Mr Bahadur had turned for help,
called in Mr Ramjahn and together they went to the Chai Wan
cemetery on 25 December and examined the bones found in the grave.
	   Removal of one of the wooden frames used in Muslim burials
revealed parts of a skull and a set of false teeth. The skull
appeared to have been crushed by the burial frame.
	   Further examination showed that the digging for the ``new
grave'' had exhumed half an old grave. Mr Ramjahn subsequently
submitted a report on the matter to the council.
	   Almost five months on, he has had no acknowledgment of his
report.
	   The only movement of any sort in the case has been the summary
dismissal of Mr Bahadur and Mr Mohammed on 31 March.
	   Their almost identical letters of dismissal list allegations of
misconduct dating back to December.
	   Neither was given the opportunity to appeal against the
allegations.
	   Two members of the Chinese Muslim community were visibly shaken
when told of the saga of the bones in the Chai Wan graves.
	   ``It is very shocking. It makes us all feel uncomfortable,''
said Haji Ebrahim Yang, secretary of the Chinese Muslim Cultural
and Fraternal Association.
	   Haji Kassim Ma, a member of the executive committee, called for
a review of how work at the cemeteries was carried out.

	   The publication ceremony of eminent poet Hasnat Abdul Hai's
travelogue Andalusia's publication ceremony was held in the LGRD
auditorium at Agargaon in a festive mood last evening. State
Minister for Information Prof. Abu Sayeed attended the programme as
chief guest and poet Shamsur Rahman and Prof. Anisuzzaman were
special guests. Prof. Zillur Rahman Siddique presided over the
function. Sayed Manjurul Islam read the keynote paper on Andalusia.
The book is based on the writer's interesting experience while on a
tour of Spain.
	   Earlier a still photograph exhibition on Cordova, Granada,
Andalusia and Seville of Spain taken by Hasnat Abdul Hai was
inaugurated by Poet Shamsur Rahman.
	   In his paper, Sayeed Manjurul Islam said that many travelogues
had been written by many writers but the travelogue which had been
written with the writer's farsightedness and imagination had not
only earned recognition as travelogue but had also won acclaim as a
great piece of literary work. He said that Rabindranath Tagore at
the age of 17 visited Europe and wrote a travelogue on Europe which
became a great piece of literary work. Russia'r Chiti of Tagore had
also become very popular. Sayeed Manjurul Islam said that the
reason was Rabindranath not only wrote a simple travelogue; he
tried to depict the art, culture, history, literature and every
possible thing about a nation through his book.
	   He said the same thing could be said about Hasnat Abdul Hai's
Andalusia where the writer had not only expressed his feelings
about the historic city of Spain but had also depicted the art,
culture, history and literature of Spain through his creative mind
and natural ability. He said the success of this book lies there.
	   Professor Abu Sayed said the writer had described his tour of
Spain in his book with his great imaginative and creative mind. The
minister added that the important point about this book was he had
beautifully depicted the history, art, culture and literature of
Spain.

Islamic women sidestep Turkish headscarf ban by wearing wigs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In the ongoing battle between the
religious and secular in Turkey, some women have found an ingenious
way to bypass the government's ban on headscarves: wearing a scarf,
but hiding it with a wig.
	   The government says headscarves have become a political gesture,
a symbol of too-fervent Islam that threatens Turkey's secular
system. It has cracked down on the practice, calling for stricter
enforcement of the scarf ban in schools and public offices.
	   To sidestep the law, some women have turned to wigs, boosting
the business of people like Emel Ozkaynak, of the Princess Wig
House in Ankara. ``It is very profitable,'' he said. ``I hope it
lasts a long time.''
	   Under Turkish law, women can be fined up a fourth of the
salaries for wearing scarves in public offices and schools.
	   Men would face even stiffer punishment under a measureparliament
is expected to approve shortly. It provides for prison terms for up
to a year for laymen wearing Islamic headgear in public.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai stock prices hit an 11-year low
Monday as investors dumped the stock of the country's biggest
finance company after it decided to sell half of its securities
subsidiary.
	   The Thai baht also tumbled Monday, ending the trading day at 44
to the U.S. dollar, it's lowest level in 13 weeks. The baht has
dropped 40.3 percent against the dollar since it was floated last
July, triggering economic problems across the region.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand closed down 5.79 points to 312.37
on Monday. Dealers said the index hasn't seen such lows since 1987,
blaming the drop on regional currency woes and the move by Phatra
Thanakit PCL.
	   Phatra Thanakit announced last week that it would sell a 51
percent stake in a subsidiary, Phatra Securities Co., to Merrill
Lynch and Co.
	   Dealers said it could be the beginning of the end of Phatra's
listing on the exchange, since top Phatra executives said they were
considering merging the company's finance operations into those of
Thai Farmers Bank PCL, its biggest shareholder.
	   Currency traders attributed the baht's fall to a regional
currency sell-off as the dollar rose above 140 Japanese yen for the
first time since June 1991.
	   The weakness of the Japanese currency, dealers said, spells
trouble for crisis-hit Southeast Asian economies that have been
increasingly dependent on Japan as an export market.
	   Fears are rising that the Asian economic crisis could enter a
new, more devastating phase.

	   LOCAL film stars and directors dived into Hong Kong waters for
garbage on Sunday _ and came up almost empty-handed.
	   The celebrities were called in to help clean up Middle Bay beach
in time for today's World Oceans Day.
	   They donned deep-sea diving equipment but kept well within the
shark nets in the wake of a suspected shark sighting last month.
	   The aim was to scour the seabed for litter, but as action man
Tung Wai said: ``No lap-sap (garbage).'' The World Wide Fund for
Nature Hong Kong was behind the cleansing operation, and had agreed
with the Urban Services Department (USD) on which beach to clean
up.
	   Some campaigners and celebrities were surprised to find the
beach spotless, and wondered whether the USD had sent an advance
party of cleaners to the beach to make a pleasant environment for
the beautiful people.
	   A total of 35 pounds of rubbish was collected by 15 divers in a
half-hour's underwater action.
	   Most of the rubbish was in the form of rusty pipes and
soft-drink cans.
	   Actress Theresa Lee Yee-hung, WWFHK's ambassador for the past
three years, did not take part in the dive, and said she usually
avoided Hong Kong waters as they were too polluted.
	   She said: ``Hong Kong people are very unknowledgable about the
environment _ I want to help raise awareness.'' Director Michael
Hui Koon-man said: ``I came here 25 years ago with my girlfriend,
and we threw coins into the sea. Now I am helping take things out
of the water.'' Director Teddy Chan Tak-sum often dives with
friends, but not in Hong Kong waters.
	   Windsurfer-turned-actor Wong Hop Hei said: ``We want all Hong
Kong beaches to be clean.'' Middle Bay was recently downgraded from
a Grade 1 to a Grade 2 beach.

	   The Dairy Poultry and Fishery Federation of Bangladesh (DPFFB)
yesterday demanded an allocation of Tk 1,500 crore in the budget to
promote a ``white revolution'' in the country.
	   Addressing a press conference at the National Press Club,
Marshal Shah Alam, President of the DPFFB, said that improvement of
the country's dairy, poultry and fisheries sectors could not only
solve the unemployment problem but also provide the people of the
country with nutrition.
	   Demanding stoppage of the advertisement of all types of milk
powder on the state-owned radio and television, he said that
marketing of milk powder and its pasteurised liquid in polibags was
a great hazard to the health of children.
	   He observed that import of milk powder from member states of the
EC would destroy the live-stock sector of the country.
	   ``Though the fisheries sector became one of the major sources of
foreign exchange, there were no direction for this sector in the
national budget'', Shah Alam said adding that fish worth Tk 70,000
crore were misused in the last 11 years due to the lack of a
national policy.
	   Harun-or-Rashid, Abdur Rouf, Khayer Chowdhury and Ziaul Haq
Bulbul, leaders of Live-stock, Poultry and Fishery Firm Owners
Associations of Gajipur, Nandail, Brahmanbaria and Gaibandha
respectively were present at the press conference.

	   The National Road Safety Strategic Action Plan aimed at curbing
road accidents and fatalities was launched by Communications
Minister Anwar Hossain in the city yesterday.
	   Organised by Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) in
association with the Department for International Development of
the United Kingdom and the IDC project, the launching ceremony was
chaired by Syed Rezaul Hayat, Secretary of the Roads and Railway
Division.
	   The inaugural ceremony was addressed by AN Hossain, Chairman of
BRTA, National Professor Dr. MR Khan of ICDDRB and Roger
Weatherell,
	   IDC Team Leader.
	   Over 3,000 persons were killed in road accidents in the country
last year. The number of the people killed in road accidents was
only 1,156 a decade ago in 1987.
	   The Action Plan is the result of extensive reviews of road
safety issues and inputs from overseas safety specialists. It has
components for improving the roads and vehicles.
	   Until recently in Bangladesh, road safety was addressed only
through temporary measures occasionally taken after major road
accidents. As a result, previous road safety initiatives suffered
from a lack of co-ordination and continuity.
	   The National Road Safety Council (NRSC) was constituted in July
1995 and assigned the responsibility of preparing and implementing
a national plan on road safety. The NRSC, chaired by the Minister
for Communications, consists of representatives from the government
and professionals from other organisations.
	   Speaking on the occasion, the Communications Minister, called
upon the people to cooperate with the government in making road
communication safe and accident free.
	   The minister said the growth in our road network is proceeding
at a breathtaking rate providing more jobs and greater and faster
mobility for all. In this regard, he mentioned that the opening of
the Bangabandhu Bridge on June 23 would be a big step toward
integrating the country divided by the river Jamuna. The Minister
stressed on the need for a co-ordinated approach to tackle the road
safety problem.
	   AN Hossain, Member-secretary of the NRSC said road safety
committees have been formed in the metropolitan cities and
districts with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner and the
District Commissioner as the convener of the committees
respectively. These committees are already working in accordance
with the action plan, he added.
	   Later, a day-long workshop on the Action Plan was held. It was
participated by some 75 representatives from government and private
agencies involved in the road safety strategic plan.

	   SOME parents are still ignorant about certain education policies
such as the nine-year compulsory education and the prohibition of
corporal punishment, a survey has shown.
	   Of a total of 1,763 parents polled by the Education Policy
Concern Organisation (Epco), 42 were unaware of the fact that
children had to complete at least nine years of basic education
under Hong Kong laws, with another 23 saying they were uncertain
about it.
	   As many as 301 of them still believed school heads could inflict
corporal punishment on students, and another 130 were not sure
about that policy.
	   Also, 134 were mistaken that all secondary schools would have to
use Chinese as the medium of instruction from September, with a
further 315 unable to answer ``yes'' or ``no'' to the question.
	   Up to 45 per cent were either unaware or unsure that schools are
answerable on education quality.
	   About 29 per cent did not know of any channels to express their
opinions about education.
	   The interviewed parents are from seven secondary schools, seven
primary schools and three kindergartens.

	   The nation yesterday observed the historic June 7 commemorating
the blood-strained struggle for realisation of the historic
six-point demand, that inspired the whole nation to fight for
self-rule.
	   The movement of the 6-point demand led by Bangabandhu Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman culminated into a mass upsurge in 1969, that
eventually led the nation to launch the heroic War of Liberation
from Pakistan in 1971.
	   The day's programme began with the laying of wreaths by the
portrait of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman, at the ``Bangabandhu Smriti Jadughar'', by hundreds of
leaders and workers of Awami League and its front organisations.
	   Prime Minister and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina placed a
wreath by Bangabandhu's portrait early in the morning.
	   On this day in 1969, industrial workers Monu Mia, Shafiq and
Shamsul Huq were killed by the Pakistani police during a
nation-wide hartal, called by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to
press for realisation of the six-point demand.
	   By observing the nation-wide hartal, the Bengalees of the then
East Pakistan demonstrated their total support to the six-point
demand.
	   The day was observed amid various programmes by Awami League,
Chhatra League and Sramik League. Awami League and its front
organisations hoisted national and party flags atop ``Bangabandhu
Bhaban'' and their party offices across the country. Prayers were
also held for the peace of the martyrs of June 7.
	   The main programme of the day was a public meeting at Paltan
maidan where Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina spoke as the chief guest.
	   Bangladesh Betar and Bangladesh Television presented special
programmes commemorating the day, while major national newspapers
published special articles highlighting the significance of the
historic June 7.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A leading human rights activist who barely
survived an assassination attempt last month went home from the
hospital Monday.
	   Akin Birdal, 50, underwent two operations after being shot six
times on May 12. Doctors said it will take him from six weeks to
three months to fully recover.
	   Two men have confessed to shooting Birdal and were identified by
him. Police also arrested the alleged mastermind.
	   Birdal has won international respect for his opposition to
torture and the forced evacuation of Kurdish villages in
southeastern Turkey by the military in its war against Kurdish
guerrillas.
	   From his hospital bed, Birdal had vowed to continue his work.
``The assault has strengthened my belief in the values that we have
to fight for,'' he said.

India says U.N. resolution on nuclear, missile programs
</HEADLINE>
unacceptable

 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
mantained his refusal to shut down India's nuclear weapons program
despite pressure from the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``The call made in the resolution that we should stop our
nuclear programs or missile programs is unacceptable ...,''
Vajpayee said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press.
	   Vajpayee made a similar statement in India's upper house of
Parliament earlier Monday, two days after the 15-member Security
Council passed a resolution asking longtime rivals India and
Pakistan to resume talks to solve their disputes, especially over
the Himalayan territory of Kashmir
	   The two countries escalated their arms race with a series of
tit-for-tat nuclear tests last month.
	   The Indian government on Saturday released a statement calling
the Security Council resolution ``coercive and unhelpful.''
Vajpayee has said in the past that India went nuclear because of
its fears of being surrounded by the nuclear weapons of neighbors
China and Pakistan.
	   Vajpayee also reiterated his oft-repeated statement since his
country's recent nuclear tests that India will not let any other
nation mediate in the Kashmir dispute.
	   India has consistently resisted international pressure on
Kashmir, while Pakistan welcomes intervention because it feels at a
disadvantage in one-on-one talks with its much larger and more
powerful neighbor.
	   India has been seeking talks with Pakistan since January, but
Islamabad has not replied, Vajpayee told Parliament.
	   The Security Council also called on India and Pakistan to sign
the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and a test ban accord.
	   India has repeatedly refused to sign the treaties because they
do not require the five traditional nuclear powers _ Britain,
China, France, Russia and the United States _ to give up their
nuclear arsenals. Pakistan says it will sign the treaty only if
India does so.
	   In India's financial hub of Bombay on Monday, Japanese
Ambassador Hiroshi Hirabayashi told Indian and Japanese businessmen
that the economic sanctions Tokyo imposed to punish India for its
nuclear tests would affect only new government proposals, not
ongoing development aid or loans and humanitarian aid.
	   He urged the Japanese private sector ``to continue business with
India as usual .... The Japanese government had no intention to
restrict trade with India.''
	   Japan is India's biggest aid donor third largest trading
partner.
	   ``We hope that with dialogue between India and Pakistan in the
not so distant future we can put this issue (nuclear testing)
behind us,'' Hirabayashi said. ``The international community will
lend a helping hand if asked by both countries.''
	   The United States, Australia and other countries also imposed
sanctions, the effect of which is yet unclear.
	   In its response to the Security Council, Pakistan said Sunday
that it cannot be compelled to sign the nuclear arms control
treaties. It also expressed disappointment that the council's
resolution did not offer concrete steps toward resolving the
Kashmir dispute.
	   Two of the three wars India and Pakistan have fought in the last
50 years were over Kashmir, a former kingdom that had a Muslim
majority and a Hindu ruler. Officially Islamic Pakistan holds
one-third of Kashmir, and India's two-thirds is the only
Muslim-majority state in the predominantly Hindu country.

Rail officials try to restore confidence after deadliest postwar
</HEADLINE>
crash &QL; 
 &UR; By COLLEEN BARRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Still unsure how a wheel on one of its
premier high-speed trains could have broken, the German railway on
Monday intensified safety checks and assurances it would spare no
costs to restore confidence in rail travel.
	   Workers laid new tracks in the northern village of Eschede, the
scene of Germany's worst postwar rail disaster, in hopes of
reopening the Hanover-Hamburg line by midweek. Rescue workers
continued sifting through loose dirt five days after the crash in
search of personal effects and human remains.
	   Officials lowered the death toll on Sunday after a new analysis
of remains so badly damaged in Wednesday's wreck of InterCity
Express 884 that forensic experts say DNA analysis will be
necessary to make some identifications.
	   They now believe 93 people died at the scene; 73 victims have
been identified. Five died in hospitals.
	   German rail director Johannes Ludewig said that inspectors
checking wheels on the 59 original high-speed trains have found no
defects so far. By Monday, 400 of the 700 wheels had passed
inspections.
	   Officials doubled the number of ultrasound machines and
inspectors on Monday to restore full service at the normal top
speed of 280 kilometers (175 miles) as soon as possible.
	   ``You win trust only with safety,'' said Ludewig. He and
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann are considering new safety
features, such as a wheel alarm system. They have not ruled out
redesigning the trains.
	   But Ludewig conceded that the railway still had a long way to go
to resume its place as one of the most trusted German institutions.
The high-speed rail has been a source of national pride since its
introduction in 1991.
	   ``Of course, our image was damaged by the catastrophe. Only
complete openness will reverse that,'' Ludewig said.
	   It remains unclear whether the train's wheel broke due to a
defect, or an outside force.
	   Investigators know that somehow the steel rim encircling the
wheel broke off and was propelled into the wheel carriage. They
theorized that the train derailed when it hit a rail switch about
300 meters (985 feet) from an overpass. Traveling at a speed of 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour, the train struck the overpass,
bringing down 200-300 tons of concrete, steel and roadway onto the
jackknifing cars.
	   German President Roman Herzog will lead a memorial service for
the victims and their families on June 21 in Celle, the main town
outside of Eschede. Officials delayed the service, originally
scheduled for Friday, due to the slow job of recovering and
identifying the dead.

	   THE stereotyping of the cruel stepfather was even stronger in
Chinese families than in the West, a leading welfare expert said on
Sunday.
	   Thomas Mulvey, director of the Hong Kong Family Welfare Society,
said children could be torn apart by their natural father's family
if their mother remarried.
	   ``The father's family can create problems and portray the
stepfather as a cruel figure. The problem for children can be even
more intense in Chinese societies which emphasise more
relationships along the father's line than those in the West.'' Mr
Mulvey said even if the natural father did not feel any hostility
towards the new stepfather, his own family might still try to turn
the children against him.
	   He said his group also came across cases of children feeling
very hostile to stepmothers and had completely rejected them.
	   ``But this problem is found as often in Western families as
Chinese.'' Mr Mulvey said the Hong Kong Family Welfare Society had
launched a new divorce mediation service as figures showed the
number of divorce cases had increased from 537 in 1974 to 10,492 by
the end of October last year.
	   And new research shows that stepfathers can get the ``baby
blues'' too. They were especially at risk if their wives or
partners are depressed, it was revealed yesterday.
	   A study of British men found that stepfathers were particularly
at risk of such depression.
	   Mr Mulvey said he had come across cases of husbands developing
physical symptoms like appendicitis before their wives gave birth,
but he had not come across any such cases involving stepfathers.
	   Researchers wrote in the American Journal of Psychiatry: ``Men
in step-families may be at greater risk for depression than those
in traditional families, and this risk is closely linked to their
partners' depressive symptoms.'' Kirby Deater-Deckard and
colleagues at the University of Bristol surveyed more than 7,000
men before and after their wives or partners had babies.
	   Post-natal depression is a well-known phenomenon, affecting 13
per cent of all new mothers in a variety of different countries and
cultures.

	   The Coordination Committee on civic services has not only failed
to improve the civic amenity situation in Dhaka city, but has
failed to coordinate within itself as well, according to City
Corporation sources.
	   The committee was formed immediately after the present
government assumed power in June 1996 with the LGRD Minister Zillur
Rahman as Chairman and Dhaka City Mayor Mohammad Hanif as
Co-chairman. The chief executive officer of the City Corporation
was made member secretary of the committee.
	   Seventeen agencies, engaged in providing civic services,
including the electric supply authority, Water and Sewerage
Authority, RAJUK, Public Works Department, T&AMP;T, Titas gas
authority, Public Health Department, Social Welfare Department,
Roads and Highways Department, Environment Department, transport
authorities, civil surgeon district administration and the
metropolitan police were involved in the city co-ordination
committee.
	   It had been planned that co-ordination meetings would be held
every month. However, only 10 meetings were held with the first
meeting on November 15, 1996 and the last one on May 27, 1998.
	   The city mayor who had promoted the idea of a metropolitan
government with authority on various service providers in the city
was, however, discouraged with the formation of a co-ordination
committee, said an executive of the corporation.
	   The outcome of the meetings was nothing promising, said a
participant referring to the proceedings recorded by the member
secretary. A clear lack of co-ordination surfaced since the same
observation was made in a series of meetings on the same problem.
	   The sources referred to the problems like water logging, sewage
overflows, garbage cleaning and removal of construction materials
from the roads to show that the problem remained the same as
before. The minutes of the ninth meeting mentions that `` same
instructions were delivered in the past meetings''.
	   Similarly, the proceedings of the consecutive meetings recorded
``should be done'' ``will be made available'', ``will convey the
instructions'', ``made recommendation'' and such similar
expressions as made by different agencies in response to the city
problems.
	   No meeting could record appreciation for any job done to
mitigate the sufferings of the city dwellers, an official of the
LGRD ministry said in despair.
	   The meetings were becoming simply rituals, the sources added, as
many of the agencies were sending substitutes for their chief
executives to attend them. As a result, no concrete decision could
be taken in any of the cases needing attention.

Rock star apologizes over night out with Gascoigne
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rock star Rod Stewart publicly apologized Monday
for taking part in a late-night drinking session with Paul
Gascoigne, an incident which may have contributed to the player's
axing from the England World Cup squad.
	   Stewart and Gascoigne were photographed leaving a trendy London
nightclub May 14 on one of Gascoigne's nights out before he was
dropped by England coach Glenn Hoddle.
	   Stewart, an ardent Scotland fan, issued the apology through the
Sun newspaper.
	   ``Had I known the outcome I would have said, `No drinking for
you tonight Paul.' But try telling Paul Gacoigne he can't have a
drink.''
	   Stewart said he admired but hardly knew Gascoigne and their
meeting at the nightclub, when Gascoigne joined his table and
discussed the World Cup, was only their second meeting in 11 years.
He said they spent two hours together.
	   ``I did, as reported, help Paul to the toilet as he was a little
wobbly on his feet,'' he said.
	   Stewart said he had given Gascoigne a lift home, and then gone
straight home.
	   ``In hindsight, if I could turn back the hands of time, I wish
there had been another way out of the restaurant but there wasn't
without the photographers following us and having a field day,'' he
said.
	   ``I apologize to Glenn and the team and wish them well in the
World Cup. This is a man I admire but hardly know and I'm
absolutely devastated for him _ don't write him off just yet.''

	   Visiting Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar
yesterday backed the peace accord on Chittagong Hill Tracts,
calling it ``a great and tremendous achievement of Sheikh Hasina.''
	   ``What Sheikh Hasina has done in Bangladesh won a great
admiration,'' he said addressing a workers' rally of ruling Awami
League at the historic Paltan Maidan, the same site from where
opposition BNP will begin its long march towards CHT on Tuesday.
	   The Lankan minister said she (Hasina) had succeeded when so many
failed in bringing peace in the region.
	   ``My sincere hope the peace that she has brought will continue
and be maintained,'' he said before concluding his speech saying
``Joy Bangla.''
	   About the two decades of insurgency in CHT, Kadirgamar said, we
in Sri Lanka have also the same problem...one group of people in my
country wants to secede for 25 years and that has caused a great
deal of bloodshed.
	   In this regard, he said, ``our President whose father and
husband have been assassinated is trying to negotiate the problem.
	   ``Everything should be negotiated in talks and discussion.''
	   The Lankan Foreign Minister termed Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman, who was brutally killed, a great leader not only of
Bangladesh, but also of South Asia.
	   ``I am glad that his surviving daughter is now the Prime
Minister of your country,'' he said.

Town promoting reconciliation receives U.S. aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARDA, Croatia (AP) _ The United States gave dlrs 13.7 million
Monday to the eastern-most town of Darda, rewarding city fathers
for promoting reconciliation in this war-torn region.
	   The money will be used to rebuild homes and infrastructure, and
revive the local economy.
	   Darda, in the region known as eastern Slavonia, was the first
Croatian town to receive such financial support.
	   ``We chose Darda as it does need reconstruction and has shown a
real desire for reconciliation,'' said U.S. Ambassador William
Montgomery.
	   Last month, a group of foreign diplomats pledged to aid towns
across Croatia that cooperated in efforts to allow the return of
refugees and the development of multiculturalism.
	   Serbs and Croats fought a bloody war in 1991, when local Serbs
rebelled against the country's independence from former Yugoslavia.
Thousands of Croats and Serbs were killed or left homeless, and
tensions and hatreds persist in many communities.
	   Darda, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) east of the capital,
Zagreb, was badly damaged during the conflict. But unlike other
municipalities, it has set up a successful multi-ethnic leadership.
	   Before the war, Darda's population was more than 6,000. A slight
majority were Croat.
	   Now the population is predominantly Serb, but the government
already has rebuilt more than 100 homes for Croats.

	   POLICE have smashed 16 illegal bookmaking syndicates which
accepted horse racing bets with a turnover of $80 million per
racing day.
	   Nineteen people _ 14 men and five women aged between 17 and 52 _
were arrested in a territory-wide operation over the weekend.
	   A large quantity of banking and betting records and more than
$140,000 in cash was seized.
	   Two of the syndicates were operating in Hong Kong, while the
remaining 14 were accepting bets in Macau and coastal cities in
Guangdong on Hong Kong races.
	   The police investigation was launched at the start of the racing
season in September last year.
	   One of the syndicates was also involved in betting on football
matches.
	   Organised Crime and Triad Bureau Superintendent Steve Tarrant
warned punters intending to bet on the coming World Cup that they
might be charged even if they were placing their stakes on a legal
overseas bookmaker.
	   ``If the betting in other jurisdiction is legal, there is still
a possibility that you can be involved in money laundering by
settling the bet in Hong Kong,'' he said.
	   Supt Tarrant said further advice had been sought from the
Department of Justice for clear guidelines, because the relevant
ordinance was very complicated.
	   Under the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance, bookmakers
based in Hong Kong who accept bets from outside Hong Kong were
guilty of money laundering.
	   The syndicates were believed to be controlled by triads.
	   ``Most of them had operated for more than a year, while the
longest had been in business for seven years,'' said OCTB Chief
Inspector Lam Man-wing.
	   They were making about 10 to 15 per cent of the turnover as
profit, Supt Tarrant said.
	   The largest single bet found was about $1 million.
	   Those arrested have been released on bail ranging from $10,000
to $50,000. The maximum penalty upon conviction is 14 years'
imprisonment and $5 million fine.

	   About 2000 resident students of different halls of the Rajshahi
University took out a procession on the campus at about 10-30 last
night demanding uninterrupted supply of electricity.
	   The students came out en masse from their respective halls and
assembled in front of the official residence of the Vice-Chancellor
of the university. They chanted slogans demanding power supply.
	   The power supply on the campus remained disrupted from the
evening till midnight yesterday.
	   The angry students held a meeting in front of the main gate of
the VC's residence. The meeting was addressed, among others, by
Nahid, Kamal and Sabur. The speakers at the meeting alleged that
the power supply on the RU campus remained disrupted for about 10
hours within a span of 24 hours.
	   Moreover, the ``loadshedding till midnight'' has become a common
phenomenon, they further alleged.
	   The power supply situation in Rajshahi city further worsened
during the last 24 hours. The PDB sources said, there were only 7-8
megawatts of power available against the total requirement of 40
megawatts in the city. The city residents, particularly, the
examinees, the children and elderly people were the worst
sufferers.
	   Last night, the power supply in most areas remained disrupted
for about 6-7 hours. The situation became normal around 3-00 am.
The Registrar of the Rajshahi University has appealed to the Chief
Engineer of the Power Development Board of Rajshahi to take
immediate steps to restore normalcy in power supply on the campus.
	   According to the official letter of the Registrar, severe
loadshedding had made the lives of thousands of teachers, students
and employees on the campus miserable. Studies of the students have
been greatly hampered, it added.
	   The students even gheraoed the residence of the Vice-Chancellor
demanding supply of electricity. The letter expressed grave concern
over the deteriorating law and order situation on the campus due to
continued loadshedding.
	   The students may turn more violent if the power supply situation
was not improved before the beginning of the World Cup Football,
the letter said.

	   Trains will run on the broad gauge rail track from Rajshahi and
Parbatipur to the eastern side of the Bangabandhu (Jamuna) Bridge
from the opening day of the bridge on June 23. However rail
connection between Joydevpur and Bhuapur will commence after at
least one year.
	   The construction of the railway station on the eastern side of
the bridge is about to be completed.
	   This was disclosed by Engineer Muhammad Shamsur Rahman, General
Manager, Jamuna Bridge Railway Link Project of the Ministry of
Communications, while briefing a group of journalists who visited
the bridge site yesterday. Railway Project Director Engineer
Iqbaluddin Choudhury also spoke.
	   Engineer Rahman said a special train would run from Jamtoli
(Bangabandhu Bridge west) station to the Bangabandhu Bridge east
station on the broad gauge. The train will consist of some saloon
cars and some passenger coaches. Later two to three trains would
run every day from Parbatipur and Rajshahi. The trains would
terminate at the Bangabandhu East station.
	   He told newsmen that Bangladesh Railway (BR) has procured 3,000
metric tonnes of rail from China for the first phase of the project
which would be completed by June 20. He said the BR had also
procured 27000 wooden sleepers for the first phase. He said about
27,500 metric tonnes of rail would be required for the entire
project.
	   Engineer Rahman said under the Bangabandhu (Jamuna) Bridge
Railway Link Project, 94 kilometre (excluding 5 kilometre Jamuna
Bridge)-long new dual gauge railway line was being constructed from
Joydevpur to Jamtoli in Sirajganj district. He said the work
started on December 8 last year on the west side of the Jamuna
Bridge and it would be completed by June 20.
	   He said the project was scheduled to be completed by May 2001.
He said the construction of culverts and bridges, nine station
buildings and embankments etc would be done at a cost of Tk 514.96
crore (US dollars 117.71 million) under the project.
	   Engineer Rahman said the existing 245 km broad gauge track from
Jamtoli to Parbatipur via Ishwardi would be converted into dual
gauge at a cost of Tk 235 crore (US dollars 50 million). This would
be completed by October this year.
	   He said the dual gauge rail line would be installed from
Joydevpur to Dhaka under a Tk 60 crore project. Tongi to Bhairab
Bazar double line project would be implemented with German aid. He
said the Bangladesh Railway had plans to extend the broad gauge
rail line to Chittagong port.
	   He said the total estimated cost of the railway link project was
Tk 1155.40 crore (US dollars 268.70 million). Of the total amount,
Tk 473 crore was being provided by the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), Tk 504.39 crore by the government of Bangladesh (GOB), Tk
34.40 crore by France, Tk 49.00 crore by Spain, Tk 30.10 crore by
the Export Development Corporation (EDC) of Canada and Tk 64.50
crore by OPEC.

	   AN academic has warned of the possible erosion of press freedom
because of the recent trend of businessmen with interests in the
mainland buying into the local media.
	   In a paper to be read at Oxford University this weekend, Richard
Cullen, visiting fellow at the City University's faculty of law,
says the Hong Kong press remains one of the freest and most
informative in East Asia even almost a year after the handover.
	   In his paper entitled ``Law, Politics and Freedom of the Press
in Hong Kong'', Mr Cullen says local media ownership has been
passing more and more not to specialist media operators but to
people with a general business background involving business with
the mainland.
	   ``There are now signs that mainland interests are buying into
the Hong Kong media with some vigour,'' he writes.
	   ``The fact that Hong Kong media outlets are increasingly falling
into business hands with close links to (or homes in) the mainland
does not automatically spell erosion of freedom of the press, but
it does indicate an increased potential for such erosion.'' Mr
Cullen will deliver the paper at a conference on the independence
of Hong Kong's judiciary at Oxford University this weekend.
	   Solicitor-General Daniel Fung Wah-kin will be the keynote
speaker at the conference, which will also be attended by judges
and members of the legal profession.
	   Mr Cullen co-authored a book entitled Media Law in the PRC with
Fu Hua-ling, a research fellow at University of Hong Kong's faculty
of law.
	   The approval of the change in the ownership of Asia Television
(ATV) by businessmen with mainland links almost two weeks ago was
cited as an example.
	   A consortium led by Phoenix chairman Liu Changle, who is a
former People's Liberation Army officer, bought 46 per cent of the
shares owned by former ATV chairman Lim Por-yen.
	   Although the future chief executive Wu Ching promised to
maintain the station's editorial independence, various sectors have
voiced their concern.
	   Mr Cullen says in his paper that there is nothing wrong if
businessmen bought stakes in local media as part of their empire.
	   But he warns that such a set up could lead to a conflict of
interest in future.
	   Although Mr Cullen has noted some incidents of self-censorship
in the media in recent years, he also maintains that the Hong Kong
press is still among the freest in the region.
	   There are about 20 dailies for Hong Kong's 6.3 million people
while there are only two or three dailies in most Western cities of
comparable size.

Jewish settlers take over homes in Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers took over two buildings in an
Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem before dawn Monday, stringing barbed
wire and setting off angry stone-throwing clashes with Arab
neighbors.
	   It was the latest in a series of escalating confrontations in
Jerusalem's eastern sector as both sides accuse the other of trying
to grab land in the bitterly contested city.
	   At least two people were injured in Monday's clashes, including
the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini. He was
hit in the head with a stone and slightly hurt before police and
soldiers broke up the melee.
	   Adding to the volatile mix, about 20 activists from the Peace
Now group arrived at the site in the Silwan neighborhood to protest
the settlers' arrival. Police dragged them away after they refused
to disperse.
	   The 15 settlers were from the Elad group, which claims it
purchased the homes legally. Israel radio said, though, that the
ownership is in contention.
	   ``We decided tonight to fulfill our ownership of these
buildings,'' said Yehuda Mali, one of the settlers who moved in
overnight. He said his group bought the property almost 10 years
ago.
	   In one skirmish, settlers kicked Arabs who tried to block them
from entering one of the buildings.
	   ``I will surrender my life before I surrender my house!''
shouted Fatima Karaeen, 62, who said she has papers showing one of
the houses belongs to her Arab family. ``The cowards!''
	   The makeup of Jerusalem's neighborhoods is an explosive issue,
with Palestinians trying to block what they say are illegal
encroachments by Jewish settlers. Both sides are constantly
jockeying for position, pending negotiations on the city's final
status.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
1967, as capital of a future state. Israel insists the city must
remain undivided under Israeli sovereignty.
	   Husseini, the Palestinian official, has called for mass street
protests to block Jewish settlers, who have been stepping up
activity in recent weeks. Last month, clashes broke out after the
settler group Ataret Cohanim set up sheds near the Old City's
Herod's Gate.
	   Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert told army radio the settler move to
Silwan was legal.
	   ``I don't wake up in the morning and ask myself what will please
the Palestinians,'' he said. ``People can buy wherever they want.''

	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has urged all concerned, including
the lawyers, the judges and the police to be more careful so that
the identified terrorists, following their arrest, are not freed on
bail.
	   The Prime Minister made the appeal yesterday while addressing a
public meeting at the Paltan Maidan. She pointed out that the
arrested terrorists were coming out of the jail on bail.
	   The Prime Minister said that the terrorists, after getting
release from jail on bail, were again resorting to terrorism with
renewed zeal. ``The people of the country cannot more live with
such an unacceptable situation,'' she said.
	   The people concerned should perform their duties in the interest
of common people,'' Sheikh Hasina said.

Blatter elected FIFA president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Johansson, Platini quotes; ADDS new grafs
9-13 on candidates' positions on host for 2006 World Cup. &QL; 
 &UR; By SLOBODAN LEKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sepp Blatter, a late candidate who waged a
globe-trotting campaign, was elected Monday as president of FIFA,
the first change at the top of soccer's world body in almost a
quarter century.
	   In balloting two days before the start of the World Cup, Blatter
defeated Lennart Johansson when the Swedish president of UEFA
conceded after the first round.
	   ``The game is over,'' Johansson said. ``I wish Mr. Blatter
luck.''
	   The comments ended a brief but nasty campaign filled with
mudslinging and heavy spending, and Blatter sought quickly to make
sure the fighting ended.
	   ``There may have been a few fouls, but we never tackled from
behind,'' the Swiss said. ``Now we need to think of what is fair.''
	   Neither man received the two-thirds vote needed for a
first-ballot victory, but Blatter piled up a clear majority,
111-80, and Johansson would have needed a massive defection in the
second round, when a simple majority would have won.
	   Joao Havelange, the Brazilian industrialist who has been FIFA's
president since 1974, backed Blatter's candidacy and openly
applauded his deputy's pre-vote speech. Having been engaged in a
long feud with Johansson, he appeared to avoid acknowledging the
Swede's.
	   Johansson and Blatter, general secretary of FIFA, accused each
other of being puppets for other interests, and spent more than
dlrs 1 million combined on very public campaigns that usually are
waged quietly and privately.
	   After Johansson's concession, Blatter and Havelange appeared
before the FIFA Congress. Havelange called Johansson ``a
gentleman,'' although the defeated challenger was clearly bitter
after the vote.
	   ``The result is there, consequently he is the winner and we will
have to cooperate for the good of the game,'' Johansson said. ``But
we're not dropping our program. I'm loyal to the president but I'm
not going to obey everything he says.''
	   Blatter appeared to hold onto his voting blocs in Asia and the
Americas, and cut deeply into Johansson's strongholds of Europe and
Africa.
	   Both contenders had similar platforms stressing a more open and
member-oriented FIFA. But Blatter appeared to make inroads with
proposals such as all but promising that the 2006 World Cup would
be held in Africa if he were elected president.
	   Johansson may have hurt himself with his open support of Germany
for the 2006 World Cup, angering the English who also are bidding
for the tournament.
	   Blatter, who formally joined the race just 2 1-2 months ago, and
Johansson, the sole candidate for more than a year before that,
both had said in recent days that they were confident of victory.
	   Each had surrounded himself with soccer stars of the past, with
Pele supporting Johansson and Michel Platini backing Blatter. Each
of the endorsements was in keeping with the personal nature of the
campaign _ Pele has had a long-running feud with Havelange, his
Brazilian countryman, while Platini is co-chairman of the French
World Cup and has been reluctant to share any stage with Johansson.
	   ``I supported the man who I believe will change the face of
football in the future,'' Platini said.
	   Blatter has said he wanted to make the job, a traditionally
part-time and unpaid post, a full-time, well-paid position.
	   It already is one of the two most powerful positions in
international sports, perhaps even more so than the presidency of
the International Olympic Committee.
	   It carries the flag of soccer, the game that elicits passion and
attracts sponsor dollars like no other. That attraction has led
critics to question how the FIFA presidency might have added to
Havelange's personal wealth; a recent article in the German
newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau said the outgoing president rang up
dlrs 2.7 million in travel, hotel and other expenses in the past
four years, about 4 percent of FIFA's budget.
	   Questions about corruption and growing criticism of Havelange's
dictatorial style were considered the main reasons the Brazilian
decided not to seek another four-year term.
	   Name-calling and personal attacks have been prominent in this
campaign. Johansson has accused Blatter of stealing his platform
and acting as a straw man for Havelange; Blatter, in turn, has said
that Johansson was a puppet of the German soccer federation and
Antonio Matarese, the powerful head of the Italian federation who
probably would take over at UEFA if the Swede is elected FIFA
president.
	   And not only has the campaign been nasty, it's been expensive.
Blatter said he has spent dlrs 300,000, and estimates put
Johansson's campaign costs at up to dlrs 800,000, much of it
financed by UEFA.
	   Havelange, who openly supported Blatter, his key aide for almost
18 years, said he was not dismayed at the conflicts that have
arisen.
	   ``I have said before that FIFA is not a dictatorship, and to
have an election you need two candidates. I wish we had four or
five,'' he said. ``To have free competition is very good for
football. I would hope that my successor would carry on our good
results.''
	   The new president won't have to worry about money. Havelange
said FIFA had a cash reserve of dlrs 4 million, with dlrs 800
million in sponsorships and uncounted millions more in TV rights
fees.
	   ``Enough to stage two World Cups,'' Havelange said.

	   COMMERCIAL rather than political reasons have motivated
businessmen with mainland links to penetrate the local media, an
academic said.
	   Professor Lau Siu-kai, head of the Chinese University's
Department of Sociology, said the community should not be alarmed
over the recent trend towards changes in media ownership.
	   ``I think it is purely a commercial decision,'' he said.
	   ``These businessmen with mainland links buy shares in local
media because they want to eventually enter the huge mainland
market.'' Prof Lau said businessmen with mainland links may have
greater success in penetrating the mainland market.
	   ``A number of local media have tried to enter the mainland
market but none of them has been successful,'' he said. ``I won't
be surprised if more businessmen with mainland links buy into local
media, especially if they want to tap the mainland market.'' Prof
Lau does not believe the trend will lead to the erosion of press
freedom.
	   ``Businessmen are more concerned about making profits and they
cannot afford to lose their readers and viewers because they have
censored a story.'' Hong Kong Journalists Association chairwoman
Carol Lai Pui-yee agreed that businessmen had been investing in the
local media for commercial reasons.
	   But she said journalists were concerned that editorial
independence could be undermined should businessmen with mainland
links dominate the local media.

	   By Marcel Bonneff
	   Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia in cooperation with Forum Jakarta-
	   Paris, Jakarta 1998

	   JAKARTA (JP): Comics can be claimed as the most widely consumed
form of reading. Think about it -- have you ever met a literate
person who has never read a comic strip? Some newspapers print them
daily, and they are hard to miss.
	   Ironically, as far as reading goes, comics in Indonesia are
usually dismissed as having the lowest quality among reading
materials.
	   Parents would not usually agree to their children reading comic
books, which they consider ``not educational''.
	   Children would devour comics as the ``forbidden fruit'' and
would take pains of hiding the fact from their parents by all means
possible, including replacing the cover with a more ``educational''
title, such as that of a history book.
	   Yet, what is taken for granted here is viewed quite seriously in
several other countries, including France.
	   It even warrants its own research; Marcel Bonneff's study of
comics brings us the book Komik Indonesia (Indonesian Comics).
	   From the original French, it is based on research carried out by
Bonneff for his thesis back in 1972. Two years later, the thesis
was published in Paris.
	   More than two decades later, it has been translated into
Indonesian by Rahayu S. Hidayat and published by Kepustakaan
Populer Gramedia.
	   Bonneff covers many areas. He describes the history, production
and distribution of Indonesian comics, and the grounds and messages
conveyed behind them. Examples from numerous comics fittingly
complement his description.
	   The history of comics here is surprisingly traced all the way to
the images on the Borobudur temple as a prehistoric comic. This may
come as a surprise to some. The history continues from the
prehistoric stone comics to another form of storytelling through
images, the wayang kulit (leather puppets). These, Bonneff writes,
are the ancestors of comics in Indonesia.
	   These primitive comics evolved and were later affected by mass
media influences, including those from the West and Orient.
	   Through this evolution, many genres of comics appeared, such as
silat (a form of martial art), adolescent romance, science fiction,
tales and legends, cowboys and detectives.
	   The first two can be considered the major genre, since these
seem to be the readers' favorite. Among the comics published
between April and July of 1971, Bonneff found 48.75 percent were
silat comics, 36.75 percent romance comics, and the other genres
only reached 6.40 percent at the highest.
	   These two genres are completely different from one another, yet
they complement each other. Silat comics triggers the imagination.
They invite the readers to break all limits and barriers, and be
free.
	   On the other hand, adolescent romance comics are down to earth.
They portray problems of everyday life (mainly in terms of
relationships). To avoid these problems and to live safely and
peacefully, certain limitations are set (don't drink or do drugs;
don't have sex before marriage). Between these two, the readers may
choose whether they want to explore their imaginations or keep
their feet solidly on the ground.
	   Bonneff points out that comics are rich resources in the study
of the society during a certain period. For example, from the
language point of view, we can return to the jargon of the day.
	   From a sociological point of view, we can see the role of a
father in a family, where he usually stays detached. The father is
usually depicted sitting in a chair, reading a newspaper, wearing
glasses and with a mustache.
	   Komik Indonesia is a relatively comprehensive account of the
development of comics in the country. Unfortunately, since the book
was written in 1972, that is where the story stops. No doubt comics
have developed even further over the years.
	   There is still 26 years worth of comic development hidden in the
minds of a handful of comic experts here in Indonesia. It is time
we gave comics a better place among literary works because they are
not simply a series of drawings. They are, in a way, evidence of
history.

Town promoting reconciliation receives U.S. aid

	   DARDA, Croatia (AP) _ The United States gave dlrs 13.7 million
Monday to the eastern-most town of Darda, rewarding city fathers
for promoting reconciliation in this war-torn region.
	   The money will be used to rebuild homes and infrastructure, and
revive the local economy.
	   Darda, in the region known as eastern Slavonia, was the first
Croatian town to receive such financial support.
	   ``We chose Darda as it does need reconstruction and has shown a
real desire for reconciliation,'' said U.S. Ambassador William
Montgomery.
	   Last month, a group of foreign diplomats pledged to aid towns
across Croatia that cooperated in efforts to allow the return of
refugees and the development of multiculturalism.
	   Serbs and Croats fought a bloody war in 1991, when local Serbs
rebelled against the country's independence from former Yugoslavia.
Thousands of Croats and Serbs were killed or left homeless, and
tensions and hatreds persist in many communities.
	   Darda, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) east of the capital,
Zagreb, was badly damaged during the conflict. But unlike other
municipalities, it has set up a successful multi-ethnic leadership.
	   Before the war, Darda's population was more than 6,000. A slight
majority were Croat.
	   Now the population is predominantly Serb, but the government
already has rebuilt more than 100 homes for Croats.

	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has welcomed Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina to visit New Delhi shortly.
	   In a letter to Sheikh Hasina Saturday, Vajpayee said it is his
pleasure to welcome her to India.
	   ``I will be happy to receive you very shortly,'' he wrote Hasina
replying to her letter of May 31.
	   The Indian Prime Minister said during the forthcoming meeting at
New Delhi, they will be able to discuss ``many issues'' of mutual
interests.
	   Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad disclosed this last night to
newsmen who went to cover the press conference of Sri Lankan
Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar.
	   Replying to a question, Azad hoped to receive a similar positive
response from Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who is now on a
tour to the middle eastern countries.
	   ``Surely, we will receive a similar reply from Pakistan,'' said
the Foreign Minister.
	   On May 31, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina wrote separate letters
to Atal Behari Vajpayee and Nawaz Sharif to visit their countries
to discuss the situation arising out of nuclear tests carried out
by the two SAARC members.

	   THE closing of Kai Tak Airport next month will be a cause for
celebration as well as dismay for businesses in Kowloon City.
	   Most people in the area feel that the relocation of the airport
will mean the departure of many of the consumers the airport
attracts.
	   The diverse selection of restaurants lining the streets of
Kowloon City are the first stop for many incoming travellers
getting their first meal after a long flight.
	   This will no longer be the case after Kai Tak shuts on 5 July to
clear the way for Chek Lap Kok Airport the next day.
	   ``Business is definitely going to decline after the airport
closes,'' said Lam Lai-kuen, manager of the Chui Yuen Restaurant.
	   ``But hopefully when the new developments begin, business will
pick up again.'' The 380,000 residents who live under the flight
path will likely rejoice in the absence of the roar of jetliners
landing or taking off every three minutes or so.
	   Or will they? When asked if she would be glad that the screaming
of planes ceased for good, Mrs Lam replied: ``I don't know if I
could get used to it.'' Others, like employees of the Chan Xian
Fang cafe, have other concerns.
	   ``The new airport will be very inconvenient because it is so
far,'' said a bartender named Toby.
	   ``But at least it won't be as noisy when the planes pass by.''
The good news is that the closure of the airport calls for a
commemorative campaign, complete with a set of souvenirs and
publicity gimmicks.
	   Yesterday, Kowloon City Plaza kicked-off its ``Farewell to Kai
Tak'' campaign, officiated by Lee Cheuk-fan, in his capacity as a
member of the Kowloon City District Board.
	   The event involved the introductions of a photo exhibition of
Kai Tak Airport and Kowloon City, as well as the unveiling of a
countdown board.

Japan says no new talks with North Korea amid abduction suspicions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prospects for talks on normalizing ties with North
Korea have dimmed because of suspicions Pyongyang has withheld
information about alleged kidnappings in Japan, a top Japanese
official was quoted as saying Monday.
	   Tokyo had asked North Korea to investigate allegations its
agents had abducted as many as 10 Japanese, but the reclusive
communist government said Friday it knew nothing about any missing
Japanese.
	   Japan was dissatisfied with the response. Vice Foreign Minister
Shunji Yanai was quoted as saying Monday by Kyodo News that any new
bilateral talks would likely end in failure.
	   ``We will ask North Korea to offer information and
investigate,'' Yanai was quoted as saying.
	   North Korea, ravaged by food shortages and a devastated economy
and isolated politically, is eager for ties with wealthy Japan.
	   Preliminary talks on normalizing relations between the two
neighbors collapsed in 1992 over the kidnapping issue.

	   BANDUNG (JP): In September last year, art dealer Jais
Dargawidjaja created a stir in the local art world by exhibiting
works of world class maestros.
	   It was near the end of the country's art boom but she still went
on with the show, Modern Masters of Indonesia and Europe, at Darga
Gallery in Sanur, Bali. Art lovers, including those with no
intention of buying, could thus satisfy their hunger for the
masters.
	   Among exhibits were originals of Picasso and Matisse, and pieces
by local artists Hendra Gunawan, Jeihan, Srihadi Soedarsono and
Nashar. Jais did not disclose how many were actually sold and who
bought them, except that one Picasso considered of ``average''
quality was purchased for over Rp 100 million.
	   Now, as buyers are understandably thin on the ground here, local
artists may have more hope if they can make it to Jais' new gallery
in Paris.
	   She announced on May 9 in Bandung that she was attempting a
breakthrough into the European market by opening the Darga &AMP;
Lansberg Gallery in Paris.
	   Her aim is to market Indonesian painters' works to European
society in a city, renowned for its development of modern art,
where hundreds of galleries are found.
	   This is a major challenge -- not a single Indonesian painter has
penetrated the market continuously like the Chinese painter Zao Wu
Ki or Indian Anish Kapoor, for example.
	   Bali-based French art observer Jean Couteau said Jais' effort
was daring.
	   ``Not a single star shines abroad, there are only participants
of official international activities in several forums,'' he said,
``Nobody has systematically examined the big markets in Europe,
America and Japan.''
	   Jais admitted she was taking a gamble as she had yet to conduct
a representative market survey and was acting mainly on her senses.
	   ``Perhaps we have considered so far that exoticism could be sold
in Europe. But it is not true. We don't have to rely on 'exotic'
works, but on works of quality,'' Jais said.
	   Therein lies the complication -- does a contemporary work using
the charcoal medium, for instance, constitute inferior quality
compared to an oil painting?
	   Is a painting of simple figure lesser than one on a grand scale?
	   These are areas of endless debate in the art world. As an art
dealer, Jais has her own parameters.
	   ``If we talk about market, we must first value physical quality.
How an artist makes a work of art from a simple medium which looks
elegant, attractive and valuable. ... An installation work could
unique, but there are installations which are worked on seriously
enough, so that they also look elegant, attractive and mysterious
...''
	   Jais became known as a professional art dealer at the end of the
1980s when she was still cooperating with the Duta Fine Arts
gallery. Aiming for the upper market, she had already promoted
works of maestros such as Jeihan, Popo Iskandar, Arie Smit and Lee
Mam Fong.
	   In the last two years, she began to work on her own and then set
up the Darga Gallery. Jais, a former theater actor in Bandung who
also acted in a few films, has worked with other artists including
Daryono, Ivan Sagito and Faizal.
	   Her business acumen has taken the works of artists such as
Jeihan, Made Wianta, Chusin, Nyoman Erawan and Herry Dim to Europe.
	   According to plans, Darga &AMP; Lansberg Gallery will start
exhibiting works next month. In her own pioneering and independent
way, Jais shows the art community that they cannot wait for the
government to put their works on the international stage.

World Cup: Tension rises before first match against Cameroon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARSAC, France (AP) _ The Austrians are happy with their
surroundings, training opportunities and state of fitness ahead of
their World Cup opener against Cameroon. So why all the tension in
the air?
	   It's simple nervousness as Austria focuses on Thursday's match
in Toulouse. Some signs of tension were palpable Monday, during the
squad's morning training at the local stadium in Arsac, a
picturesque wine-growing town north of Bordeaux.
	   Midfielder Arnold Wettl, for instance, was unhappy with the
ball. He said was different than in Austria, where he plays for
Rapid.
	   ``It's inflated a bit too much,'' he complained. ``We hope we
can control it better during the games than in practice.''
	   Coach Herbert Prohaska, normally a picture of staidness, also
showed some strains, chewing out an interviewer from state-run
Austrian television for asking what he considered a silly question.
	   Still, the team has little to complain about. The practice field
is perfectly manicured, the weather is late spring rather than hot
summer, and the players are as fit as they will be.
	   Hannes Rainmayr was out for the full 90-minute practice session
Monday, showing no signs of that a bruised knee sustained two days
ago was slowing him down.
	   ``I can keep up again!'' Rainmayr, of Austria's Sturm Graz,
yelled toward the sidelines. ``There's no problem if it stays this
way.''
	   Wolfgang Feiersinger collided with another player during
practice Monday, bruising his shin, but Prohaska said it would not
slow the star defender down. Generally, ``the team's physical
condition is not a concern,'' he said.
	   Asked about general fitness, fellow-defender Peter Schoettel
said: ``It's getting better all the time.''
	   Midfielder Andreas Herzog said condition was extremely important
against Cameroon, a young and fast team, saying: ``If we're in the
best physical shape, we can really cut loose.''
	   He waved off questions about Austria's other first-round
opponents, Italy and Chile.
	   ``We should only be thinking of Cameroon now,'' he said. ``In
the final analysis, this game is a kind of qualifier for us _ if we
don't do well here, we're in trouble further on.''

	   President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed yesterday said culprits
perpetrating repression on women and children would be punished
without reprieve, reports APB.
	   He said, ``I will instruct concerned authorities to see that the
culprits are handed exemplary punishment in accordance with the law
of the land.''
	   The President said this while talking to a 14-member delegation
of the Repression Complaint Cell, which called on him at
Bangabhaban yesterday. Convenor of the cell and former MP Farida
Rahman led the delegation.
	   Earlier, the delegation submitted a memorandum to the President
expressing grave concern at the rising incidents of cruelty to
women and children.
	   ``The women and children are being kidnapped, raped and murdered
almost everyday. But the perpetrators of such crimes are going
scot-free'', the delegation told the President.
	   They referred to the rape of 6-year-old Tania, in a police
control room in broad daylight. ``But no action was taken against
those who cannot avoid their responsibility,'' they said.
	   The delegation noted with deep dismay that persons committing
rape and murder are being granted anticipatory bail, which is
encouraging many others to commit such crimes.
	   The members of the delegation urged the President, to instruct
all concerned to combat such crimes ruthlessly and to ensure that
culprits are given exemplary punishment.
	   President Shahabuddin gave them a patient hearing and said he is
aware of the state of things as regards cruelty to women and

	   DON'T go to the new Chek Lap Kok airport when it opens on Monday
6 July, authorities are advising the public.
	   People are being advised to ``stay home'' and watch the grand
opening ceremony on television.
	   The weekend prior to opening day will be of vital importance and
people are being asked to prevent traffic congestion and not to
disturb the operations.
	   The most critical hours will start at midnight of 5 July, a
Sunday, when vital equipment will be moved from Kai Tak airport to
Chek Lap Kok.
	   Commissioner for Transport Fanny Law Fan Chiu-fan on Sunday said
members of the public should understand the urgency of ensuring a
smooth operation to avoid any delay.
	   ``As the removal of the airport should be done in a limited
period of time, it is hoped that commuters and drivers would avoid
using the roads at that time,'' Mrs Law said.
	   She added that the process would be broadcast live on television
and the public should stay home to watch it. Details of traffic
arrangements will be announced later.
	   Mrs Law was speaking after the 20th anniversary launching
ceremony of Rehabus, which provides a door-to-door transport
service for the physically disabled.
	   Some 20 Rehabuses took more than 300 disabled people to the new
airport to try out the facilities before the official opening.
	   Speaking at the ceremony, Lee Man-bun, chairman of the Hong Kong
Society for Rehabilitation, said the Rehabus service started 20
years ago, with two borrowed buses. Today it boasts a fleet of 74
Rehabuses _ 71 12-seater minibuses and three single-deck buses.

	   When I read the article written by Laila Faisal about the lack
of students' curiosity in classrooms, I just grinned. As a student,
I have behaved exactly as she described -- declined to ask
questions for fear of looking stupid. Or when my teacher explained
a lesson, I would suddenly find another subject more interesting
and so not pay enough attention to what the teacher was saying.
I've witnessed other students behaving in the same way.
	   I totally agree with what Laila said about it being far easier
to ask questions when we were little. People are more tolerant
toward young children, and if weird or stupid questions are asked
people just think, ``Well, he/she is just a little kid anyway.''
	   As you grow up, you have to be more responsible for what you do
or say. The more responsibility you have, the less tolerance other
people show toward you. It depends on a person's courage to take
more responsibility. And this courage is the result of someone's
education, environment and experience.
	   I often marvel at and admire the relationship between Western
parents and their children as depicted in Western movies. It seems
to me that children in the West are freer to express themselves and
that their parents show more appreciation of their opinions. Since
early childhood, it appears that they are thought of as complete
individuals who have rights and opinions, and not just obligations.
	   I don't mean that parents here don't give to or think the same
things about their children. It is just that parents here are more
fearful of letting their children do anything freely, therefore
children tend not to learn how to be independent.
	   My father always called young actors in Western movies
``clever'' and ``bright'' and he always commented on why young
Indonesian actors couldn't act as well. I think it's because
Western actors are used to being their own selves since early
childhood and so they are used to using their instincts, making
them better actors.
	   When the Environmental Engineering Department of ITB held an
international seminar a couple of months ago, there was a foreign
lecturer invited. He was a flying lecturer at some universities in
several countries, already a professor in his early 40s. He had a
wife and three kids. He always took his family wherever he went.
And because of his heavy schedule, his kids were never registered
at any school. We asked him why and he answered that it was because
he was sure that traveling was a kind of education, too.
	   ``By traveling, my children see different cultures, learn to
adapt easily to other people and appreciate them, and they will be
brave to face different situations. They will be enriched by the
experience, and it will allow them to improve their selves. Formal
education is somewhat easier than those things,'' he said.
	   I and my friends watched his family with full interest. We
thought he was really confident of his children's abilities. And
when we talked with his kids and ``tested'' them, we were surprised
at how bright they were. His four-year-old child was already able
to read. She could identify different kinds of animals that we
showed her in an encyclopedia. And the kids were so friendly.

	   Academic activities of the university are being hampered for
lack of adequate number of classrooms and teachers' rooms. The
rooms in the university are small enough to make spaces for all the
students of a class. As a result, most classrooms remain crowded.
Many students attend the classes standing inside the rooms.
	   An estimate shows that the number of students under the Arts and
Social Science faculties is around 12,500. There are about 200
teachers in the 16 departments under the faculties. But there are
only 27 classrooms and 117 teachers' rooms which cannot cope with
the situation. Classes of three of the departments under the
faculties are held in the Business Studies building.
	   Yet another class is held at the building for Arts and Crafts
Department. Students of these two faculties usually gather at the
teacher's room and the teacher asks them where they want to hold
the class. The search for a free room then begins.Some of the
departments do not have their own classrooms. Students of such
departments move from one section of the main building to another,
looking for a place to hold the classes.
	   Some teachers take their classes during the breaks. Sometimes
classes are also held in the seminar room or even at the teacher's
room. The Computer Science Department has only one classroom. Lack
of accommodation pushes two or more teachers to sit in one room.
Muhammad Mizanuddin, a university teacher, said the accommodation
problem of the students and teachers could only be solved by
constructing a fourth building of the Arts Faculty.

Norway 's first oil fund investments in stock markets produce
</HEADLINE>
gains &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ After three months of dabbling in the
world's stock markets, the Norwegian government has turned a profit
that would the envy of any novice investor: about dlrs 1 billion.
	   Norway, the world's second-largest oil exporter, has for several
years been salting away some of its oil revenue in a fund to
cushion the country once the wells run dry.
	   This year, parliament allowed the Central Bank of Norway to
expand oil fund investments into stocks instead of placing them
exclusively in safe but lower yield government bonds. About 40
percent of the fund is now invested in 21 countries and 2,000
companies.
	   On Monday, the state bank announced that the fund's value
increased 6.3 percent to 120.5 billion kroner (dlrs 16.2 billion)
during the first three months of the year. Money was transferred
slowly and quietly into stocks to avoid affecting markets with a
sudden infusion of cash.
	   ``We have been through a very important phase. The increase has
happened stepwise, at about 8 percent a month. It has been
important to us to transfer the funds to the stock markets without
effecting the markets,'' the fund's director, Knut M. Kjaer, said
by telephone.
	   Because Norway's currency, the krone, has weakened recently,
Kjaer said the international buying power of the fund was a better
measure of the fund's gains. That increase was 3.74 percent, or
about 4.2 billion kroner (dlrs 560 million), during the three
months.
	   ``We are quite satisfied, but one quarter with good results is
no guarantee for what will happen in the next quarters. We know
there are big swings in these markets,'' said Kjaer.
	   He also said there was little impact from Asia's economic
crisis.
	   ``There has been a somewhat lower return in Asia then in the
other countries but just the same a relatively positive return. We
can't expect, in such a large portfolio spread over the whole
world, that all regions and all countries at any given time will
show positive developments,'' he said in presenting the results.
	   Kjaer said the value of the fund's bonds rose 2.17 percent while
its stock values gained 12.47 percent during the three months. By
comparison, the Oslo stock market increased 7.83 percent in the
same period.
	   The fund placed Norway's money through four external managers _
Banker Trust of New York, State Street Global Advisors of Boston,
and the London firms Barclays Global Investors and Gartmoe
Investment Management _ with the Chase Manhattan Bank as overall
global custodian of the fund.

	   JAKARTA (JP): ``You can just call me Rudy,'' gestured President
B.J. Habibie.
	   In his two weeks as president, the 62-year-old technocrat has
been trying to project a congenial image, and again during a
luncheon with chief editors and Jakarta-based foreign journalists
he tried to show himself as an average man rather than a patriarch.
	   He claimed that he wanted to do away with the feudalistic aura
surrounding a person of high rank and continue to be intimate with
the people.
	   Habibie recounted how his predecessor, and mentor, always
complained that the most important job in the country was always
the loneliest one.
	   ``You will have many admirers, many friends and experiences, but
one thing is clear, you will be the loneliest man in the world,''
Habibie recounted Soeharto telling him 24 years ago after returning
from Germany.
	   ``Now I understand the warning. I do feel lonely now,'' he
remarked.
	   Many things have changed now, even his physical repertoire is
more choreographed.
	   He revealed that his wife, Hasri Ainun Besari, told him to be
more meticulous in front of television cameras. ``My wife said I
should no longer wave my hand to people so much.''
	   He lamented that being Indonesia's No. 1 official was also
taxing his personal freedoms.
	   He claimed he only had two hours of sleep each night because he
was constantly pondering over ways to lift the economic hardship
and restore international confidence in Indonesia.
	   Even his daily swimming exercise has had to be curtailed.
	   Habibie boasted that he used to swim over two kilometers a day.
``I hope that I can swim for one hour this evening,'' he said.
	   Habibie claimed that he had not envisioned himself before as the
country's leader, and that he had planned to retire in April this
year after holding a cabinet post since 1978, after which he would
spend five months out of the year in his beloved Germany where he
spent most of his young adult life.
	   His election as vice president in March ruined his dream.
	   Unabashed, Habibie said Soeharto had predicted in 1974 that he
would replace him as the country's leader someday.
	   ``If God wants it, you will accompany me in bringing this nation
to enter the next century,'' Habibie said reciting Soeharto's words
24 years ago.
	   Despite the close relationship, Habibie was quick to impugn
perceptions that he was merely Soeharto's puppet.
	   ``Just look at what we have done,'' he asserted as he pointed
out policies he recently enacted that would have been unthinkable
during Soeharto's era, such as releasing political prisoners and
revoking restrictive regulations on press freedoms.
	   He acknowledged the many doubts hovering over him, both at home
and abroad.
	   ``Lee Kuan Yew (Singapore's senior minister) once said if
Habibie is there, everything will collapse,'' he said smilingly
recalling the senior statesman's remark earlier this year when news
first spread that Habibie would be vice president.
	   In an apparent response to the wave of discontent against him,
Habibie pleaded for patience and cooperation.
	   In a remark that suggested that he knew he was only human, he
said he could not restore the country to its precrisis condition
overnight.
	   ``I only have 24 hours a day like everyone else,'' he quipped.
	   Following an off-the-cuff address which was preceded by lunch,
Habibie challenged the editors to ask questions. Some looked
unprepared, although many could not hide their skeptical
impressions.
	   Some Palace officials looked tense as Habibie rambled on during
the question period for over two hours.
	   From the sidelines, one of his doctors jested in a whisper that
it might be healthy to talk freely to the press for hours.

	   The Industrial Clinic at Rajghat Industrial Area under
Abhoynagar thana of the district has been lying inoperative for a
long time depriving at least 30,000 people of medicare facilities .
It may be mentioned that the Health Ministry and the Public Works
Ministry of the then government established a 110-bed Industrial
Clinic at Rajghat Industrial Area in 1982-83 fiscal year. Soon
after establishment of the clinic, the local Health Department
recruited two senior staff nurses and 14 officers and employees
temporarily as per verbal orders of the Health Ministry .
	   But the ENAM committee expressed its inability to sanction funds
against the project on the plea that there was no order for
increasing posts. As a result, the officers and employees of the
clinic were either transferred or adjusted elsewhere. The project
remained abandoned depriving the people of medicare facilities .
Meanwhile, valuable materials of the clinic have been stolen on
over a dozen occasions.
	   But the local administration all along remained indifferent for
mysterious reasons. Moreover, the clinic has turned into a den for
the criminals due to the negligence of the concerned authority .
The patriotic people have urged upon the competent authority to
take immediate steps to save the clinic from total destruction and
arrange for extending proper medicare facilities to the people of
the industrial area.One arrestedIdris Ali, a local leader of the
extremist group Sramajibi Mukti Andolon was arrested by Kotwali
police from Shyamnagar village in Sadar thana at noon on June 2.
	   Kotwali thana source said that acting on a tip-off the
Officer-in-Charge CA Halim along with SI Fazlur Rahman gheraoed a
garden of the village and arrested Idris Ali who was sleeping
there. The police added that Idris Ali was a local leader of the
armed extremist group Sramajibi Mukti Andolon. A few days ago one
of his gangmates was arrested by the Kotwali police with 57 rounds

were three cases against Idris Ali with Kotwali thana and many
cases with Kaligonj thana of Jhenidah district, it is learnt .

	   MACAU'S Judicial Police on Sunday announced the arrest of three
alleged 14K triad members, among them two women said to be ``very
close'' to the gang's detained reputed leader, Wan Kuok-koi.
	   The three were identified as Wong Tat-hou, an alleged gang
leader; Wong Wan-wa, who is widely known by her Cantonese nickname
Fei Mui or Fat Woman; and Lam Iok-im, who is known by her nickname
Dai Ka Che or Big Sister.
	   Macau's district court yesterday ordered the pre-trial detention
of the two women on preliminary charges of criminal association.
	   Both women were taken under police guard from the district court
building on the peninsula to the central prison on Coloane island.
	   A police source said Wong Tat-hou was facing possible charges of
organised crime membership, casino loansharking and blackmail.
	   Wong is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.
	   A source recalled that police last year found a huge amount of
cigarettes smuggled from the mainland in a house on Coloane island
owned by Wong Tat-hou.
	   On Saturday the police arrested an illegal Chinese immigrant
surnamed Ho, suspected of kidnapping and extortion allegedly
committed between 1995 and 1996, and a Thai national working as a
bouncer in the Heavy Club discotheque, which is reportedly owned by
Wan.
	   The Thai national, whose name was not released by police,
allegedly carried an explosive device at the time of his arrest.
	   Wan has been in pre-trial detention at Coloane prison since 4
May by order of the district court. He was arrested on 1 May,
several hours after a bomb destroyed the car of Judicial Police
Director Antonio Marques Baptista.
	   But Wan has been charged only with being a triad member, not
with the bomb attack on the police chief's car.
	   As part of a major crackdown on organised crime, Macau has set
up a special taskforce within the public prosecutor's office and
hired half a dozen criminologists from Lisbon.
	   During a visit to Lisbon last month, Macau's governor, general
Vasco Rocha Vieira, called on China to be ``more rigorous'' in
controlling its borders with Macau.
	   China has pledged it will increase its anti-crime cross-border
co-operation with Macau in the run-up to the enclave's reversion to
Chinese administration in December next year.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The commander of a Bosnian Croat
paramilitary unit watched as one of his men raped a Muslim woman
during an interrogation, a U.N. war crimes prosecutor said Monday.
	   The defendant, Anto Furundzija, 28, has pleaded innocent to two
war crimes charges relating to his alleged involvement in the May
1993 attack.
	   Furundzija looked calm as his trial opened before the Yugoslav
war crimes tribunal. He faces a maximum life sentence if convicted.
	   Although rape has been considered a war crime in other cases
before the U.N. tribunal, Furundzija's trial is the first to deal
specifically with sexual assault inflicted during an interrogation.
	   The alleged rapist has not been arrested. Furundzija was
arrested in December in the central Bosnian town of Vitez, near
where the alleged offenses occurred.
	   Furundzija allegedly was interrogating the victim, identified as
``Witness A,'' as she was raped at the headquarters of his unit,
called ``The Jokers.''
	   The Jokers allegedly took part in a violent campaign by Bosnian
Croat forces to drive Muslims out of the Lasva River Valley in
central Bosnia in 1993.
	   ``Shortly after the interrogation started, the other member of
The Jokers forced her to undress and began what turned out to be a
prolonged series of physical, mental and serious sexual abuses
including repeated rapes,'' prosecutor Michael Blaxill said Monday.
	   By failing to stop the rapes, Furundzija became a ``direct
perpetrator committing the crimes of torture and outrages upon
personal dignity,'' Blaxill said.
	   Defense attorney Luka Misetic said the prosecution's case was
built on faulty recollections of the victim.
	   ``Her testimony will not convince you beyond a reasonable doubt
that Anto Furundzija is guilty as charged, and, make no mistake,
the prosecution's entire case is based on her testimony,'' Misetic
said.
	   Prosecutors have said they will only call five witnesses _
including the alleged victim. The first witness, a Muslim community
leader from Vitez, testified Monday about the background of the 3
1/2-year Bosnian war.
	   Set up in 1993, the war crimes tribunal has indicted 60 suspects
and has 27 in custody. Its most-wanted suspects, former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen.
Ratko Mladic, remain at large.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Chairman of the Jakarta Arts Council (DKJ) Salim
Said and six other board members tendered their resignations
Friday, following rancorous demands they step down.
	   With literary figure Taufik Ismail at the helm, Hamid Jabbar,
Salim, Adi Kurdi, Chaerul Umam, Slamet Soekirnanto and Tommy F.
Awuy followed suit and resigned, council member Ratna Riantiarno
told The Jakarta Post yesterday.
	   The seven were among 27 members of the board.
	   Separately before his resignation, Salim told the Post that in
the event he resigned from the board it would be not because of the
demands made by young artists and students, but because
``situations had become unbearable for him to continue working at
the board''.
	   Following the drive by prominent artists and art students for
the immediate dismissal of the DKJ board and the Jakarta Academy of
Arts and Culture (AJ), the board which elects DKJ members, Friday's
meeting also saw the surrendering of the DKJ mandate to AJ members
Iravati Sudiarso and Taufiq Abdullah.
	   In a meeting organized by DKJ on Tuesday, poet Sitok Srengenge
read a statement, Bongkar (Remove), signed by at least 100 people
and dated June 1.
	   Signatories included poet Afrizal Malna, playwright Ratna
Sarumpaet, production designer Mualim M. Sukethi, musician Sawung
Jabo, film director Garin Nugroho and actor Ikranegara.
	   Their demands included freeing the arts from red tape,
censorship and banning. Despite a 1995 government decree stating
that performances no longer need permits, artists say in reality
they still face bureaucratic obstacles.
	   At a local level, they demanded the DKJ board elected April 21
for the term 1998/2001 disband itself.
	   Artists said they wanted changes in how DKJ board members were
selected. They also criticized the lifetime membership tenures of
members of the Jakarta Academy.
	   Since 1970, board members have been selected by the Jakarta
Academy before being approved by the governor.
	   The artists argued board members should be selected through
voting by city artists.
	   Sitok said in a prepared statement that members ``are clearly
old figures who no longer follow the dynamics of the arts in
society'' and had ``no objectivity'' in electing council members.
	   The board elected April 21 had only a few new faces. Salim led
the board for 10 years.
	   Sitok said yesterday a two-day public discussion was scheduled
for June 13 - June 14 to discuss the mechanism of voting to elect
new members of the council by Jakarta artists.
	   Other topics may include government regulation of the arts.
	   Sitok said the forum of about 20 members had invited government
officials, non-governmental organizations, cultural observers,
business people and art critics.
	   Playwright Ratna of the Teater Koma troupe warned of tough tasks
ahead for new board members, particularly on lobbying for funds.
	   ``I agree that some of them have brilliant artistic ideas, but
can they convey them articulately enough to get funding for the
programs? Pak Salim did that before ...''
	   She claimed those who opposed the board had forgotten about
Indonesian ethics and culture when it came to dealing with elders.
	   ``Out of the around 100 signatures asking for the board
dismissal, only about 20 were actually artists. The rest were
unknowns ... even a five-year-old.
	   ``The children (the dissenting young artists) are ignorant and
misinformed about the institutions. Basically, this is just a huge
misunderstanding for which a 30-year-old arts council is paying
for.''
	   She said that since the founding of the Jakarta Arts Foundation
nearly a decade ago, DKJ ``never again'' took control of budget
allocated for Jakarta arts and cultural committees by the city's
administration and the National Development Planning Board.
	   ``How can they blame us for monopolizing the budget for the
staging of progovernment plays?''
	   Artists contended that while they faced ``politics of
licensing,'' government-sponsored cultural events, supported by the
Arts Council, always proceeded smoothly.

	   The people of Faridpur town have demanded shifting of the morgue
to the Faridpur Medical College Hospital from its present site. The
lone morgue in the district situated on the northern side of
Faridpur General Hospital was set up during the British rule.
	   The morgue has become dilapidated now. Besides, it is too small
to conduct autopsy of two bodies at a time. The surrounding areas
of the morgue have become thickly populated. The atmosphere in the
surrounding areas of the morgue becomes polluted very often when
rotten and decomposed bodies are kept there for autopsy. Moreover,
people living in the neighbourhood suffer from psychological
problems.
	   When the attention of the Civil Surgeon Abul Hossain was drawn
to the matter, he opined that a morgue should be situated on the
premises of a medical college, if there be any. So, the morgue
should be shifted to Faridpur Medical College Hospital premises
from its present site and housed in a suitable spacious building to
cope with the changing situation.

Polish-German foundation presses for slave labor compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Polish-German foundation appealed Monday
to German companies that had employed slave laborers to consider
reparations for Poles forced to work in Nazi Germany during World
War II.
	   The Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation urged Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek to discuss slave
labor reparations when they meet Thursday, said Jan Parys, the
foundation's deputy chairman.
	   Kohl and Buzek will open an international youth center in the
southwestern Polish town of Krzyzowa, or Kreisau, which was part of
Germany before 1945.
	   Foundation members argue that Poland's 1953 decision not to seek
war reparations from Germany does not mean that Poles are not
entitled to civil compensation claims, the PAP news agency
reported.
	   Created in 1991, the foundation is currently distributing 500
million marks (dlrs 295 million) it received from the German
government for payments to Polish slave laborers.
	   The foundation already paid one-time compensation to more than
half a million people and plans to review claims from 250,000
others this year.
	   Foundation members say some 200 existing big German companies
had employed slave laborers and thus should start paying
compensation to Poles.
	   About 7 million people were forced to work in Nazi Germany
during the war. Most were from Poland and the Soviet Union, and
many were Jews.
	   Some big German industrial firms, including Siemens and
Mercedes-Benz, paid reparations to some former slave-laborers, but
those behind the Iron Curtain were unable to apply.

	   THE Privacy Commissioner has called on Hong Kong companies not
to break laws protecting personal information when upgrading
computer systems to get rid of the millennium bug.
	   Stephen Lau Ka-men said organisations needed to make sure the
personal data they held was accurate and protected against
unauthorised or accidental access, processing or erasure.
	   The problem, also known as the year 2000 bug, is caused by the
inability of many computer systems and micro-processors to
recognise dates in the year 2000.
	   Mr Lau said the biggest danger when it came to privacy
protection lay in mistakes made when converting figures such as
bank account statements or changing passwords.
	   ``All practical steps must be taken to ensure the accuracy of
personal data and the security of computers,'' he said.
	   Mr Lau said banks, in particular, should be aware of the risk of
breaking the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance when upgrading their
computer systems to get rid of the bug.
	   While big business was taking steps to deal with the problem,
many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were often unaware
of the pitfalls, he said.
	   ``There are half a million SMEs and a lot of personal computers
are not compliant with the year 2000, because the firms lack
resources and are buying off-the-street software,'' he said.
	   Legislator-elect Sin Chung-kai called on the Information
Technology and Broadcasting Bureau to issue guidelines to safeguard
the protection of personal information.
	   ``It's the very minimum the government should do,'' he said.
	   Mr Sin, a Democrat who represents the Information Technology
functional constituency, said the Hong Kong Productivity Council,
which is helping SME's to take on the millennium bug, should draw
attention to the privacy implications of the changeover.
	   ``Privacy protection is a major issue of the year 2000 bug, it
should be addressed,'' he said.
	   The HongkongBank said most of its computer systems were already
compliant with the year 2000.
	   It said it regarded the protection of personal data as
``sacrosanct''.

	   YOGYAKARTA (JP): Bantul Council (DPRD) unanimously agreed to
sack Regent Sri Roso Sudarmo yesterday after he admitted offering
bribes to smooth his election to another term in office.
	   The unanimous decision was taken during the second special
plenary session of the council which was attended by all members
except one, Sri Roso's brother, who asked permission to be excused.
	   ``The Bantul council will form a team to meet with the Minister
of Home Affairs to ask him to grant the wish of local residents and
remove Sri Roso,'' council speaker Mansur S. said yesterday.
	   The council's decision was initially expected on Friday, but was
delayed when Golkar council members walked out of the session after
hearing Sri Roso's explanation of his behavior.
	   The council asked the regent if it was true that he signed a
letter promising the Dharmais foundation, chaired by former
president Soeharto, Rp 1 billion if he could serve another term in
office.
	   Mansur said Sri Roso admitted signing the letter during the
hearing.
	   ``He himself admitted writing and signing the letter which
states he would make the contribution after being reelected. That
is a clear violation of his oath as a public servant,'' Mansur
argued pointing to Article 14 paragraph 4 of Law No. 5/1974 which
forbids offering or accepting gifts and other items to secure
position or personal advancement.
	   Mansur added that given the evidence against him, it would not
have been possible for the council to continue to support the
corrupt regent.
	   The council also urged the attorney general and police to reopen
their investigation into the murder of Yogyakarta based Bernas
journalist Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin yesterday.
	   While there is not yet any evidence to implicate the regent in
the 1996 murder, Fuad was known to be investigating official
corruption in Bantul.
	   ``No leads should be left uninvestigated and all those who may
be able to help police with their enquiries, including Sri Roso
Sudarmo, should be questioned. The true culprit and motive must be
discovered,'' Mansur asserted.
	   Police initially forwarded a rather dubious dossier and case
against Dwi Sumaji, whom they claimed was the murderer. The public
prosecutor's office eventually accepted the police case, but only
after rejecting it several times.
	   The case was later thrown out of court after it transpired that
the police had insufficient evidence to bring Dwi to trial.
	   Yesterday's decision by the council was greeted with relief by
Bantul residents.
	   A group of university students who had gathered with a large
crowd at the council building, immediately rushed to the podium
when the council meeting ended and began to sing the national
anthem.
	   ``This is proof of the councillors dedication and sensitivity to
the aspirations of the people,'' Herry Sebayang, who headed the
student group, said.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The first court-martial session of the Trisakti
shooting incident was held at the Military Court in East Jakarta
yesterday, as hundreds of students, police officers and the media
teamed the courtroom to watch the proceedings.
	   The trial brought two of the 18 suspects -- all of whom are
members of the Jakarta Police force -- to the court wearing their
respective uniforms and flanked by a strong team of leading
lawyers.
	   The hearing for the two officers -- company commander First Lt.
Agus Tri Heryanto, 29, and platoon leader Second Lt. Pariyo, 38,
both from the City Police mobile brigade unit -- lasted for almost
three hours after it opened at 8:40 a.m.
	   Prosecutors Col. Sardji Purnomo and Capt. Bambang Ari Wibowo,
who read the indictments by turns, charged the two for
undisciplined acts under Article 103 of the Military Penal Court
which carries a maximum sentence of two years and four months in
prison.
	   Open fire
	   According to the military prosecutors, the two officers allowed
their subordinates to open fire without authorization during the
May 12 Trisakti student protest that ended with the deaths of four
students.
	   ``In fact, they did not do anything to stop either the shootings
or the beatings of the students in the Trisakti incident,'' Sardji
said while reading the indictments.
	   ``The suspects' conduct eventually led to chaos, property
destruction, injuries and the death of four Trisakti students,'' he
told the court.
	   The prosecutors also said the suspects were armed with ``blanks,
rubber bullets and tear gas''.
	   ``Therefore, we demand that the two defendants remain in custody
during which we ask to bring in 10 witnesses to testify in this
trial,'' Sardji said.
	   He identified the 10 witnesses as West Jakarta Police Chief Lt.
Col. Timur Pradopo, Second Sgt. Cecep Dadang S., Second Sgt.
Sunarto, private Arwan Saleh Siregar, Capt. Arman Dahlan, Second
Lt. Mahmud Sulaiman, head of Trisakti campus authority Ari Gunarsa,
neighborhood civilian security officer Samsudin, head of Trisakti
security Yonas Pattikaihatu and Trisakti student Julianto Hendro
Cahyono, an economics major who is also Trisakti's student senate
chairman.
	   No evidence was presented during yesterday's hearing.
	   National Military Police Corps Commander Maj. Gen. Syamsu Djalal
said Tuesday that all of the 18 suspects would be charged under
Article 170 of the Criminal Code for violent assault, which carries
a maximum sentence of 12 years in prison.
	   At times during the hearing, most of the watching police
officers voiced their support for their fellow members on trial.
	   ``Yeah ... be brave, man!'' cried some of them, forcing
presiding judge Col. Sudji Suradi to bang his gavel to silence the
court.
	   The prosecutors' charges were at least twice objected to by the
defense team led by noted Indonesian attorney Adnan Buyung
Nasution. He was accompanied by eight senior lawyers: O.C. Kaligis,
Hotman Paris Hutapea, Moh. Assegaff, Rudhy A. Lontoh, Denny
Kailimang, Hotma Sitompul, Otto Hasibuan and Purwaning Yanuar.
	   The team also consists of six senior officials from the National
Police Legal Affairs Department.
	   Differences
	   The defense questioned significant differences of words found in
the indictments read by the prosecutors compared to those in the
defense's hands.
	   ``You also said in the indictment that the police were armed
only with rubber bullets, tear gas and blanks. Yet, the results of
Jakarta Military Police investigation showed that the four Tisakti
students died from live ammunition.
	   ``These defendants obviously were not the ones who shot them,
and therefore, there is no correlation between their action and the
death of the students,'' Adnan said.
	   O.C. Kaligis took the stand and backed up Adnan's opinion,
saying that the prosecutors were trying to mislead the public,
stoke student outrage and lead the innocent officers to a ``fatal
indictment''.
	   The hearing was closed with a defense plea to dismiss all
charges.
	   ``We also want the court to release defendant Agus from
detainment because his wife is due to give birth,'' Buyung said.
The appeal was quickly rejected by the judges.
	   ``The defendant will remain in prison and we will adjourn until
the next session on Tuesday at 9 a.m. sharp,'' presiding judge
Sudji said.
	   Outside, an angry group of Trisakti students yelled their
disappointment at the defense team, particularly Buyung whom they
have considered a strong supporter of the student movement.
	   ``Why are you defending killers? You said you'd support the
student fight for reform all the way! You're a traitor,'' said
Hendro Cahyono of Trisakti University.
	   Buyung tried to calm the angry students and said: ``You want all
this to be revealed completely?''
	   ``This trial is one way to reach that goal. You can't just blame
and drag down innocent people, ruining their lives. For what?''
	   Speaking with reporters later, Buyung said he chose to defend
the suspects because he saw discriminative action aimed at the
police.

	   THE government has denied any link between an order for the
Provisional Urban Council to vacate Central Market and a review of
district organisations.
	   The government plans to move the market from Queen's Road to
Hollywood Road and turn the area into a bus terminal and commercial
building.
	   But PUC members want the market to stay put and the site
redeveloped to include recreational and cultural facilities.
	   Chairman of the PUC working group on the issue, Democrat Kam
Nai-wai, said members would investigate the rights of the council
in relation to land owned by the government. ``We want to know if
the government has the right to take over the site.'' He said the
group would discuss the resumption order on Monday.
	   A spokesman for the Planning, Environment and Lands Bureau said
despite six years of discussion with councillors, little had been
achieved, and the need for a bus terminus on the site was
``urgent''.
	   A government statement said: ``We cannot afford to wait until
PUC acceptance or otherwise of our offer to reprovision the market
before we make preparations for the redevelopment of the Central
Market site.'' It said redevelopment of the market and the review
of the municipal councils were separate issues.
	   But Urban Councillor Jennifer Chow Kit-bung, said the move was
an attack on the council's power.
	   ``The Urban Council has much power and the Government thinks
it's time to review its duties and responsibilities.'' Copyright

	   Hypertension is defined as a sustained diastolic blood pressure
greater than 90 mm Hg accompanied by an elevated systolic blood
pressure above 140 mm Hg. Elevated blood pressure is an extremely
common disorder affecting approximately 20 per cent of the entire
population of the world. Although many of these individuals have no
symptoms, chronic (long-term) hypertension can lead to congestive
heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction, renal damage and
cerebrovascular accidents. The incidence of morbidity and mortality
significantly decreases when hypertension is diagnosed early and is
treated properly.Although hypertension may occur secondary to other
disease processes, more than 90 per cent of patients have essential
hypertension, a disorder of unknown origin affecting the
blood-pressure regulating mechanism.
	   A family history of hypertension increases the likelihood that
an individual will develop hypertensive disease.Essential
hypertension occurs four times more frequently among blacks than
among whites and it occurs more often among middle-aged males than
among middle-aged females. Environmental factors such as a
stressful lifestyle, high dietary intake of sodium (sodium
chloride-table salt), obesity and smoking - all lead to the
occurrence of hypertension.A patient of essential hypertension must
adopt a philosophical attitude toward life. He should avoid heavy
manual work but continue moderate activities. He should have 8/10
hours sleep at night. Fatty hypertensive patients should modify
eating menu to reduce body weight up to normal. Salt intake should
be restricted but not stopped.No drug can cure blood pressure
completely, but the above mentioned measures help to keep the
pressure down to a reasonably lower level.
	   Careful designing of treatment varies according to the blood
pressure studies of individual patients and their emotional
background.Mild hypertension can often be controlled with a single
drug. More severe hypertension may require treatment with several
drugs that are selected to minimise adverse effects of the combined
regimen. Treatment is initiated with any of four drugs depending on
the individual patient: (1) a diuretic, (2) a beta-blocker, (3) an
ACE inhibitor, or (4) a calcium channel blocker.If the blood
pressure is not adequately controlled, a second drug is given.A
general scheme of treatment may be as follows.(1) Mild case: Oral
diuretic (e.g. chlorthiazide) plus tranquilliser (e.g. Relaxeu
tablet). (2) Moderate case: Oral diuretic plus methyldopa. (3)
Severe case: Diuretic plus prazocin. (4) Hypertension with angina:
Beta blocker (e.g. propranolol) plus ACE inhibitor (e.g.
captopril). (5) Hypertensive emergency: Diuretic (frusemide) plus
reserpine.Lack of patient compliance is the most common reason for
failure of antihypertensive therapy.
	   Treatment of hypertension is directed at preventing the disease
that may occur in future, rather than in relieving present
discomfort of the patient. The side effects associated with
hypertensive therapy (e.g. depression, fatigue, insomnia, asthmatic
breathing, etc.) may influence the patient more than future
benefits. Thus, it is important to enhance comfort of the patient
by carefully selecting a drug regimen that minimises adverse
reactions.

World Cup: French return, but is Zidane healthy for opener?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIRFONTAINE, France (AP) _ After a four-day escape to Finland,
``Les Bleus'' of host France returned home bearing a message of
high anxiety: Is their creative genius, Zinedine Zidane, healthy?
	   After a hard-fought 1-0 win over Finland last Friday, playmaker
Zidane has been struggling with an injured ankle, and reassuring
messages from the medical staff have hardly lifted the dark cloud
hanging over the World Cup team.
	   Zidane, without whom any French hope of winning the World Cup
seems a pipe dream, had to be rested on Saturday and could only run
for 10 minutes on Sunday because his right ankle was still acting
up.
	   The Juventus Turin star hopes to return to regular training on
Tuesday, just three days ahead of the World Cup opener against
South Africa in his hometown of Marseille. Saudi Arabia and Denmark
are the others in Group C.
	   ``It is preoccupying because there is always that fear that he
will not be able to play the first match,'' said team doctor
Jean-Marcel Ferret. But he added Zidane was fighting the worst pain
a few days after the injury. ``I wouldn't worry too much,'' he
added.
	   All through the weekend, coach Aime Jacquet criticized Friday's
refereeing that could have cost France its brightest star. Zidane
was tackled often and hard, and Jacquet even considered pulling him
off to protect him. ``It was a scandal,'' the coach declared.
	   In case Zidane cannot recover in time, his place would most
likely be taken by Robert Pires, 24, the playmaker of Metz,
runner-up in the French league.
	   Zidane's was the only injury for the French. Other difficulties
were tactical, centering on who would provide the French goals.
	   Jacquet had long promised that France would turn from a
defensive and conservative team into an ``audacious'' one for the
World Cup, but words have come easier than performances.
	   Captain Didier Deschamps knows that an overnight change is
tough.
	   ``We will never produce fireworks,'' he was quoted by L'Equipe
sports paper. ``We cannot have a revolution in one week.''
	   On top of that, the French expect South Africa to do little else
than defending and hoping on a lucky break next Friday.
	   ``We won't fall for that trap,'' said Deschamps, arguing against
an all-out assault from the start.
	   The French team will stay for three days at its training camp
here in the woods southwest of Paris before heading to Marseille on
Thursday, ready for their Coupe du Monde.
	   ``The team is bubbling with impatience,'' said Jacquet.

	   A JUNCTION point of the Airport Rail tracks was slightly damaged
during a trial run on Wednesday, but the Mass Transit Railway
Corporation on Sunday shrugged off the accident as ``minor''.
	   The incident, caused by a defective track and not by a
subsidence of the reclaimed land, would not delay the opening of
the line, the MTRC said.
	   The junction, known as ``scissors point'', about 200 metres from
the Olympic Station of the Tung Chung Line, was damaged when an
engineering train rolled through during a test.
	   The junction is located in a newly reclaimed land near Tai Kok
Tsui.
	   The accident sparked concerns that land subsidence caused the
defect and would be a potential danger to the Airport Rail's
operation.
	   But MTRC public relations manager Betty Chan Lee Pik-hang said
the damage was only slight and not caused by the reclaimed land.
	   ``The defect was fixed shortly afterwards on Thursday, so it is
no longer a problem,'' she said. The method of reclamation had
taken into account that a railway would be built on the land.
	   But she refused to comment on the consequence that would occur
if the fault was not promptly discovered, saying this was ``only an
assumption''.
	   Citing the example of Hang Fa Chuen station of the MTR, Mrs Chan
stressed that railway tracks built on reclaimed land should not be
a problem.
	   ``We are confident the line can start operating as planned on 22
June.'' The Olympic Station was opened to the public on Sunday.

Egyptian, Israeli activists propose solution to peace deadlock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian and Israeli peace activists Monday
proposed a 7-point peace plan, which includes a united Arab-Jew
Jerusalem, to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
	   The activists, who worked on the plan for more than a year, say
they will try to mobilize Arab and Israeli peoples into pressuring
their governments to speed up negotiations and reach peace.
	   The activists represent Peace Now, Israel's largest peace group
with thousands of members, and the Egyptian Peace Movement, a small
group of about 120 members including prominent writers, lawyers and
former politicians.
	   A joint statement by the two groups said they decided to join
hands to counter the hard line policies of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, which have forced the talks into a ``virtual
standstill.''
	   ``We deeply believe that ... both Jews and Arabs throughout the
region urgently desire peace,'' the statement said. ``We are also
convinced that a comprehensive peace is not only desirable but also
attainable.''
	   Among the seven points offered as the solution, one proposes
that Jerusalem remain a united city in which Palestinians and
Israelis can co-exist under coordinated municipalities and have
their own capitals.
	   The statement says that some Israeli settlements be allowed to
remain within the boundaries of the agreed Palestinian state but
others must be evacuated with appropriate compensation from the
Israeli government.
	   The proposal also says that the Palestinian state should be
allowed to absorb the 1948 refugees and displaced Palestinians from
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The refugees should also receive
compensation from the international community.
	   The official Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have left the issue
of Jerusalem and the historical disputes to be resolved last,
pending a resolution of major issues such as Israeli troops pullout
from West Bank, the opening of an airport in Gaza and the free
passage of Palestinians between West Bank and Gaza.
	   Netanyahu's government says the peace process cannot proceed
until it has ensured the security of its people and secured
guarantees from the Palestinian Authority that it will curb
terrorism in its area.
	   The peace talks between the two sides are currently stalled over
Israel's refusal to accept a U.S. proposal for a further 13.1
percent Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank. The
Palestinians, who originally demanded a bigger pullout, are ready
for 13.1 percent.

	   THEFTS of tractors, trailers and containers in the border
district of the New Territories increased sixfold last month.
	   While the monthly average of tractor, trailer and container
thefts for the January to April period was only three, the figure
jumped to 19 last month.
	   Police yesterday advised truck drivers to take precautions
against theft, particularly when in the northern New Territories.
	   Drivers are advised to take simple, common-sense measures to
ensure their vehicles are kept under surveillance where possible,
are securely locked and easily identifiable, in order to deter
thieves.
	   Acting Chief Superintendent Leslie Burton, Border District
police commander, said police would give further advice to truck
drivers if needed.
	   Several guidelines were issued yesterday, such as not parking
containers, trailers or tractors in remote areas or on roadsides
sheltered by thick undergrowth which could provide cover for
thieves.
	   The best place to park is at a car park with security
facilities, where surveillance can be kept on the vehicle.
	   Drivers and owners were warned to use ``mushroom locks'' or
other good-quality locks resistant to prising and bumping.
	   Owners were also advised to paint the company name in a
prominent position on the vehicle so that it could be easily
identified. And car park management should be told not to allow
vehicles to leave the car park without prior notice.

	   Sino-nasal disease is a very common disease to the people of all
classes in our population. Sino-nasal disease means the disease
which involves the paranasal sinuses and the nose itself. Although
amongst all the Sino-nasal diseases, sinusitis is very common and
the term is almost known to everybody. Many patients directly
report to the physician or ENT specialists with diagnose of
sinusitis and ask for treatment. Some patients think that this
disease does not cure permanently so no need of treatment at all.
One quarter of patients is well experienced with wash treatment of
sinusitis and many of them, their relations or associates express
their dissatisfaction when the treatment does not alleviate the
sufferings. What is sinusitis?Sinusitis is the inflammation of the
lining membrane of the sinus wall. There are four groups of sinuses
and situated on each side of the nose.
	   These are maxillary, ethanoidal, frontal and spenoidal.
Inflammation may be restricted to a single sinus or may be present
in several or in all of one or both sides but the maxillary sinus
is the commonest victim of all the sinuses. The lining of the nose
and paranasal sinuses is continuous and it would be rare for
inflammation to affect one without the other. The term rhinitir
implies an inflammation lining membrane of the nosal fossae. Owing
to the continuity of the lining membrane of the nasal fossae with
that of the sinuses, some degree of inflaming is very often present
in the latter at the same time, so constituting a
rhinosinusitis.Effects of rhinosinusitis on chest
diseaseRhinosinusitis is a disease of the respiratory tract and the
respiratory tract for better understanding is classified into two
subdivisions namely the upper respiratory tract and the lower
respiratory tract.
	   The upper respiratory tract mainly includes the nose and
paranasal sinuses and the lower respiratory tract includes the
trachea (wind pipe) and lungs. These two subdivisions i.e. the
upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract are very
much closely related, not only in anatomy, but also in a number of
physiological functions and also to the responses to the various
environmental factors. Since the upper and lower respiratory tracts
share the common defence mechanisms, defects in them will be
reflected as infective presentation to either ENT Specialists or
chest physician or both. Since the upper respiratory tract brooks a
higher rate of environmental attack, the ENT specialists usually
come across the infections first which will later affect the lung.
Therefore, chest disease is frequently associated with
rhinosinusitis.
	   So naturally ENT specialists look for the principles of
actiology, pathology, investigation and management of diseases of
one tract reflected in the other.In fact, the complex relationship
of sino-nasal disease and the chest disease is well exemplified by
the presence of sinusitis in association with a purulent lung
disease such as bronchiectasis, acute bronchitis and recurrent
bronchitis. In one study it has been observed that chronic purulent
sputum production, most with proven bronchiectasis showed a high
prevalence of rhinosinusitis. In another study, it revealed that
asthma occurred in 17-19 per cent of patients with nasal disease,
particularly allergic rhiniter, and 56-74 per cent of patients with
asthma were found to have allergic rhinitis.
	   How do the patients of rhinosinusitis present to the ENT
specialists? The patient may present with one or more of the
following: (1) Nasal obstruction - one or both sides. (2) Nasal
discharge - watery or purulent (3) Itching in the nose or throat
(4) Sneezing (5) Snoring (6) Facial pain and headache (7) Nose
bleeding (8) Abnormal smell or difficulty in nasal smell (9)
Foul-smelling nasal discharge (10) Weakness (11) Feverish condition
(12) Cough (13) Feeling of something in the throat (14) Blocked
feeling in the ear or pain in the ear etc. Whatever may be the
clinical presentation, if the patients suffer with the above, he or
she is advised to consult ENT specialists to get the timed
diagnosis and its definitive treatment.

	   ``Bangladesh is at a cross-roads,'' said Dr Nasir Uddin of the
Voluntary Health Services Society in Bangladesh. ``If the country
and the people take action now, they have the opportunity to save
thousands of lives and millions of dollars - otherwise Bangladesh
faces an AIDS epidemic of appalling social and economic
proportions.'' That was two years ago. Yet it was only in April
last year that a comprehensive five-year plan of action was drawn
up by the Bangladesh National AIDS Prevention and Control
Programme.
	   The fact that Bangladesh took so long to wake up to the AIDS
crisis has mystified some observers and there is scepticism over
the plan being implemented in time to avert disaster. ``It's
frustrating - the country has known there's a problem for a long
time,'' says a senior development expert who wishes not to be
identified. ``They have a moral obligation to do something. All
this really should have happened sooner.'' HIV is expected to
spread faster and kill more people in South and Southeast Asia than
anywhere else in the world in the coming decades.
	   Bangladesh's neighbours, India and Burma, are already in the
throes of a serious and rapidly worsening epidemic of HIV. In the
past the government argued that the forces behind epidemics in
other countries, such as sexual and drug injecting behaviour, are
less pronounced in Bangladesh. The new plan is an acknowledgment
that this argument doesn't hold water. Sexually transmitted
diseases, which can lead to HIV infection, are common, particularly
among the poor. Blood for transfusion is not systematically
screened for HIV.
	   According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, there are 800,000
drug addicts in Bangladesh - though most inhale and are not at risk
of HIV infection, the numbers who inject drugs (and are therefore
at risk from contaminated needles and syringes) are increasing. The
Bangladesh economy relies on more than 1.5 million migrant workers,
including truck drivers, businessmen and labourers. These migrants,
who spend much of the year away from their families, are known to
be at increased risk of contracting HIV. In addition, there are
more than 100,000 known sex workers in Bangladesh, most of whom
have not received AIDS education and do not use condoms.
	   If reliable statistics about HIV were available in Bangladesh,
it might not have been so easy to ignore the problem for so long.
However, the number of HIV positive people in Bangladesh is not
known. Based on the small number of surveys that have been
conducted in the past, the World Health Organisation estimated that
in 1993, there were 20,000 people living with the virus in the
country. Although the Bangladesh Ministry of Health still quotes
this figure, epidemiologists from the World Bank estimate that the
true number of infected people may have risen to 112,000 or more by
now.
	   The only way to obtain accurate estimates of the number of
infected people is by testing a random sample of the population for
HIV. If the sample is truly random, the fraction of infected people
will be the same as that in the general population. This method,
known as surveillance, has never been properly tried in Bangladesh,
leaving health workers and policy makers guessing. The new plan
recognises that AIDS cannot be attacked in a purely medical way. It
acknowledges, too, the difficulty in changing behaviour and
attitudes and the need to involve all sectors of society in any
strategy.
	   In particular, the plan aims to implement a reliable
surveillance system to educate the public about HIV and AIDS;
control sexually transmitted diseases; ensure safe blood supply and
provide care, support and counselling for infected people. Work
will be carried out by government ministries and health-related
non-governmental organisations. Implementation is expected to cost
about $40 million, most of which will be sought from overseas
donors. Lisa Messersmith of United Nations AIDS programme (UNAIDS)
is optimistic.An action plan has been prepared. Finally, it seems
that Bangladesh is in a strong position to do something.
	   The plan is consistent with Bangladesh's long term health goals.
``In the past, Bangladesh health policy was focused on child
survival - now there is a trend to focus on issues of adult and
reproductive health that have been neglected for a long time,''
says Sarada LeClerc of the Canadian International Development
Agency. Years of bureaucratic inefficiency and denial may finally
be over. But some are taking a wait-and-see attitude. ``The
government hasn't yet said how the plan will be implemented, and
nothing has happened on the ground yet,'' according to a senior
official in an international agency.
	   ``However, the new plan does recognise that there has to be more
coordination between the policy makers and the implementers, and
that's a good sign,'' the official added.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Before the din of student protests has died down
comes another passionate event sure to unite people, regardless of
age, sex, social status and ideology.
	   The World Cup, the pinnacle of soccer competitions, takes to the
field Wednesday night.
	   People have waited with baited breath for the ball to get
rolling. Children hum along to Ricky Martin's catchy 1998 World Cup
theme song, or the Indonesianized version, Anak Ale, Ale.
	   Political scientist Muhammad A.S. Hikam believes many will lower
the volume on the clamor for reform and become couch potatoes for a
month as they feast on a daily diet of soccer.
	   ``I guess those proreform activists will find it difficult to
maintain people's spirit. And it's not unlikely that the government
will take advantage of World Cup fever to distort the movement,''
Hikam said.
	   Demonstrations for reform shifted into a frenzied, grimmer gear
following the death of four Trisakti University students in Jakarta
on May 12. After all the smoke of looting and burning had cleared,
president Soeharto resigned nine days later in answer to the
reformers' prayers.
	   Hikam, a fanatical supporter of four-time champion Brazil, said
reform would be a second priority as people focused on their soccer
heroes in the vast media coverage on offer.
	   ``Lowering the mood for reform could be an unintended
consequence of this extra extensive coverage of World Cup.''
	   The six TV stations will broadcast the tournament's 64 matches
from the June 10 opener to July 12 final, in addition to special
coverage by print media. Media firms have buckled down and sent
their representatives in a tacit confirmation, perhaps, that the
World Cup is bigger than even the country's worst-ever financial
crisis.
	   University of Indonesia student Ahmad Noerhori was adamant that
the World Cup would not sway him from his reform goals.
	   ``Our movement will never dwindle until the government agrees to
hold general elections in the very near future. If our rallies
cease, it's because we've regrouped in order to avoid certain
parties from meddling in our movement.''
	   Students may not lose their ardor for reform, but Ahmad conceded
there might be some adjustments for the action in France.
	   ``We take our TV sets to our campuses, so that we can watch the
matches while working on our next agenda,'' he said.
	   Souvenirs
	   World Cup fever is at palpable levels in department stores,
where souvenirs, cassettes, compact discs and other World
Cup-related merchandise are on sale.
	   Junior high school student Yanti proudly owned up to buying
Ricky Martin's album and posters of soccer players, among them her
favorite, Alessandro del Piero of Italy.
	   ``I will watch all matches Alex and his Italian team play for
sure,'' she said. ``I like him because he's handsome.''
	   A trade fair selling an array of World Cup souvenirs including
sportswear, emblems, posters, stickers, keyrings and pins is
underway at Atrium Plaza in Senen, Central Jakarta.
	   A stand attendant said most visitors bought outfits of World Cup
holders Brazil. A short-sleeve shirt sells for Rp 25,000 (US$2.5),
a long-sleeve one for Rp 30,000.
	   A group of schoolboys of state-run SMP 20 junior high school in
Kramatjati, East Jakarta, also caught the fever -- they shaved
their heads to emulate their idol, Brazilian Ronaldo.
	   ``Actually we want to wear the Brazilian team's yellow and green
jersey shirt time we do sports at school, but our teacher forbade
us,'' said Yudi, one of the 30 shorn students. Students must wear
uniform outfits during sports lessons, according to the school
rules.
	   ``But no one can stop us from having our heads shaven like
Ronaldo,'' Yudi added.
	   Betting
	   Bookies are another group of soccer enthusiasts who cannot wait
for the World Cup to get rolling. Although the government outlaws
gambling, it is an open secret that some businesspeople and
professionals are prepared to stake big purses on their favorite
teams in major competitions.
	   A lawyer who wished to remain anonymous claimed a game master
could get turnover of hundreds of million of rupiah in one soccer
match during the World Cup.
	   He admitted to having bet on soccer matches for years, under
control of the game master. A participant needs only to call the
master while watching a live soccer match, usually on cable sports
network ESPN.
	   ``It's a trust game. It's difficult for the police to trace
us,'' he said.
	   ``Once my wager reached Rp 30 million ($2,608). I would have not
bet that amount if I did not trust the gambling organizers.''
	   The game master usually sends his employees to collect the
wagers or present the winner's prize money. The master will earn
between 5 percent and 7.5 percent of the winning pot.
	   Another source said a master required bookies to open accounts
at the same bank as his.
	   He said the illegal gambling in the country was linked to a
world gambling network. The master usually place his bet abroad to
reduce the risk of losing at home, he added.
	   ``The master could fix local matches in the past, but today they
cannot because of strong opposition from bookmakers.''
	   No wonder, then, that gamblers are hedging their bets on
four-time winner Brazil.
	   World Cup gambling has inevitably made it onto the Internet,
with several bookmakers offering their services with an interactive
on-line betting facility.

Slovaks start up controversial nuclear plant

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Despite strong protest from
anti-nuclear campaigners and neighboring Austria, Slovakia on
Monday started up its controversial nuclear power plant at
Mochovce.
	   The plant is just 120 kilometers (72 miles) east of Austria,
which has campaigned against its activation, arguing that certain
features of the heavy water pressure reactor make it unsafe.
Austria is the only country in the world to have built a nuclear
power plant, then voted in 1978 by referendum against putting it
online or having nuclear power.
	   Mochovce is a 440 MW Soviet-designed plant subsequently equipped
with Western technology.
	   Plant spokesman Rastislav Petrech said it received a go-ahead
from the Slovak nuclear authority on Sunday to activate its nuclear
fuel rods, as the authority deemed the plant ``met all the safety
and technical conditions.''
	   Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima on Monday condemned the startup
as ``an irresponsible and unfriendly act,'' the Austria Press
Agency reported.
	   In recent weeks, Klima and Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar
have repeatedly discussed concerns over Mochovce.
	   Klima said Meciar broke an agreement by failing to notify him
about the startup of the power plant.

	   TUNG Fong Hung Property Holdings on Sunday officially agreed to
acquire a 34.9 per cent stake in DC Finance Holdings for $408
million.
	   The price is equivalent to $0.465 per share of DC Finance.
	   According to the sale agreement, Tung Fong Hung will transfer
property assets involving a total floor area of 222,959 square
feet.
	   The properties include 17 commercial, retail and residential
assets, worth $460.9 million.
	   In addition, Tung Fong Hung chairman Lo Siu-fai, agreed to sell
his own properties with a total floor area of 9,672 sq ft to DC
Finance for $196.5 million.
	   Compared with the average closing price of $0.1376 per share
over the past 10 trading days on the stock exchange, the
acquisition price for DC Finance represents a 237.9 per cent
premium.
	   But the acquisition price represents a 7 per cent discount to
net asset value as of last December.
	   Under the agreement, DC Finance will pay back $140 million in
its loan portfolio as soon as the transaction is completed.
	   The loan portfolio, as of 15 May, amounted to a total of $915
million with loan maturities ranging from two to 20 months.
	   As agreed, Tung Fong Hung will not make a general offer to DC
Finance's shareholders.
	   The transaction is expected to be completed no later than 31
July if approved by Tung Fong Hung shareholders at an extraordinary
general meeting and other conditions stated in the agreement are
met.
	   Valuation of Tung Fong Hung's assets sold to DC Finance totalled
$606.7 million, according to reports from Vigers (Hong Kong) and
Chesterton Petty.
	   The most expensive of these assets, located in Sai Kung, is
worth $93 million or $6,011 per sq ft.

EU bans new investments in Serbia; freezes assets abroad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with comments from EU statement on possible
military action. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Worried that a new wave of ethnic cleansing
may ignite another Balkan war, the EU tightened sanctions against
Belgrade on Monday and urged the NATO alliance to study military
solutions to stop the violence in separatist Kosovo province.
	   The European Union foreign ministers banned new investments in
Serbia and froze the country's assets abroad to punish it for
``widespread house-burning and indiscriminate artillery attacks on
whole villages'' in the Serb-ruled province, where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9 to 1.
	   Yet given the limited effect sanctions have had so far on
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, they urged ``international
security organizations ... to consider all options,'' including
those requiring specific United Nations Security Council support.
	   That could mean military intervention by NATO. The sort of
actions requiring specific U.N. blessing would be the imposition of
a no-fly zone, air strikes against Serb artillery, beefing up U.N.
forces in Macedonia or _ the most extreme scenario _ sending an
allied force into Kosovo.
	   Until now, NATO has been considering only joint but small-scale
maneuvers in neighboring Albania and Macedonia and sending up to
20,000 troops in Albania along the Kosovo border.
	   On Thursday and Friday in Brussels, the NATO defense ministers
meet to consider a military response, a prospect that so far has
met with little enthusiasm.
	   On Friday in London, the foreign ministers of the G-8 nations _
Canada, United States, Britain, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and
Russia _ will discuss Kosovo, bringing Russia into the
international deliberations.
	   ``It is very important we include Russia,'' German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters. ``But that will be
difficult.''
	   Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, would
be called on to endorse any NATO action under a U.N. mandate.
	   In their statement, the EU ministers said Serb security forces
have been ``engaged in a campaign of violence going far beyond what
could legitimately be described as a targeted anti-terrorist
operation.''
	   They urged Belgrade and Kosovo independence activists to seek a
negotiated solution and spoke of ``the grave deteriorating
situation on the ground, involving the excessive use of force by
the Serb security forces.''
	   ``We are disturbed by reports that these attacks are beginning
to constitute a new wave of ethnic cleansing,'' the ministers said.
They called the flow of refugees into Albania a ``threat to
regional security and stability.''
	   The investment ban and the asset freeze come in addition to
previously announced measures including a ban on arms exports and
restricted travel visas for Yugoslav officials.
	   At Washington's urging last month, the EU held off on the
investment ban and assets freeze to give Milosevic a chance to
reach a peaceful settlement in Kosovo.
	   Escalating violence in Kosovo in recent weeks has drawn
parallels with West European waffling in 1991 and 1992 as Bosnia
slipped into civil war.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Indonesia needs reform brought about through an
evolution, not a revolution, President B.J. Habibie said yesterday.
	   ``We have to realize that everything must be allowed to evolve.
But the process can be accelerated. An accelerated evolution is the
natural way to ensure the quality of the outcome,'' Habibie said
during a luncheon held for editors of newspapers and broadcast
media at the State Palace.
	   He explained that this was the way that he intended to pursue
reform, including preparations for a general election next year.
	   ``I beg for your help, leaders of `information society', to
explain our sincere intentions to the public. We can only
accelerate the process. We only 24 hours in a day, not more and not
less,'' he told the media executives.
	   He likened the reform process to constructing a multi-story
building.
	   ``You can't rush up and build the 10th floor straight away.
That's impossible.
	   ``What you can do is build the first, second and third floors at
a normal speed, then afterward you can accelerate your drive until
the top story has been reached.
	   ``Evolution does not only apply to construction. In every aspect
of our lives and thoughts, nothing happens suddenly. It (sudden
change) only happens in the 1001 Nights tales,'' he said during the
four hour luncheon.
	   Evolution minimized the risks associated with a revolution, he
said, adding: ``In the end, the nation has to bear the brunt.''
	   Habibie described the students' uprising of 1966, which helped
Soeharto to ascend to the presidency, as a revolution. On the other
hand, he called this year's student movement, which led to
Soeharto's downfall and helped his own rise to the presidency, an
evolution.
	   The editors were the latest group of people to be spoken to by
Habibie in the two weeks since he was appointed president. He had
earlier met with religious leaders, senior business figures and
prominent members of the reform movement.
	   The legitimacy of Habibie's presidency is still widely debated
and he came under strong criticism when he announced this week that
he had no plans to call a general election until next year.
	   Speaking without a prepared text, Habibie begged his guests to
be understanding, and said that it would be better if the entire
nation spoke the same language when talking about reform.
	   ``We can speed it up. We can run, and then stop to contemplate.
That is the gradual approach.''
	   ``I ask you to maintain the momentum for reform, but be
realistic. We all have our limitations.
	   ``We need to focus our attention on the future. That does not
mean that we should forget past practices of corruption, collusion
and nepotism,'' he said, pointing out that there were legal
channels to resolve these problems.
	   Habibie said his government ``has been rushing'' to implement
the various reform agendas, including the preparation of new
political laws which would open the door for a fair general
election to be held as early as May next year.
	   ``We intend to complete the laws on elections and political
parties by August. That gives us two months, gentlemen.
	   ``They (the government team) are working hard to draft the laws
... Once the drafts are completed, I will give them to you, you can
publish them, and let the public study them thoroughly.
	   ``But I will only give you one month, because we want to have
the laws enacted by December,'' he said.
	   Once enacted, the People's Consultative Assembly could meet in
December to set a date for general elections, he said. ``They
(assembly members) will need only one day to decide.''
	   He argued that the country would then need a few months to
prepare for the elections. ``If everything goes well, Insya Allah
(God willing), we can hold the elections in May next year,'' he
said.
	   A new assembly formed as a result of the elections could then
meet in December to elect a new president and vice president.
	   Habibie predicted a coalition government would emerge from the
election which would be contested by more than three parties.
	   He estimated the election would cost Rp 3 trillion to organize.
Last year's election cost Rp 1.4 trillion because it was only
contested by three parties, he said.
	   Regarding his economic program, Habibie said the government
would give greater attention to small and medium enterprises
because they were more resilient than large conglomerates.
	   ``They gave us a cushion when we fell. It's only natural that
they now be given a special place in our economy,'' he said.

	   THE price war among property developers intensified over the
weekend with the Paliburg Group discounting the price of its Park
Royale development in Yuen Long by 15 per cent compared with other
new developments in the area.
	   The move drew overwhelming response from flat-buyers, prompting
Paliburg to extend the deadline for registration from 7.30 pm to 10
pm last night.
	   With an attractive launch price of $2,834 per square foot, the
project received more than 300 applications during the first day of
registration on Saturday for the first batch of 100 units.
	   Total registration figures for the first two days were not
available last night.
	   The strong response to Paliburg's 15 per cent discount is an
indication that prices of flats for new developments may drop
further in the coming weeks as other developers undertake similar
price cuts, property analysts said.
	   The decline in property prices in the primary market is
carefully watched by the government and private sector which are
concerned about a too-rapid decline in Hong Kong property prices.
	   To cope with the strong market response to Park Royale, Paliburg
announced on Saturday that it would put another 100 units on the
market at the same price.
	   While the secondary market was hard hit by the prolonged
property market slump, many real estate agents have turned to the
primary market.
	   Industry watchers said half of the applications for purchases in
the primary market were submitted through real estate agents.
	   Park Royale is scheduled for completion by early 1999. The
development offers 680 flats, a 180,000 sq ft club house and a
podium garden.
	   Wheelock &AMP; Co also sold almost 80 per cent or 33 units of its 45
remaining Regalia units in Tower I, King's Park on Saturday at an
average price of $6,455 per sq ft.
	   The spokeswoman of Wheelock Properties, Eva Ho, said they have
put all the remaining units in Tower II on the market.
	   Henderson Land was also able to sell some 30 Metro City units in
Tseung Kwan O and 10 Dawning Views units in Fanling on Saturday
through real estate agencies which generate more than $100 million
for the group.

	   India has objected to the ``coercive and unhelpful'' resolution
adopted by the UN Security Council and reiterated that it does not
want any external involvement in resolving disputes with Pakistan,
reports Reuters.''We regret that the Security Council has acted in
the way it has and produced a resolution which is coercive and
unhelpful in respect of the objectives it seeks to address,''
India's External Affairs Ministry said late on Saturday.It said
India was committed to fostering friendship and cooperation with
all neighbours and was determined to resolve all outstanding issues
with Pakistan through direct bilateral dialogue.''There is no place
for third party involvement of any nature whatsoever in this
process,'' the statement added.
	   The UN Security Council on Saturday unanimously condemned India
and Pakistan for nuclear tests carried out in May and urged the two

U.S. diplomat ordered to leave summer residence in Minsk, gates

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarusian authorities ordered the
American ambassador to vacate his summer residence so that it can
be repaired, and tried Monday to weld shut the gates, Ambassador
Daniel Speckhard said.
	   Diplomats from 22 countries were notified in April that they had
to leave their summer homes because the post-World War II-era
complex outside the Belarusian capital, Minsk, needed long-term
repairs, Speckhard said at a news conference.
	   Speckhard took reporters to his residence in the diplomatic
complex at Drozdy and arrived to find two workers and a policeman
trying to weld shut the side gate. A small American flag was lying
on the ground. The workers left when Speckhard protested.
	   The ambassador said the government told him no vehicles will be
allowed into the complex starting Wednesday. He said his parents
were arriving in Minsk that day and he had hoped they could stay at
the residence, commonly called a dacha.
	   He said the United States has occupied the dacha since 1992, the
year after Belarus gained independence with the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and has since then spent dlrs 800,000 on repairs.
	   Speckhard said governments have no right to insist that foreign
diplomats leave their residences against their will. He appealed to
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to rescind the order.
	   ``I am hopeful that this press conference today will help to
inform the president of the situation in case he has not been
receiving the right information from his bureaucracy,'' Speckhard
said.
	   ``I think it very important that the government of Belarus sends
some different signals today or tomorrow on this issue.''

AND WORLD TIMES, INC. NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN

	   JAKARTA (JP): Ancestry: It's something quite a lot of people
reflect on with pride. There are associations in the U.S. like the
Mayflower Descendants and the Daughters of the American Revolution
which sing the praises of the heroics of their forefathers and
foremothers who settled and fought for the freedom of their
country.
	   There are, of course, many time periods in which the acts of
past generations should be looked upon with shame instead. The
Japanese, vis-a-vis the way their country treated neighboring
nations occupied during World War II, are an unlaudable example as
to how a country looks at such past acts, whereas their allies, the
Germans, have faced their heinous acts squarely.
	   Still, where less praiseworthy aspects are concerned, there's at
least one country in which many of its citizens are rather proud of
being descended from rum-swilling men and women: Australia. Even
more to their credit, most Australians are currently well aware of
the atrocities committed against the native aborigines and the need
to redress the situation. But by and large, people everywhere look
on their ancestry with affection.
	   Except in Indonesia. This is one country in which a segment of
its population have every reason not to even mention their
ancestry: the Chinese Indonesians. The country's recent upheaval
has made this all too clear. Again they have become the butt of
organized rioting. I can't prove this, but I am unshakable in my
belief that the ordinary Indonesian, the man on the street, does
not have it in him to go on a rampage against anyone unless he's
running amok -- in which case he'd be killing indigenous
Indonesians too before turning on himself. One must look beyond the
looting mobs to find the educated group hiding behind them. After
all, hatred, as Oscar Hammerstein said, must be carefully taught.
	   ``Ancestry'' could well be one of the most negative words in the
Indonesian language. Some of you will dispute this, and come up
with quite a lot of others like the ones about bodily waste, for
instance, or coarser expressions referring to the process of
procreation. But these are merely foul words, producing no worse
than a raised eyebrow, a mild, short-term shock, or a slap across
the beezer if you're underage and your parents happen to be around
to hear you say it.
	   But ancestry (keturunan in Indonesian) has become a word that is
bereft of any connotation except bad, wrong, immoral, unscrupulous,
rich and ... Chinese Indonesian. And don't think that the unsavory
reputation of keturunan had to go through an evolutionary process
before reaching its current meaning. It was enshrined in our laws
and regulations, as any minor immigration official can tell you.
All right, the government has decreed that Chinese Indonesians are
no longer required to declare their ancestry on official documents,
but after some 40 years of constant rubbing in (call it brain
washing, if you like), everybody associates keturunan with Chinese
Indonesian. How do you erase it from their psyche? Will the passing
of time help?
	   I'm sure that by now you have noticed that there's no further
definition in the use of the term. You don't, for instance, say
keturunan Cina (Chinese ancestry), and this, I'm sure, is to spare
the feelings of those other Indonesians who have a different alien
ancestry, like foreign affairs minister Ali Alatas, or former
minister of tourism, post and telecommunication Joop Ave.
	   Come to think of it, I can't remember ever having come across an
article or any kind of writing referring to former industry and
trade minister Mohammad Hasan as a warga negara keturunan (national
with an ancestry), especially during his two-month position in the
cabinet.
	   But scrapping decrees from the book is not the same as wiping
them out of the people's minds. Or news publications either.
Indonesian rags keep on referring to warga negara keturunan.
English language ones, like the one you're holding now, use
``descent''.
	   I am not Chinese and can trace my lineage back to my
great-great-grandparents who were equally un-Chinese. But of course
I cannot vouch for the sexual mores of my forebears beyond that
level. After all, who can say whether there was an ancestor of mine
who wasn't averse to a fling with an Arab, say, or Chinese,
Portuguese, whatever, from which union I would surely have
inherited more interesting features than the boring Malay ones I'm
sporting now. I have nothing in particular against the Chinese; in
fact, besides the cousins, nephews and nieces I have who happen to
be of Chinese descent, I genuinely like a lot of them, though I am
not ashamed to say that there are some I would rather see dead than
alive. But then, there are also some Ambonese, Bataks, Javanese,
Manadonese, Americans, Australians, what have you, about whom I
think that this world would be absolutely beautiful if they weren't
around.I still say dasar Cina! (what do you expect from a Chinese!)
but just as often I also exclaim dasar Sunda!, or dasar Bule!
	   But let's look at this ancestry thing from a different angle.
You see, I feel that the enshrinement in our regulations of the
definition that Chinese Indonesians are warga negara keturunan,
implies that, officially, I have no ancestry and all that its
meaning entails, including culture. Somehow, to me it also seems to
imply that only Chinese Indonesians have a right to an ancestry. If
this isn't extremely objectionable, I don't know what is. Of course
it also means that the government officials who enacted the
regulation have no ancestry either, but I find that scant comfort
because it is not the kind of company I dig.
	   These scribblings are dedicated to my mom, dad, uncles, aunts,
grandparents, teachers, lecturers, etc., who haven't taught me to
hate. And when I look over the rest of the clan, neither have the
Javanese, Buginese, Minang, Chinese, Dutch, Ambonese parents of my
many cousins, nephews and nieces. Would that the requirement to
declare one's ancestry be a must for all Indonesians! The daughter
of very dear friends would have to be wallowing in luxury, being
able to chose either Acehnese, or Javanese, Sundanese and
Manadonese. I, poor me, have only one! Anyway, from this moment on,
anyone who asks will be told that I am an Indonesian of Iban
ancestry. Maybe I should say ``any stranger who asks'' because I
have the type of friends and acquaintances, including Javanese,
Sundanese, Chinese, Germans, Americans, whatever, who couldn't care
less.

	   Indian Premier AB Vajpayee on Saturday asserted that no
construction activity for a temple was going on near the disputed
temple-mosque site at Ayodhya only to be contradicted by temple
makers who say preparations are in full swing and no power on earth
can stop us building the shrine,.Vajpayee's counter comes a day
after the entire opposition walked out of parliament charging that
workmen were giving finishing touches to prefabricated materials in
different cities to build a temple at the site where Babri mosque
was demolished in December 1992 and demanded a categorical
statement from the government. Prime Minister's assertion focusing
on 'the site'' is not dissimilar to that of the Home Minister IK
Advani's that court orders in this regard would be scrupulously
adhered to.
	   The opposition's contention that the temple fabrication activity
is going on in 'different cities'' has not been contested by the
leader of the pro-Hindu ruling Bharatiya Janata Party which has
been supporting the cause of temple and the government-opposition
tussle is likely to continue.Prime Minster told reporters ``I will
ascertain all facts and the information I have is that no
construction activity is going on anywhere near the disputed
site''.''Preparation is in full swing to construct Ram Temple in
Ayodhya and no power on earth--not even the Supreme Court-- can
prevent Vishwa Hindu Parishad (vhp) from achieving the goal, vhp
general secretary Acharya Giriraj Kishore said.
	   In an interview to the latest issue of Outlook' magazine, the
vhp leader said that the cutting and carving of stone for the Ram
Temple, now being done in Ayodhya in full swing, would be completed
in two years, according to a press release by the
periodical.Expecting the BJP government ``to remove all impediments
and hindrances'' in the construction of the temple, Kishore
remarked ``The land will be definitely handed over to us.
	   ``The vhp's assertion is in striking contrast to assurances
given by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Home Minister
Advani in parliament this week that the BJP-led coalition
government would maintain the status quo ordered by the apex
court.''What is our work now ? only to make the temple Bhavya'
(grand),'' he said, adding ``in India there is only one Dharma' --
that is Hinduism. The others are Mazhabs.''''The Puja at the
disputed site cannot be stopped. Nobody can move the makeshift
temple,'' Kishore said.Although the title suits are still in court,
the vhp leader said that would pose no problem.

	   THE British telecoms giant, Cable and Wireless (C&AMP;W), announced
on Sunday that it would delist its shares from the Stock Exchange
of Hong Kong on 29 June.
	   The move comes shortly after C&AMP;W announced it had filed an
application to delist its stock from the foreign section of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange on 13 May and shares would be delisted from
the Tokyo exchange on 21 August.
	   C&AMP;W company secretary Ken Claydon said C&AMP;W shares were hardly
traded on the Hong Kong exchange.
	   As of Friday, only 265 shareholders, holding 749,050 shares or
0.03 per cent of the C&AMP;W's issued capital, were registered with the
Hong Kong exchange.
	   Records indicate that an average daily trading volume for C&AMP;W
shares within the six-month period from 6 December 1997 to 5 June,
was only 87 shares.
	   According to the exchange records, there were no transactions
for C&AMP;W shares over the past five weeks, with the last active
trading date being on 27 April involving only 500 shares at $86.45
per share.
	   ``There are comparatively few shareholders who trade our shares
trade on the Hong Kong exchange, and trading volume is low. And
compared with our listing on the London Stock Exchange, we decided
the Hong Kong listing's costs were not justifiable,'' Mr Claydon
said.
	   Mr Claydon, however, emphasised that the group still had full
confidence in Hong Kong' future prospects and economy.
	   Although Hong Kong is the biggest profit contributor to C&AMP;W, the
company has been decreasing its presence in Hong Kong since the
handover.
	   The group posted an 8 per cent rise in net income before
exceptional items to 732 million (HK$9.22 million) for fiscal 1997.
With the exceptional gain, net income was 1.28 billion.
	   A one-time gain of 837 million was posted, including 519 million
from the sale of 5.4 per cent in Hongkong Telecom, and 524
compensation for the early termination of an exclusive IDD licence
for Hongkong Telecom.

	   Ex-boxer Farouk Afero is doing his best to support the reform
movement.
	   No, the 59-year-old is not going to return to the professional
boxing ring. But the national film award winner is doing more than
his share to save the disintegrating national film industry.
	   With 16 friends from the movie and TV industry, Farouk has
called upon Indonesian movie and TV artists to register themselves
to a new party.
	   ``This, if nothing else, will bring a sense of solidarity among
artists,'' he said of the party which would aim to protect the
rights of national artists.
	   Movie critics call it more of a lame, much-publicized try at
bringing ex-members of the Indonesian Film Artists Union (Parfi)
and the Nusantara Artists Association (Gan) to promote the flailing
movie industry. Farouk denied this.
	   Among others, he said, ``there is the historical significance of
Parfi which has to be upheld. Members of Parfi fought for artists
during the times of communism,'' Farouk said.
	   Artists wishing to register in the new party can do so at the
Parfi office on Jl. Rasuna Said, South Jakarta, from June 8 to July
1. A party congress to discuss the betterment of the national movie
industry will be held on July 8.
	   Among those registering are Dangdut queen Camelia Malik and
actors Gusti Randa, Deddy Mizwar, Roy Marten, Sys NS, Ahmad Fuadi,
Mark Sungkar, Yati Octavia and Nazar Amir.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sepp Blatter won a contentious fight for the FIFA
presidency on Monday, while two other battles _ against terrorism
and a potentially disruptive airline strike _ wore on just two days
before the start of the World Cup.
	   Blatter, FIFA's general secretary and choice of outgoing
president Joao Havelange, defeated European confederation chief
Lennart Johansson 111-80 in balloting among FIFA membership.
Blatter, from Switzerland, needed two-thirds of the votes for an
outright victory, but his Swedish opponent conceded before a second
ballot could be held.
	   ``I would like to thank all of you _ those who voted for me and
those who did not vote for me, because we are in a democracy. The
great thing to do is to unite the family,'' said Blatter, who then
praised Johansson as a ``gentleman'' and a ``friend.''
	   Both candidates had promised to make FIFA more open and
democratic, a contrast to the dictatorial style associated with
Havelange. Among their differences was the proposed location for
the 2006 World Cup: Blatter has all but promised the tournament to
Africa for the first time, while Johansson favored Germany.
	   ``The result is there, consequently he is the winner and we will
have to cooperate for the good of the game,'' Johansson said. ``But
we're not dropping our program. I'm loyal to the president, but I'm
not going to obey everything he says.''
	   The election ended a bitter, globe-trotting campaign that cost
more than a million dollars.
	   ``There may have been a few fouls, but we never tackled from
behind,'' Johansson said. ``Now we need to think of what is fair.''
	   Havelange, 82, who chose not to run for another four-year term
amid questions of corruption and growing criticism of his
administration, wiped away tears after the result was announced.
His 24-year tenure as FIFA president expires at the end of the
World Cup.
	   As the ceremonies continued inside the Equinox Hall, French
authorities were combing the country in their vigilant campaign
against terrorist threats to disrupt the World Cup. Nine more
suspects were arrested Monday, and police urged the public to watch
out for bombs.
	   The suspects were considered close to aides of Hassan Hattab, a
leader of the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria, who allegedly has
ordered an attack during the tournament.
	   ``We have to be vigilant, every citizen must be vigilant without
losing their cool,'' Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement
said. ``If you see something suspect, first get away, then call.''
	   Seven of the suspects were arrested in the Paris area, while two
other people were apprehended in the southern city of Carpentras
and the northern city of Roubaix, police said.
	   Meanwhile, there was a novel twist in the eight-day old strike
by Air France pilots. The SNPL, main pilots' union, made an
unexpected offer to work for free to fly foreign fans to the World
Cup games.
	   Air France said it would study the measure, but three smaller
pilot unions on Monday rejected the proposal, saying they would
advise members not to cooperate.
	   The walkout shows no sign of ending soon, and is certain to
disrupt the World Cup, which begins Wednesday when Brazil plays
Scotland and Norway faces Morocco.
	   The huge cache of political developments overshadowed the
supposed centerpiece of the tournament _ the players, who continued
to arrive and conduct practices throughout the country.
	   Belgium, in its fifth consecutive World Cup, began training at
Monthieux in the eastern part of France and wasted no time praising
its neighbor, the Netherlands. The two teams meet in the first
round Saturday.
	   ``I'm so impressed with the Dutch,'' coach Georges Leekens said.
``It's a machine that is far better than we are.''
	   Another injury to versatile defender and midfielder Thomas
Helmer provided a damper to Germany's first full day of practice in
Nice.
	   Helmer showed up lame after hurting his right thigh in Sunday's
workout. Also missing was wing back Christian Ziege, who is
battling a fever.
	   ``It's a real, real shame for Thomas,'' coach Berti Vogts said.
``He was being treated this morning and perhaps he can do some
light jogging this afternoon.''

	   FLAT owners may soon reduce the asking price for flats in the
secondary market by 5 to 8 per cent because of the recent
undercutting by property developers.
	   Ricacorp Properties area manager for Tuen Mun and Yuen Long
Jacky Fung said the Paliburg Group's Park Royale development in
Yuen Long had received a favourable response owing to its
attractive average launch price of $2,834 per square foot.
	   In contrast, the secondary market in Yuen Long was quiet.
	   Managing director of Ricacorp Properties Barry Law said all eyes
were on the primary market with the undercutting, flexible payment
terms and top-up mortgages.
	   While most of the new projects launched during the first half of
the year have been in the New Territories, the area's secondary
market has been hardest hit.
	   According to a survey conducted by Centaline Property Agency,
the transaction price of major developments in the New Territories
has fallen across the board.
	   Senior Supervisor of Centaline Property Agency (Royal Ascot)
branch Ray Au said the launch price for most new developments was
about 10 to 20 per cent lower than the market price, and there had
been a big fall in transactions in the secondary market.
	   Mr Au said another 22,000 new flats would come on to the New
Territories market by the end of the year and there was pressure on
prices in the secondary market.
	   He said the latest transaction in Royal Ascot, Fo Tan, had
recorded a 50 per cent fall in price from when it was at its peak.
	   He said the transaction price for Block 6 of Royal Ascot, which
contains flats of 1,236 sq ft, was $6.05 million, or $4,895 per sq
ft.
	   According to Hong Kong Property Services (Agency), the price of
flats has fallen to 1994 and 1995 levels.

AND WORLD TIMES, INC. NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN

	   JAKARTA (JP): The sun was shining on a small garden with a tiny
brook and bridge reminiscent of Japanese landscaping. The view was
irresistible to Muchtar Pakpahan, who was released May 25, after
his year-long bed-rest and five months behind prison walls.
	   ``Can we stand over there?'' he pleaded with television
reporters preparing to shoot an interview. ``It's been quite some
time since I've seen a garden.''
	   No, the light was not favorable, he was told. He had just opened
a seminar held by SBSI, the Indonesian Prosperous Labor Union, at
the building of the Indonesian Family Planning Association. Another
function was going on in the neighboring room. As the camera
rolled, participants in civil servants' uniforms were in a coffee
break.
	   Pakpahan seized the opportunity -- and so did they.
	   In the budding ``reform era'' civil servants have recently, in a
few sporadic incidents, expressed courage rarely seen in the
previous three decades.
	   Jostling state employees joined Pakpahan on air as he said,
``... as long as civil servants must join Korpri (the compulsory
civil servants' organization under the Golkar ruling party), they
will never struggle for the betterment of their welfare. Their
wages ...''
	   A pretty employee butted in, ``And rice! The rice is awful!''
and more colleagues approached.
	   ``Yes, and their monthly ransom of rice ...'' he complied.
	   He continued, ``... also, because civil servants are entitled to
the state's Astek health insurance, they should be served first,
and not ...''
	   ``like second class citizens!'' interjected an elderly man.
	   When the camera was switched off he continued his ``campaign''
with the employees of the National Land Agency.
	   Convinced
	   ``Now you can shake my hand without fear anymore,'' he said,
offering his hand, ``Join SBSI, or set up your own unions ... If
one day I arrange my land documents with you, I will no longer have
to pay you to get them processed,'' unlike civil servants in the
past who would have succeeded in improving their wages and
productivity, he said.
	   SBSI was officially registered as a union on June 1, six years
after it was set up, and Pakpahan is now convinced that civil
servants and other workers will have the pluck to join his union.
	   ``The wall has crashed,'' he said of the end of the ban on SBSI.
At the end of the week Pakpahan was scheduled to fly to Geneva to
an International Labor Organization convention.
	   Unlike at earlier conventions, SBSI is now in the government
delegation. Officials will no longer be embarrassed being seen with
Pakpahan, who in an earlier convention turned up as he was invited
by international unions.
	   Pakpahan said workers afraid to speak up against their
superiors, or hesitant to join the only legal union under Soeharto,
FSPSI (the Federation of the All Indonesian Workers Union), could
now turn to SBSI.
	   His prison guards in Medan, where he was detained for allegedly
instigating a riot in 1994, and in Cipinang, Jakarta, where he
spent the last part of his term, are among the civil servants who
have joined his union, he said.
	   Among the Cipinang guards' complaints was that they had become
victims in the escape of convicted tycoon Eddy Tansil; the special
treatment given to him was on the request of a senior official,
Pakpahan said.
	   Pakpahan acknowledges the huge task facing the union following
its official recognition: ``We only have idealism and militancy, we
are in dire need of intellectual and bargaining skills.''
	   With this task in mind he repeats that SBSI, claiming a
membership of 500,000, will never be a political party.
	   The two-day seminar, SBSI's first ever legal event, ``and the
first one in an air-conditioned room,'' he quipped, included the
best minds in labor studies and labor practice. It was an immediate
response to the union's challenge. ``The results will serve as our
platform for action,'' the chairman said.
	   His address to the seminar was strewn with apologies for his
schedule: ``After these few weeks, I will be back at home.'' He
wasn't referring to his family -- ``I'll be back with SBSI.''
	   He told participants he understood that ``political rhetoric''
wouldn't help priorities like overcoming growing unemployment and
lack of access to basic food supplies.
	   ``But how can we improve the economy without taking care of
politics first?''
	   He cited firsthand experience. ``We've helped to set up
foodstalls to help boost the income of laid-off workers.'' But few
were buying meals: ``Office people say now they try to have a full
breakfast and bring something from home, or only eat some bread for
lunch.'' Among the foodstalls is one set up by his wife under the
Cikini train station in Central Jakarta, to supplement the family
income since Pakpahan could no longer earn from university
teaching.
	   Other people are afraid to open stalls in case mobs begin
rampaging again, he said. ``This is all because of the uncertain
political conditions.''
	   Pakpahan, who earned his doctorate in state administrative law
from the University of Indonesia, has reiterated what he sees as
necessary immediate changes such as those regarding elections.
	   Removing the police from the Armed Forces is one priority, to
enable them to become law enforcers. ``At present, they use the
security approach and shoot first before investigating.''
	   Another repeated appeal is ``Please do not take over alleged
stolen property yourselves, Soeharto's or anybody else's; let's
leave it to the courts.'' The courts should also be made
independent from the government immediately, he said.
	   God
	   Pakpahan cites ``God's hand'' in his risk-filled life. One
example, he said, was when he was convicted for allegedly
instigating labor riots in Medan in 1994, but then had to be
hospitalized.
	   The resulting lung tumor, said the devout Christian, must have
been God's doing; it led to international advocacy for his freedom
and access to medical services. Most of his prison term was spent
at the Cikini hospital. ``And the C-3 ward became the center of
SBSI meetings.''
	   The tumor, he thinks, ``disappeared the minute (former
president) Soeharto stepped down.''
	   He reflects that in prison ``I increasingly understood what God
expects of me.''
	   It appears that Pakpahan's sincerity has won hearts although he
has no experience of, for instance, organizing labor in a factory.
He was once a self-employed pedicab driver in Medan to pay his way
through university.
	   Born in Bah Jambi II, Tanah Jawa, in Simalungun, North Sumatra
on Dec. 21, 1953, his father Sutan Johan Pakpahan died when he was
11; his mother Victoria Silalahi passed away a few years later. ``I
was brought up by my older brother; he's the only person that I
have never opposed.''
	   He says his achievement in gaining a bachelors degree in law was
``strange'' (''How could an orphan get a degree?'') and he says he
felt an obligation to the downtrodden.
	   He helped set up a few unions before finally founding SBSI in
1992. It gained popularity mainly because the legal union, then
SPSI, frequently proved impotent, and also because it was banned.
	   SBSI gained an international reputation but Pakpahan and his
secretary-general Sunarti, a former factory worker, remain modest
and without pretensions. She giggled when Pakpahan, shouting into
his mobile phone, turned out to be holding it upside down.
	   Also, Pakpahan's public addresses lack rhetoric but to most
people that does not seem that necessary. At a strike by drivers of
the state-owned PPD bus company, also on Wednesday, he basically
told the crowd what SBSI understood their problems to be, what the
proposed solution was, and enthusiastic roars filled the air.
	   Though modest, the labor leader is far from naive. He recites an
unexpected causality of his mission; another brother lost his
business because of Pakpahan's activities. ``He begged me to help
save his business. I was to sign a statement brought by the
authorities that I would be loyal to the Constitution and Pancasila
(the state ideology).''
	   ``I apologized ... I told him that if I signed this it would
mean I have never been loyal'' and that his activities would be
tantamount to being subversive.
	   Pakpahan promises that once his obligations following his
release are over -- addressing students and various other functions
-- there should be time for the family.
	   The youngest of his three children, Ruth Damaihati, 12, has
said, ``I wish we could all spend some time together again, like
going swimming.''
	   The last time they plunged in the pool near their home on Jl.
Kayu Putih in East Jakarta was before Pakpahan was arrested in
Medan in 1994.
	   The family had previously managed to go swimming on weekend
mornings, ``before union gatherings,'' Pakpahan said, because
workers only had time for organization activities on weekends.
	   ``I know I should have been there for them ... asking who
they're dating,'' Pakpahan said. ``I've asked for their
understanding.'' Ruth's brothers, Johanes Dartha and Binsar
Jonathan, are 16 and 17 respectively.
	   His wife Rosintan Marpaung Pakpahan, who teaches physics at a
high school, says she had a hard time ``being both father and
mother'' to the teenagers during his detention. But his family is
firmly behind him.
	   Rosintan was an activist with GMKI, the Indonesian Christian
Students' Movement, when she first met Pakpahan in Medan.
	   ``We hope he will never be arrested again,'' says Rosintan. ``No
one should ever be arrested again (for organizing labor). That's
why we need to fight for democracy.''

	   Fears of a war between India and Pakistan, after a display of
nuclear prowess, were overplayed and the two neighbours are likely
to return to the negotiating table to resolve their dispute over
Kashmir, analysts said on Sunday.''What has happened is both sides
which had missiles and bombs have exploded them. Now they (will)
proceed with the talks,'' said analyst BG Verghese.The UN Security
Council on Saturday unanimously condemned India and Pakistan for
the nuclear tests and urged the two to stop all nuclear arms
development programmes.India voiced its regret over the ``coercive
and unhelpful'' resolution adopted by the Security Council and
turned down any third party involvement in resolving its disputes
with Pakistan.Analysts said the reactions of the Security Council
and its five permanent members were along expected lines, and their
condemnation of India and Pakistan was not a surprise.
	   They said the SAARC (South Asian Association For Regional
Cooperation) summit in Colombo next month could provide a forum for
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistan Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif to discuss contentious issues.Analysts said
any fears of a nuclear war in the region were unfounded. ``There
are no war clouds hanging...nuclear weapons prevent a war,'' said
Savita Pande of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis.She
said there was no mad arms race in South Asia like the one that
existed between the two superpowers during the Cold War. ``If
nuclear weapons could ensure peace and stability in Europe, they
will definitely do it in Asia.''Verghese said the fear of a nuclear
war ``is all bogus'', adding: ``The notion that these are
irresponsible leaders leading weak governments is all imagined
fears.''In the next few weeks, he said, things would settle down
and a dialogue between India and Pakistan would be put back on
rails.
	   ``I think now there will be negotiations on the issue of Kashmir
because direct talks is the hallmark of Indian diplomacy on this
issue,'' said Pande.But a lot would depend on Pakistan's stance,
since India had made a set of proposals in January for reopening
talks, she said.Talks between the two nations were stalled last
year because of their dispute over Kashmir, the cause of two of the
three wars they have fought since independence from Britain in
1947.Tension between the two countries escalated last month after
India carried out five nuclear tests, followed by Pakistan.''India
has had talks with Pakistan in the past and it will agree to have
them again,'' said Pran Chopra of the Centre for Policy Research.
	   ``The ball is in Pakistan's court since India has already made a
set of proposals.''Sharif was quoted on Sunday as saying that South
Asia was on the verge of a ``disastrous'' nuclear arms race, and
urged the global community to address the Kashmir issue to avert
the risk of a nuclear conflict.In an interview with the official
UAE newspaper Emirates News published on Sunday, Sharif said
Pakistan's protracted dispute with India over Kashmir was the root
of regional tension.
	   But Vajpayee said on Saturday that Kashmir should be kept
separate from the nuclear issue.Analysts said too much should not
be read into Sharif's remarks since Pakistan had always sought to
link the nuclear issue with Kashmir.Chopra said the Kashmir issue,
on which the global view had been limited, was brought back into
sharp focus after the blasts.Sharif, in his Saturday interview,
invited Vajpayee for talks to end the arms race. Separately,
Vajpayee said India was always ready for talks with Pakistan to
resolve all outstanding bilateral issues, including Kashmir.

Toxic chemical found at former Mitsubishi plant site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dangerous amounts of a toxic chemical that causes
cancer was discovered at a former Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.
plant site under consideration for a sports center, officials said
Monday.
	   Ground water at the site in the central Japanese city of Nagoya
contains seven times the legal concentration of CIS-1,
2-dichloroethylene, said Masao Sugiura, an environmental official
with Nagoya city.
	   Mitsubishi used the chemical, a dirivative of the carcinogenic
chemical trichloroethylene, while making diesel engines at the site
until 1985, a company official said.
	   Sugiura said the chemical was found in a concentration of .28
milligram per liter, seven times higher than the maximum allowable
limit of .02 milligrams per liter.
	   The government surveyed the groundwater near the former plant in
preperation for building a sports center in the city, 269
kilometers (168 miles) west of Tokyo, Nagoya official Toyohiko
Owaki said.
	   Last week, officials announced that they found ground water at a
Toshiba Corp. plant in Nagoya with trichloroethylene, or TCE,
15,670 times the level the environmental agency considers safe.
	   TCE causes cancer in laboratory animals, and studies indicate it
may be the cause of lupus erythematosus and other connective-tissue
and immune-system diseases.

World Cup: Nigeria gets defensive in practice; Kanu sits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ The attack is out of synch and Nwankwu
Kanu's latest injury does not bode well. Yet Bora Milutinovic
devoted Nigeria's first full-squad World Cup practice Monday to the
real crisis: defense.
	   Kanu did not take part in the morning training session because
of a bothersome left ankle, a team source said.
	   The Inter Milan striker, who inspired Nigeria to the 1996
Olympic gold medal, could help boost the sagging offense. Nigeria
managed just one goal in its last three tuneup games.
	   Of more concern to Milutinovic, though, is a defense that
conceded 12 goals in that span.
	   ``All those goals are not just our goalkeeper's fault,'' the
coach said. ``Everyone is to blame. The whole team let those in.''
	   With defender Jero Shakpore in Italy having his left shoulder
examined by his club doctor, defender Mobi Oparaku had a long spell
at right back Monday.
	   Oparaku, who plays for Belgian club Kapellen, is not on the
official 22-man roster. But teams have until Wednesday to replace
injured players, and Oparaku seems destined to replace Shakpore if
the rising star is ruled out.
	   Shakpore, 19, hurt the shoulder in the first half of Nigeria's
5-1 loss at the Netherlands last week.
	   None of the roster members plays club soccer in Nigeria, and
Milutinovic has not had many chances to work with them since taking
over the team in December.
	   He ran a mostly leisurely, 1 1/2 hour practice at the team's
facility in Resson, a small village 80 kilometers (50 miles) north
of Paris.
	   The final 30 minutes featured an animated half-field scrimmage,
with the Yugoslav coach barking instructions in a mix of English,
French and Spanish.
	   He emphasized positioning and midfield help, areas that have
been disastrous in the Super Eagles' last two outings, the drubbing
at Amsterdam and a 3-0 loss at Yugoslavia.
	   Veteran 'keeper Peter Rufai _ who let in two goals in one half
of play against Netherlands _ worked with the first-team unit
Monday, an indication he will start Saturday's opener against Spain
in Nantes.
	   Rufai plays for Deportivo La Coruna in the Spanish league and
started at the 1994 World Cup, when Nigeria went close to knocking
off eventual finalist Italy in the second round.
	   The team arrived in France Saturday night, and Milutinovic gave
most of his charges the day off Sunday, when only a handful of
reserves and the three 'keepers worked out. The team is set to
practice twice a day until Friday, when it will travel to Nantes by
train.
	   Milutinovic said he expects Kanu to join his teammates in
practice Tuesday.
	   Kanu, 21, has been beset by a series of lingering leg injuries
over the past six months, hampering his comeback from 1996 heart
valve surgery.

Marine released on bail from Japanese jail in high-profile case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. Marine was released on bail from a Japanese
prison Monday after three American congressmen lodged protests last
week with Japan's Ambassador in Washington.
	   Pvt. Rocky Stubbs of Coshocton, Ohio, was handed over to U.S.
military forces on 1.7 million yen (dlrs 12,600) in bail paid by
his family and a lawyer, the Marine Corps said in a statement
released late Monday.
	   Stubbs and Pfc. William Costello of Farmingdale, New Jersey,
have pleaded innocent to charges stemming from fight on March 7 at
a bar near their base on Japan's southernmost island of Okinawa.
	   Costello was released Friday on the same amount of bail.
	   Also Friday, Sens. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Mike
DeWine of Ohio and Rep. Christopher Smith of New Jersey met with
Japanese ambassador Kunihiko Saito to express concern over the
case. The lawmakers were troubled by reports the two Marines were
interrogated for 10 to 12 hours.
	   The congressmen had previously written a joint letter to Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto about the pair's treatment by Japanese
authorities and the prospects for a fair trial.
	   Stubbs has acknowledged striking a local plaintiff in the case
and Costello has admitted head butting, kicking and hitting the
man, but both Marines said they did so in self-defense.
	   Final arguments in the case will be heard on July 6 and the
sentencing has been scheduled for July 22, the Marines said.

	   Jakarta is still clearing away the debris from the May riots
that turned parts of the city into a wasteland of gutted buildings
and burned-out cars and left more than 1000 dead.But the spectre of
mass unrest has not been exorcised by the departure of former
President Suharto, analysts say. And next time, they warn, it could
be even worse.As Indonesia's economy lurches deeper into
depression, an explosive mixture of rising prices, mass
unemployment and worsening poverty is posing an ever-increasing
risk of igniting another wave of rioting and violence.Indonesia's
Central Bureau of Statistics forecasts an economic contraction of
10.1 percent this year and inflation of 80 to 85 percent. If more
unrest breaks out, according to bureau chairman Sugito Suwito,
inflation will hit 100 percent or more.The labour ministry expects
1998 unemployment to reach 15.4 million -- 17.1 percent of
Indonesia's 90 million workforce.
	   Marie Pangestu, an economist at Jakarta's Centre for Strategic
and International Studies, says by the end of the year 58 million
of Indonesia's 200 million population will be living below the
poverty line, compared with 22.5 million before the crisis.And as
the income of the poor is falling, the price of basic foods and
commodities is rocketing.''The food situation is very serious,''
said Thee Kian Wie, senior research associate at Indonesia's Centre
for Economic and Development Studies.''This is not just a problem
for the urban centres, it affects the rural poor also. And of
course, there is a strong connection between increasing poverty and
food shortages and the prospect of further unrest.''A severe
drought has battered this year's rice harvest, while the price of
imported foods like rice, sugar and wheat flour has been catapulted
upwards by the collapse of the currency--the rupiah has plunged
almost 80 percent against the dollar since July.
	   Food scarcity has been worsened by damage to the distribution
network after thousands of ethnic Chinese, who make up the bulk of
Indonesia's traders, fled the country. Food riots broke out in
Indonesia in February and March as the economic crisis began to
bite, and when the government removed fuel subsidies in early May
the North Sumatran capital of Medan was shaken by several days of
fierce rioting.The riots spread to Jakarta when at least four
students were killed during an anti-Suharto protest. The official
human rights commission put the number of dead in the capital at
more than 1,100.Suharto resigned on May 21 but new President B.J.
Habibie faces the task of maintaining control through even worse
hunger and higher inflation. Many analysts doubt his ability to
survive.''You've got high unemployment, the country is on the brink
of hyperinflation and at the same time, at the very apex of the
political system you have a president who is a weak president,''
said Bruce Gale, manager of the Political and Economic Risk
Consultancy in Singapore.''He's not enthusiastically supported by
the army.
	   If there was massive unrest, how long could Habibie
last?''Indonesia had been due to remove subsidies on basic foods on
October 1, one of its promises to the International Monetary Fund
in return for a $41.2 billion bail-out package.But the Medan riots
showed the risks of removing subsidies, and the government says it
has agreed with the IMF that subsidies can stay for the moment and
be phased out more gradually.Given the ruinous state of the
country's public finances and the persistent weakness of the
rupiah, however, the government may find itself unable to cope with
the cost of keeping prices down.And if unrest does explode, the
army may be unable--or unwilling--to prop up Habibie.''The
military, even if it wanted to control the situation, may not be
able to. It's not large relative to the population.
	   As a rule of thumb, they could hold only two urban centres
simultaneously, if you assume massive unrest,'' Gale said.Financial
markets have shown little faith in Habibie's chances of survival.
The punch-drunk rupiah is lying inert below 11,500 to the dollar
and shares have failed to make a significant advance beyond the
lows they hit during the Jakarta riots. Analysts say Jakarta's
markets are paralysed by the fear of more upheaval and unrest.''The
markets are dominated by political uncertainty and I think that
will last at least until we have elections, whenever that may be,''
said David Chang, head of research at Jakarta's Trimegah
Securities. ``You have various groups calling for the removal of
Habibie and his position is not strong. And the poor and unemployed
made up the mobs that rioted in Jakarta. As people get poorer you
could see it happening again.''Warnings of a doomsday scenario of
economic collapse and national disintegration are growing louder.
	   Amien Rais, opposition figurehead and leader of a Moslem group
claiming 28 million members, said last week economic crisis and
political uncertainty could turn multi-ethnic Indonesia into
``another Yugoslavia''.If the country does slide towards anarchy,
the military may seize its chance to take political control.''If
the situation worsens and we see more unrest, Habibie will not
last. What we may have then is a military government,'' Gale said.
``Given the difficulties faced by the country, that may not
necessarily be a bad thing.''

	   US Marshals. Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes and Robert
Downey Jr. Director: Stuart Baird.
	   Snipes has replaced Harrison Ford in the role of the fugitive

	   Downey Jr. is an agent assigned by federal authorities to help
Gerard (Jones) catch the person who murdered his colleagues.
	   Desperate Measures. Cast: Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia.
Director: Barbet Schroeder.
	   In this thriller, Garcia is a widowed cop in San Francisco whose
son is dying of cancer.
	   The child's life could be saved with a marrow transplant.
	   The hitch?
	   The single match is a murderous sociopath (Keaton) who has spent
more than half his life in prison.
	   Keaton conveniently escapes from the operating room just before
surgery starts. Keaton goes loose in the hospital and Garcia gives
chase.

Jolie. Director: Andy Wilson.
	   Eugene Sands (Duchovny), a surgeon who gets hooked on
amphetamines and loses a patient on the operating table, witnesses
a shooting at a disco and saves a man from death.
	   The man happens to be a friend of mobster Raymond Blossom
(Hutton) who decides to use Sands by getting him to play God.
	   Great Expectations. Cast: Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne
Bancroft, Robert De Niro. Director: Alfonso Cuaron.
	   The only ``different'' movie of the lot, it is a rags-to-riches
story telling of society's foolish pretensions.
	   Finn (Hawke), a poor orphan, has a horrifying encounter with an
escaped convict.
	   Years later, with complements of an anonymous benefactor, Finn
goes to New York and becomes an established artist.
	   He thinks his patron is loony recluse Ms. Dinsmoor (Bancroft),
and he dreams of winning her beautiful, icy ward, Estella
(Paltrow).
	   In Money Talk$, Chris Tucker as the scalper-turned-escaped-con
and Charlie Sheen, the TV broadcaster trying hard to save the day
are still driving audiences crazy with laughter and nonsense.

Clinton meets at U.N. to discuss anti-drug efforts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Precede WASHINGTON &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Clinton at UN. &QL; 
 &UR; By SONYA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Armed with plans for a dlrs 2 billion
media campaign to help stanch the flow of drugs across
international borders, President Bill Clinton huddled Monday with
otlivering the opening address at the U.N. General Assembly special
session on drugs before representatives of about 150 countries,
including 35 heads of state and government.
	   In his address, Clinton was announcing a dlrs 2 billion,
five-year media campaign against drugs, targeting young people,
said national security adviser Sandy Berger. Clinton will ask
Congress to provide dlrs 175 million of that money, with the rest
coming from businesses and philanthropic organizations, Berger
said.
	   The money will be used for public service advertisements
spreading anti-drug messages to young people, and a ``virtual
university'' for preventing and treating substance abuse, using the
Internet and other media for discussions on reducing the drug
supply and the demand that feeds it, Berger said.
	   A list of talking points distributed by the White House
indicates a 49 percent drop in overall U.S. drug use in the United
States since 1979 and a 70 percent decrease since 1985. Arguing
that changing young people's attitudes is an urgent matter, the
president also points out plans to launch the media campaign in
July and asks Congress to extend the program until 2002.
	   The focus of the U.N. session is on curbing the laundering of
drug proceeds and reducing demand among drug users. Clinton wants
the world to unite behind a common strategy for fighting both,
White House spokesman Josh Silverman said Sunday.
	   In the talking points released Monday, Clinton pledged a
crackdown on money laundering with other nations that will ``extend
the long arm of the law, as well as the hand of compassion, to
match the global reach of the problem.''
	   That would give Clinton a chance to advance his own proposal for
containing other international threats, such as terrorism, illegal
immigration, trafficking in people and global crime rings that are
a threat to newer, weaker democracies. He made the proposal last
month before the annual summit of the world's eight largest
industrialized nations in Birmingham, England.
	   Among those scheduled to attend the session were Presidents
Jacques Chirac of France, Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Rafael Caldera
of Venezuela, Alberto Fujimori of Peru, Hugo Banzer of Bolivia and
Ernesto Samper of Colombia.
	   In a prepared text of his remarks, Zedillo called for a
``balanced strategy'' to combat drug trafficking ``so that no one
can become the judge of others and no one feels entitled to violate
other countries' laws for the sake of enforcing its own.''
	   This is a clear reference to the controversy over ``Operation
Casablanca,'' a major U.S. money-laundering sting which led to the
arrests month of 42 people _ including about two dozen Mexican
bankers.
	   Zedillo, reflecting the views of most Latin American leaders,
said efforts by consumer countries to reduce demand for drugs
``must be significantly strengthened'' and ``should be seen as a
public health issue'' rather than strictly a law enforcement
problem.
	   The United Nations has estimated that, even with aggressive
interdiction, law enforcement agencies would be able to seize only
about 10 percent of heroin shipments and 30 percent of cocaine
shipments worldwide.

Aidid militia men back in control of Baidoa; at least 130 killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Militiamen loyal to Hussein Mohamed
Aidid were back in control Monday of the strategic town of Baidoa
after a weekend of fighting in which a local militia briefly seized
the upper hand.
	   But Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinle, a spokesman for Rahanwein
Resistance Army, told reporters in Mogadishu the RRA still
controlled the airport in the town 150 kilometers (93 miles)
northwest of Mogadishu.
	   Apparently angered by being pushed out of Baidoa, the RRA
attacked a smaller settlement south of the town and shops and
homes. It took a reinforcement of 200 of Aidid militiamen to end
the looting spree.
	   At least 130 people, mostly civilians, have been killed since
the fighting broke out in the last week of May.
	   Last December, Aidid and 23 other faction leaders agreed to hold
a national reconciliation conference in Baidoa. But the RRA and
others said they would not attend unless Aidid withdrew his
militia, which he has not done.
	   The conference, first scheduled for Feb. 15, has been postponed
three times, the last time indefinitely.
	   Somalia has had no central government since clan-based faction
leaders ousted dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in January 1991, then
turned on each other as the country disintegrated into fiefdoms
protected by private militias.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Somewhere in Tokyo, a place called Graha Indonesia
exhibits and sells sculptures of Irian Jaya's Asmat tribe.
	   A new addition is a counter where visitors can watch videos of
Indonesian television dramas. This is how a production house, PT
Sinema Sejati, is promoting its products overseas.
	   Graha is organized and run by Seichi Okawa, the Tokyo
correspondent of an Indonesian weekly magazine. When he was in
Indonesia two months ago, he visited the office of Sinema Sejati in
Kebayoran, Jakarta.
	   He watched the drama film Penari (Dancer) and a 13-episode
series called Arjuna Mencari Cinta (Arjuna Seeking Love).
	   He said he was prepared to promote and sell the two productions
to NHK TV station or other local networks in Japan.
	   The president director of Sinema Sejati, Kemala Atmojo, welcomed
Okawa's enthusiasm.
	   Sinema Sejati is a relatively new production house in Jakarta.
Founded on March 11, 1997, it has already produced four TV dramas
and one film.
	   Arjuna Mencari Cinta, based on the novel by Yudhistira ANM
Massardi and directed by Sam Sarumpaet, has been purchased by
private television station ANteve and is scheduled to be screened
this month.
	   Three other TV films, Penari,which is based on a short story by
Seno Gumira Ajidarma, Sunyi Nirmala (Nirmala's Loneliness, based on
the novel by Ashadi Siregar) and Dalam Bayangan Ibu (In Mother's
Shadow, based on a short story by Najib Kertapati) are now being
offered to TV studios.
	   By normal standards completing films before knowing who is going
to buy them -- or whether anyone is even interested -- is a
foolhardy approach. This is even more so when the products are not
the usual commercial soap operas.
	   For the 90-minute Penari, for instance, Sinema Sejati spent Rp
125 million.
	   Meanwhile, the only theatrical film made by the production
house, Sri, written and directed by Marselli Sumarno, is now being
mixed and edited for release.
	   Sinema Sejati has met with a mixed welcome. Some say the
production house is too daring.
	   Customarily, a production house offers its scenario first to TV
studios for an agreement before it starts production. This assures
that the film will be bought by a TV station.
	   Sinema Sejati says it has taken this risk to avoid a further
risk -- having to compromise quality for viewers used to a diet of
low-quality soap operas.
	   TV studios are interested only in productions certain to land
hefty ratings, however how deficient it may be in substance and
artistic values.
	   Kemala, explaining his seemingly suicidal policy, ``Sinema
Sejati was founded as a response to the death of the Indonesian
cinema movie''.
	   Profit remains a target, but the most important thing is that it
should be earned by giving something valuable to the viewers,
Kemala said.
	   By watching the productions and educational messages in subtle
packaging, viewers, he added, ``would better know the meaning of
life, of themselves and their environment''.
	   Sinema Sejati's starting capital was Rp 1.5 billion and it has
spent about Rp 3 billion for productions.
	   It is now trying hard to market its product domestically as well
as overseas to seek more capital. It is now listed on the Internet
in the Movie Market Homepage and the New York-based magazine
Variety Catalogues. It also cooperates with moviemaker and
distributor Miramax to sell its products.
	   Another cooperation is with a foreign artist, playwright and
director Jason Moore, for filmmaking in Indonesia and the United
States.
	   By offering serious products depicting social problems, Kemala
is confident that viewers will tend to think rationally and not be
gullible and easily satisfied as is the common assumption.
	   Sinema is adamant about not producing films with storylines
containing mysticism and action, popular ingredients of today's
programs on local TV stations.
	   ``Let them (others) do it, don't ask me to do so,'' Kemala said.
	   But he added that production houses need to play their role in
changing viewers' taste to increase the quality of TV dramas.
	   At least three series are in the pipeline for this idealistic
company: Di Antara Dua Wanita (Between Two Women) by Prasanti in 26
episodes),Midnight Cafe by Seno Gumira Ajidarma and Hati Yang
Berkabut (The Clouded Heart) by Najib Kertapati in 30 episodes.

	   BRATISLAVAr campaigners and neighboring Austria,
	   The plant in Mochovce is just 120 kilometers (72 miles) east of
Austria, which argues that certain features of the heavy water
pressure reactor make it unsafe. Austria is the only country to
have built a nuclear power plant, then voted in 1978 by referendum
against putting it online or having nuclear power.
	   Mochovce is a 440 MW Soviet-designed plant subsequently equipped
with Western technology.
	   Plant spokesman Rastislav Petrech said it received a go-ahead
from the Slovak nuclear authority on Sunday to activate its nuclear
fuel rods after the authority deemed the plant ``met all the safety
and technical conditions.''
	   Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima on Monday condemned the startup
as ``an irresponsible and unfriendly act,'' the Austria Press
Agency reported.
	   In recent weeks, Klima and Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar
have repeatedly discussed concerns over Mochovce.
	   Klima said Meciar broke an agreement by failing to notify him
about the startup of the power plant.

	   AIR Macau will lease one of its three Airbus A-320s to
Portugal's national airline, TAP-Air Portugal, a spokesman for Air
Macau said on Sunday.
	   The spokesman said the lease agreement had been concluded
following two weeks of negotiations between the two airlines.
	   The lease included the aircraft's crew, the spokesman said,
adding the Air Macau plane was scheduled to leave for Lisbon in the
third week of June.
	   The Airbus is to remain with TAP-air Portugal for at least six
months.
	   The spokesman said TAP-Air Portugal would use the Airbus to meet
rising demand in Europe, at a time when air traffic in Asia is
expected to decrease further because of the region's current
financial crisis.
	   Air Macau has a fleet of seven Airbuses. The airline, which
started commercial operations in November 1995, flies to cities in
China, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines.
	   TAP-Air Portugal has a 25 per cent stake in Air Macau. China
National Aviation Corporation holds a 51 per cent stake in Air
Macau. Other shareholders include the Macau government and Stanley
Ho Hung-sun's STDM.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Political and economic reform has been discussed
daily topic for the past five months, but World Cup soccer will
undoubtedly become the number one topic of conversation among
Indonesians for the next 30 days.
	   Eyes will be glued to television sets across the archipelago,
hearts will beat quickly and voices scream in anguish and joy as
the trials and tribulations of the tournament unfold.
	   A number of people, including military personnel and former
political prisoners, shared their opinions on the biggest sporting
event on earth with The Jakarta Post.
	   Muchtar Pakpahan, chairman of the Indonesian Prosperous Labor
Union (SBSI) said soccer was in his blood but doubted if he would
be able to enjoy the sporting extravaganza.
	   ``I'd love to watch the World Cup. My favorite team is Brazil,
or perhaps Germany. But I don't think I'll have time to watch the
tournament on TV,'' he said.
	   He has had a very hectic schedule since his release from prison
on May 25, with up to seven appointments every day.
	   ``Of course, we used to watch everything in prison. I used to
play soccer in high school (in Medan) but I was always a
substitute, never a first-choice player,'' he said.
	   Adang Ruchiyatna, a major general and chairman of the All
Indonesian Soccer Federation's disciplinary commission said: ``I
don't have enough money to go to France so I will watch the World
Cup matches on television if I have time.
	   ``Reform and the World Cup are two different things. As far as I
know reform has nothing to do with the World Cup. Reform is the
most important thing for this country. Nothing can change that.
	   ``Reform has to go on in spite of the World Cup if necessary,
and if reform had required that World Cup television broadcasts be
banned, then our leaders would have taken immediate action to
support that.
	   ``I don't think I will stake any money on the outcome. I never
do that and I don't think I will be able to follow all the matches
closely because I get sudden calls to duty all the time nowadays.
Let's wait and see.
	   ``It's still hard to say who my favorite team is. I usually
watch two or three stages then decide which team I like best. I'm
not a fanatical supporter so I will just support the team that
looks most likely to win,'' he said, sitting on the fence.
	   David, a university student: ``Of course I will watch the World
Cup. I wouldn't dream of missing it, not even for exams. I will
watch every match right from the very beginning.
	   ``I do not see any connection between reform and the World Cup.
After what we've been through, reform should go on no matter what.
	   ``My favorite team is Germany, they have a strong defense but
when they start to attack, it's very calculated. But I also like
Brazil and Argentina.
	   ``I'm willing to put money on the world cup, Rp 50,000 at most.
But, none of my friends are willing to match that.''
	   Dwiki Dharmawan, singer, leader of the Indonesian Fantasy
Orchestra, president director of Kita Music, musical instrument
distribution company said: ``You bet I'm going to watch the World
Cup. I'm counting on Italy, Nigeria and Brazil. I expect the
unexpected from Nigeria. Their performance in the Olympics was
magnificent.
	   ``But then again, Italy and Brazil really are the greatest.
	   ``Reform? I think the World Cup will boost the spirits of reform
activists. It will be a refreshing change for them, because we all
know that reform must go on.
	   ``No, I'm not going to bet big money. Maybe a shaved head or
dinner... you know, small stuff. Just for fun.''
	   Former Minister of Forestry and Plantations Sumahadi: ``I'm not
a big football fan. I'm not very fond of watching 22 men struggle
for a ball. If I stay up all night it will be because I have to
work all night or to watch wayang (Javanese puppets).
	   ``Which team I will be supporting? If you join one of the teams
I will support your team.''
	   Satria Wira, Sari Pan Pacific Marketing Communications Manager:
``I don't think it's exciting watching 22 grown men battling for a
ball. If I was rich man I would buy them each a ball so they
wouldn't need to fight anymore.
	   ``But I think it gives us all a good chance to relax for a while
and forget the crisis.''
	   Abdul Wahab Mokodongan, the Armed Forces spokesman said: ``I
expect the atmosphere in the country will calm down during the
World Cup after months of hectic politicking and the demonstrations
demanding sweeping reform. Everybody will enjoy it, and you
journalists (whose beats are on political affairs) can take a long
rest, can't you?
	   Of course I hope to watch all the matches, although it may cost
me my sleep. I'm not sure which team will emerge victorious.

Lebanon gears up for World Cup with war of flags

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Looking at the multitude of national
flags hanging from buildings and street corners, one would think
that Lebanon is preparing to host an international conference.
	   Not so. It is the World Cup 1998 fever.
	   Lebanon may be nowhere near playing in the tournament that
begins Wednesday, but that hasn't dampned the enthusiasm of
Lebanese soccer fans who are waging a war of flags to root for
their favorite team.
	   The flags mix strangely with pictures of candidates running for
Lebanon's municipal elections, with portraits of solemn-looking
contestants competing for space with the colorful flags of World
Cup participants.
	   Brazil's flags are everywhere, hanging from buildings,
fluttering on street corners, draped on car windshields and
adorning shop fronts. So are the flags of Germany, Italy, France
and Britain.
	   Lebanese fans of all ages seem to be split between Brazil,
winner of four World Cup titles, and three-time champion Germany.
	   ``I have always been a German fan,'' said Fuad Khoueiry, a
grocer whose customers are greeted with a large picture of
Germany's team.
	   ``That's because the Germans, Hitler aside, are the best people
in the world. They are intelligent, hard-working and persevering,''
said the man in his 50s who has never visited Germany.
	   Tony Zoghbi, 28, has a slightly less passionate reason for
putting up the green Brazilian flag outside his home.
	   ``I did it to spite my next-door neighbor, who's a German
fanatic,'' he laughed. ``Plus, the Brazilians are excellent
players,'' he added.
	   The World Cup has also proved to be an opportunity for many to
make money.
	   Street peddlers are selling a range of World Cup accessories _
pirated, of course _ such as flags, T-shirts and caps on street
corners.
	   Some restaurants are scrambling to buy small television sets to
attract _ and keep _ clientele during matches.
	   Sales of small TV sets have reportedly shot up 50 percent in the
runup to the competition. At least a couple of giant screen for
more lavish, open air attractions are being set up.
	   Even during the 1975-90 civil war, the World Cup was a hit in
this soccer-mad nation of 3.2 million. Militiamen stopped shooting
and residents cranked up electrical generators just to watch
matches on TV.
	   Although Arab countries Tunisia, Morocco and Saudi Arabia are
taking part in the 1998 games, they are receiving little support
from fellow Lebanese Arabs.
	   ``In short, many Lebanese are doing to football what they do in
their everyday lives: admire the foreigner and back the winner,''
an editorial in the English-language Daily Star said Monday.
	   What remains to be seen is whether Brazilian flags will be left
in place after the tournament to welcome President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso who arrives here next month.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Despite the economic crisis, the mass media
realize the importance of keeping soccer fans satisfied and are
battling to outdo one another as the World Cup approaches.
	   ``Becoming a soccer maniac is much better than becoming a
looter, isn't it? At least the World Cup with all its charm can
help people forget the daily misery,'' Sumohadi Marsis of Bola
sports tabloid told The Jakarta Post recently.
	   Bola has prepared profiles, previews and features on popular
teams and eagerly anticipated matches.
	   ``As you know, the printed media have struggled this year and we
are in fierce competition with TV.
	   ``TV has a tremendous advantage because it can show matches
live. What we do is try to meet readers other needs, such as in
depth previews of each match. At least this helps people to decide
who to back in bets,'' Sumohadi joked.
	   Bola is sending three members of staff, including Sumohadi, to
France, who will be joined by the tabloids Italian-based
correspondent.
	   Bola has issued 12,000 copies of a special World Cup edition
priced at Rp 35,000. ``All copies have sold out. That is good news
because it will cover our expenses.''
	   For the final, Bola will hold a special show at Hotel Santika
Jakarta hosted by popular actor Rano Karno.
	   Another sports tabloid, GO, has been preparing its 40-page
special edition since June 2.
	   ``We publish every Tuesday and Friday. This week we have
eliminated all other topics and focused on soccer alone,'' Syaibani
of GO said.
	   GO has only sent its managing editor Hardimen Koto to France.
``We have to be thrifty because of the crisis,'' he explained.
	   The ``humble'' coverage given to the World Cup by sports papers
contrasts starkly with the saturation coverage which TV stations
have dished out.
	   Privately owned ANteve will broadcast 13 matches live and will
earn Rp 5 billion in advertising revenues from doing so.
	   ``We have been airing soccer packages since January to welcome
the World Cup. From between now and July we plan to air over 170
hours of soccer related programs,'' Zoraya Perucha of ANteve said.
	   She added a crew of 30 had been allocated to cover the World Cup
between June 10 and July 14.
	   ``We have also sent four people to France: Reva Deddy Utama
(executive producer), Boy Irwan Noya (producer/reporter), Lutfi
Zulkarnaen (editor) and Asdeddy (cameraman),'' she added.
	   ANteve football programs include Kilau Piala Dunia, a World Cup
Journal showing match highlights, and profiles of soccer stars,
coaches and managers from each of the 32 teams.
	   Kilau will be aired Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 10:30 a.m
and between 9:30 p.m and 10 p.m. Among other programs scheduled are
Sensasi Piala Dunia on June 14 from 9:30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m.; Guyon
Piala Dunia, which will present anecdotes from the World Cup on
June 21 from 9:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.
	   ANteve is the leading channel for sports coverage in the
country. It broadcasts matches from the Italian, English, German,
Spanish and Indonesian leagues.
	   Lensa Olahraga and Majalah Olahraga, two sports magazine
programs produced by the station, won the 1997 Panasonic Award for
favorite sports show and the 1997 Asian Television Award for best
sports program respectively.
	   TPI, owned by former president Soeharto's eldest daughter Siti
Hardijanti Rukmana, will broadcast 16 of the 64 matches live.
	   ``We have signed sponsorship deals with tobacco company Djarum,
Lamborghini Cafe and weekly sports tabloid Bola,'' TPI broadcasting
director Ishadi S.K. said last month.
	   ``We also plan to show repeats of six group matches,'' he added.
	   TPI has hired the services of renowned soccer commentator and
former national coach Eddy Sofyan for Rp 50 million (some US$5,000)
for the duration of the tournament.
	   Ishadi refused to disclose the value of advertising deals struck
by the station, or its budget for coverage of the soccer
extravaganza.
	   ``It is unethical to reveal those figures because of the
economic crisis, but we have enough to run the show.''
	   An agreement reached by directors of the country's six TV
stations in April gave TPI exclusive rights to broadcast nine group
matches, one match from the last 16, and one quarterfinal match.
	   The directors also agreed to joint live broadcasts of the
opening match between defending champions Brazil and Scotland on
June 10, the two semifinals on July 8 and 9, the match to decide
third and fourth place on July 12, and the final the following day.
	   To add life to the broadcasts and boost the number of
supporters, TPI will hold live showings in a cafe in Taman Ria
Remaja recreational park in Senayan, Central Jakarta.
	   ``We want people to enjoy the show, express their feelings and
scream their lungs out if they want to,'' Ishadi said.
	   Visitors to the Cafe will receive T-shirts bearing the World Cup
logo provided by the embassies of countries who qualified for the
tournament.
	   RCTI, the longest established private station in the country,
has plans to air 15 live matches, and has attracted advertising
worth Rp 4 billion.
	   Rayana Djaka Surya and Andi Darussalam have been sent by the
station from their base in Italy to Paris along with former
national team captain Ronny Pattinasarani.
	   Eduard Depari, RCTI public relations manager, said the country's
six television stations would share the Rp 10 billion fee for
airing live coverage of the World Cup.
	   RCTI sports producer Andi Chairil said the station had also
arranged live showings for low-income people in 300 regencies
across the country.
	   ``We all plan to watch the live broadcast with soccer fans in
cafes or hotels,'' Andi said, adding that RCTI had prepared mobile
broadcasting facilities for the event.
	   ``I'll guarantee you it will be an awesome show,'' he said.
	   SCTV is also planning special programs and will broadcast the
opening and closing ceremonies live from France.
	   The station will air 15 matches live and show five repeats.
``Our show may not be as glamorous as the other TV stations, but we
will provide lots of games and quizzes,'' Budi Darmawan, public
relations manager of SCTV said.
	   Radio stations are also holding various quiz programs, including
Prambors Rasisonia, Kiss FM, Mustang, Sonora, Female, Trijaya, ARH
and university station Radio MS Tri.
	   ``It's better to join the soccer mania than sitting around
wondering what this country is going to be like,'' Vanda, a radio
broadcaster, said in between singing ``Here we go...Allez, Allez,''
	   ``It's an anthem, isn't it? People on the street are singing it.
Come on, lift your hands up high!'' she said with a smile and a
swirl of her hips.

	   NEW T&AMP;T Hong Kong, the telecom subsidiary of the Wharf Group,
has been so successful it has become a victim of its own success,
says New T&AMP;T president Leslie Harris.
	   New T&AMP;T's launch three years ago introduced competition into
Hong Kong's fixed network telecommunications market as part of the
de-regulation of the local telecommunications industry.
	   Since then the company's share of telephone lines previously
registered with Hong Kong Telecom (it switched to a new operator
while retaining its original number) has seen a staggering rise.
	   In July 1996, New T&AMP;T had a 39 per cent share of these lines
with the rest being distributed among the other fixed telephone
network operators.
	   By February this year it had grown to an 85 per cent market
share, a performance the company attributes in part to the
organisation's aggressive advertising campaign of its International
Direct Dialing (IDD) services.
	   Mr Harris admits the New T&AMP;T's ``in your face'' advertising
campaign has been successful, too successful perhaps.
	   Market research conducted by the company show that many telecom
users think of New T&AMP;T as primarily an IDD provider.
	   The company now needs to raise consumers' perceptions to boost
its image as a $2 billion telecom network investor, Mr Harris said.
	   New T&AMP;T wants its blue-chip customer base to recognise the
firm's image with its contract to supply high-speed data links to
HongkongBank and global conferencing.
	   ``We are famous for not being a shy kind of company. We tend to
be pretty much in your face with our kind of marketing,'' Mr Harris
says. Part of that success was the clever acquisition of one of the
most memorable numbers in the world for the company's code to
access the international telecommunication services, 007.
	   By not participating in the draw for the 008 number, the company
picked up a number it hoped would be a licence for making a killing
in Hong Kong's telecommunications market.
	   ``We were particularly successful with IDD 007,'' said Mr
Harris.
	   ``We continue to ride on the back of that success and it has
been our major promotional vehicle. It's also probably the most
memorable number in the world,'' he said.
	   ``On the other hand, so powerful was our marketing and
advertising of it, that people forgot there was this new company
called New T&AMP;T that was building the best network in Hong Kong,''
Mr Harris said.
	   Such unabashed modesty is difficult to challenge in a man at the
helm of a company that since its launch, has achieved enviable
success within Hong Kong's burgeoning newly-deregulated
telecommunications market.
	   Being part of the Wharf Group, New T&AMP;T can benefit from the
synergy it creates with Wharf Cable, Hong Kong's exclusive cable
television provider.
	   ``Technology has now brought cable telephony into existence so
instead of us having to build a telecom network to pass 600,000
homes, we can access the homes that Wharf Cable have and utilise
their expertise and resources,'' said Mr Harris.
	   ``We've been waiting for technologies to come along so we can
realise the opportunity for our investments much more
cost-effectively,'' he said.
	   The company has grown steadily in its short history and has
reached a point where it's time to take a more measured approach
towards its future business strategy, Mr Harris said.
	   ``Managing growth is a very difficult thing because the
temptation is that as you're growing, you keep piling in the
resources in a relatively unthinking way,'' he said.
	   ``When you cease to be a small company which you can direct
personally and you've become a large company with more complex
structures, you have to take a deep breath and work out how to
convert your company into something that is more measured,'' he
said.
	   Mr Harris says the regional crisis has speeded up this process.
	   ``We have reached that point earlier because of the changed
climate in Hong Kong. Normally we might have let the company rip
for another year before we started to refer to issues that we had
put aside for future attention,'' he said.
	   ``We are now beginning to work the measures and ratios to see
how we can improve our business by making it more inherently
efficient, rather than just putting more bodies against the
problem.'' The company's transition to a large organisation, coming
as it does in the middle of the region's downturn, calls for a
review of company and staff structures and adopting ``efficiency''
as the watchword.
	   ``We are ensuring we maximise the output of our workforce to
make it as efficient as we can,'' Mr Harris said.
	   ``That means looking at our structures to see if any are getting
in the way. Now that we've become a big company, we can no longer
do some of the things we used to. We are trying to remain dynamic
because it would be easy for operations to become
institutionalised,'' he said.
	   Mr Harris said employees have expectations and when the concept
of change is introduced people start to put little fences around
their turf.
	   The key to the company's success comes from adopting classic
market entry strategies and remaining focused on its core product,
Mr Harris added.
	   ``We're not like the other companies, we don't have any
distractions. We don't have a mobile licence, we don't have paging,
we just focus on the fixed network service and what that brings,''
he said.
	   ``We are focused on being a fixed line operator bringing all the
benefits to customers that we can through that technology. There
are approximately 350,000 in Hong Kong and they were the neglected
underclass of the market,'' he said.
	   ``It wasn't a sector of the market the monopoly (Hongkong
Telecom) tended to bother with until there was competition. These
businesses are feeling very happy at the moment because we started
addressing them,'' he said.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Can't get to France but desperate to celebrate
this year's World Cup soccer fiesta in true style? Look no further,
help is at hand. Hotels and cafes throughout the country are ready
to take part in the soccer fun by offering special facilities to
entertain their guests in a World Cup atmosphere.
	   Hotels and cafes in Jakarta are looking to lure soccer zealots
by presenting live soccer matches on giant screens, and are
decorating their buildings and their employees in the World Cup
spirit.
	   Some Jakarta cafes will stay open until dawn to allow diehard
guests watch every soccer match live.
	   Champions Cafe in Kemang Raya, South Jakarta will remain open
until 5 a.m every day from June 10 through July 13.
	   ``As one of the well-known sports restaurants in Jakarta,
Champions is holding events with the theme of Champions France '98.
This will show that even in a time of monetary crisis, we are still
committed to our theme as a sports cafe,'' Dede Yanti, Champion's
public relations manager said.
	   Dede told The Jakarta Post that guests would be able to watch
games on five large screens and 17 other televisions.
	   ``We will ensure that our guests experience the real World Cup
atmosphere,'' she said, adding that her cafe would also record some
of the best games on video so patrons could watch the games they
missed.
	   Champions is also arranging games such as score contests, table
soccer and World Cup pool, Dede said.
	   Front Row Sports and Grill, another sports cafe located in Taman
Ria Senayan, South Jakarta plans to remain open until 4 a.m. during
the World Cup.
	   ``We plan to hold a soccer quiz and lucky draws and will offer
special menus from midnight to 4 a.m. We will invite some
well-known soccer commentators to guide fans through the semifinal
and final games,'' Front Row marketing coordinator Ignatia Evina
said.
	   Planet Hollywood Jakarta will also invite soccer commentators,
athletes and celebrities to watch the games with guests at their
grand opening and final night of the soccer fiesta.
	   ``We also plan a World Cup fashion show here,'' Planet Hollywood
public relations manager Esther Lolita said.
	   Esther said her restaurant was cooperating with several sponsors
to hold a contest on the games with a grand prize consisting of
round trip tickets to England and tickets to English Soccer League
matches.
	   Hard Rock Cafe Jakarta will remain open for longer hours during
the grand final but will operate as usual during the rest of the
one-month tournament.
	   ``We're only focussing a little bit on the World Cup because we
want to keep our image as a music cafe,'' Teges Prita Soraya, the
cafe's public relations manager, said.
	   Nevertheless, Hard Rock Cafe is offering souvenirs such as
T-shirts, mugs and posters featuring the faces of several top
soccer players, including Paulo Maldini and Alessandro Del Pierro
of Italy, Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo of Brazil, Davor Suker of
Croatia and Paul Ince of England.
	   World Cup mania can also be seen cropping up in hotels. There is
a giant goal post and a replica of the Eiffel Tower currently set
up in the lobby of the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza on Jl. Gatot
Subroto.
	   Hendra Nugraha, Holiday Inn's public relations assistant
manager, said the hotel is working with several companies,
including Air France and Coca-Cola, for its World Cup festivities
and will hold a contest on who will be the this year's champion.
	   ``The winner will be entitled to two airline tickets to France
and tickets for Euro Disney'' in France, Hendra said.
	   The hotel has prepared its three restaurants to entertain soccer
maniacs 24 hours a day, and is dressing its employees in soccer
uniforms.
	   A World Cup flavor will be added to its new menu with top
players named with various entrees, such as Brazilian ``Ronaldo''
Style Beef Flamenco, or Baked Salmon of Zinedine Zidane, Hendra
said.
	   Mercure Rekso Hayam Wuruk will feature the final match of the
tournament live on a 20-square-meter screen in its Rekso Grhadika
Ballroom, which will be transformed into a giant soccer stadium.
	   Mirna A. Basalamah, public relations manager of Mercure Rekso,
said the hotel's management was very enthusiastic over the games --
most of its expatriate staff being French.
	   ``Our management thinks that (the occasion) is a good
opportunity for us to restore our guests' confidence in the
security of the Hayam Wuruk area which declined in the recent
riots,'' Mirna told the Post.
	   The hotel is on Jl. Hayam Wuruk, West Jakarta, one of the areas
hit worst by the riots last month.
	   Mirna said the hotel was also holding a drawing with various
prizes, including a free room in the hotel and a vacation in Bali.
	   The hotel has also provided four different room package deals
named after the four seeded teams -- Argentina, Germany, France and
Brazil.
	   ``But we won't hold a scoring contest for our guests. They can
arrange that themselves. Besides, it is already known that people
in this area are usually very fond of such contests,'' she said.
	   Sheraton Bandara, located near the Soekarno-Hatta Airport, will
feature ``Soccer Mania'' in its Someone Else's Fun Pub, which has
two big screen TVs to watch the soccer games. Each drink will come
with a free glass of beer.
	   The Regent in Kuningan, South Jakarta, and Hotel Sari Pan
Pacific on Jl. M.H. Thamrin, Central Jakarta will also provide
special menus for the whole 33-day period besides a giant TV
screen.
	   Other cities
	   The Sheraton Surabaya in East Java will show soccer games in
Bongo's Fun Club, which will be open from 5 p.m to 2 a.m. However,
for the final match the pub will remain open until the game
finishes.
	   The Hyatt Regency Bandung in West Java will feature every live
World Cup match on big screen TV from 10 p.m. and has invited the
well-known comedy group Project P to join the audience during the
finals.
	   The Grand Bali Beach in Sanur and the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel in
Nusa Dua said they would not have any special World Cup programs.
	   ``We don't think it is necessary ... especially at a time when
tourist arrivals are low,'' Komang Yudara, the Grand Bali public
relations officer said.
	   The public relations manager of Le Meridien Nirwana Golf and Spa
Resort in Tabanan, Lisa Halim, said the hotel would send out a
regular bulletin to guests and local communities with the latest
updates on the games.
	   ``We will create an atmosphere almost as exciting as the Paris
Stadium itself here in the Mondial Cafe at the Nautilus Fun Club,''
she promised.
	   ``Our staff will be dressing up as soccer players and there will
be special World Cup menus with food and drinks from the countries
playing that day.''
	   Lisa added that Le Meridien would also offer a special program
for wives not interested in the games left stranded by their
husbands as each match kicks off. The program will consist of
beauty and health treatments, spas and shopping.
	   The main representatives of the host country here, the French
Cultural Center (CCF) and the French Embassy, are not having
special programs.
	   CCF's public relations officer Aji Yahuti said CCF and the
embassy had already held their World Cup program early this year
for students.
	   ``Many French people had to return home after the riots last
month,'' Aji said.

Reports: Loyalist troops in Guinea-Bissau fight off coup attempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with about 30 reported dead, comments from U.S.
embassy spokesman

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Troops loyal to the government were
Monday involved in heavy fighting in the capital of Guinea Bissau,
West Africa, as they tried to crush a coup attempt led by a former
chief of the armed forces, according to reports.
	   Heavily-armed troops were attempting to dislodge renegade
soldiers from military installations about 16 kilometers (10 miles)
outside Bissau on the road to the airport, the Portuguese state-run
news agency Lusa reported in a dispatch monitored here.
	   An unknown number of rebels were holed up at the two separate
military bases _ a military barracks and an arms depot _ in the
suburb of Bra after clashing with loyalist troops on Sunday,
according to Lusa.
	   The bases are next to the Russian embassy where staff were
observing the fighting from the roof, a U.S. embassy spokesman said
in a telephone interview.
	   Bryan Hunt said automatic weapons, rocket-propeled grenades and
mortars were being used in the clashes. However, the Russian
embassy staff were unable to identify the two sides, nor could they
say how many were fighting on the rebel side.
	   ``They can't tell who's who. They're all wearing the same
uniforms,'' Hunt said.
	   A reporter for Guinea-Bissau national radio, interviewed by
Lisbon radio TSF, said he counted about 30 bodies scattered around
the two bases.
	   Hunt said gunfire from automatic weapons and small arms could
also be heard in downtown areas.
	   ``We firmly believe that this is a coup d'etat,'' Hunt said.
	   Representatives at peace corps projects around the country
reported that everything was quiet in their areas, according to
Hunt.
	   There are about 100 U.S. citizens in the country, including
government officials, businessmen and tourists.
	   Reports said troops set up roadblocks on routes to the
presidential palace and other government buildings and military
installations.
	   The rebels took refuge at the Bra installations after sporadic
clashes which began early Sunday at the military high command
building.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira said Sunday that former armed
forces chief Brig. Ansumane Mane was leading the revolt and was
backed by members of political opposition parties.
	   In a statement read on public radio, Vieira vowed to ``use all
possible means'' to quash the revolt.
	   Mane was fired six months ago during an official investigation
into the trafficking of arms to the separatist rebels of Casamanca,
a Senegalese province that borders north Guinea-Bissau.
	   Mane formally stepped down and was replaced at a ceremony in
Bissau last Saturday.
	   Guinea Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, has a population of
about 1 million.

Beirut votes for religious harmony; Amal and Hezbollah split
</HEADLINE>
Shiites &QL; 
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Muslims and Christians endorsed religious
harmony in Beirut and militant Shiite Muslims made major inroads in
south Lebanon in municipal elections held after a break of 35
years, preliminary results showed Monday.
	   With Beirut having shifted to a Sunni Muslim majority city since
the last elections, many feared only Muslim candidates would win in
Sunday's vote, driving Christians out of local politics in
Lebanon's largest city.
	   But a half-Christian, half-Muslim ticket backed by Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri swept to victory for the 24-member city
council, the results showed.
	   Hariri and other moderate Sunnis campaigned feverishly to urge a
Muslim vote for Christians so that the delicate sectarian balance
could be maintained in the city, as it is in senior government
posts in this country of 18 religious sects.
	   Hariri told the leading newspaper An-Nahar overnight that
national consensus has been preserved, showing the Lebanese have
``abandoned the logic of war and upheld democracy.''
	   In the south, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah that is the major
guerrilla group fighting Israel scored major gains, chipping away
at the power base of the pro-Syrian Amal faction of Parliament
Speaker Nabih Berri.
	   Berri, in a news conference Monday, maintained that Amal alone
stood up against a coalition of Shiite militants, Communists,
leftist nationalists and traditional right-wing politicians.
	   He estimated that Amal won 51 of 75 wholly Shiite towns, tied
with Hezbollah in five others and took control of 22 mixed
Christian-Shiite towns. The prize win for Amal was in the southern
city of Tyre.
	   Preliminary results estimated Hezbollah won 18 municipalities, a
further signal that it has succeeded in transforming itself from a
guerrilla force into a populist movement.
	   Berri confirmed the Hezbollah gains, including the capture of
the teeming market town of Nabatiyeh.
	   Municipal elections have not been held since 1963 because the
1975-90 sectarian civil war and the political tensions that led to
and followed the conflict.
	   Local elections have been held in various parts of the country
for the past two weeks and another round will be held next Sunday.
Official results from Beirut and the south were still not available
since vote counting is manual.
	   Not all were happy with the Beirut outcome. The leftist As-Safir
newspaper on Monday criticized the sectarian character of the
Beirut election campaign.
	   ``It is difficult to speak about democracy in the light of
dominating religious slogans and sectarian fever,'' As-Safir
publisher Talal Salman said in a front-page editorial.
	   ``This is Lebanon after civil war,'' he wrote, adding ``it is
difficult to build a nation'' based on such sectarian feelings.

	   ``Have I lost my good looks, San?'' Katil was trying to close
his mouth tightly. The feeling of loss and sadness was apparent.
	   Santi just smiled, or more precisely she was smiling thinly, not
unlike Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa.
	   ``What has handsomeness to do with a full set of teeth?'' She
prised her husband's lips open to confirm the absence of some front
teeth.
	   Katil parried her move and hurried to the mirror. He displayed
his teeth, grimacing slightly.
	   Santi shook her head before she approached. She was plump and
moved slowly. She checked the back of the mirror and said, ``Uda,
why do you believe so much in mirrors?''
	   ``What do you mean?''
	   ``This mirror is a cheat, Uda!'' hissed Santi while showing her
neat row of teeth.
	   ``A cheat?'' Katil frowned trying to guess where his wife's
words were heading. She was a lecturer in philosophy.
	   ``A big cheat. The mirror shows us that our right side is on the
left and the other way around. A mirror distorts facts!''
	   ``So, what looks ugly in the mirror, is not necessarily bad
according to you, a lecturer in philosophy?'' Katil was trying to
understand his wife. He was trying to understand while being
sarcastic -- it was his trait as an activist.
	   Santi did not want to respond to his insinuation. ``Uda, you
must know why I just checked the back of the mirror.''
	   ``You behaved like a macaque,'' Katil laughed infectiously.
``Only a macaque has the habit of checking the back of a mirror
before looking at it!'' He could not hide the empty space between
his front teeth any longer, for the sake of responding to his own
joke.
	   ``The macaque's behavior is not a joke, Uda!'' Santi said, her
mouth closing firmly before she added, ``It teaches us that anyone
looking at the mirror must remember to check behind the mirror. We
should not believe only in what is in front of us, we should know
what is behind our backs!''
	   Katil smiled shyly. He had not expected his discussion on teeth
to move on to mirrors and the philosophy of the macaque's behavior.
He bowed his head and pressed the cemented floor with his toes. He
walked unsteadily to the living room where the discussion had
started.
	   Santi followed in triumph. But her elation only lasted until she
sat down. She asked, ``You didn't throw your teeth away, did you?''
Santi swallowed, suddenly remembering their depleted savings due to
the cost of replacing her husband's two front teeth knocked out by
a vendor selling cendol (a cold drink with rice-flour droplets).
The vendor was angered because Katil said that he had not boiled
the water for the cendol.
	   ``I didn't throw them away, but ...''
	   ``But lost them unintentionally?''
	   ``No.''
	   ``So?''
	   ``Hmm ...''
	   ``Uda, have you forgotten that the two front teeth are made of
gold?'' Santi reminded him. ``You once took me along to
Bukittinggi. Unintentionally you left me at the Aur Kuning
terminal.''
	   ``I did not forget you that time, San.'' Katil said in earnest,
noting that Santi hadn't forgot last year's incident. ``I was
somewhat annoyed because you chatted so long with your college
friend, hmm, what was her name again?''
	   ``Lely!'' Santi snapped. Such a tone would always come up if
Katil, a literature graduate, started to weave sentences into a
paragraph of arguments.
	   Usually Katil showed indifference. This time was no different.
``Ah, Lely!'' He snapped his fingers. ``Considering your gossip
might be lengthy, I just went straight to Kapeh Panji, to attend a
meeting on the es mambo (popsicles) epidemic hitting the Tigo Baleh
region.''
	   Santi looked her husband in the eyes. Again she smiled thinly
when she saw the sincerity in her beloved husband's eyes seemingly
resting on his pointed nose. It was this love that made her
seemingly indifferent to the lack of money she received from Katil.
He was now virtually dedicated to his non-government organization
activities, practically neglecting personal economic needs.
	   Katil responded with a smile before saying, ``Besides, you knew
that we were heading to Kapeh Panji. And ...''
	   ``Enough!'' said Santi. If he got his way, Katil would continue
harping with a fluency that resembled his hour-long speeches in
front of the public to convey the importance of one of his NGO
programs. ``Now I want to hear your sincere explanation, Uda, where
are the two gold teeth?''
	   Katil raised his head and frowned. He said in a distinct voice,
``I have donated them to the village head. I hope the donation will
induce the wealthy in our village to also donate gold. When the
gold has been collected, it will be further channeled to the
relevant agencies to help the country overcome the increasingly
permanent monetary crisis ... ``
	   ``Stop!'' Santi pressed her index finger against her husband's
lips. ``You did that because you really wanted to 'show your
teeth'? Were you sincere or was there some kind of protest
implied?''
	   ``What do you mean?'' Katil always succeeded in involving people
in an argument.
	   ``I'm quite sure you perfectly understand what I mean. I may not
understand you if later on you will represent our village to carry
the gold collected ... ``
	   ``As one of the representatives of thousands of villages in the
whole country, to present the gold collected from the villages, to
the authorities in charge, ...'' Katil cut in, continuing the train
of his wife's thoughts. Only, his skill in composing sentences
weakened somewhat. Perhaps because -- ``However ...''
	   ``Yes!'' Santi cut in. ``However, how many grams of pure gold
can be collected from a village? Besides, we live in a less
developed area.'' Santi cleared her throat on seeing her husband
shake his head. ``And if each village sent a representative, what
about his travel expenses? Wouldn't the costs exceed the value of
the donations?'' She saw that her husband had shifted his attention
to a program on their black-and-white TV.
	   ``Why does our country have more and more ceremonies?'' Katil,
feeling cornered, changed the topic of conversation. He willed his
wife's concentration on to the TV program.
	   ``In my opinion, one of the functions of a ceremony is 'to show
one's teeth'. But the teeth are no more! Whatever the situation --
``
	   Before Santi could say, ``Ugh!'' Katil coughed loudly.
	   Santi held her hand to her chest in disappointment. She diverted
her annoyance by switching off the television.

	   Bangladesh is launching its first utility project of renewable
energy with a 62 kw photovoltaic pilot project under final stages
of implementation by the Rural Electrification Board (REB). The
utility will meet energy demands of rural markets, homes and
livestocks in Karimpur and Nazarpur unions of Sadar Thana of
Narsingdi district. The pilot project covers an area of 29 square
kilometres with 8500 households of 21 villages.The REB has already
undertaken planning in the expectation of World Bank funding to
initiate, on completion of the pilot project, two more projects in
Astagram of Kishoreganj district and Shingra of Natore district.
	   The World Bank may provide US $ 5 million for the new projects
from its Global Environment Fund, for which socio-economic survey
and commercial feasibility study are already under preparation. An
expansion in the immediate neighbourhood of the Photovoltaic Pilot
Project of Narsingdi Sadar Thana is also envisaged, to include 5000
consumers of Alokbali and Chardighaldi unions of the thana. French
grant provided the foreign currency requirement of the pilot
project, and further French funding is also expected for its
expansion. Commercial energisation of the project started in
August, 1996. At the current stage, the project is expected to
provide electricity to 1000 different categories of consumers, and
the tariff has been designed in a way that will generate enough
revenue to cover the one-time investment in appliances and their
long-term maintenance.
	   Solar energy as the cleanliest energy with daily recharges from
nature is no doubt most desirable. But for rural users of
electricity, tariff commensurate with initial costs of installation
of photovoltaic charging stations or units including electronic
controls may still be discouraging. Research to bring down those
costs is essential if renewable energy is meant to benefit the
poorest sections of the people. Lower consumer density also may
render such utilities less cost-effective by systems losses and
costs in extended lines of supply. Individual home units are
therefore the answer if the one-time installation costs could be
significantly reduced.

Popular journalist freed of slander charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A prominent independent journalist was
freed Monday of slander charges filed by an alleged Bosnian warlord
currently standing trial.
	   The alleged warlord, Mladen Naletilic, accused Davor Butkovic, a
former senior editor at the weekly Globus, of slander in an article
describing him as ``a most notorious warlord.''
	   Naletilic, also known by his nom de guerre of Tuta, is thought
to have been a major criminal figure in Mostar, behind crooked
police and politicians who wanted to keep the Bosnian city firmly
split between Muslims and Croats in order to maintain their
political and economic power.
	   During the Bosnian war, he headed the so-called ``Convicts'
Brigade,'' which has been accused of some of the most brutal
massacres of Muslims.
	   A district court judge, Goran B. Hersak, declared Butkovic
innocent, specifying that the reporter was only referring to
Naletilic in the way he had created himself in the public's eyes.
	   Naletilic, 50, has been in custody since his arrest last year on
charges of abduction, assault and battery, inciting murder and
aiding and abetting crime.
	   He has spent most of the time in the jail's hospital ward,
suffering from tuberculosis, and faces 20 years in prison if
convicted.
	   However, his trial has hardly budged, with witnesses unwilling
to appear and testify against him, reportedly fearing reprisals.
	   Naletilic said he had already filed 20 similar lawsuits against
other Croatian papers, adding that he would do the same against
foreign agencies and publishers.

	   JAKARTA (JP): In his book Komik Indonesia, the French researcher
Marcel Bonneff writes that every comic within the silat (a form of
martial arts) genre shares a common thread.
	   The hero travels through four stages during the story. The first
is the ``scorned'' stage, at the beginning of the tale, which
provides the reason why the hero embarks on a search for wisdom and
skill.
	   Here, the hero might experience a tragic episode -- i.e. the
hero's family is murdered or kidnapped -- so the character is
virtually disenfranchised. Or a friend might betray the hero so he
becomes an outcast of society. The hero might also be a coward,
afraid of danger.
	   Next comes the ``maturing'' stage where the hero seeks wisdom
and skill as a way of preparing for revenge or to overcome his
fear. This stage is followed by the ``responsibility'' stage. Here,
the hero would feel responsible to assist the society, where the
weak are oppressed by the strong, the good by the evil. Finally, in
the last stage, good wins over evil.
	   Even though Bonneff applied this common thread only to martial
arts comics, it could be used for much more.
	   It is evident in martial art movies, such as the Drunken Master
and American Ninja series. We can see it in TV series, such as
Renegade and the A-Team.
	   It is even there in fantasy fictions like in the Belgariad and
Mallorean series by Davis Eddings. To cite a far out example, we
have no other than George Lucas' masterpiece Star Wars, The
Trilogy.
	   Star Wars is an unlikely example to compare to Indonesian silat
comics. Who would think that a science fiction story could have
something in common with silat? However, the thread Bonneff
delineated for silat comics also applies to Star Wars. All four
stages occur in the trilogy.
	   Star Wars starts out with the hero, Luke Skywalker, discovering
that his father was a Jedi knight and that he was killed by Darth
Vader.
	   Later on he comes home only to find that his uncle and aunt were
murdered by the Empire. This is the ``scorned'' stage. Luke finds
that he no longer has a reason to stay on Tatooine, the planet
where he grew up, so that he agrees to go with Obi-Wan Kenobi to
answer to a distress call sent by Princess Leia (although he also
wants to rescue the princess because he actually had fallen in love
with her).
	   During his journey to rescue Princess Leia, Obi-Wan instructs
him on the arts of the Jedi, on how to use the Force. This can be
seen as the maturing stage.
	   After they managed to rescue the Princess, Luke feels the
responsibility to help the Rebel Alliance to fight the Empire, so
he joins the fleet on a mission to destroy the Death Star. This is
the responsibility stage.
	   At the end of Star Wars, Luke managed to blow up the generator
which then destroyed the Death Star. The Light force wins over the
Dark force; good wins over evil.
	   The thread continues in the next two parts of the trilogy.
	   In Star Wars, Luke was in the scorned stage. In the next
episode, The Empire Strikes Back, Luke was in the maturing stage,
where he learned the art of the Jedi from Master Yoda.
	   In the Return of the Jedi, he moved on to the responsibility
stage, where he once again helped the Rebel Alliance on a mission
to destroy the second, even bigger Death Star.
	   He also felt responsible to convert Darth Vader, whom he
discovered was actually his father, from the dark side back to the
light.
	   In the end, he faced the dark side by confronting Darth Vader
himself, the ultimate meeting between light and dark. Luke
succeeded in getting his father back to the light side and,
ultimately, light wins over dark.
	   Apparently, perhaps without being fully aware of it, Bonneff
described the guidelines of the classical heroic story. This is not
to say that Bonneff invented the guidelines, but he formulated the
ingredients which makes a heroic tale heroic.

	   The Teacher-Student Centre, Dhaka University thronged with
nearly 1100 ladies and gentlemen as the first convention of the DU
Alumni Association was inaugurated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
last Saturday. The PM in her speech stressed the foundation of a
sound higher education system like that which led to Dhaka
University acquiring its reputation as the Oxford of the East'. She
expressed the belief that such a mode of study depended on the kind
of family values that enabled peace to reign at home. Here the
teacher's role is vital in the forging of a society where talented
individuals bring the nation to the forefront in the international
arena.
	   Many of the elderly students (a few in their 80s and even 90s)
from the golden days of Dhaka University shared their memories
during the alumni reunion. The oldest alumni, a 96-year-old
professor, who had been among the poorest when a student, announced
the donating of all his property to the old alma mater now that he
was a rich man. This is a step worthy of emulation by others in
their own way to help the university regain its glory. A general
consensus was that an end should be put to student politics with
the cooperation of all political parties. If students concentrated
on their studies as in the former days of academic eminence, there
could be stimulating debates and enlightening seminars. Students
would also be able to engage in informal discussions on the campus
relating there subject to everyday life.
	   At that time libraries were also extensively used and papers
prepared diligently by many a student. No wonder in those days
after taking the Master's degree one did not have to go through two
years of preliminary studies abroad preparatory to enrolment for
Ph.D. Today students, as a general rule, have to even take a
language test and, on that basis, a language course in English
before taking up their studies in the foreign university. Muscle
power counted for naught then, it was the meritorious who
flourished with scholarships to inspire them in endeavouring to
attain further heights of academic brilliance.

Portuguese traffic fatality rate, still worst in Europe, falls
</HEADLINE>
slightly &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Tough new traffic laws have lowered the
number of highway accidents and fatalities in Portugal, but the
country still has the worst road death record in the European
Union, Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said Monday.
	   ``Portugal has a particularly tragic history in road accidents,
which in 1997 killed five times more people than the number of
homicides,'' Guterres told an international road safety conference.
	   However, Portugal is succeeding in changing attitudes and
driving habits, Guterres said.
	   The new highway code, which introduced higher fines for traffic
violations, took effect in March.
	   During April and May, the total number of road deaths fell by 20
percent and accidents causing injuries dropped by 30 percent,
Guterres reported. Detailed figures were not available.
	   The EU statistical agency Eurostat reported last week that per
one million inhabitants, 217 people died on Portuguese roads in
1995, the last year for which European figures were available.
	   The second-worst country was Greece, with 195 per million.
	   Guterres said that efforts were underway to correct road danger
spots, especially poor sign posting and badly-designed junctions.
	   Sixteen people were killed and 316 injured in 594 accidents over
the weekend in Portugal.
	   Meanwhile, 56 people were killed in vehicular accidents from
Friday through Sunday in neighboring Spain, which has five times
the population of Portugal. The figure compared with an average of
20 weekend fatalities so far this year.

	   A UAE national who has fathered 46 children has advised his
fellow countrymen to eat fish instead of taking Viagra (for
reinforcing virility). The story of this highly fecund male and his
prescription for attaining his level of fertility was reported by
Reuters quoting the daily Emirates News. The 48-year-old UAE
national, Ahmed Rashid bin Abaud, said he has sired 23 sons and 23
daughters by eight wives and that one of these eight wives has
given birth to 17 children. His slogan is Eat fish and more fish'.
	   Five of his wives have been divorced and the remaining three
live with him. As four wives at a time is permissible, Abaud has
place for one more which, hopefully, will soon be filled. The
habitual bridegroom is looking for a teenager not only to become
his latest consort but also to bear children leading to further
augmentation in the number of his offspring. May this fish eater's
family increase further and further.
	   What wonders fish can do!From this it is possible to deduce that
in an overpopulated country like ours fish cannot be the ideal
food. But fish has been our natural food, eaten from traditional
habit rather than from the compulsion of enhancing potency. If fish
is an aphrodisiac, that is an added benefit, hitherto unrecognised.
Bengalis need no encouragement to eat fish which is their favourite
food. But in view of the newly revealed magical properties of fish,
the slogan in their case should be ``Eat fish but not without
contraception.''

strongman Gen. Sani Abacha's residence and office in Nigeria's
capital Monday.
	   No visitors, except the top military brass, were permitted to
enter the secluded leader's compound amid growing reports on the
state of Abacha's health.

Four foreigners arrested in connection with bombings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EVA KEKES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Two Russians, a German and an Israeli
were taken into custody in connection with bombings that have
rocked Hungary in recent years, senior police officers said Monday.
	   The foreigners were arrested after police raided three houses
around the capital Wednesday and found a laboratory and several
warehouses set up to produce explosives, Laszlo Forgacs, the
national police chief, told reporters.
	   ``This was the first case that police found a laboratory to
produce explosive devices and we hope that this will help us solve
several such attacks,'' police Brig. Gen. Enroe Kiss said.
	   Officers searching the houses found more than 10 kilograms (22
pounds) of explosives, 42 kilograms (92 pounds) of chemicals that
can be used to manufacture explosives and several M25 and M75
Yugoslav-made hand grenades.
	   ``According to preliminary investigation, these materials and
devices are similar to the ones used in several bombing attacks,''
Kiss said.
	   Officials also discovered almost 1 ton of paper that could be
used to print money.
	   Since 1991, the country has seen 111 bombings, killing five
people. Of that number, 38 explosions were attributed to hand
grenades, 36 to bombs, 18 to Molotov cocktails, and the rest were
caused by makeshift devices, such as fire extinguishers, Kiss said.
	   The bombings have largely been associated with battles between
domestic and foreign gangs, including trafficking in drugs and
women. In most cases, victims were from rival gang.
	   The detained foreigners were all in Hungary with valid papers,
and all had legal businesses in the country.
	   Officials refused to release information about the suspects, but
did say one of the Russians is a woman.

	   THE Securities and Futures Commission's (SFC) spat with Morgan
Stanley Asia Ltd (MASL) over its reprimand of the American
investment bank's failure to disclose information in connection
with an injection of assets into China Everbright IHD-Pacific, has
again raised questions over its effectiveness.
	   The SFC accused Morgan Stanley of failing to inform the
investing public that Everbright expected to receive approval from
Beijing authorities for its acquisition of a stake in Everbright
Bank of China.
	   ``It (Morgan Stanley) had not fulfilled its regulatory
responsibility to ensure the public was told this information,''
the SFC said.
	   Immediately after the SFC's reprimand, Morgan Stanley
counter-attacked with a denial that it had violated any regulatory
guidelines saying it had made all the proper disclosures.
	   This was quickly followed by an even stronger attack from the
SFC who admitted they had been taken completely by surprise by
Moragn Stanley's response.
	   According to Mark Dickens, the SFC's executive director of
enforcement, the wording of the initial reprimand had been
carefully negotiated with the company prior to its release.
	   ``Ours (reprimand) would not have been as sweet as it was had we
had any forewarning of their action,'' he said.
	   The apparent nonchalance with which Morgan Stanley rebuked the
SFC's reprimand clearly implies a perception in the industry that
the regulator has a bark that is worse than its bite.
	   Analysts are asking how effective a regulator can be if it has
to engage in a tit-for-tat war of words every time it reprimands an
industry rule breaker.
	   A spokesman for the SFC admitted this was the third time it had
reprimanded Morgan Stanley.
	   ``It received its first about two to three years ago,'' a
spokesman said.
	   ``It received the second in April 1996 for inadequate audit
trials for its brokerage operations.'' Perhaps more importantly,
the latest reprimand comes at a time when the SFC has come under
fire for allowing a number of brokerages to use clients shares
without their knowledge.
	   And even when the SFC does exercise its regulatory powers it
seem this is still not enough of a deterrent.
	   Forluxe Securities director James Mui Kwong-nok had his licence
suspended for five days and was fined $20,000 for illegally using
client's shares the year before he left Hong Kong.
	   Forluxe collapsed and police received over 270 complaints from
clients involving $47 million.
	   Many within the industry are asking whether the SFC has got its
priorities right.
	   The spectacular collapse of Peregrine Investment Holdings, a
company many bankers believe has misled the investing public, has
so far escaped the reach of the SFC's investigative arm.
	   Hopefully the announcement that Peregrine's liquidators are
pursuing $23 billion in assets, a figure far higher than previous
estimates, may provoke some kind of response.
	   According to an SFC source, the public should ``watch this
space'', a statement as ominous as it is vague.
	   The SFC said that since Morgan Stanley acted as an adviser to
Everbright in a $1.9 billion capital raising exercise last June, it
should have disclosed more information about pending mainland
acquisitions at a time when red-chip fever was most intense.
	   Morgan Stanley says it feared any more positive statements could
be interpreted as being falsely optimistic about the deal's
prospects and be seen as an effort to talk up the share price.

Bumbling apartheid scientist describes poisoned umbrellas,
</HEADLINE>
screwdrivers &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ An apartheid-government scientist
testified Monday how he made poisoned umbrellas and screwdrivers
that could kill enemies of white rule, and how his bumbling almost
cost him his own life.
	   Dr. Jan Lourens said the umbrellas, walking sticks and
screwdrivers outfitted with concealed needles were made at the
request of apartheid-era security forces, but that he did not know
if they were ever used to kill anyone.
	   At one point during his testimony before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, Lourens described taking vials of poison
to a contact in Britain, known only as ``Trevor.''
	   ``It is rather like a James Bond movie,'' commented Truth
Commission member Dumisa Ntsebeza.
	   ``Unfortunately,'' replied the tall, bespectacled Lourens.
	   However as Lourens told of the encounter, he appeared to have
been more of an Inspector Clouseau.
	   Lourens described accidentally spilling the poison on his hand
as he demonstrated one of the needle units in a cottage near Ascot,
just outside London.
	   ``I don't know how it happened, but I wiped my mouth and I lost
consciousness very quickly,'' Lourens recounted.
	   He said he survived because when he awoke, he staggered to a
bathroom and drank antiseptic until he vomited.
	   Lourens testified to sending equipment to an army research
laboratory for fertility experiments on baboons. He said he had
suspected experiments were being carried out to discover ways of
reducing birth rates among black women.
	   Reports that such research was conducted has surfaced in recent
years, although there is no indication the research ever escalated
into actual attempts to reduce fertility among blacks.
	   Earlier Monday, the Truth Commission turned down a government
request to hold the hearings behind closed doors.
	   The ruling African National Congress, which ended apartheid by
winning all-race elections in 1994, believes some of the
information should not be revealed in public for fear of spreading
dangerous technologies.
	   However, Truth Commission chairman Desmond Tutu rejected the
request, saying potentially sensitive documents had already been
withdrawn from the public hearings.
	   The Truth Commission was set up by President Nelson Mandela in
1995 to probe apartheid-era human rights abuses and promote racial
healing.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The government will sell all state-owned
inter-city bus routes to private companies next month, the public
sector minister, Atef Obeid, said Monday.
	   The Middle East News Agency quoted Obeid as saying that
state-owned shipping companies will also be sold soon. He gave no
figures for the imminent sales, which are part of Egypt's
7-year-old privatization program to reform the economy.
	   Since 1991, the government has sold to private hands more than
300 state-owned factories, hotels and department stores.
	   Egypt's parliament approved last March the sale of 20 percent of
a government-owned telecommunications company. The government also
put up for sale 30 percent stakes in a company that will take over
the state-run cellular telephone network.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Investments increased 53.9 percent to 131
million dinars (dlrs 184.5 million) in the first half of this year
compared with the same period in 1997, an official said Monday.
	   The rise was due to ``professional servicing, attractiveness and
transparency'' offered by Jordanian investment bills, Muntasser
Oqlah, director general of the semi-independent Investment
Promotion Corp., said.
	   Jordanian laws provide investors with incentives such as tax
exemption and export guarantees and offer foreigners equal rights.
	   Oqlah told The Associated Press that 68 projects in various
sectors benefited from the investments between January and June
this year.
	   In addition to Jordanians, Americans, Canadians, Europeans and
Gulf Arabs invested, he said. He declined to provide a breakdown.
	   Of the total money invested this year, 37 percent was spent in
the hotel sector, 25 percent on industrial projects, 19 percent on
hospitals, 10 percent on transportation and nine percent on

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A group of 28 Jordanian businessmen headed
for Iraq on Monday to explore ways to increase trade.
	   The group, headed by former Trade and Industry Minister Bassam
Saket, comprises leading industrialists and members of the
Jordanian Exporters Association.
	   ``We want to probe the needs of the Iraqi market and discuss
increased trade exchange in the future,'' Saket told The Associated
Press before embarking on the 12-hour overland trip to Baghdad.
	   He said the group will meet with Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh and other senior officials as well as private sector
businessmen during its four-day visit.
	   Trade with Iraq is set at dlrs 220 million annually, or 25
percent the volume of exchange between the two neighbors before
Baghdad came under sweeping U.N. sanctions in 1990 for its invasion
of Kuwait.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's net international reserves climbed
to dlrs 20.1 billion in March from dlrs 20 billion in February, the
Central Bank of Egypt said Monday.
	   Egypt's reserves in March 1997 were dlrs 19.5 billion
	   Before March, the country's foreign exchange reserves had
declined every month since September 1997 with the exception of
January.
	   The decline in reserves followed the Nov. 17 massacre of
tourists in Luxor, which hit receipts from tourism, while revenues
from petroleum exports also came under pressure as a result of a
sharp fall in international oil prices.

Diplomats ordered to vacate residences in Minsk

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarusian authorities ordered diplomats
from 22 countries to vacate their homes for repairs, and tried
Monday to weld shut a gate to the American residence, U.S.
Ambassador Daniel Speckhard said.
	   The government served notice in April that it wanted to overhaul
water and sewage pipes in the post-World War II-era complex on the
outskirts of the Belarusian capital, Minsk, Speckhard said at a
news conference.
	   Speckhard took reporters to the ambassador's residence in the
diplomatic complex at Drozdy and arrived to find two workers and a
policeman trying to weld shut the side gate. A small American flag
was lying on the ground. The workers left when Speckhard protested.
	   The ambassador said the government received a diplomatic note
from the Foreign Affairs Ministry that it planned to start the
repairs Wednesday, the day his parents are scheduled to arrive for
a visit. The note said the repairs cannot begin until the
residences are empty.
	   He said the United States has occupied the residence since 1992,
the year after Belarus gained independence with the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and has since then spent dlrs 800,000 on repairs.
	   Under international law, ambassador's residences are considered
foreign territory and governments have no right to enter them
without permission or insist that diplomats leave against their
will.
	   He appealed to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to
rescind the order.
	   ``I am hopeful that this press conference today will help to
inform the president of the situation in case he has not been
receiving the right information from his bureaucracy,'' Speckhard
said.
	   ``I think it very important that the government of Belarus sends
some different signals today or tomorrow on this issue.''
	   The Belarusian Foreign Ministry told the Interfax news agency it
proposed that diplomats move either to new buildings in central
Minsk or begin building new accommodations near Minsk.

Thousands of miners protested throughout Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Almost 20,000 miners throughout the
country protested Monday against the government's failure to reform
the mining system and demanded more help for another 95,000
colleagues who have been laid off.
	   ``The situation is explosive,'' Marin Condescu, the leader of
the Miners Unions Confederation, told to the Associated Press.
	   Miners traditionally were among the best-paid workers in
Romania. Since Communism fell in 1989, radical miners twice
rampaged through Bucharest, violently attacking opponents and
causing the downfall of one premier, Petre Roman.
	   Last summer, the center-right reform government began a massive
program of layoffs, perhaps the biggest in the history of European
mining. Initially, miners were happy to accept payoffs, but now
seem to be realizing their lives have not improved.
	   Miners from five regions marched through local cities shouting
anti-government slogans and submitted lists with their requests to
local authorities.
	   ``We want to work, not to beg!'', ``We voted you but you
betrayed us!''' shouted miners in one town, Targu Jiu in the Jiu
valley area.
	   Inefficient and loss-making state-run companies are currently
being shut down by the reformist government.
	   Some 108 mines will be closed soon, endangering the jobs of many
of the remaining 110,000 miners, Condescu said.
	   The protesters demanded the government compensate miners being
laid off by providing low interest bank loans and land to set up
small farms.
	   They also wanted increased investment for the country's coal,
gold, silver and copper mines.
	   Almost 100,000 miners have been laid off since September 1997 in
a scheme in which the government gives them up to 20 months'
salaries.
	   Miners' groups say the most of the miners have spent this money
and only 10,000 found new jobs.

	   Trafficking in humans are in the news again. This time six women
and a minor girl have been returned from Pakistan. They are now
staying at Prashanti' a home for rehabilitation and shelter for
women and children run by the Bangladesh National Women Lawyers'
Association. All of these women were taken to Pakistan via India,
and sold to persons for sexual exploitation. Such is the present
situation that the BNWLA officials are hesitant about handing them
over to their guardians, who themselves have been compliant in
handing over their dependents to these traffickers against
pecuniary gain. It is also reported that these rescued women are
among the one hundred or so women taken away to India, Pakistan or
even the Middle East for purposes of sexual abuse.
	   Next to what benefits the poor, perhaps the most controversial
problem with which any modern society must contend is that of
migration. In practical terms, this is the movement of people from
the less to the more advantaged countries. The worst kind of such
movement is the trafficking of women and children for the purposes
of physical and sexual exploitation. While overt forms of slavery
have gradually been erased from almost all countries of the world,
the new form of forced sexual labour seem to be on the rise. Even
countries only marginally above Bangladesh on the economic scale
seem to attract the victims of the racketeers in women. As the
modern economy develops, it comes increasingly to rely on immigrant
labour from abroad.
	   Without this labour supply, there would be grave economic
disorientation, even disaster. Yet there is a strong current of
thought that deeply deplores immigration, is deeply resentful of
migrants and campaigns ardently against their entry and continued
presence. There are today no industrially advanced country, Japan
being the exception, on which the question of migration does not
obtrude as a major political issue. In the case of Bangladesh, we
find the issue of illegal migrants to India and Malaysia, a prickly
political issue for the countries concerned as manifest in the
actions of push-backs' and incarceration. Yet the traffickers of
women seem to have a hold on the law enforcing personnel of India
and Pakistan to avoid arrest and deportation.
	   Despite the obvious resistance of governments and peoples to
migration, particularly, such types of illegal migration leading to
sex trafficking, the rewards must be very high to allow such a
traffic to continue quite unabated. In the Western world we have
seen the increase of women trafficking through the new mafia that
has grown up since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. And it
is now quite possible to come across women belonging to countries
of the former Soviet Union, sustaining themselves in the resorts
and entertainment centres of the developed world, and even in
Bangkok and Manila which have a large Western clientele. In a
similar manner and strategies the underworld in South Asia are
managing to supply sex workers from among the least privileged. The
real tragedy lies, as it does in all contraband dealings including
sex, the street level partners in crime get the least of the
payoffs, which accrue mainly to the underworld bosses.
	   In the latest case of the six Bangladeshi women, they were
probably paid a pittance aside from food and shelter. In the long
run, they would have been much better off at home. However, that
should in no way imply that they are willing participants in this
trafficking, but it also underscores the difficulties of women to
seek and receive justice within the social and legal structures of
South Asia. The example of the East European women indicate that in
some cases there is willing compliance and complicity. But in the
case of the South Asian regions, it is the absence of effective
mechanisms of redress that prevent the victims from breaking out of
their involuntary incarceration for the purposes of sexual abuse.So
much for the dialectics of the phenomenon. What are the mechanisms
of redress? Some of the problems to be encountered in finding
remedial solutions are related to population pressures.
	   Poverty, which is inversely related to population, encourages
the trend of taking shortcuts to augment income whether such
shortcuts are legal and moral or not. And the more the population
growth the less grows the moral pressures to adhere to legal means.
Enter the tempter, in the form of the go-between who suggests to
the woman herself or her guardians, a substantial improvement in
present earnings by the apparently innocent employment in domestic
service with a much enhanced pay. Added to this is the pecuniary
enticement offered to the guardians, in many cases a parent or a
husband. Once the deal is completed and the woman handed over, it
is very difficult to trace her in the multitudes of people in the
urban areas where she is mostly taken, before being transported
across borders. The operation of border transfer is also difficult
to trace with shortage of border patrols and the realities of
corruption amongst a section of the law enforcing agencies.
	   But solving the problem of the population and stricter border
controls are not possible in the short term. In that case the only
solution is accelerated community awareness, resistance, and
effective remedies developed by the communities. Both rural and
urban communities have to be educated in the mechanics of resisting
the allure of illegal employment abroad, and the prospect of
windfall incomes. The persons who do offer such inducements have to
be identified. By now we are quite aware of such famous gangland
figures. In smaller village communities and urban communities
lesser figures of criminal repute can be identified if the effort
is taken. If these people are identified and the law enforcement
authorities kept informed on a regular basis, even corrupt cops
have to do something about the continuing clamour for action
against these criminals. The government departments of Social
Welfare and Women's and Children's Affairs have to have field level
staff responsible for creating awareness about the mechanisms of
illegal trafficking and the resistance to it, amongst the people in
their command areas.
	   Simultaneously organisations such as the Bangladesh National
Women Lawyers' Association have to be encouraged by both the
government, and the donor agencies aiding NGOs, to take effective
steps in preventing trafficking as well as rescuing the victims of
trafficking. Relevant agencies within the SAARC umbrella have to be
activated to combat this problem within the SAARC countries, which
will effectively show the way to techniques applicable to other
destinations such as the Middle East, or Myanmar and thence to
Bangkok. Also this should be treated at par with the political
issues involved in migrations of other types, legal or illegal. No
country really enumerates the numbers engaged in sex trade as it is
a twilight zone, sometimes literally, of labour employment. Neither
tax, nor labour, nor police authorities know for sure the numbers
of such workers within their areas of responsibility. It is
therefore time that the new techniques of information technology
were harnessed to this end.
	   The public and political actions proposed in outline in this
article are in keeping with the controlling forces of the good
society, and consistent with them there is much to be urged, much
to be done. The accommodation to past historical trends can be
improved, made more compassionate. This will bring about a better
life for the more vulnerable elements in our society, a majority of
whom are the poor women in rural areas. We must henceforth consider
in all earnestness how the future can be made safer and better for
them.

	   ABUSE of foreign earnings deductions could and should have been
specifically targeted by anti-avoidance measures rather than a
withdrawal which penalises many thousands of genuine
short-to-medium term British resident expatriates.
	   Most multi-national employers recognise that an expatriate
assignment requires a package of incentives, and this often
includes a guaranteed level of net pay for the duration of the
assignment.
	   Wherever an employee is seconded to a lower tax jurisdiction,
the abolition of the foreign earnings deduction will increase the
overall payroll costs for employers. What the British government
does not seem to realise is that expatriation is far from being a
holiday.
	   If the Government's rationale was correct, it is hard to see why
any incentives subsidised by the general body of taxpayers should
remain, such as the foreign earnings deduction for seafarers.
	   There will be many situations in which the United Kingdom
resident expatriate will be able to claim relief under a double
taxation treaty to avoid what would otherwise be double taxation on
the same income.
	   But the mechanics of this do not exactly help the cash flow of
expatriates and, in some cases, it is necessary to pay tax in two
countries and recover in the appropriate jurisdiction by making a
treaty claim after the event.
	   Multi-national employers will find themselves picking up the
cost of this in some situations where the foreign earnings
deduction would have prevented the situation from arising.
	   Many expatriates will continue to ``escape'' UK income tax on
their income through a period of non-residence covering a tax year.
	   The Finance Bill makes it clear expatriates who were relying on
foreign earnings deduction can do so for emoluments attributable to
the period to 16 March.
	   But it is clear that the Bill aims to catch schemes put in place
afterwards and is designed to cover attributed additional income to
the period covered by the foreign earnings deduction. However,
there is still time for a change of heart before it becomes an Act.

Rain on last day forces a draw at Edgbaston
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Stewart and Cronje
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Rain spoiled any chance of a result
in the first cricket test between England and South Africa at
Edgbaston on Monday.
	   Play was abandoned due to persistent rain, resulting in a draw
and preventing what should have been the most eventful day of the
five-day match.
	   Both teams went into the last day with high hopes of a win but
England got nowhere with its overnight 170 for eight, as the wicket
square remained under cover until the match was abandoned.
	   England enjoyed an overall lead of 289 going into the final day.
	   Umpires David Shepherd and Russell Tiffin finally called off
play at 2.20pm local time (13:20 GMT), the cut-off time for a
rain-affected last day. Both captains _ Alec Stewart and Hansie
Cronje _ consented.
	   ``We were the better of the two sides,'' Stewart said later.
``We dominated the game despite losing the toss.''
	   It was only the fourth time a day's play mark before being
bowled out for 343.
	   The test also marked the return of Dominic Cork after a chronic
hip injury kept him out of the England side.
	   Cork took 5-93 to keep the South African first innings under
check until Rhodes came to the rescue with a fighting 95.
	   Stewart, who took over from Atherton, praised the former
skipper's 103 and said: ``He showed a lot of character, and has
shown us what he's capable of.''
	   ``This match has given us the confidence we need for a hard and
tough series like this,'' he added.
	   Cronje felt his strike bowlers were short of a ``good rhythm''
going into the game, and it will be an area the visitors will be
working on in the 10 days before the second test at Lord's.
	   ``What we need is contribution from the top order and a good
rhythm from our medium pacemen,'' Cronje said.
	   He said both Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock were world class
bowlers and it was too early to write them off after one test.
	   South Africa failed to make use of a good toss it won when
England finished the first day losing just one wicket.
	   ``That was the key to the match,'' Cronje said. ``We let go of
the opportunity.''

	   The world population is expected to double by the end of this
century when the total is likely to exceed six billion from 5.5
billion (1992). It is predicted to reach about 10 billion by 2050.
Over the next 35 years, population density in Bangladesh will more
than double from 860 per sq. km. to 1755. Thus when in 1988-89
fiscal the food grain import was twenty-four lakh metric tons, this
seemed to the World Bank more than the requirement. The World Bank
advised not to import any further food grains but to concentrate on
the grow more food' programme by giving the farmers incentive
prices. The key to the food problem is thus to give the farmers
incentive prices, gear up internal procurement programme during the
harvesting season and create lesser demand by gearing up a tight
population programme supported by concerted plans in all the
educational institutions. By 2010 Bangladesh must produce at least
30 million tons of cereals to maintain self-sufficiency provided a
tight population programme is adhered to.
	   Tight population programme is certainly a detailed sterilisation
programme supported by free abortion facilities in each Hospital
and Thana Health Complex. Otherwise the success of the population
so far achieved is likely to rebound as most of the clientele are
illiterate, poor and live in the rural areas. Let there be a debate
over this without wasting any more time. It is said about the
Untied States, the surplus food country,: ``Debate within the
United States on population control might have ended in the 1970s
when birth rates plunged below zero population growth levels.
However, the Supreme Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade and Doe v.
Bolton (1973) ignited new controversy over abortion, and of course
the abortion issue is closely related to population control...
Abortion clinics are developing rapidly in large cities and it was
predicted that within a few years the number of abortions will rise
to 30 to 50 percent of the number of live births.
	   The Supreme Court held that the fetus is not a ``person'' within
the meaning of the Constitution and therefore not entitled to life
under ``due process of law''. Women, however, are guaranteed the
``liberty'' to control their own bodies, that is, to have abortions
at least in the first six months of pregnancy with limited
interference by the states''. Abortions or no abortions but
sterilisation, there must be a systematic and programmed way.
Vigorous efforts are therefore needed by all irrespective of
political affiliations, castes, and cultures now and for years to
come. South Korea's baby boom crowded nurseries and schools during
the 1960s and 1970s. The increasing number of babies later flooded
the labour market in the 1970s and 1980s and the industrial boom
made the family planners to apprehend that the sudden slowdown of
the population growth rate might result in labour shortages as the
population start ageing. But the present economic austerity and
labour retrenchment shows that South Korea's population planning
was justified.
	   There is a similarity between South Korea's baby boom and that
of our experience. Before 1960 the typical South Korean woman used
to bear as many as six children, similar to a typical Bangladeshi
woman. The US experience is different in that the average American
woman's fertility was far below this. Still then, the US women
adopted harsher family planning practices. In South Korea also
fertility declined with remarkable speed. Even then, contraception
and abortions are common. Abortions are about equal to the number
of live births. The South Korean women are averaging fewer births
than in either the US or Japan.'' About 43 per cent of women are
already working in South Korea as child bearing responsibilities
are declining. Population, food and famine are thus a world-wide
phenomenon and concern. A cable sent by Clement Attlee to President
Truman on January 3, 1946 is still relevant.
	   Mr. Attlee told the President that there was a deficit of seven
million tons of food grains between available supply and demand.
``It is our view that unless the maximum quantities that can be
spared are exported from all the producing countries there is a
grave danger of wide famine in Asia and Europe''. Such threats have
now extended to Africa as well. Britain also put greater emphasis
on her population programmes in right earnest and made considerable
changes to the 1971 Abortion Act. Termination of pregnancies was
made available under the National Health Services. Even then the
Area Health Authorities pressed for further and better services in
the 1970s. They urged that ``there should be greater provision for
abortion within the NHS''. The health authorities pointed out that
termination of unwanted pregnancies would make a lot of savings on
the cost of confinements, delivery and after-care alone.
	   In any case the sight of poor women begging for alms while
hugging her new-born baby or women surrounded by small kids cooking
food beside the vacant land along the footpath or parks is common
in the streets. Whenever a visitor goes to the rural areas he is
almost overtaken by the onrush of youngsters, many of whom are not
well cared for and most of whom do not go to school. It is time
that the rich and the upper middle class section of our society
agreed to tighten their belts and were ready to pay more price for
one kg of food grains so that the very poor can be fed at a cheaper
rate and are also ready to abide by the family planning norms, so
that the farmers can get incentive prices for growing more food
grains. Half our population is under 15. About 3 per cent are 65 or
over. The condition of our demographically advanced neighbours is
also not better. Thus they can help us marginally. The US and
Europe can help us but how long? Hence we are to be ready to help
ourselves. Otherwise social discontent at mass level will soon
overtake us thereby undoing all the good deeds of successive
generations.

Rebels abduct at least 10 students in bus ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels abducted at least 10 students when
they attacked a passenger bus near a major garrison town in
northern Uganda, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Fourteen people later died of their wounds and 25 others were
hospitalized after the June 1 ambush near Kitgum, about 300
kilometers (185 miles) north of Kampala, said the government-owned
New Vision newspaper.
	   A police officer, who spoke on condition he was not identified
further, told the newspaper among the dead were students and
soldiers.
	   He said some of the people who fled into the bush might have
also been captured by the Lord's Resistance Army.
	   The rebels, who say they want to oust President Yoweri
Museveni's government, have terrorized northern Uganda for 11
years.
	   Uganda accuses Sudan, its northern neighbor, of arming and
giving refuge to the rebels, who are led by Joseph Kony. Sudan
denies the charge and in turn accuses Uganda of helping rebels in
southern Sudan.
	   The rebels routinely abduct school children. The boys are given
military training and the girls are often distributed among Kony's
fighters as ``wives.''
	   The government has been attempting to secure the release of 21
girls kidnapped by the LRA from a Catholic school in northern
Uganda in February 1997. They turned over 42 Sudanese prisoners of
war to Khartoum and expected to get the girls in return, but the
deal fell through.

	   BEFORE you buy a flat, you shop around to find the one you want.
You plan and save for a down payment. You compare prices and shop
for the best financing and start saving your money.
	   You do the same when you plan a vacation. You pick a
destination, find out how much the trip costs, who offers the best
value and service, and start saving.
	   Saving for retirement requires similar planning.
	   To retire in the lifestyle you want you need to know what it
costs to live the way you want, how much you need to do that, and
then start saving accordingly.
	   If you want to retire in a grand style (in a big flat, taking
exotic vacations and golfing weekends), you'll need to save far
more than if you plan to retire quietly, taking care of
grandchildren and doing yoga.
	   There are other factors that affect how much you need to save
for retirement. How many working years do you have left? What is
your current salary and your spending habits? What rate of return
are you earning on your investments? What is the inflation rate?
The more working years you have before retirement, the less you
need to save now.
	   A 25-year-old with 30 or more years to save needs to save less
now than does a 50-year-old as he has a lot more time to put money
away.
	   On the other hand, the more the 25-year-old puts away now, and
earns interest on, the greater savings and better lifestyle he will
have when he retires. So don't think because you're young you only
need to save a small amount.
	   The more money you make and the more luxurious your current
lifestyle, the more money you probably will want for retirement.
	   When you are used to receiving big pay checks and living a good
life, you expect to live well even after you stop working.
	   Many doctors, lawyers, senior company executives and other
well-paid professionals save a lot every year for retirement
because they are keen on living comfortably, if not luxuriously,
after they retire. Lucky for them, their good salary makes it
easier to save more! By comparison, less well-paid workers may be
saving less for retirement, partly because they don't have as much
money to set aside once they have paid their living expenses.
	   Secondly, with a modest current lifestyle, they might not expect
to live grandly after they retire.
	   Studies in the US have shown retirees generally need 80 per cent
of their pre-retirement income to live the same lifestyle that they
were used to before retirement. They need less because they no
longer have the same work-related expenses such as transportation,
work clothes, dining out, and socialising.
	   If you are paying a mortgage and expect to own your flat at
retirement, you may need to save a smaller percentage of your
pre-retirement income since you will not need to pay rent.
	   On the other hand, if you expect to rent your flat at
retirement, you need to secure a higher percentage of
pre-retirement income for your years in retirement.
	   The earlier you start to save, the sooner you achieve your
retirement income goal for the same amount of principal.
	   The higher the return your investments generate, the more you
can save. And interest compounds at a surprising speed! You will
need to save more in an environment of high inflation.
	   Once you decide how much you need to save to retire in the
lifestyle that you want, you might start thinking about investing
your money in a way that will best preserve its value in the long
run.

Reports: Loyalist troops in Guinea-Bissau fight off coup attempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with about 30 reported dead, comments from U.S.
embassy spokesman. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Troops loyal to the government were
Monday involved in heavy fighting in the capital of Guinea Bissau,
West Africa, where they tried to crush a coup attempt led by a
former chief of the armed forces, according to reports.
	   Heavily armed troops were attempting to dislodge renegade
soldiers from military installations about 16 kilometers (10 miles)
outside Bissau on the road to the airport, the Portuguese state-run
news agency Lusa reported in a dispatch monitored here.
	   An unknown number of rebels were holed up at the two separate
military bases _ a military barracks and an arms depot _ in the
suburb of Bra after clashing Sunday with loyalist troops, according
to Lusa.
	   The bases are next to the Russian embassy where staff were
observing the fighting from the roof, a U.S. embassy spokesman said
in a telephone interview.
	   Bryan Hunt said automatic weapons, rocket-propeled grenades and
mortars were being used in the clashes. However, the Russian
embassy staff were unable to identify the two sides, nor could they
say how many were fighting on the rebel side.
	   ``They can't tell who's who. They're all wearing the same
uniforms,'' Hunt said.
	   A reporter for Guinea-Bissau national radio, interviewed by
Lisbon radio TSF, said he counted about 30 bodies scattered around
the two bases.
	   Hunt said gunfire from automatic weapons and small arms could
also be heard in downtown areas.
	   ``We firmly believe that this is a coup d'etat,'' Hunt said.
	   Representatives at peace corps projects around the country
reported that everything was quiet in their areas, according to
Hunt.
	   Reports said troops set up roadblocks on routes to the
presidential palace and other government buildings and military
installations.
	   The rebels took refuge at the Bra installations after sporadic
clashes which began early Sunday at the military high command
building.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira said Sunday that former armed
forces chief Brig. Ansumane Mane was leading the revolt and was
backed by members of political opposition parties.
	   In a statement read on public radio, Vieira vowed to ``use all
possible means'' to quash the revolt.
	   Mane was fired six months ago during an official investigation
into the trafficking of arms to the separatist rebels of Casamanca,
a Senegalese province that borders north Guinea-Bissau.
	   Mane formally stepped down and was replaced at a ceremony in
Bissau last Saturday.
	   Guinea Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, has a population of
about 1 million.

	   The entire country has been sizzling with an unprecedented heat
spell. Temperature on the average was around 40 degree Celsius in
the last week of May. Occasional shower for the last couple of days
along with a relatively cool breeze has cooled the situation to a
bearable position. There has been report of deaths due to
heat-stroke. Incidentally all the deaths have been reported from
the northern part of the country which usually experience
relatively much more hotter summer than the other parts of the
country. Seven deaths have been reported from Kurigram district due
to heat-stroke.Knowing about all these deaths, the consequence of
heat spell and subsequent heat-stroke, one is tempted to know more
about heat-stroke, the identifying features, prevention and
management of heat-stroke.
	   Heat-stroke may then be scrutinised and information may be
disseminated to all so that people could combat heat-stroke
resulting from abnormal heat spell or heat wave.There are as many
as 14 disorders resulting from exposure to heat have been
recognised, the most serious one is being heat-stroke.Heat-stroke
is attributed to the failure of the heat relating mechanism.
Characteristic features are the rise of body temperature to a big
height, for example, even up to 110 F., profound disturbance
including convulsions and partial or complete loss of
consciousness. The skin becomes dry and hot. Death is often sudden
and may be due to hyperpotassemia.Hyperpotassemia may be due to
release of potassium from red blood cells which have been injured
by heat.
	   Treatment of heat-stroke patients is rapidly cooling the body in
ice-water-baths till the rectal temperature falls below 103 F.
Temperature should be monitored (rectally) every 10 minutes and
active cooling be stopped when the temperature is between 102 F and
101 F. Patients should be kept in bed for a few days until the
temperature control becomes stable. Though there are two other
clinical condition resulting from exposure to high temperature -
heat exhaustion (heat collapse or heat prostration) and heat cramp,
the most serious consequence of exposure to high temperature is
heat-stroke. The fatality rate is about 40 per cent if the
temperature rises around 110F and 80 per cent or more if the
temperature rises above 110F.
	   Now let's try to know how to beat the heat or prevent the
effects of high temperature. The harmful effect of exposure to high
temperatures may be avoided by certain preventive measures. The
most important measure is to replace the water and salt which have
been lost from the body through sweat. The best method is to drink
abundant quantities of water containing about 0.1 per cent sodium
chloride. People working or living in high temperatures losing 5 to
8 litres of fluid per day require about 15 gms of salt per day.
Normal intake of salt with food is about 10 gms per day. So an
additional 5 gms per day is recommended during unusual hot days
along with at least 5 litres of water.
	   Another method of reducing the incidence of heat during unusual
hot spell is to reduce the amount of physical work and the duration
of exposure to hot environments. Strenuous exertion in a very hot
environment, inadequately ventilated space, or heavy and insulating
clothing should be avoided. Loss of fluid and electrolytes (often
imperceptible in very hot and dry air) should be replaced by intake
of oral fluids slightly salty to taste (i.e. near isotonic).
Sometimes exertion in a hot environment cannot be avoided. Every
effort should then be made to replace the lost fluid and salt and
to keep the skin temperature cool by evaporation.

	   It is a popular fad in the sub-continent to compare our
performance vis-a-vis South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong or Malaysia
and produce a dismal note by declaring that we have lagged behind
miserably though we started from a similar position in the early
sixties. Implicit in the declaration is the assumption that we
could do at least as well as these countries if we took all steps
in the right direction and in right time. I have studied the
statement carefully and have come to the conclusion that at least
in the context of Bangladesh the statement is not wholly true. It
is a self-disparaging statement which ignores our achievements and
magnifies the failures. An inter-temporal comparison of development
indicators across the countries leads me to conclude that
Bangladesh is a late-starter rather than a laggard in the field of
economic development.
	   Many problems including that of slow growth could be
characteristics endemic at the early stage of development. Many of
these problems will give in once the country crosses the threshold
of low level development and gathers momentum for a higher growth.
It is true that the per capita income of each of these East Asian
countries was low in the sixties. Per capita income of Bangladesh
(the area now comprising it) was, however, lower compared to these
countries. The difference was clearly visible in the seventies.
Indicators of development like life expectancy, calorie supply,
enrolment in the primary education, share of agriculture in GDP put
the East Asian countries on a much higher plane. Singapore, Hong
Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka were in a
different league even in the mid-sixties. Their superiority
vis-a-vis Bangladesh was firmly established in the mid-seventies.
	   Bangladesh was a poor country, its underdevelopment clearly
captured by all relevant indicators, while the East Asian countries
were poised for a take-off at that point of time. It is true that
South Korea's position in terms of per capita income was near to
Pakistan or slightly higher than Bangladesh in the sixties. This
will, however, give a misleading impression because all other
indicators decidedly put South Korea at a much superior position.
South Korea was like an aircraft poised for taking off while
Bangladesh or Pakistan was an aircraft standing still in the
hanger. Both are apparently on the same plane, their positions are
however, not comparable. Each represents a distinct state of
movement though apparently both of them are in a sedentary state.
	   It is therefore inaccurate to say that starting from a similar
situation a few years back, Bangladesh had lagged behind the East
Asian countries inordinately. The statement is inaccurate on two
counts: (a) Except Korea, all other countries had a substantially
higher per capita income than Bangladesh, (b) In terms of all other
indicators of economic development, East Asian countries were way
ahead of countries like Bangladesh. It is natural that in the
nineties Bangladesh will be way behind the East Asian countries.
There is virtually no reason for lamenting over such a situation.
Bangladesh is not a laggard, it is a late starter. She was never in
the same league with the East Asian Countries. Countries whose
conditions were similar to Bangladesh have not in any way
outstripped her in the last two and half decades. A few countries
have gone down the league.
	   Bangladesh has maintained its position rather well. She has
improved her position in certain cases. In case of Bangladesh all
the indicators are moving in the right direction, some indicators
are not moving as fast as one would like them to do. A small but
steady growth has put Bangladesh ahead of at least a few countries
which did not do well in the last two decades. One would be tempted
to hypothesise that countries at the lower end of the per capita
income demonstrate a modest growth rate for a number of years. They
start leapfrogging only when they cross the threshold income level,
say US$ 600 per capita. Some countries find it extremely difficult
to cross the threshold. Some would stagnate or decline like
Tanzania or Kenya. Even the top achievers may attain a growth rate
around six percent. Once the threshold is crossed a propitious
environment is created, a spurt of activities is observed and
growth rate may jump to double-digit number.
	   Countries at the lower rung of the income ladder showing a
modest growth rate should not be viewed as laggards, they are
conditioned to behave in a particular way at this stage of their
development. A modest but steady growth performance will gradually
lead them to a stage of transition (threshold income), from a stage
of utter poverty and despondency to that of hope and
respectability. As a late starter our aim should be to maintain a
steady growth performance through good management of resources at
our command. We have no reason to worry or feel small. We should
instead work to maintain a growth rate that promises to lead us to
threshold income in due course of time.

	   The three barrio schoolboys were tardy as usual. Like in the
past, they tarried along the way instead of proceeding directly to
school.
	   A flock of birds attracted them. They spent the bette part of
the morning firing their sling shots. The birds hovered around the
newly-harvested field to nourish on the left over grains on their
pannicles. The boys had fun chasing the birds. And as each animal
flew to safety, the stone from the force of the sling shot followed
them.
	   Now they were late to school by almost an hour. It was not the
first time.
	   But somehow, they always put one over their young
city-bredteacher. They invariably had good alibis.
	   It was either the farm chores, or some last minute unavoidable
errand or some mishap. One time, they spent the morning swimming in
the river. Yet they convince their teacher of an emergency. A
little girl was drowning so they took time to save her.
	   Or the alibi of helping an old woman carry her heavy load. Their
excuses were endless.
	   They also knew the teacher was getting suspicious and fed up. So
the three boys made sure theirexplanation was fool-proof.
	   I have a good idea, said the fat one of the three boys. Let us
tell the teacher we saw this carabao in pain. Yes, the second
agreed. The carabao was wounded. No, the third remarked. It must be
more serious than a wound. Let us say was fractured. That way it is
acceptable and will justify the length of our delay Right .
Brilliant. The perfect alibi, they chorused.
	   And so in as dramatic a way they could master, the alibi was
presented. The teacher listened patiently.
	   How pitiful is the carabao, she commented. It is good the three
of you were on the spot to assist and save the poor helpless
animal. That is right, Maiam, confirmed the fat one with a shade of
cocksureness.
	   Without us, the carabao is a goner (tepok na). It is good only
one leg got broken. Otherwise, it is the slaughter house for the
hapless animal. We should be commended. Maybe even awarded
medals.Tama na ang kalokohan (enough of your lunacy), she said with
a trace of anger, Now spread out, one on each corner of the room.
Get a piece of paper and ready your pencil. Are you giving us a
special quiz? asked the fat one with apprehension.
	   The three were certainly not ready for a test.
	   No, this is not a quiz, she said with a naughty and big smile. I
just want you separately to write a short essay indicating which of
the four legs of the carabao got fructured. And be specific whether
it is a hind or front leg and whether right or left

BBC TV reporters held in Yemen say they were forcibly separated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three British Broadcasting Corp. television
journalists cleared of filming without state permission in Yemen
said Monday they were forcibly separated and denied access to
British diplomats for most of their first day in custody.
	   Producer Robin Barnwell, reporter Rageh Ommar and cameraman
Frank Smith arrived in London after being cleared Sunday by a
Yemeni court.
	   They filmed in an area where tribesmen have carried out numerous
kidnappings, including of a British teacher, and were arrested May
26 when they returned to the Yemeni capital, San'a. The men were
held for 50 hours and then allowed to return to their hotels.
	   ``We were denied diplomatic representation or any contact with
diplomats for 19 hours,'' Barnwell told reporters at London's
Heathrow Airport.
	   He said the three tried to stay together, but were eventually
forcibly separated for questioning.
	   ``We were constantly deprived of sleep overnight by people
turning on lights, coming in and disturbing us. The next day there
was then a full day of interrogation,'' added Barnwell.
	   The men said they didn't eat in custody because they feared the
food would make them ill.
	   ``During the first two days, there were difficult moments, but
afterwards it was just the uncertainty of when things were going to
be over,'' said Ommar.

	   Africa is making substantial headway in curbing its birthrate,
but still faces major challenges such as reducing teenage
pregnancy, according to a latest study by a major US population
research group. To sustain and accelerate progress, donor nations
should double their assistance for family planning and related
health care from the present total of 500 million dollars, to at
least one billion dollars by the year 2000, according to the report
by Population Action International (PAI).
	   The 82-page report, Population Challenge,' argues that the
region's prospects for economic development largely depend on the
success governments can achieve in reducing the birth rate and
providing better health care to mothers and children. 'Africa is a
latecomer to the revolution in reproductive behaviour sweeping
across the developing world, but is now poised for positive change
with respect to childbearing patterns and sexual health,'' says
Shanti Conly, co-author of the study. She adds pointedly 'The needs
are urgent...''Sub-Saharan Africa's population - the fastest
growing in the world - effectively doubled in the last quarter
century to 620 million and could double again in less than 30
years.
	   For more than a generation, population growth of almost three
percent per year generally has outpaced economic growth - until the
last few years. As a result, Africans' per capita income is about
22 percent below what it was in 1975. According to the report,
however, African governments increasingly have taken steps to
address these problems. About two- thirds of the countries in the
region now have active family-planning programmes. A fundamental
shift in people's attitudes toward child-bearing has become
increasingly evident, the report says. This shift is explained in
part by increasing economic hardship for poor families who, given
government budget cuts, find it more difficult to afford the costs
of educating more children.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Legions of soldiers sealed off military
strongman Gen. Sani Abacha's residence and office in Nigeria's
capital Monday.
	   No visitors, except the top military brass, were permitted to
enter the secluded leader's compound amid growing reports on the
state of Abacha's health.
	   In an unusual move, senior aides with the ruling junta summoned
journalists to the State House for a briefing Monday, but they were
quickly turned away by the soldiers.
	   Scores of reporters, including those with state-controlled
media, were camped outside the State House awaiting an explanation
for the closure.
	   Although the army and police usually maintain a high profile on
the streets of Nigeria, the extraordinary move of sealing the head
of state's residence triggered a wave of rumors in the capital,
Abuja.
	   Abacha, 54, who was supposed to have been at a special function
in Lagos last week, failed to appear. He has made few public
appearances since he greeted Pope John Paul II in March.
	   Abacha seized power in Nigeria in 1993 after canceling
presidential elections and suspending the constitution.
	   Although he has pledged to hand the government over to an
elected civilian administration, in April he became the only
nominated candidate for the presidency.
	   Opposition to Abacha's rule has been mounting in recent months
with the prospect that his junta might not honor its pledge to
stand down.

Dallaglio signs for quality schedule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Injured England Five Nations rugby captain
Lawrence Dallaglio on Monday struck a deal with his club, Wasps,
restricting his matches to give him more chance of being fit for
England duties.
	   Dallaglio, one of the dozen test players missing from the
England team which was thrashed 76-0 by Australia in Brisbane
Saturday, has challenged other injured stars to consider similar
agreements.
	   Tours by England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales to the southern
hemisphere this summer have been marred by player unavailability
due to the demands of a hectic domestic schedule during winter.
	   Dallaglio, who was singled out by the Australian hierarchy for
playing in a club match after being ruled out of the England tour,
will limit his rugby to 35 matches next season.
	   The rangy forward estimated he played 80-plus matches between
the start of the 1996/97 season and May this year, including
League, Cup, Europe, England and Lions matches.
	   The deal negotiated with Wasps Rugby Club effectively means
Dallaglio misses selected League games from a total commitment of
26 Premiership fixtures, eight internationals and up to five cup
ties.
	   ``Let's hope the other clubs and their international players can
take similar action. Wasps are continuing their support of
England,'' he said Monday.
	   ``It remains to be seen whether other clubs are prepared to take
tough decisions and give their stars a break occasionally.
	   ``I am not now in Australia and I don't ever want to be absent
recovering from wear and tear when there is a tour on.''
	   Dallaglio said he hoped tour compilers had learned a lesson and
the current tour should never have gone ahead in the background of
the current English match structure.
	   ``It is very tough on the young players in Brisbane who should
normally have the chance of being brought in slowly and judiciously
to learn international rugby surrounded by older heads,'' he said.

World Cup: For Brazil, ``D'' is for dazzle, not defense
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Defense rarely springs to mind
when the subject is Brazilian soccer. For Ronaldo and company,
``D'' stands for dazzle, dribble and daring.
	   But defense can win World Cups, as an atypical Brazil proved in
1994. And as the team readies for its opening game against Scotland
on Wednesday, defense is its chief worry.
	   Tactical indiscipline, blown coverage, the age and precarious
health of its fullbacks contribute to the feeling that defense
again is Brazil's weak link.
	   Asked where the team most needs work, coach Mario Zagallo said
candidly that the main problem was ``holes in coverage.''
	   For team coordinator Zico, Brazil must ``improve coverage and
prepare the defense better. On the attack, we can always expect
more because of the skill of our players.''
	   The defense is anchored by three `94 veterans. Goalie Taffarel
is back for his third World Cup, as is midfield bulldog Dunga.
Fullback Aldair has shifted to the left side to make room for
Junior Baiano, a newcomer to Cup play.
	   While Zagallo values experience, critics question the fitness of
veterans for the grueling, five-week tournament.
	   Dunga, 34, is recovering from a leg injury but says he will be
ready by Wednesday. Aldair was forced to leave an intra-squad
scrimmage on Sunday with muscle pains.
	   Aldair's backup, Andre Cruz, also reported a pain in his left
thigh and didn't train on Sunday. MRI testing showed no swelling or
lesion, but his status for Wednesday is uncertain. Both Aldair and
Andre Cruz were held out of practice Monday to nurse sore legs.
	   The defense has an extra burden because of the constant upfield
charges by defenders Cafu and Roberto Carlos, both key offensive
weapons. Junior Baiano and Cafu have had trouble coordinating,
while Aldair and Dunga are a step slower than four years ago.
	   The defensive woes are nothing new. The back line looked shaky
in Brazil's 1-0 loss to Argentina in April and in a 1-1 draw with
Spain's Atletico Bilbao last week. In a 3-0 romp over tiny Andorra,
the defense barely worked up a sweat.
	   ``It was a practice, not a game,'' Zagallo admitted. ``The
defense wasn't tested at any time.''
	   Even so, there were problems. Junior Baiano and Andre Cruz
abandoned their positions to join the attack against the
overwhelmed Andorrans, and an irritated Zagallo ordered them back.
	   In style and game philosophy, Brazil today is very different
from the 1994 team that won an unprecedented fourth World Cup title
in the United States.
	   In '94, coach Carlos Alberto Parreira erected a blockade of four
players in the midfield. Mauro Silva, Dunga, Mazinho and Zinho were
an extra line of defense, leaving just Romario and Bebeto to
provide both playmaking and scoring.
	   And it was defense that decided the final game, when Brazil held
Italy to a 0-0 tie and Taffarel came up with a decisive save in the
penalty-kick shootout.
	   But Brazilians didn't like Parreira's efficient-but-dull brand
of soccer. Fans who recalled masters like Pele and Zico found it
painful to watch the disciplined but limited Mazinho, a converted
defender, and Zinho, who was dubbed ``the floorwaxer'' because he
went around in circles. When Zagallo took over after the Cup, he
promised to revive the ``art soccer'' of Brazil's glory years.
	   Today, in place of Mazinho and Zinho, Brazil has FC Barcelona
teammates Giovanni and Rivaldo. While the team gains in creativity
and scoring punch, it certainly will be more vulnerable when it
loses the ball.
	   Brazil's fortunes could ride on midfielder Cesar Sampaio, also
making his debut in a World Cup. He will have multiple duties to
support the offense, block the midfield and cover the holes left by
defenders.
	   ``I'm a defender first, he said. ``The World Cup will be
different from exhibition games. Tactics are more important,
because our opponents will play on our mistakes.''
	   Meanwhile, Zagallo dismissed worries about the fragile defense,
saying opponents will be too busy trying to contain Ronaldo, Bebeto
and Co. to attack.
	   ``No team will make the mistake of playing offensively with
us,'' he said. ``I'm sure that all will play on the
counterattack.''

NATO to get ready for intervention &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Cook comments; UPDATES with details of UN force in
Macedonia &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Worried another wave of ethnic cleansing may
ignite another Balkan war, the EU tightened sanctions against
Belgrade Monday and urged NATO to consider military action to stop
the bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   The European Union foreign ministers banned new investments in
Serbia and froze the country's assets abroad to punish it for
``widespread house-burning and indiscriminate artillery attacks on
whole villages'' in Kosovo.
	   Yet given that sanctions have had no effect on Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic, they urged ``international security
organizations ... to consider all options,'' including military
ones that need a U.N. mandate.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, speaking of Milosevic,
told reporters:
	   ``This is his last warning. If he continues to cross the line
and to use unacceptable military measures against civilian
populations, he should not be surprised'' the international
community will reply with military means.
	   ``We cannot tolerate in any part of Europe a return to ethnic
cleansing.''
	   Actions needing a U.N. mandate would include imposing a no-fly
zone, air strikes against Serb artillery, beefing up U.N. forces in
Macedonia or _ the most extreme scenario _ sending an allied force
into Kosovo.
	   Until now, NATO has been considering only joint, small-scale
maneuvers with Albania and Macedonia and deploying up to 20,000
troops in Albania along the Kosovo border.
	   U.N. Secretary General Koffi Annan has recommended the Security
Council keep the 750 peacekeepers in Macedonia beyond the end of
its mandate on Aug. 31. The troops have been there since 1992. Next
week, Annan will propose how to strengthen the force that includes
Danish, Finish, Indonesian, Norwegian, Swedish and U.S. troops.
	   On Thursday and Friday, the NATO defense ministers meet in
Brussels to consider a military response. On Friday, the foreign
ministers of Canada, United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Japan, Italy and Russia will discuss Kosovo in London.
	   As a permanent U.N. Security Council member, Russia can veto any
military action against Serbia, a traditional ally.
	   ``It is very important we include Russia,'' German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters. Cook said Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeni Primakov will be made to ``understand the gravity
of the situation.''
	   In their statement, the EU ministers said Serb security forces
have been ``engaged in a campaign of violence going far beyond what
could legitimately be described as a targeted anti-terrorist
operation.''
	   They urged Belgrade and Kosovo independence activists to seek a
negotiated solution to their conflict and spoke of ``the grave
deteriorating situation on the ground, involving the excessive use
of force by the Serb security forces.''
	   The investment ban and the asset freeze come in addition to
previously announced measures including a ban on arms exports and
restricted travel visas for Yugoslav officials.
	   Cook could give no details on the impact of the investment ban
and the assets freeze but termed them ``considerable.''

<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ Wearing the red and yellow Spanish
soccer team jersey, French Open winner Arantxa Sanchez Vicario said
Monday she hoped Spain can take home another trophy from France
this year _ the World Cup.
	   ``Hopefully we can all celebrate again in Paris,'' the tennis
star said when she visited the Spanish team hotel outside this
chateau town just north of Paris.
	   ``This could be Spain's year. Winning the World Cup would be the
knockout punch.''
	   Sanchez Vicario, who won her third Roland Garros on Saturday by
beating Monica Seles, posed with the full Spanish squad on the
steps of the Blue Green Hotel wearing a team jersey given to her by
striker Juan Pizzi.
	   She then held up a minature replica of the tennis trophy she won
and kissed it to the cheers of the team and journalists gathered.
	   ``I wanted to wish them the best of luck and if my calendar
allows me to get to a game, I will,'' said Sanchez Vicario. She
said that the team had greeted her chanting ``Champion, Champion''
when she entered the hotel.
	   The Barcelona-born tennis player said she would set about
immediately preparing for Wimbledon in two weeks time.
	   Spanish defender and friend Miguel Angel Nadal said her victory
together with Carlos Moya's in the men's tournament on Sunday had
boosted the team's optimism.
	   ``Hopefully all this success is contagious,'' Nadal said.

World Cup: Pagliuca, Zamorano set to play a private game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, Italy (AP) _ Inter Milan teammates Gianluca Pagliuca and
Ivan Zamorano will be involved in two games when Italy and Chile
square off in their World Cup opener on Thursday.
	   Besides their Group B clash, the Italian keeper and Chilean
striker have been chiding each other on their team's respective
chances at France '98 _ and offering personal challenges.
	   ``It's not a real bet, but Ivan promised to score one goal on
me. He has been pestering me for weeks,'' Italy's starting keeper
said at the team's training camp north of Paris.
	   ``I told him he won't. But I am ready to surrender (a goal),
under the condition that Italy wins the match. I believe Italy is
stronger than Chile.''
	   Zamorano was expected to start against the Azzurri, despite
nursing a knee injury, and Pagliuca has said the presence of the
Chilean striker would help Italy play a more determined and focused
game.
	   ``He's a key, great player. If he's as good as in the UEFA Cup
with Inter, he can be very dangerous for Italy. But I'm not hoping
for his absence. I hope to play him, and beat him,'' Pagliuca said.
	   Zamorano scored the first goal and was a key figure in Inter's
dominating 3-0 victory over Lazio in the all-Italian UEFA Cup final
in Paris last month.
	   Pagliuca is also looking forward to playing another of his Inter
teammates in the World Cup _ Brazilian forward Ronaldo.
	   The Italian keeper, who will be starting for Italy in his second
World Cup, ascended to the starter's job when Angelo Peruzzi of
Juventus pulled a muscle and was dropped from the roster.
	   ``As usual the opening match will be crucial for (advancing).
Chile is a tough opponent, but I feel we will have a better start
than four years ago,'' Pagliuca said.
	   Italy lost 1-0 to Ireland to open their 1994 tournament before
reaching the championship match, where it lost on penalty kicks to
Brazil.
	   ``I still remember that lost final, but I have no nightmares
about it,'' said Pagliuca, who after holding Brazil to a 0-0 draw
through 120 minutes, stopped one penalty kick in the 3-2 shootout
loss.
	   ``Under the new rules, the strikers are going to shine in this
edition. It's going to Ronaldo's and Del Piero's World Cup,''
Pagliuca said.
	   Alessandro Del Piero, Italy talented forward, is not expected to
play Thursday due to his continuing recovering from a right thigh
strain.
	   He likely will be replaced by veteran Roberto Baggio.
	   Baggio, the 1994 World Cup hero, recently signed a lucrative
two-year contract with Inter.
	   ``With Baggio and Ronaldo in front, we will have no excuse next
season. We will have to win the league title,'' Pagliuca said.

Russian government to cut rail transportation fees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government will reduce by 25 percent the fees
it charges for transporting coal, iron ore, oil and fuel oil by
rail in an attempt to support Russia's industries, a top official
said Monday.
	   ``This is a key structural step in the government's industrial
policy,'' Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov was quoted as saying
by the Interfax news agency.
	   Railroads stand to lose 6 billion rubles (nearly dlrs 1 billion)
through the fee cuts, which will take effect June 15, Nemtsov said.
But the cuts are expected to help Russia's struggling
power-engineering, iron, steel and ore-processing industries.
	   ``The railway people volunteered to take the financial blow,''
Nemtsov said.
	   Russia's gas monopoly, Gazprom, and electricity monopoly,
Unified Energy Systems, are expected to introduce similar cuts in
gas and energy rates, Nemtsov said.

Dallas Stars' Zubov arrested, accused of assaulting wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPPELL, Texas (AP) _ Dallas Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov has
been arrested on charges of assaulting his wife and brandishing a
knife.
	   Zubov, 27, was charged with aggravated assault and family
violence, a second-degree felony.
	   Coppell police said they went to Zubov's house shortly after 3
a.m. (0700 GMT) Sunday after someone at the home called police and
hung up.
	   Officers, who determined that Zubov had exhibited a kitchen
knife in the alleged assault, took him into custody, Coppell police
Capt. Wade Goolsby said. He said the weapon was recovered.
	   Zubov's wife, Irina, was not believed to have been injured.
	   Zubov, who was the Stars' second-leading scorer during the
playoffs with nine points in 16 games, was released Sunday on dlrs
5,000 bond set by Municipal Judge Kim Nesbitt.
	   ``The Dallas Stars and the National Hockey League are
cooperating fully with the authorities and are offering our
assistance and support to both Sergei and Irina,'' Stars general
manager Bob Gainey said in a statement.
	   The club had no further comment.

Sporting Lisbon signs Croatian coach Mirko Jozic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Sporting Lisbon announced Monday that it
had signed Croatian coach Mirko Jozic on a one-year contract.
	   Jozic, 58, replaces Carlos Manuel who quit last month after the
club finished the Portuguese first division in fourth place, 21
points behind champion FC Porto, on a 15-11-8 record. Manuel was
the club's fourth coach of the season.
	   Sporting has not won the league title for 16 years.
	   Jozic, who last week left Argentinean club Newell's Old Boys
after six months as coach, signed Sunday in Rome.
	   He led Colo Colo to the Chilean title in 1991, 1992 and 1994,
and coached Croatia's Hadjuk Split in 1996.

Red Cross presses Chechnya to investigate aide workers' deaths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The international Red Cross said Monday it will
keep pressuring the Chechen government to find and punish those
responsibility for the 1996 killings of six Red Cross workers.
	   No progress has been made so far in the investigation, said
Francois Warin, head of the Red Cross mission in the North
Caucasus.
	   The six Red Cross workers were gunned down while they slept in
their hospital compound on Dec. 17, 1996.
	   The Red Cross and other aid agencies withdrew their foreign
workers in response. The Red Cross will not return until the
investigation is completed, Warin said, according to Interfax news
agency.
	   Chechnya has seen a rise in kidnappings and other crimes since
the end of its 1994-96 war of independence against Russia. Chechnya
insist it is an independent state, although no country has
recognized its sovereignty, and Moscow says it remains part of
Russia.

	   SUNGAI PETANI, Sun.- Umno members should avoid speculating why
party veterans are being roped in to help the Government explain
the economic problems to the people, party vice-president Datuk
Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today.
	   He said their wealth of experience could be shared with the
people.
	   ``Veterans are very influential, enjoying the people's respect.
I feel it is timely for them to come forward to help the
Government,'' he told reporters after giving a talk at a motivation
camp organised by the Kepala Batas Umno Youth Division at Pantai
Merdeka, about 20km from here.
	   Asked if the veterans' help could be misconstrued as an attempt
at political comeback, Abdullah said: ``There is no such intention
and there should also be no speculation why the veterans are
offering help. We have to be serious in overcoming the economic
problems and everyone should concentrate on the job at hand.''
	   The fears that veterans might make a comeback were unfounded.
	   He was asked to comment on former Deputy Prime Minister Tun
Ghafar Baba's statement yesterday that Umno veterans would be
called to explain the economic problems to the people.
	   Ghafar had said they would include former Menteris Besar,
Ministers and Members of Parliament.
	   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad is expected to
meet 200 of them next Saturday for a briefing.

	   THERE is something odd about the kampung house on stilts
nestling in Henry Barlow's hilly tea estate in Genting Sempah,
Bentong.
	   This is especially so when it is juxtaposed with Barlow's
multi-tiered stone one or the casino and high-tech theme park for
which this area is most renowned.
	   What makes this kampung house - or the `rumah ibu' - unique is
that it belongs to sculptress and British expatriate Waveney
Jenkins and her husband Peter, who salvaged it from a dilapidated
kampung house they had found in Perak.
	   And as if that were not enough, the Jenkins' rumah ibu (the main
section of the generally multi-sectioned traditional Malay house)
fronts what used to be the home of the tea-plantation's foremen
which they had extensively renovated.
	   ``Oh, it was ghastly when we first got it from Henry late last
year,''
	   says Jenkins of the foreman's residence which current
estate-owner, Henry Barlow, had sold to Waveney and Peter after
they had decided to move out of their home in Ampang.
	   ``For the longest time,'' says Waveney of their ex-home in Jalan
Ampang, ``205 was a peaceful enclave - it was a lovely home - but
recently, it seems to have become the hub of activity and
consequently besieged by pollution and noise.''
	   The Jenkins' move to Genting Sempah marked the moment when
Waveney finally had the time and space to realise her dream of
owning a kampung house.
	   ``It's really a shame that it has taken us 30 years to achieve
this. We didn't start working on it until last October, and it's
finally beginning to feel like home,'' Waveney declares, gesturing
at the cozy room that is the rumah ibu.
	   As the need to move away from the ``metropolis into which Kuala
Lumpur had degenerated'', the Jenkins decided to materialise, once
and for all, their dream of a kampung house.
	   They put out word that they were looking for old kampung houses
but did not have to wait long. Peter's driver told them that there
were two old houses in his kampung in Perak.
	   A trip to Perak later, and the Jenkins were proud owners of two
almost decrepit kampung houses, one of which they then remodelled
into their very own rumah ibu.
	   ``The house from which this rumah ibu was built was in very bad
shape. We only managed to salvage enough wood for the rumah ibu
section,'' explains Waveney.
	   To rebuild the kampung house, the Jenkins commissioned a
``rather chaotic but very dear'' Kelantan man who moved the house,
bit by bit, to Genting Sempah in small lorries.
	   ``If you are to undertake a proper Malay house move, you would
number every piece of wood and replace it accordingly. We didn't do
this; we basically remodelled the house as we were constrained by
the fact that we could only use salvageable wood.
	   ``As a result, it's more of a Kelantan rather than Perak house
though, ultimately, it's neither,'' says Waveney laughing with
delight.
	   She said kampung houses in Perak generally have an anjung
whereas those in Kelantan often have a rumah ibu with an adjoining
rumah bujang (section of the house where the bachelors of the
family live).
	   The Jenkins' rumah ibu which is now used as a study and a guest
room of sorts, was rebuilt according to tradition.
	   When the original house was dismantled, the Jenkins learnt that
it was built in the 1920s by the coins placed at the base of every
tiang (pillar or stilt).
	   ``It's a tradition that you place a coin of the year in which
the house is built at the base of each tiang. In the second house,
we found coins dating back to 1905.
	   ``So when we rebuilt it, we placed coins with last year's dates
on them along with the original coins,'' says Waveney.
	   Aside from this, they also had a traditional Malay house-warming
ceremony and prayers.
	   Waveney's interest in Malaysian heritage and culture is merely
the spritely offspring of her passion for art and her love for the
country.
	   After attending school and art schools in London and Paris,
Waveney married Peter and moved to Malaysia in 1962. By 1963,
Waveney was preparing dioramas and the Hang Tuah mural for Muzium
Negara, Kuala Lumpur.
	   Throughout the years, she has had seemingly countless
exhibitions of her numerous projects in art galleries; she is by no
means a new kid on the local art block.
	   Aside from this, Waveney is also a very active member of the
Badan Warisan Malaysia (the Malaysian Heritage Trust). She was a
council member of BWM from 1983-1994 and an honorary member from
1994.
	   ``Although I've always had an interest in the traditional Malay
house, I'm especially into its preservation right now as I fear
that it may all disappear with urbanisation,'' Waveney says.
	   What she finds most disturbing is that many Malaysians seem to
regard the traditional Malay house as sub-standard and symbolic of
poverty.
	   In her mind, the Malay house is under threat from two fronts:
its general association with poverty and traditional inheritance
laws that seem to encourage the neglect of these houses.
	   During the quest for their house, the Jenkins found that many
beautiful Malay houses were in tragic states of disrepair as their
ownerships were in dispute.
	   ``Many of the houses we saw were often in the name of a dead
grandfather as the surviving members of the family could not find a
way of dividing the house.
	   ``Usually, the poorest members of the family are allowed to live
in the traditional house whose ownership is in dispute. As a
result, no one wants to chip in for the repair of the place,''
Waveney says.
	   Nevertheless, she feels that there is hope yet for the
traditional Malay house.
	   ``I am finding that more and more young Malaysians are beginning
to appreciate their heritage. This may be because many of them have
been abroad and from learning another culture have come to
appreciate their own better,'' she adds.
	   For more information on the traditional Malay house or BWM, call

	   GOPENG, Sun.- Local authorities should not raise assessment rate
during the interim takeover period by solid waste management
consortiums, Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Dr Ting
Chew Peh said today.
	   This was because the interim would last only until the Solid
Waste Management and Cleansing Bill was approved.
	   Although they had to pay a certain amount to the consortiums to
handle waste management, ``local authorities are only paying what
they would normally spend on waste management,'' he said after
opening a MCA Langkawi project exhibition organised by the MCA
Gopeng division today.
	   The Ipoh City Council is said to be planning to increase rates
because it is unable to pay Northern Waste Industries an estimated
RM21 million for managing solid waste.
	   Some councillors had claimed the City Council planned to use the
assessments collected to pay the amount, claiming the council would
go bankrupt if it did not increase the rates.
	   Ting said the adjustment required during the interim takeover
was minor and this did not warrant an increase in assessment rates.
	   If they had trouble raising the money, it was an internal matter
to be resolved by the authorities.
	   ``The Kuala Lumpur City Hall paid Alam Flora Sdn Bhd RM100
million to manage solid waste during the interim period and it has
not increased the assessment rates.
	   ``Likewise, Johor Baru, where Southern Waste Management Sdn Bhd
is managing solid waste for the City Council and Johor Baru Central
District Council, has not increased the rates.''
	   Four consortia have been appointed to manage the country's solid
waste.
	   They are DRB-Hicom (Alam Flora Sdn Bhd), Northern Waste
Industries (NWI), Southern Waste Management Sdn Bhd and MMC
Engineering (Eastern Waste Management).
	   Alam Flora will cover Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Pahang, Kelantan
and Terengganu; NWI for Perak, Kedah, Penang and Perlis; Southern
Waste for Johor, Negri Sembilan and Malacca; and MMC for Labuan,
Sabah and Sarawak.
	   Alam Flora took over from Kuala Lumpur City Hall in January last
year while Southern Waste Management took over in Johor Baru and
Johor Baru Central District Council this year.
	   NWI is scheduled to enter the interim period on August 1.

	   Former banker and accused money-launderer Angel Isidoro
Rodriguez attacked Banco de Mexico President Guillermo Ortiz,
saying Ortiz and other federal authorities knew of illegal bank
transactions, French news agency AFP reported Sunday.
	   Rodriguez, who is better known by his nickname ``El Divino,''
told journalists Mexico's bank privatization in the early 90s was
rife with corruption.
	   ``They always knew who was going to buy the banks,'' Rodriguez
said about the bank-purchase process.
	   ``El Divino'' was extradited from Spain on Monday in connection
with defrauding Mexican banks out of 400 million pesos -- valued on
today's market at about 47 million dollars.
	   Rodriguez lashed out against Ortiz and Eduardo Fernandez, former
president of the federal National Banking &AMP; Securities Commission
(CNBV).
	   Rodriguez said authorities favored some purchasers over others,
such as jailed former Confia bank head Jorge Lankenau.
	   Lankenau is accused of defrauding banks out of 180 million
dollars. Rodriguez said authorities provided ``facilities and even
resources to buy the banks.''Both bankers have complained that they
are ``scapegoats'' and that officials are trying to silence them by
putting them in prison.
	   Authorities are afraid alleged fraudulent bankers Lankenau and
Rodriguez will make more damaging accusations, alleging officials
promoted shady management of the banking rescue plan.'' Copyright

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Shariff
today reprimanded residents of the federal capital for not doing
enough to stop littering.
	   In future, more stringent action would be taken against
litterbugs.
	   Kamaruzzaman said the city's cleanliness was still not up to the
required standard. The main reason for this, he said, was the
attitude of residents who did not seem to care enough about the
well-being of their city.
	   Kamaruzzaman was speaking at a Press conference after launching
the Malay Mail Big Walk 98 at Menara Kuala Lumpur.
	   Thus far, City Hall has imposed a fine of RM300 on litterbugs.
	   Kamaruzzaman announced that from now on anyone found polluting
rivers and drains would be brought to court.
	   During the next two months, City Hall will launch a campaign
titled ``Care For Your Rivers and Drains''.
	   Specific details were not given but it is hoped that the
campaign will help instil in people's minds the need to care for
their city.
	   ``It is not just up to City Hall and Alam Flora to pick up
rubbish left by other people. While the authorities are doing their
best to clean up the city, it is also the responsibility of the
residents to play their part.''
	   On another important note, Kamaruzzaman said that it was
absolutely vital for Kuala Lumpur to project an image of
cleanliness to visitors attending the 1998 Commonwealth Games.
	   ``People must realise that Malaysia will be hosting the second
largest sporting event after the Olympic Games and it is not just
the tourists and athletes who will be watching us. All eyes around
the world will be focused on our capital city.
	   ``We have to show the world that we truly are a healthy,
clean-living nation.''

	   Capital legislators say they will recommend that delegation
governments comply with new laws against street merchants setting
up shop near public markets.
	   Official news agency Notimex reported the recommendations would
be sent Monday.
	   Veronica Moreno Ramirez, president of the Commission on
Wholesale Food Markets and Food Distribution, said that the Law of
Public Markets and Government Regulation prohibits businesses in
public thoroughfares and at a distance of 200 meters from markets,
schools, hospitals and churches.
	   The local legislator said lawmakers were influenced by the fact
representatives from more than 70 percent of the city's 318 public
markets attended meetings and voted on the issue.
	   Moreno Ramirez said established merchants are demanding laws be
followed through to protect established businesses.
	   Besides, Moreno Ramirez said, market owners are asking for help
in obtaining short-term needs, such as the management of sewers and
trash collection.
	   Moreno Ramirez said she was confident local authorities would
follow through with the law.
	   At the same time, Moreno Ramirez said more resources and funds
are needed to provide for the rebuilding of markets'
infrastructure. The large La Merced market, for example, suffered
heavy fire damage recently and much of that has not been repaired.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The nation's biggest walking event, the
Malay Mail Big Walk 1998, was officially launched today by Datuk
Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Shariff at Menara Kuala Lumpur.
	   This will be the 38th big walk organised by the Malay Mail.
Nearly 1,000 people turned up today to register for the event.
	   While queuing up to register, they listened to a talk given by
former national champion Khoo Chong Beng on ``The Art of Walking''.
	   In his opening speech, Kamaruzzaman said the 38th Malay Mail Big
Walk, more affectionately known as the ``Biggie'', would be an
excellent way to further nurture the spirit of healthy and clean
living among city dwellers.
	   Also present was the walk's organising chairman, Malay Mail
editor Fauzi Omar who said that with the walk taking place just 18
days before the Commonwealth Games, he hoped the turnout would
exceed the usual figure of 10,000 participants.
	   ``We have written to all 68 countries inviting their athletes to
participate,'' he said.
	   The walk will be held on Aug 23 at Padang Merbuk. It is jointly
organised by the Malay Mail, Kuala Lumpur City Hall, Malaysia
Tourism Promotion Board and the Federal Territory Amateur Athletic
Association.
	   Sponsors of the walk are Milo and Isomax with Menara Kuala
Lumpur being the venue sponsor and Time Highway Radio the official
radio station.

	   MALACCA, Sun. - Police have intensified their investigation into
the killing of two men whose bodies were found in a car at a
roadblock last Tuesday.
	   Although two Singaporeans have been arrested to facilitate
investigations into the murder, police have not ruled out the
probability that others might also be able to shed light into the
case.
	   The New Straits Times learnt today that among others, police are
working on the theory that more than two people might be linked to
the killings.
	   Police also believe that the person or persons involved may have
been known to the victims and hope to trace them.
	   The widows of the victims are expected to be interviewed when
they arrive from Singapore and Sabah tomorrow to identify the
bodies at the Muadzam Shah Hospital in Rompin.
	   Malacca police chief Senior Assistant Commissioner Arthur
Edmonds today urged those with information on incidents leading to
the killings to come forward.
	   He said those who had business dealings with the victims or knew
them personally, should contact the police to facilitate
investigations.
	   In Tuesday's incident, two Singaporeans were detained after
police found the bodies of Chai Cheon Keat alias Peter, 30, and an
unidentified Singaporean man in a white Toyota Corolla car at a
roadblock at the 100km Kuantan-Segamat highway.
	   One of the foreigners was driving the car while the other was a
passenger when they were nabbed near the junction of Bandar Muadzam
Shah about 3.30pm.
	   Of the two victims, one who was found in the boot of the vehicle
is believed to have had 24 stab wounds in the chest and abdomen.
	   The other, who is believed to have been strangled, was found in
the rear seat.

EU bans new investments in Serbia; freezes assets abroad

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Cook comments; UPDATES with details of UN force in
Macedonia. PICKS UP 6th graf pvs: On Thursday and ... &QL;

	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Worried that a new wave of ethnic cleansing
may ignite another Balkan war, the EU tightened sanctions against
Belgrade on Monday and urged the NATO alliance to study military
solutions to stop the violence in separatist Kosovo province.
	   The European Union foreign ministers banned new investments in
Serbia and froze the country's assets abroad to punish it for
``widespread house-burning and indiscriminate artillery attacks on
whole villages'' in the Serb-ruled province, where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9 to 1.
	   Yet given the limited effect sanctions have had so far on
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, they urged ``international
security organizations ... to consider all options,'' including
those requiring specific United Nations Security Council support.
	   ``This is his last warning. If he continues to cross the line
and to use unacceptable military measures against civilian
populations, he should not be surprised,'' British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook told reporters. ``We cannot tolerate in any
part of Europe a return to ethnic cleansing.''
	   Actions needing a U.N. mandate would include the imposition of a
no-fly zone, air strikes against Serb artillery, beefing up U.N.
forces in Macedonia or _ the most extreme scenario _ sending an
allied force into Kosovo.
	   Until now, NATO has been considering only joint but small-scale
maneuvers in neighboring Albania and Macedonia and sending up to
20,000 troops in Albania along the Kosovo border.
	   U.N. Secretary General Koffi Annan has recommended that the
Security Council keep the 750 peacekeepers in Macedonia beyond the
end of its mandate on Aug. 31. The troops have been there since
1992. Next week, Annan will propose how to strengthen the force
that includes Danish, Finish, Indonesian, Norwegian, Swedish and
U.S. troops.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An alleged Bosnian Croat
paramilitary commander accused of allowing one of his troops to
repeatedly rape a Muslim woman went on trial Monday at the Yugoslav
war crimes tribunal.
	   Anto Furundzija, 28, has pleaded innocent to two war crimes
charges relating to the May 1993 rapes, allegedly committed while
he was interrogating the victim. He faces a maximum sentence of
life imprisonment if convicted.
	   His attorney, Luka Misetic, said judges would acquit Furundzija
because the prosecution's case was built on faulty recollections of
the victim.
	   ``Her testimony will not convince you beyond a reasonable doubt
that Anto Furundzija is guilty as charged, and, make no mistake,
the prosecution's entire case is based on her testimony,'' Misetic
said.
	   Her evidence ``is not credible, let alone convincing beyond
reasonable doubt.''
	   But prosecutor Michael Blaxill insisted testimony from five
witnesses would prove Furundzija's guilt.
	   ``The evidence will show that the accused conducted
interrogation and arranged a confrontation with another detainee
during which both were beaten and the female victim was again
subjected to further horrendous sexual abuse in the presence of her
interrogator,'' Blaxill told the three-judge panel.
	   Furundzija sat calmly in court throughout Monday's hearing. He
faces a maximum life sentence if convicted.
	   Although rape has been considered a war crime in other cases
before the U.N. court, Furundzija's trial is the first to deal
specifically with sexual assault inflicted during an interrogation.
	   The alleged rapist, identified Monday by the names Cicko and
Bralo, has not been arrested. Furundzija was arrested in December
in the central Bosnian town of Vitez, near where his alleged
offenses were committed.
	   The victim, identified in court only as Witness A, was raped at
The Jokers' headquarters just outside Vitez, prosecutors claim.
	   The Jokers allegedly took part in a violent campaign by Bosnian
Croat forces to drive Muslims out of the central Bosnian Lasva
River Valley in 1993.
	   By failing to stop the rapes, Furundzija became a ``direct
perpetrator committing the crimes of torture and outrages upon
personal dignity,'' Blaxill said. Furundzija maintains he was not
present when the woman was raped.
	   The trial is the sixth to begin at the tribunal. Prosecutors
will only call five witnesses, including the alleged victim. A
Muslim community leader from Vitez testified Monday about events
leading up to the conflict.
	   Although Furundzija is a minor figure from the 3 1/2-year
Bosnian conflict, prosecutors at the U.N. court are keen to
establish case law involving sexual assaults as a war crime.
	   Set up in 1993, the war crimes tribunal has indicted 60 suspects
and has 27 in custody. Its most-wanted suspects, former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen.
Ratko Mladic, remain at large.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Numerous showers and isolated thunderstorms developed over the
coastal waters of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands this
morning. Most of the showers remained over the coastal waters, but
a few moved onshore over the U.S. Virgin Islands and the east coast
of Puerto Rico.
	   The heaviest rain fell just off the southeast coast of Puerto
Rico from Maunabo to Guayama.
	   The showers developed early this morning as an upper level area
of high pressure over the southeast Caribbean weakened, allowing an
upper trough to drift close to the islands.
	   Scattered showers are expected over the east half of Puerto Rico
and the U.S. Virgin islands this morning.
	   However, as sea breezes develop most of the shower activity is
expected to be pushed into the interior and western sections of
Puerto Rico by the afternoon.
	   A tropical wave located in the middle and upper levels of the
atmosphere passed over the Windward Islands overnight. This wave
will pass south of the local area today and is not expected to have
a direct effect on the local weather.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Still unsure how a wheel on one of its
premier high-speed trains could have broken, the German railway on
Monday intensified safety checks and assurances it would spare no
costs to restore confidence in rail travel.
	   Workers laid new tracks in the northern village of Eschede, the
scene of Germany's worst postwar rail disaster, in hopes of
reopening the Hanover-Hamburg line as early as Tuesday afternoon _
unless accident investigators disagree. Rescue workers continued
sifting through loose dirt five days after the crash in search of
personal effects and human remains.

	   JAVA software developer Datek Sdn Bhd plans to invest RM20
million over the next three months to carry out its business
development strategy. The company intends to step up its marketing
drive and further promote its technology.
	   Datek's chairman and chief executive officer Darryl Carlton said
the company has managed to establish its business presence in
Malaysia and its next objective is to reach targeted markets in
Asia, Europe and America.
	   Datek has so far invested some RM35 million to develop its
business.
	   ``It is very hard to get presence today, and we have to work
much harder than before,'' Carlton said at the worldwide launch of
its Solo 3270 solution which was held in Petaling Jaya last week.
	   The first software house to be granted the Multimedia Super
Corridor (MSC)-status, Datek is now actively recruiting local
workers for its projects.
	   Carlton said Datek has started to work on projects such as
systems for accounting, airlines and banking.
	   On Solo 3270, Carlton said the product is aimed at personal
computer (PC) users who need access to IBM mainframe systems.
	   He claimed that SOLO 3270 is the country's first IBM mainframe
terminal emulator that allows PCs access to IBM mainframe systems
anywhere in the world through its Internet browser embedded
software.
	   ``The market for Solo 3270 is huge. Altogether there are some
450,000 mainframes worldwide and they contain roughly 70 per cent
of the world's data,'' Carlton said. ``These mainframes are
configured to the IBM 3270 computer protocol, including those
produced by computer giants such as Amdahl, Hitachi, Fujitsu, NEC
and IBM.''
	   He said for the new product, Datek is targeting North Asia
because China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan will make a good market for
the market to grow. ``In fact, statistics show that these countries
are Asia's top five growth markets for information technology,'' he
said, adding that Datek is targeting to sell between 13 and 15
millions units of Solo 3270 each year.
	   The product is aimed at companies that intend to replace their
PCs with IBM terminals, telephone companies and other large
corporations.
	   Carlton said the company is also in discussions with a large
computer manufacturer for the inclusion of Solo 3270 as a standard
software.
	   Solo 3270 functions with both Netscape's Navigator and
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browsers.
	   Priced at US$29.95 (about RM115), Solo 3270 is written in 100
per cent pure Java programming language, which means that it can
run on any operating system.
	   Developed in nine months, Solo 3270 is now made available
worldwide via the Internet through an ongoing electronic commerce
arrangement set between Datek and Release Soft Inc, a leading
Internet-based e-commerce facility in the United States.
	   Customers can download Solo 3270 from the Internet through
Datek's Web site (http://www.bata via.com or http://www.
datek.com.my). Payment is transacted over the Internet through the
validation of major credit cards.
	   Datek has 43 software development staff operating in Petaling
Jaya, and another five in Australia. Its first product, Batavia,
has made a considerable impact in Malaysia, Japan, and the US via
online retail stores.

Two MiGs collide in midair, no fatalities reported

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES number of injured, pilots hospitalized with spine

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Two fighter planes collided in
midair Monday and one of them crashed near a densely populated
area, injuring 10 people, Defense Ministry officials said.
	   The two planes collided at 9:25 a.m. in heavy clouds over the
city of Ceske Budejovice, 130 kilometers (81 miles) south of
Prague, ministry spokesman Petr Sykora said.
	   One of the planes crashed near an apartment complex, setting
three buildings on fire, local police officials said. The plane
first hit several parked cars and then slid toward the buildings,
heavily damaging one of them.
	   Seven civilians were slightly injured in the accident, but no
fatalities were reported.
	   The three pilots ejected but were hospitalized with spine
injuries, the news agency CTK quoted air force commander Ladislav
Klima as saying.
	   One of the planes was a two-seat Russian-made MiG 21U and the
other was a MiG 21 with a single pilot.
	   The second plane crashed in an uninhabited area near the
complex, causing no serious damages, CTK said.
	   Residents were evacuated and given gas masks to prevent them
from inhaling poisonous gases from burning plastic in the
buildings.
	   At least 200 police and firefighters brought the blazes under
control within two hours, CTK reported.
	   All military flights were immediately suspended, CTK said.

Honduran boy hitchhikes to Mexico in search of brother
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISAAC GUZMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) _ He set off on foot from his small
village in Honduras carrying few belongings, no money, in search of
an older brother who was merely distant memory.
	   It took five months of hitchhiking, hiding and working odd jobs,
but 11-year-old Ivan Lopez made it more than 1,930 kilometers
(1,200 miles) to Guadalajara, where he had heard his brother had
gone.
	   ``I always got rides. I got into trucks and people took me
along. But I never told them my story,'' said Ivan, who speaks with
the confidence of someone much older and bigger. ``People with good
hearts helped me with food and money.''
	   Ivan said he left his village of San Antonio el Coco on Jan. 9
because he was ``bored,'' because there wasn't any work, and
because he had heard about his brother Juan Carlos, who had left
for Guadalajara six years ago when Ivan was only 5.
	   He ignored warnings from his father and uncles, and slipped out
of his village. He said a policeman stopped him on the road, but
let him continue after he said he was going to a nearby town.
	   The boy made it into Mexico in nine days, he said, sneaking
under a bridge along the border.
	   ``That's how I got past the immigration agents,'' he said.
``They're the only ones who scared me.''
	   Ivan said he got odd jobs working as a porter to make a little
money, then met a family who took him to the state of Nayarit. He
lived with them for two months, he said.
	   ``I went to sixth grade there, but I told them I had to continue
with my voyage and find my brother,'' he said.
	   In Guadalajara, Ivan found a television station that broadcast
his story in the hopes of finding his brother, whom Ivan said works
at a hotel.
	   The news director at the television station is caring for Ivan
while immigration officials study his case, and is in contact with
Honduras' consul in Guadalajara.
	   Ivan's case echoes that of another Honduran boy, Elmer Javier
Licona, who as a 10-year-old who was found in Guadalajara in 1996
while trying to reach his mother in the United States. Elmer was
eventually returned to Honduras.
	   Ivan has not yet found his brother, but he said that didn't
worry him.
	   ``It doesn't matter,'' he said, ``because I've already decided I
want to stay here.''

Blatter is new head of FIFA, arrests made, pilots make free offer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with France's arrival, South Korea practice &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sepp Blatter won a contentious fight for the FIFA
presidency on Monday, while two other battles _ against terrorism
and a potentially disruptive airline strike _ wore on just two days
before the start of the World Cup.
	   And somewhere in between, more teams set up training camps
throughout the countryside in anticipation of their first-round
games. Oddly enough, the latest arrivals were the French, who had
escaped all the hype to work out in Finland for a few days.
	   ``The team is bubbling with impatience,'' coach Aime Jacquet
said as his squad settled in Clairfontaine, among the woods
southwest of Paris.
	   Blatter, FIFA's general secretary and choice of outgoing
president Joao Havelange, defeated European confederation chief
Lennart Johansson 111-80 in balloting among FIFA membership.
Blatter, from Switzerland, needed two-thirds of the votes for an
outright victory, but his Swedish opponent conceded before a second
ballot could be held.
	   ``I would like to thank all of you _ those who voted for me and
those who did not vote for me, because we are in a democracy. The
great thing to do is to unite the family,'' said Blatter, who then
praised Johansson as a ``gentleman'' and a ``friend.''
	   Both candidates had promised to make FIFA more open and
democratic, a contrast to the dictatorial style associated with
Havelange. Among their differences was the proposed location for
the 2006 World Cup: Blatter has all but promised the tournament to
Africa for the first time, while Johansson favored Germany.
	   ``The result is there, consequently he is the winner and we will
have to cooperate for the good of the game,'' Johansson said. ``But
we're not dropping our program. I'm loyal to the president, but I'm
not going to obey everything he says.''
	   The election ended a bitter, globe-trotting campaign that cost
more than a million dollars.
	   ``There may have been a few fouls, but we never tackled from
behind,'' Johansson said. ``Now we need to think of what is fair.''
	   Havelange, 82, who chose not to run for another four-year term
amid questions of corruption and growing criticism of his
administration, wiped away tears after the result was announced.
His 24-year tenure as FIFA president expires at the end of the
World Cup.
	   As the ceremonies continued inside the Equinox Hall, French
authorities were combing the country in their vigilant campaign
against terrorist threats to disrupt the World Cup. Nine more
suspects were arrested Monday, and police urged the public to watch
out for bombs.
	   The suspects were considered close to aides of Hassan Hattab, a
leader of the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria, who allegedly has
ordered an attack during the tournament.
	   ``We have to be vigilant, every citizen must be vigilant without
losing their cool,'' Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement
said. ``If you see something suspect, first get away, then call.''
	   Seven of the suspects were arrested in the Paris area, while two
other people were apprehended in the southern city of Carpentras
and the northern city of Roubaix, police said.
	   Meanwhile, there was a novel twist in the eight-day old strike
by Air France pilots. The SNPL, main pilots' union, made an
unexpected offer to work for free to fly foreign fans to the World
Cup games.
	   Air France said it would study the measure, but three smaller
pilot unions on Monday rejected the proposal, saying they would
advise members not to cooperate.
	   The walkout shows no sign of ending soon, and is certain to
disrupt the World Cup, which begins Wednesday when Brazil plays
Scotland and Norway faces Morocco.
	   The huge cache of political developments overshadowed the
supposed centerpiece of the tournament _ the players.
	   Belgium, in its fifth consecutive World Cup, began training at
Monthieux in the eastern part of France and wasted no time praising
its neighbor, the Netherlands. The two teams meet in the first
round Saturday.
	   ``I'm so impressed with the Dutch,'' coach Georges Leekens said.
``It's a machine that is far better than we are.''
	   Another injury to versatile defender and midfielder Thomas
Helmer provided a damper to Germany's first full day of practice in
Nice.
	   Helmer showed up lame after hurting his right thigh in Sunday's
workout. Also missing was wing back Christian Ziege, who is
battling a fever.
	   ``It's a real, real shame for Thomas,'' coach Berti Vogts said.
``He was being treated this morning and perhaps he can do some
light jogging this afternoon.''
	   South Korea worked out under a cloak of secrecy, revealing few
tactics in a two-hour session opened to the public. Coach Cha
Bum-kun, who would not let his players speak to the foreign media,
said his biggest concern was a knee injury suffered last week by
three-time World Cup veteran striker Hwang Sun-hong.
	   ``It is a very grave situation,'' Cha said. ``... He's out of
the first game against Mexico, but I hope that he might recover to
play later in the tournament.''

	   RESEARCH and standards body Sirim Berhad is spending RM10.4
million this year in developing mission-critical information
technology (IT) applications to computerise its business and
workflow activities.
	   Its general manager IT department Abdullah Abd Hamid said these
applications are aimed at meeting the day-to-day IT requirements of
its five departments, namely Standards and Quality Services,
Engineering Services, Research and Development (R&AMP;D) Services,
Operations, and Corporate Services.
	   He said Sirim has so far developed a number of applications
which are the Quality Assurance System that handles ISO
certification for its clients, and the Project Monitoring System
which manages its internal and external projects including R&AMP;D
initiatives carried out with partners.
	   ``Under the allocated budget, we have also developed our
information kiosk system called Sirim Active X, our Sirim Active I
home page, and the Asset Management System,'' he told Computimes in
Shah Alam last week.
	   According to Abdullah, another application which is in the
development stage is the lead management system or help desk system
that keeps track of calls made to Sirim for enquiries, complaints
or comments, with regards to quality or standards.
	   Apart from that, Sirim is also working on another application -
the Testing Management System - which manages the process workflow
of product testing.
	   ``This system, to be implemented in the Standards and Quality
Services department, will be able to track down the process, from
the point Sirim receives a product for testing to the actual
testing of the product,''
	   Abdullah said.
	   According to him, Sirim completed a two-month study of the
system's requirements last month, and will immediately begin
developing the system.
	   Valued at RM600,000, the Testing Management System is expected
to be deployed within the Sirim environment by year-end.
	   Abdullah also said that Sirim, in collaboration with the Small
and Medium Industries Development Corporation (Smidec), is also
building an electronic database comprising a list of companies
categorised as small and medium-sized industries (SMIs).
	   ``Available database systems on SMIs in the country today are
either paper-based, or not comprehensive,'' he said, adding that
setting up an electronic database on SMIs is therefore important.
	   The SMIs database, which costs about RM200,000 to develop, is
targeted to go live next year.
	   ``It will be like the Yellow Pages of SMIs, but with more
detailed information such as profiles and business activities of
the companies,''
	   said Abdullah.
	   He added that the database was developed in order to assist
Sirim in evaluating applications from SMIs for capital incentives
under the Government's Industrial Technical Assistance Fund (ITAF)
programmes.
	   Sirim is responsible in assessing applications for the ITAF2
programme, which covers product development and design, and ITAF3,
for quality and productivity improvement.
	   In addition, the database is also expected to facilitate foreign
companies seeking local partners among the SMIs.
	   Abdullah said information from the database could also be shared
electronically among SMIs via a common network, thus enabling these
companies to exchange expertise and resources in their
manufacturing and business activities.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Education Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Najib
Tun Razak today urged teachers not to depend too much on textbooks
but to be creative when educating their pupils on environmental
protection.
	   He said the aim should be to instil a deep-rooted awareness of
and love for the environment.
	   He said this after launching the ``Wira Alam'' project and the
``Malaysia: Agenda 21 Versi Kanak-kanak'' (Malaysia: Agenda 21
Childen's Edition) and ``Alam Sekitar Anugerah Tuhan''
(Environment, a Gift from God) books at the Malaysian Islamic
Understanding Institute (Ikim).
	   The launch was jointly conducted with Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Datuk Law Hieng Ding.
	   Najib also said there should be an environment club in all
schools to create awareness among schoolchildren.
	   ``Most schools have already set up the club. The ones that have
yet to do so should do it soon,'' he said.
	   He said teachers and headmasters should encourage pupils to
participate in activities organised by the club.
	   The book ``Environment, a Gift from God'' was jointly published
by the Department of Environment and Ikim.
	   Law said its aim was to instil a love for the environment and to
create understanding about environment issues among schoolchildren.
	   The children's edition of the Agenda 21 was published by the DOE
based on the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit.
	   Both books are being distributed to all schools, public
libraries, universities and non-governmental organisations.
	   Najib said schools could use these books as a reference when
conducting lessons on the environment.
	   The ``Wira Alam'' project was initiated by the DOE and the
Malaysian Nature Society to provide motivation and an opportunity
to pupils to contribute to environmental conservation via
activities of school environment clubs.

	   Senior military junta officials chartered an airplane to take
them from the southern hub city of Lagos to the capital, Abuja, in
preparation of the funeral, the family said.
	   Abacha, 54, seized power in Nigeria in 1993 after canceling
presidential elections and suspending the constitution.
	   Although the army and police usually maintain a high profile on
the streets of Nigeria, the extraordinary move of sealing the head
of state's residence triggered rumors in the capital, Abuja.
	   Abacha, who was supposed to have been at a special function in
Lagos last week, failed to appear. He has made few public
appearances since he greeted Pope John Paul II in March.
	   Although he has pledged to hand the government over to an
elected civilian administration, in April he became the only
nominated candidate for the presidency.
	   Opposition to Abacha's rule has been mounting in recent months
with the prospect that his junta might not honor its pledge to
stand down.

Diplomats ordered to vacate official residences in Minsk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RAISE reference to violation of
international law, eviction would be the first of a U.S. embassy
facility since 1979, ADDS fresh quotes, detail. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus is trying to evict 22 ambassadors
from their homes in violation of international law and tried Monday
to weld shut a gate to the American residence, U.S. Ambassador
Daniel Speckhard said.
	   The Belarusian government served notice in April that it wanted
to overhaul water and sewage pipes in the diplomatic complex on the
outskirts of the capital, Minsk, where the ambassadors live with
their families, Speckhard said at a news conference.
	   Residents of the compound protested, saying they would prefer to
make arrangements to remain in the compound during the repairs,
Speckhard said.
	   Under international law, ambassadors' residences are considered
foreign territory and governments have no right to enter without
permission or insist that diplomats leave.
	   Speckhard called the incident the most serious violation of the
Vienna Convention on embassy operations since the end of the Cold
War.
	   ``I am confident that President (Alexander) Lukashenko is not
aware of all the details and will intervene with his bureaucracy to
save Belarus from irreparable damage,'' he said.
	   Speckhard took reporters to his home in the diplomatic complex
at Drozdy and arrived to find a team of workers and a policeman
trying to weld shut the side gate. A small American flag was lying
on the ground. The workers left when Speckhard protested.
	   Speckhard said that he doesn't doubt that some repairs are
needed on the pipes leading to the complex, built after World War
II to house the Communist Party elite. But he insisted that the
government must reach agreements with the foreign missions and
cannot simply evict them.
	   He said the United States has had a lease on the residence since
1992, the year after Belarus gained independence with the collapse
of the Soviet Union, and has spent dlrs 800,000 on repairs. The
lease does not expire until 2001.
	   If the government forcibly evicts the ambassadors, it would be
the first violation of the Vienna Convention since Iranian
militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, an embassy
spokeswoman said.
	   Speckhard said he and a number of other ambassadors are refusing
to vacate the compound, and appealed to Lukashenko to rescind the
order.
	   ``I am hopeful that this press conference today will help to
inform the president of the situation in case he has not been
receiving the right information from his bureaucracy,'' Speckhard
said.
	   The Belarusian Foreign Ministry offered the ambassadors small
apartments elsewhere in the city, an offer that embassy officials
said was unacceptable.

Boris Becker wavering on Wimbledon start
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ Boris Becker said Monday he might play
Wimbledon this year after all, just one week after saying the
opposite.
	   Becker told reporters that his decision to enter the All-England
Championships depended on how well he played at this week's Halle
tournament, a grass tuneup for Wimbledon.
	   ``On Friday, I will announce whether I play Wimbledon '98 or
not,'' said Becker.
	   Becker has until Monday to accept a wild card for the grand slam
where he enjoyed his greatest career success with three singles
titles and six finals between 1985 and 1991.
	   Becker reached the semifinals at Halle last year, then was
ousted by Pete Sampras at Wimbledon. Afterwards, the former world
No. 1 said his 14th appearance was his last.
	   Since then Becker, who now only occasionally plays tournaments
and has moved into developing young German talent, has changed his
mind several times.

EU struggles with imposition of gradual ban of drift nets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) - The EU governments struggled Monday with a
proposal to gradually ban drift nets that are miles long and cause
the death of thousands of species such as seals, dolphins and
whales.
	   After seven hours of talks, the EU fisheries ministers were
deadlocked on when the ban should begin. France, Italy, Ireland and
Greece object to a ban in general arguing it threatens the
livelihood of fishermen.
	   EU Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino, and Britain, which now
holds the EU rotating presidency, have proposed to phase out all
drift nets as of Dec. 31, 2000.
	   ``I would like to see agreement to phase out fishing with drift
nets because of the side effects on dolphins ... Britain will
certainly be voting for that,'' Britain's Agriculture Minister Jack
Cunningham told reporters on arrival here.
	   France, which has some 40 vessels using drift nets based in its
Atlantic ports, says if it comes to a transitional period, it wants
a period of at least six years.
	   Italy argues Morocco and Tunisia are worse offenders. But EU
officials say Italy is the worst in the EU and estimate that its
plan to convert 500 vessels that now drag drift nets would still
leave some 200 in operation.
	   The issue has been on the table for years without EU nations
being able to agree on a ban.
	   In 1992, the United Nations imposed a general moratorium on
drift nets. The EU responded by limiting them to 1.5 miles (2.5
kilometers) but under the EU proposal all nets would be banned as
of 2000.
	   Ecological groups, including Greenpeace have denounced the use
of the nets which they say catch animals fishermen don't want such
as sharks, dolphins, whales, turtles and diving birds.
	   The drift nets are dragged through the water and because they
are so long they have been nicknamed ``walls of death.''
	   Greenpeace said in a statement 1998 ``is the UN International
Year of the Ocean and, after dragging its feet for years, the EU
can make a real contribution to protect the oceans.''
	   The organization displayed part of a drift net outside the EU
conference building where foreign ministers met.
	   The RSPCA, the British animal protection organization, published
a report last September highlighting the devastation and suffering
caused by drift nets.
	   The report revealed that in one season alone almost 83,000 blue
sharks were caught by French boats, 8,000 dolphins by Italian
fishermen. Additionally, as many as 800 leatherback turtles died in
drift nets.

 &UR; With BC-Sports-Soccer-FIFA President &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ He's clowned with Robin Williams and cooed with
Sophia Loren. He's also banished long-time aides and been labeled a
despot.
	   Just like the sport he now runs, Sepp Blatter has many sides,
from whimsical to vicious.
	   Blatter was elected Monday as president of FIFA, the
international soccer federation. He won when the only other
candidate, European soccer union chief Lennart Johansson, conceded
after a first ballot in which neither man gained enough votes for
victory but cast Blatter as a surefire winner in the second round.
	   While he was in the race officially for only 2 1-2 months,
Blatter has been preparing for the FIFA presidency for more than 17
years, since he became secretary general running the federation's
day-to-day operations from a hilltop office in Zurich, Switzerland.
	   Since FIFA's executive committee meets just twice a year, it's
been up to Blatter to implement policy for the world's most popular
sport, and even he admits he has not always done that to everyone's
liking.
	   ``They've called me a dictator, a despot. They want Blatter
out,'' he said of his critics last week. ``But I do not do this for
personal ambition. I do it as someone who cares for sport.''
	   Joseph ``Sepp'' Blatter was born March 10, 1936, in the Swiss
village of Visp. He played soccer and became general secretary of
the Swiss Ice Hockey Federation after receiving business and
economics degrees from the University of Lausanne.
	   He joined FIFA as director of technical development programs in
1975 and six years later was appointed secretary general. He added
the title of chief executive office in 1990, and he said last week
that he'd run the presidency as if he were heading a corporate
business.
	   Four years ago, when it looked as if Joao Havelange might be
vulnerable in a run for a sixth term as FIFA president, Blatter
briefly toyed with opposing his boss, but he dropped the idea and
watched the Brazilian win again by acclamation. When they got back
to Zurich after the World Cup in the United States, he and
Havelange cleaned house of staff members they thought were disloyal
or otherwise dangerous, and Havelange backed Blatter this time.
	   Blatter speaks five languages and enjoys being in the spotlight.
At the World Cup draw in Rome in 1990, he shared host duties with
the stunning Loren, a difficult task for any trouper. Blatter loved
it.
	   Four years later, the draw was in Las Vegas, and Williams, the
comic actor who makes a hummingbird seem calm, was on the stage as
co-emcee.
	   ``Oh, Mr. Blatter!'' Williams cried, rolling the ``t's'' into
`'d's.'' ``I've waited all my life to meet you.''
	   Blatter laughed and enjoyed the joke.
	   Blatter is divorced and has one daughter.

German presidents admonishes companies not to neglect job-creation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ A day before the release of new
figures that should show some easing of Germany's unemployment
crisis, President Roman Herzog admonished businesses Monday not to
neglect their responsibility to create jobs as well as profits.
	   Speaking before union leaders at the annual convention of the
German Labor Federation, Herzog said some companies have taken to
downsizing and job cuts ``like an Olympic discipline'' in the
pursuit of higher earnings.
	   But, he added, ``whoever focuses only on stock market records
loses public trust easily.''
	   Concessions by workers in raises and other areas need to be
rewarded through job security, Herzog said. He also called for more
union flexibility in the creation of part-time jobs and for a
crackdown on the shadow economy, which is growing outside the reach
of tax collectors.
	   Meanwhile, statistics to be released by the Federal Labor Office
on Tuesday were expected to show unemployment in Germany dipping
below 11 percent for the first time since 1996.
	   In a preview last week, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the number
of unemployed in May dropped to 10.9 percent, or 4.2 million, down
from 11.4 percent in April.

Talks held in bid to avert South African teachers strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The government and a teachers
union met on Monday to try to negotiate an agreement and avert a
strike over new regulations that the union claims will result in
layoffs of thousands of teachers.
	   Talks were proceeding in a constructive spirit and both sides
were willing to continue meeting for as long as necessary in order
to reach an agreement, said Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu.
	   The South African Democratic Teachers' Union planned to begin
protest actions, including work slowdowns and picketing, on Tuesday
if the talks fell through. SADTU has more than 170,000 members.
	   The smaller National Professional Teachers Organization and the
South African teachers Union have also served notice they plan to
organize a strike. They have not announced specific plans.
	   The unions say new regulations could result in at least 50,000
teachers losing their jobs and an increase in student-teacher
ratios. The unions want the regulations rescinded.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military strongman Gen. Sani
Abacha has died after suffering a heart attack, close friends of
Abacha's family said Monday.
	   In keeping with Muslim practice, a funeral will be within the
next 24 hours, said relatives who spoke to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
	   The government has no official confirmation of Abacha's death,
but government leaders had convened an emergency meeting in Abuja,
the capital.
	   Senior military junta officials chartered an airplane to take
them from the southern hub city of Lagos to the capital, Abuja, in
preparation for the funeral, the family said.
	   Abacha, 54, seized power in Nigeria in 1993 after canceling
presidential elections and suspending the constitution.
	   Although the army and police usually maintain a high profile on
the streets of Nigeria, the extraordinary move of sealing the head
of state's residence triggered rumors in Abuja.
	   Abacha, who was supposed to have been at a function in Lagos
last week, did not appear. He has made few public appearances since
he greeted Pope John Paul II in March.
	   Although he has pledged to hand the government over to an
elected civilian administration, in April he became the only
nominated candidate for the presidency.
	   Opposition to Abacha's rule has been mounting in recent months
with the prospect that his junta might not honor its pledge to
stand down.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Aircraft used for aerial surveillance and
cloud- seeding will be installed with global positioning system for
more effective land and forest fires monitoring.
	   Science, Technology and Environment Minister Datuk Law Hieng
Ding said today the GPS, a network of satellites, could help the
authorities immediately detect fires and pinpoint the exact
location of the incidents.
	   ``These aircraft can be used not only for Malaysia, but also for
our neighbouring countries, particularly Indonesia.
	   ``As such, we have to get consent from Indonesia to allow our
aircraft to cross the borders when the need arises,'' he said after
launching the Wira Alam project, and the Malaysia: Agenda 21 -
Children's Version and Alam Sekitar Anugerah Tuhan books at the
Islamic Institute of Understanding Malaysia, at Langgak Tunku, off
Jalan Duta.
	   The launch was carried out jointly with Education Minister Datuk
Seri Najib Tun Razak.
	   Information Minister Datuk Mohamed Rahmat, who will be meeting
with Indonesian officials soon to discuss the implementation of the
Memorandum of Understanding on Disasters, is seeking approval for
future cross-border operations.
	   At present, 10 aircraft including helicopters being used for
aerial surveillance and cloud-seeding have already been installed
with GPS.
	   Law said a mobile GPS unit would cost about RM25,000 each and a
fixed one RM53,000. The battery for the mobile unit can only last
for two hours.
	   He said the units were easily available in Malaysia.
	   The Malaysian Centre for Remote Sensing has been asked to assist
in the installation process.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his
ministers arrived Monday in Germany, a key trading partner, seeking
counsel on their financial turmoil at home.
	   Yeltsin's talks with his good friend, Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
were expected to focus on international credit for Russia following
a collapse in Russia's financial markets last month.
	   ``New problems keep emerging which need to be solved quickly and
energetically, and the both of us, Helmut and I, will solve these
problems this way,'' Yeltsin said upon arrival at the Bonn-Cologne
military airport.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - A former officer with the Domestic Trade
and Consumer Affairs Ministry told the High Court today that she
received numerous complaints about direct selling company Nanang
International Sdn Bhd.
	   Noriyah Ahmad said the complaints were made in July 1995 through
telephone calls and letters to her office.
	   She had earlier testified that the complaints were about the
marketing plan used by the company in selling its Chinese herbal
products and also the company's licence.
	   Noriyah, now with the Energy, Telecommunications and Posts
Ministry, said she had given this information to The Malay Mail
journalist Yushaimi Yahaya when he called her at her office to find
out about Nanang International.
	   She was giving evidence in a defamation suit filed by Nanang
International against Yushaimi, New Straits Times Sdn Bhd group
editor Datuk A. Kadir Jasin, and the publisher, The New Straits
Times Press (M) Bhd.
	   Nanang International claimed that a series of articles published
in The Malay Mail and the New Straits Times between April and May
1996 had defamed it as they meant, among others, the company was
operating illegally, was marketing the product by using the
outlawed pyramid system and had used influential persons to put
pressure on enforcement officers.
	   The company is claiming damages with interest and costs.
	   The defendants pleaded justification and claimed that the
articles were not defamatory.
	   On the Ministry's rejection of Nanang International's
application to renew its licence, Noriyah said the Ministry was not
compelled to inform the company of the reasons for rejection.
	   Nanang International was represented by Harpal Singh while
Lorraine Cheah appeared for the defendants. Hearing continues.

	   A MODEST wholesale market offering Malaysian-made goods and
agricultural produce to shoppers to be opened in Padang Besar in
mid-June, will provide the foundation for the proposed Common
Border Wholesale Market.
	   The Common Border Wholesale Market (CBWM) is one of the
Indonesia- Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle's high priority
projects.
	   As Thailand will also start a similar venture on its side of the
border, the two are expected to merge eventually into the proposed
CBWM.
	   The Seventh IMT-GT Senior Officials' Meeting in Perak last
November hoped the project would be in place in three years.
	   The CBWM was recommended by the Asian Development Bank and
endorsed by the grouping in December 1995. Its formation was
confirmed last October in Perlis during the Fourth IMT-GT Meeting
of Working Group on Agriculture and Fisheries Co-operation.
	   The CBWM's main objectives are to organise existing activities,
create a proper trading place and serve as a collecting and
auctioning centre for agricultural, livestock and fisheries
products.
	   When the project eventually takes off, Indonesia can also
purchase properties developed within the CBWM and take part in its
trading activities.
	   The CBWM itself is a mere component of a Friendship City which
the IMT- GT envisages as a commercial and industrial centre on the
Malaysia-Thai border.
	   The city - a 50-hectare site straddling the common border has
been allocated for its creation - is conceptualised as a stop-over
destination to facilitate movement of goods and people. It would
have a common entry point and operation procedures.
	   Perlis Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim was visibly
pleased when announcing the launch of the wholesale market.
	   ``Big business usually starts from a small scale. It may
initially resemble those markets and bazaars often found in
Europe's frontier regions.
	   ``The basic aims are similar - to nurture more aggressive
shopping and encourage retailers to expand across the border,'' he
adds.
	   ``Since consumers on the Malaysia-Thai border have always been
sensitive to price differences, a wholesale market may increase the
incentive for them to shop around.''
	   Shahidan says the CBWM is a signal that viable projects within
the IMT- GT, and even within Asean, should not be delayed because
of the current difficulties.
	   ``This will at least fill the void created by the slowdown of
public sector investments at a time when Asean economies are facing
currency fluctuation problems,'' he says.
	   Of course, the Perlis Government is particularly keen on the
CBWM as it has high hopes for the project to help check plummeting
business at Malaysia's northernmost border checkpoint.
	   Traditionally, Padang Besar is a major exit point for Thai
products destined for export via the Penang deep-sea port.
	   However, following the opening of the North-South Expressway
linking Penang and Bukit Kayu Hitam five years ago, local traders
have been moaning about a 30 per cent fall in business activities.
	   They claim with some justification that the highway has diverted
a significant share of their business to Bukit Kayu Hitam.
	   Meanwhile, the Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry Malaysia,
Perlis branch, chaired by Shahidan until recently, has proposed
three projects to complement the CBWM.
	   Its Smart Regional Agricultural Marketing will provide on-line
digital information services on the marketing of agricultural
produce by IMT-GT member countries to create wider opportunities
for producers and consumers.
	   The chamber says the project is based on the borderless
marketing strategy, using a web site on-line facilities which could
be made available to subscribers.
	   ``The system will be an information-rich outfit capable of
providing vital statistical data on all aspects of marketing within
the sub-region, encompassing technical specifications of products,
home shopping, order entry and on-line payment.'' Its Hort Garden
Centre project aims at providing a platform for easier exchange of
agricultural produce and inputs required by businessmen and
farmers.
	   As complete product listings of important commodities from
member countries will be made available, the project will help
simplify sourcing of agricultural inputs.
	   Through the arrangement, the chamber says any trade encumbrances
in the form of unnecessary taxation would be done away with.
	   ``The transaction of goods will be either on a bulk-order or
exchange basis, or both, based on the `nearest location supply and
delivery base' concept.
	   ``Orders could be made in advance and supplies delivered on time
using the Smart Regional Agricultural Marketing outfit,'' it
explains.
	   The chamber's Agro-Link Food Processing joint venture is
intended to take advantage of the availability of raw materials
like chicken, meat and even fruits and vegetables for the
production of value-added processed goods.
	   The project is based on the concept of sharing of resources to
produce goods expected to be demanded by the sub-region's
fast-growing population.
	   The chamber argues that production costs could be maintained to
a minimum and competitive level because the project tends to
utilise raw materials available locally.
	   ``Finished products will be sold in member countries through a
smart marketing outlet which allows placing of orders through
digital home- shopping.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul McCartney penned the Beatles hit ``Let it
Be'' in homage to his mother, who died of breast cancer when he was
just 14. On Monday, McCartney gathered family and friends to
remember his wife Linda, who died of the same disease in April _
and, again, he sought solace in the haunting ballad.
	   The singer's office said hundreds of mourners would sing ``Let
it Be'' at a private service in the historic church of St.
Martins-in-the-Fields Monday night in tribute to Mrs. McCartney,
photographer, vegetarian, animal rights campaigner, musician, wife
_ and mom. The other two surviving Beatles, Ringo Starr and George
Harrison, were scheduled to attend.
	   In adjoining Trafalgar Square, animal rights activists were
setting up a giant pair of angel's wings for condolence messages.
And vegetarian children were to lay flowers beside a large
photograph of Mrs. McCartney, the singer's office said.
	   McCartney, 55, said he wanted the service to celebrate the full
range of his wife's passions.
	   His office said Harrison and Starr were invited to be part of
the congregation but there were no plans for the three former
Beatles to sing together. John Lennon, the fourth Beatle, was shot
to death in New York City in 1980.
	   McCartney will be accompanied by the couple's children, Heather,
36, his wife's daughter by her first marriage, and Mary, 27,
Stella, 26, and James, 21. Attendance is by invitation only.
	   Hundreds of animal activists planned a candlelight vigil outside
the church.
	   Writer Carla Lane, a longtime family friend, said she will
represent them inside.
	   ``I will be reading a message to Linda from the people in the
square,'' she said. ``I believe there will be a brief mourning and
then a celebration of Linda's life. Paul does not want it to be a
morbid affair.''
	   She said the service will comfort the mourning star, who
willingly spent only one night apart from his wife in nearly 30
years of marriage. ``He's a very sad man. I think he needs today
and then he'll go forward,'' she told Independent Television News.
	   Singer Elton John delayed plans to fly out of Britain so he
could attend. ``Linda was always very kind to me and she was a
special person,'' he told ITN. ``Out of respect to her family I
want to be there.''
	   The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals said supporters are coming from many countries, including
Germany, France and Italy. ``Linda inspired a generation with her
activism, much as her husband inspired people with his music,'' the
group said in a statement.
	   The McCartneys, married since 1969, announced in December 1995
that Mrs. McCartney was being treated for breast cancer.
	   The treatment at first appeared to be working well, but in March
the cancer was found to have spread to her liver. Mrs. McCartney
died at the family's ranch in Arizona on April 19.
	   She was cremated soon afterward and her ashes were scattered on
the family farm in Sussex county south of London.
	   McCartney, who was knighted last year, has hardly been seen in
public since his wife's death, but was recently photographed
lighting a candle in Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral after visiting
Stella, the chief fashion designer for the French house Chloe.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Twelve hours after collecting vehicles from
the manufacturers, limousines and executive coaches which
complement the Kuala Lumpur International Airport's public
transportation system were put on trial runs today.
	   Traffic congestion on major city roads following this morning's
downpour, delayed the ``scheduled'' trial runs by almost an hour.
	   Despite the downpour and late arrivals, the journey proper from
the temporary terminal at the Tun Razak hockey stadium car park in
Jalan Duta, went without a hitch.
	   Drivers taking part in the trial run said the vehicles were
collected from the manufacturers last night.
	   To get a first-hand view of operations, Entrepreneur Development
Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed turned up to take part in the trial
runs.
	   Accompanying him were his deputy Datuk Idris Jusoh, Ministry
secretary- general Datuk Abdullah Tahir, Commercial Vehicle
Licensing Board chairman Zakiah Hashim and senior Ministry
officials.
	   Also present were Datuk Mohd Nor Mohamad, DRB-Hicom senior group
director, which is invovled in the Kuala Lumpur City Bus company,
and Badardin Ahmad, Airport Limo managing director.
	   Besides the Airport Limo limousines, KLCB executive coaches and
PlusLiner coaches, red-and-white taxis were also invited to take
part in the trial runs.
	   Speaking to the media later, Mustapa said the journey went
without a hitch.
	   ``I am glad we had a smooth trip,'' he said.
	   He also expressed satisfaction with facilities for the executive
coaches and limousines available at the KLIA.
	   Leaving the hockey stadium carpark at 10.10am, the convoy of
vehicles proceeded towards the North Klang Valley Expressway, via
the Jalan Duta exit.
	   Proceeding along the NKVE, the convoy turned into the Elite
expressway at the Batu Tiga interchange.
	   At 11am, the convoy pulled into the KLIA's main terminal where
KLCB and Airport Limo's depots are located.
	   Present at the main terminal were senior officials from KLIA
Berhad, including its chairman Tan Sri Clifford Herbert, and
Malaysia Airports Bhd executives.
	   The ``passengers'' alighted at the KLCB terminal and were shown
check-in counter facilities at the bus terminal.
	   ``This enables passengers to check in their luggage, collect the
boarding passes and proceed to their departure gates without having
to lug their baggage around,'' a senior MAB official said.
	   For the return journey, passengers would be able to board the
limousines at the main terminal's arrival lounge while those
boarding the buses can do so at the KLCB terminal.

	   MALACCA, Fri. - MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik said
he would not say ``a single bad word'' against businessman Datuk
Soh Chee Wen who had yesterday resigned from all his party posts.
	   ``This is what I hope to promote in the party ... cooperation
and the interest of the party must be placed above one's personal
interest.
	   ``My attitude towards party members is that I will not say one
single bad word against them,'' he said.
	   Dr Ling, who is also Transport Minister, was asked to comment on
Soh's resignation.
	   A statement faxed by Soh's special assistant Lee Chai Huat said
Soh had resigned as deputy chairman of MCA Selangor, chairman of
the Selangor Councillor Selection Committee and MCA divisional
chairman for Petaling Jaya Selatan.
	   Soh had confirmed he had been asked to submit his resignation by
Dr Ling.
	   It was learnt that Soh was not re-appointed after the end of his
one- year term as an appointed member of the presidential council.
	   He was appointed a central committee member after the party's
last triennial election held in 1996. He has also resigned from the
post.
	   Soh is president and chief executive officer of Promet Bhd,
executive chairman of Uniphoenix Corporation Bhd, executive
director and chief executive officer of Plantation and Development
Bhd and managing director of Kelanamas Bhd and Inno-Pacific
Holdings Ltd.
	   Asked if the party would convene a central committee meeting to
discuss the matter, Dr Ling said it was up to the president to
decide who will replace Soh. ``I have the power to do so and I can
do so at any time.
	   ``If there are interested persons who can present us with good
ideas, we can appoint them right up for the post in the central
committee,'' he said.

	   PENANG, Fri. - The Tanjung Umno Youth has reiterated its call
for the resignation of the Penang Island Municipal Council
president Dr Teng Hock Nan.
	   The call was made today by its deputy chief Jalaluddin Md Ismail
in a Press statement.
	   This was despite the apology tendered by its head Raja Munir
Raja Mustapha Shah last month.
	   Jalaluddin said the apology to Dr Teng was Raja Munir's personal
action which had nothing to do with the Tanjung Umno Youth's stand.
	   ``We still want to have Dr Teng replaced as the council
president,'' he said, adding that it had recently passed a
no-confidence motion on the State Umno Youth deputy chief Mohamad
Ismail Mohd Othman on the issue of apology.
	   ``The matter has been raised to the State Youth leader Dr Abdul
Rahim Md Ghouse and national Youth chief Datuk Ahmad Zahid
Hamidi.''
	   Meanwhile, Raja Munir denied a Press report that he had
apologised to Dr Teng for his remarks on the council president.
	   He told the New Straits Times he had never apologised for making
the call for Dr Teng's resignation.
	   Raja Munir, a councillor, had last month caused a political
uproar when he said Dr Teng had been treating fellow councillors as
mere ``rubber stamps'' in major decision-making matters.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Police today arrested a man in connection
with a RM50,000 heist at a goldsmith shop in Jalan Kelang Lama,
where its proprietress was shot and injured by one of three robbers
last month.
	   A police party from the City Criminal Investigation Department
nabbed the man at a house in Bandar Sri Damansara about 10.30am.
	   He then led the party, led by Assistant Superintendent Thomas
Navamoney, to a workshop in Sri Segambut where a .45 Colt pistol
and a .38 Colt revolver were seized.
	   This brings to two, the number of people detained in connection
with the robbery at the Kedai Emas Lei Kim which occurred about
3.30pm on May 21.
	   The other man was detained when he sought treatment for a
gunshot wound in the shoulder at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital, a day
after the robbery.
	   City Criminal Investigation Department chief Senior Assistant
Commissioner II Mat Drus Sudin confirmed the arrest of the second
man and the seizure of the guns.
	   It is learnt the police have established the identity of the
suspected robber who is still at large.
	   In the robbery, the 36-year-old goldsmith shop proprietress was
shot and injured in the abdomen by one of the three robbers who
opened fire.
	   On seeing the commotion, a security guard at the shop returned
fire at the three men while they were trying to escape with three
trays of jewellery worth about RM50,000, hitting one of them.
	   However, the robbers escaped in a car which was found abandoned,
about a kilometre away from the shop.

	   DECANI, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Scenes of devastation reminiscent of
Bosnia confronted diplomats escorted into battle-torn western
Kosovo _ target of a Serb offensive that prompted foreign powers
Monday to impose new sanctions on Serbia.
	   Besides burned-out houses and deserted villages, whose forced
evacuation have provoked comparisons to ethnic cleansing, visitors
to the besieged zone saw evidence of fierce fighting between the
Serbs and ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   Along with continued clashes and shelling Monday, the first-hand
look at the devastation provides stark evidence of a fast-worsening
scenario that Western powers fear could turn into another, broader
Balkan war.
	   ``What we've seen is all sorrow, all grief... all those villages
burned and destroyed, all the people had left,'' said Dutch
ambassador Jan Sizoo.
	   Sizoo was in the first group of foreign diplomats to visit the
Decani region of western Kosovo, on Sunday, since Serb police and
army forces began a punishing offensive there in late May.
Journalists were turned back from another convoy that went into the
region Monday.
	   The destruction in the southern Serb province has increased
foreign pressure on Serbia to stop using its police and army
against militants battling for independence for Kosovo's 9-to-1
ethnic Albanian majority. Tens of thousands of villagers have fled
during the latest offensive.
	   The European Union tightened sanctions against Belgrade on
Monday _ banning new investments in Serbia and freezing its assets
abroad _ and urged NATO to consider military intervention.
	   Washington also has vowed to take strong action in the face of
the crackdowns by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   A prominent Kosovo Albanian, Nekibe Kelmendi, welcomed the EU
sanctions but said they were only a ``small step'' compared to the
situation on the ground.
	   Serb forces continued shelling the area around the Albanian
border Monday, according to the Kosovo Information Center, close to
the ethnic Albanian leadership. Its Serb counterpart, meanwhile _
the pro-Serb Media Center _ said ethnic Albanian militants attacked
two Serb villages in the Drenica region.
	   State-employed Serb journalists and this independent reporter
saw evidence Sunday of the fierce clashes and what the EU assailed
as ``widespread house-burning and indiscriminate artillery attacks
on whole villages.'' There also were clear signs of actions by the
pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army, which Serbs have accused
of attacks on Serb citizens as well as police.
	   After seeing only ``part of what one could call a battlefield,''
Sizoo said: ``We've been told (by Serb authorities) that the blame
is on the terrorists who started first. But, this statement is very
difficult to defend _ for a conflict you always need two parties.''
	   Streoce, the first village the convoy saw in northwestern
Kosovo, bore the marks of heavy fighting. More than 20 houses were
burned or shelled out, and only a few armed policemen were present.
	   On the outskirts of Decani, a town of 35,000, freshly
painted-over shop windows could not conceal graffiti praising the
Kosovo Liberation Army. A few Serb townspeople lingered about the
police station.
	   ``How long will they keep burning us out? Somebody has to take
the blame for all this _ either we, they (Albanians) or the
state,'' said a 70-year-old Serb who gave only his first name,
Sreten.
	   At the police station, the diplomats were shown an array of
weapons police said were confiscated from militants.
	   On the road to Djakovica, the scene recalled some of the worst
damages in Bosnia and Croatia. Many houses were gutted by flames.
Cartridges of different caliber littered the area.
	   In Prilep, seven kilometers (four miles) south of Decani, stray
cattle roamed the empty village. Houses were peppered with bullet
holes. Some had gashing holes made by grenades.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders say more than 50 people have been killed
in the offensive and some 200 men were missing and presumed
captured.
	   In Kosovo's capital Pristina, a daily march by Kosovo Albanians
for peace passed off without incident Monday. On Sunday, more than
100 Serbian police broke up the demonstration, injuring at least
six Albanians.
	   A woman who survived heavy fighting last week in Decani was
quoted by the ethnic Albanian daily Bujku as saying Serb shelling
was so heavy that several families hid in her cellar for a week.
Gasoline was uset to set fire to their crops, Donji Carabreg said.
	   Also Monday, Balkan foreign ministers meeting in Turkey
criticized Yugoslavia for human rights abuses in Kosovo but failed
to agree on a joint declaration on the deepening crisis.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The Ampang Sessions Court today fined a
contractor RM40,000 for carrying out open burning at a garbage dump
in Kajang.
	   PortPower (M) Sdn Bhd admitted burning the garbage at the dump
site about 4.30pm on April 9.
	   The company, situated at Jalan Melor Satu, Taman Sri Ramal,
Kajang, was represented by its directors Mohd Fadzil Mohd Said and
Hamzah Abdul Hamid, both 34.
	   It is responsible for supervising the disposal of garbage at the
Kajang Municipal Council garbage dumping site at Kampung Sungai
Kembong, Semenyih.
	   An officer from the Department of Environment and a technician
had discovered the open burning when checking the site.
	   The company was charged under Section 22(1) of the Environmental
Quality Act 1974 which carries a maximum fine of RM100,000 or five
year's jail or both.
	   In mitigation, counsel Mohd Bashir Abd Kadir, for PortPower,
said the incident was caused by a third party.
	   He said the company had spent about RM7,000 to spread sand over
the affected area and that it had pleaded guilty to save the
court's time.
	   The company, he said, had, in the interest of the public,
stationed a guard at the dump site.
	   Wan Abdul Latiff Wan Jaafar and Abdul Malik Ahmad prosecuted
before judge Hue Siew Kheng. PortPower paid the fine.

	   PENANG, Fri. - Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim
today announced a further allocation of RM500 million for the
Bumiputera Entrepreneurs Fund.
	   The Government had approved the sum to help small and
medium-sized Bumiputera companies recover their businesses.
	   ``Bank Negara will be directed to manage the implementation of
this fund as soon as possible,'' said Anwar, who is also Finance
Minister.
	   He said this after chairing the State Bumiputera Steering
Committee and State Umno liaison committee meetings today. He
criticised some local banks for withholding much needed credit for
businesses.
	   ``On the whole, banks have responded positively to the
Government's call to help businesses to carry on.
	   ``However, from the latest information received from Bank
Negara, it is clear that a few local banks have adopted an
irresponsible attitude in giving out very little credit - less than
five per cent to help businesses.
	   ``These banks instead chose to focus their lending solely for
inter-bank loans,'' he said, adding that this was against
Government policy.
	   ``While we don't say to whom loans should be given, the banks
should know that loans are needed by businesses and should lend out
to the credit lending limit we have set,'' he said.
	   ``I know of some local banks which are given the flexibility to
exceed the 15 per cent credit lending ceiling fixed by the
Government, with some even reaching 20 per cent.
	   ``However, on the whole, the credit lending ceiling should be at
15 per cent.''
	   He said the Government would continue to monitor the credit
demand through various funds like the national housing fund which
has been given RM2 billion, the Small and Medium Enterprises Fund
which has been granted RM1 billion and would give export credit to
help businesses.

	   PENANG, Fri. - Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim
said today that Bumiputera control in the State's business and
housing was still very small.
	   He said this was reflected in reports received by the State
Bumiputera steering committee and the State Umno.
	   It was thus understandable, he said, that the State Umno Youth
had been calling on the Government here, local authorities and
agencies to be fairer in the distribution (of projects and
licences) to Bumiputeras.
	   ``We cannot allow the gap to widen among the races as it will
cause problems,'' he told reporters after chairing the meetings of
the two bodies today.
	   Anwar said he had told the two bodies to relay their grievances
through the proper channels so as not to jeopardise inter-party
relations and cooperation.
	   ``I have advised them to negotiate directly with the State
Government, the local authorities or agencies concerned.
	   ``I have also asked the State Government, the Penang Island
Municipal Council (MPPP) and Seberang Prai Municipal Council (MPSP)
to consider their dissatisfaction because some of the reports and
figures are really worrying,'' he said.
	   Commenting on a memorandum from the State Umno Youth calling for
the presidents of the MPPP and MPSP who are politicians to be
replaced with administration officers, Anwar said: ``Their
memorandum stems from the unsatisfactory figures gleaned from the
point of the implementation of projects, Bumiputera control of
business, housing and sites for doing business,'' he said.
``However, the solution is not in replacing any person or
department, but in ensuring that implementation is in accordance to
agreed policies,'' he said.
	   Asked about an apparent split in the DAP, Anwar said it was an
internal party matter. ``The more members they sack, the less our
problems (will be),'' he quipped.
	   The DAP yesterday announced the indefinite suspension of
national vice- chairman Liew Ah Kim and treasurer Fung Ket Wing.
National publicity secretary Wee Choo Keong was relieved of his
post for criticising the party leadership.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Fri. - Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad said there should be maximum communication between the
Federal and Sabah Governments for a close working relationship.
	   Speaking during a brief stopover at the Kota Kinabalu
International Airport en route to Kuala Lumpur from Tokyo, he said
newly-appointed Chief Minister Tan Sri Bernard Dompok understood
the need for cordial ties with the Federal Government.
	   ``I have spoken to Dompok and he agrees that there should be
maximum communication so that when we do things we do it
together,'' he said.
	   Dr Mahathir had a 20-minute meeting with Dompok at the airport's
VIP lounge.
	   On the appointment of Datuk Osu Sukam as Sabah Deputy Chief
Minister and Finance Minister, he said it was aimed at further
strengthening the State Government in view of the forthcoming State
election.
	   He said Osu and Dompok could act as bridge between the State and
Federal Governments as both had served in the Federal Cabinet.
	   Dr Mahathir said Osu understood the importance of working
together in the Sabah Government and Barisan Nasional.
	   ``As we know, some day we will have an election and we cannot go
on thinking about minor things,'' he said.The Federal Government
would like to support the Sabah Government as much as possible.
	   The Prime Minister said there were many problems in Sabah, such
as water and electricity supply and other basic infrastructure.
	   He said the State's finances must be managed efficiently in view
of the economic problems.
	   ``We have to manage the finances of Sabah very well because
these are hard times and we cannot chop down trees the way we used
to before; so we have to be very careful.''
	   He said considering the coming State election, Sabah needed the
strongest possible combination in the State Cabinet.
	   ``We need the strongest possible combination and although Osu is
a Federal Minister, we think he has a big responsibility here.''
	   On Osu's replacement in the Federal Cabinet, Dr Mahathir said he
had yet to make a decision but it would be an Umno leader from
Sabah.
	   Asked about Dompok's unprecedented move to appoint his
predecessor Datuk Yong Teck Lee in the Cabinet, Dr Mahathir said
Yong had told him he would like to continue.
	   However, he said Yong did not want a post higher than an
ordinary Minister so that he could focus on other matters including
looking after his party.
	   He also said Yong's predecessor Datuk Salleh Tun Said was not
re- appointed to the Cabinet after his term expired on May 28, 1996
as he wanted a rest.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Fri. - Chief Minister Tan Sri Bernard Dompok said
today Finance Minister-designate Datuk Osu Sukam would take the
oath of office before the Yang di Pertua Negeri Tun Sakaran Dandai
at 11am on Monday.
	   Osu resigned as Federal Minister of Land and Cooperative
Development effective Monday to pave the way for his appointment.
	   It follows Datuk Abdul Ghapur Salleh's decision not be
re-appointed when the Cabinet under Dompok took the oath on May 28.
	   Dompok said Osu's appointment would further strengthen the State
Government, considering his 12 years in the Federal Government.
	   ``I have known him even before politics. With the experience we
have in Government all these years, I think there is no reason
people like us cannot work together for the good of the State and
the Government,'' he said.
	   Osu met Dompok at the Chief Minister's office this morning.
	   Meanwhile, Osu said although the State Cabinet comprised
experienced people, team work was more important.
	   The State Government must prove that despite the economic
problems, it could still meet the aspirations of the people.
	   On Ghapur's decision against re-appointment, Osu said it was his
(Ghapur) right.
	   ``What is important is he is sincere to give others a chance to
be appointed to the post,'' he told reporters before leaving for
Kuala Lumpur.
	   He added that Ghapur was still Sabah Umno deputy liaison chief.

While hailing progress, EU urges Bosnia to accelerate peace

implementation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The EU said Monday Bosnia-Herzegovina remained
en route to integration with the rest of Europe, yet urged its
foreign minister to accelerate implementation of the 1995 Dayton
peace accord.
	   ``The European Union will continue to help you if you help
yourselves and accept your responsibilities ... to build a
peaceful, democratic and open nation,'' British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook told Bosnian Foreign Minister Jadranko Prlic.
	   The EU has donated more than dlrs 2.2 billion in humanitarian
and economic aid for Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   It will remain the single biggest donor if the country remains
faithful to economic reform conditions dictated by the
International Monetary Fund, Cook said.
	   In his comments _ at a luncheon attended by Prlic and the 15 EU
foreign ministers _ Cook assessed the progress Bosnia has been
making to becoming a democratic nation since the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement and the road it must still travel.
	   He said political parties and freedom of expression must be
strengthened and ``the EU looks for substantial progress ... in
getting displaced persons and refugees safely back to their
homes,'' Cook said.
	   International and local officials have been at pains to combat a
trend of increasing ethnically motivated violence in Bosnia as they
seek to speed up refugee returns, a cornerstone of Bosnia's peace
accords.
	   Prlic told the EU more than 400,000 Bosnian refugees have
returned to their homes since 1995. That, however, contrasts with
1.8 million who must yet do that.

U.S. Reform Jews kept from praying at Jerusalem's Western Wall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A delegation of Reform Jews from the United
States held an emotional prayer session near Judaism's holiest site
on Monday, but Israeli police kept the group penned behind
barricades, far back from the Western Wall itself.
	   Some of the 150 men and women wept as they recited prayers and
sang songs, standing arm-in-arm behind metal police barriers about
100 yards (meters) from the Wall. A loose ring of police surrounded
the group.
	   The delegation, made up of rabbis and leaders of the American
Reform movement, is here to celebrate Israel's 50th anniversary and
to express its opposition to a bill that would deny recognition to
religious conversions performed in Israel by non-Orthodox rabbis.
	   The bill has outraged members of the non-Orthodox Reform and
Conservative movements, which are tiny in Israel but dominant among
Jews in the United States and other western countries.
	   ``We have come to stand with the people of Israel,'' said Rabbi
Eric Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations. ``But our joy is combined with worry and concern.''
	   Yoffie said the conversion bill would divide the Jewish people,
and was a ``slap in the face'' to overseas Jewry.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has moved forward with the
bill under pressure from the Orthodox political parties in his
coalition, which have threatened to bring down the government over
the issue.
	   The U.S. group will meet Friday with Netanyahu.
	   Yoffie also expressed frustration Monday that the group was kept
so far from the Wall.
	   ``Why do we need to pray in a corner, far from the Wall?'' he
asked. ``All Jews stood at Sinai. The holy places belong to all of
us.''
	   Following the prayer session, the group's members made
individual visits to the Wall, where worshippers are divided by sex
according to Orthodox custom. Yoffie said the group did not plan to
violate police orders and pray as a group at the Wall.
	   ``We're not here to provoke a fight,'' he said.
	   Earlier this month, ultra-Orthodox protesters threw garbage at a
mixed-sex group of Reform and Conservative Jews who prayed together
at the Wall, the first time that police allowed men and women to
pray together there.
	   On Monday, the American group was kept so far back that there
was almost no interaction with other worshippers, aside from the
curious glances of passersby.
	   Richard Heinrich of Buffalo Grove, Ill., said he was deeply hurt
by Israel's attitude toward Reform Jews
	   ``They don't believe that we're Jews,'' he said. ``It's going to
backfire _ blow up in their faces. They stand to lose the support
of American Jews.''
	   Heinrich said he was making his third visit to Israel, but did
not know if he would be back.
	   ``If you tell me that the way I worship _ I'm not a Jew _ it
bothers me to the core,'' he said.

	   PETALING JAYA, Fri. - Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad said today the suspension of two key DAP leaders and the
removal of another from their party positions, was an indication
that secretary-general Lim Kit Siang practices nepotism.
	   ``It looks likes Kit Siang is not concerned about his party. He
is more concerned about his son (MP for Kota Melaka Lim Guan Eng)
and his family.
	   This is actually, nepotism.
	   ``He chose his son as deputy secretary-general of the party. If
others do the same thing, he will call it nepotism.
	   ``DAP has not even formed the Government and he has already
given a place to his son. If DAP manages to form the Government one
day, his son, his wife and other family members will be in the
Cabinet,'' he said on his arrival at the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah
International Airport in Subang after a working visit to Japan.
	   On Wednesday, the DAP central executive committee suspended its
vice- chairman Liew Ah Kim and treasurer Fung Ket Wing for
criticising its leadership at party meetings.
	   National publicity secretary Wee Choo Keong was relieved of his
position.
	   Asked to comment on the action against the three, Dr Mahathir
said: ``The fact that Kit Siang had brought his son to contest in a
constituency which he himself used to contest (Kota Melaka),
already reveals elements of nepotism and cronyism.''

Rain interrupts women's Wimbledon warm-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Heavy rain washed out all matches
Monday on the opening day of a women's Wimbledon warmup tournament
where Steffi Graf is making her latest comeback.
	   The DFS Classic features the seven-time Wimbledon singles
champion, who accepted a wild card entry and was installed as the
No. 1 seed.
	   Graf, who has played in only two tournaments since surgery on an
injured knee last year, is looking for much needed match practice
before Wimbledon, which starts June 22.
	   The German star was given a bye into the second round here and
is not scheduled to play until Wednesday.
	   ``I'm happy to be here in Birmingham and I look forward to
competing again,'' Graf said after arriving Monday following a week
of practice in London. ``I'm hoping to play some matches before
Wimbledon _ I want to play as much as I can.''
	   Qualifying matches left over from the weekend were moved indoors
Monday to aviod a backlog as the tournament gets underway.
	   If the seedings hold form, Graf is expected to meet Romania's
Irlina Spirlea, the No. 2 seed, in the DFS Classic final.
	   The other top seeds are defending champion and No. 3 Nathalie
Tauziat of France, No. 4 Dominique Van Roost of Belgium and No. 5
Lisa Raymond of the United States.
	   It's been almost exactly one year since Graf, who turns 29
Sunday, had surgery to correct a knee injury.
	   She has attempted seven times to return to the WTA tour but
problems with her hamstring, ankle and knee have kept her away from
all but two tournaments.
	   In February, Graf won a match at Hanover before losing a

 &UR; Dictator, showman both sides of new soccer boss &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Soccer-FIFA President &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ He's clowned with Robin Williams and cooed with
Sophia Loren. He's also banished long-time aides and been labeled a
despot.
	   Just like the sport he now runs, Sepp Blatter has many sides,
from whimsical to vicious.
	   Blatter was elected Monday as president of FIFA, the
international soccer federation. He won when the only other
candidate, European soccer union chief Lennart Johansson, conceded
after a first ballot in which neither man gained enough votes for
victory but cast Blatter as a surefire winner in the second round.
	   While he was in the race officially for only 2 1-2 months,
Blatter has been preparing for the FIFA presidency for more than 17
years, since he became secretary general running the federation's
day-to-day operations from a hilltop office in Zurich, Switzerland.
	   Since FIFA's executive committee meets just twice a year, it's
been up to Blatter to implement policy for the world's most popular
sport, and even he admits he has not always done that to everyone's
liking.
	   ``They've called me a dictator, a despot. They want Blatter
out,'' he said of his critics last week. ``But I do not do this for
personal ambition. I do it as someone who cares for sport.''
	   Joseph ``Sepp'' Blatter was born March 10, 1936, in the Swiss
village of Visp. He played soccer and became general secretary of
the Swiss Ice Hockey Federation after receiving business and
economics degrees from the University of Lausanne.
	   He joined FIFA as director of technical development programs in
1975 and six years later was appointed secretary general. He added
the title of chief executive office in 1990, and he said last week
that he'd run the presidency as if he were heading a corporate
business.
	   Four years ago, when it looked as if Joao Havelange might be
vulnerable in a run for a sixth term as FIFA president, Blatter
briefly toyed with opposing his boss, but he dropped the idea and
watched the Brazilian win again by acclamation. When they got back
to Zurich after the World Cup in the United States, he and
Havelange cleaned house of staff members they thought were disloyal
or otherwise dangerous, and Havelange backed Blatter this time.
	   Blatter speaks five languages and enjoys being in the spotlight.
At the World Cup draw in Rome in 1990, he shared host duties with
the stunning Loren, a difficult task for any trouper. Blatter loved
it.
	   Four years later, the draw was in Las Vegas, and Williams, the
comic actor who makes a hummingbird seem calm, was on the stage as
co-emcee.
	   ``Oh, Mr. Blatter!'' Williams cried, rolling the ``t's'' into
`'d's.'' ``I've waited all my life to meet you.''
	   Blatter laughed and enjoyed the joke.
	   Blatter is divorced and has one daughter.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Youth and Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin
Yassin announced today that the Kuala Lumpur 1998 Commonwealth
Games is one country short of full participation - Tuvalu.
	   The last Games in Victoria, Canada in 1994 attracted 63
countries.
	   There are 69 member countries in the Commonwealth and St Helena
was the 68th country to confirm participation in the Kuala Lumpur
Games set for between Sept 11 and 21.
	   St Helena, which did not take part in the three previous Games,
confirmed participation earlier this week, and will send three
athletes and two officials.
	   ``I've asked Tan Sri Hashim Ali to invite two persons from
Tuvalu for the Games,'' said Muhyiddin at a briefing for newspaper
editors at his office.
	   Jen (R) Hashim is the executive chairman of Sukom Ninety Eight
Bhd, the organisers of the KL Games.
	   Sukom officials said this will be the first time that Tuvalu,
formerly called Ellice Islands, will participate in the Games if
they accept the invitation.

	   PETALING JAYA, Fri. - Three senior DAP members, who were
suspended on Wednesday, have called for an ``independent and
impartial'' committee to investigate charges levelled against them.
	   In a two-paragraph statement, national vice-chairman Liew Ah
Kim, party treasurer Fung Ket Wing and national publicity secretary
Wee Choo Keong said they were innocent of all charges levelled
against them by party secretary-general Lim Kit Siang.
	   Yesterday, during a Press conference in Malacca, Kit Siang said
the decision to remove them was taken following complaints from the
Malacca and Perak State committees.
	   Kit Siang charged they had made statements that had undermined
party morale, created confusion and caused disharmony as well as
disunity among members.
	   Meanwhile, at a Press conference at the party headquarters
today, Kit Siang said he could accept criticism at specific forums
but not falsehoods and baseless allegations.
	   Kit Siang read from a prepared text, and when asked to elaborate
by reporters, refused to answer any questions.
	   He declined to answer questions on what were the ``falsehoods
and baseless allegations'' levelled at party leaders but said the
central executive committee removed Wee because it had lost
confidence in him as the national publicity secretary.
	   He said the CEC did not decide on whether the three had breached
party discipline, as this matter had been referred to the
disciplinary committee headed by Ahmad Nor.
	   Kit Siang said he had spoken to Fung yesterday and hoped that
there would be a new beginning whereby every party leader could
come together to work for the greater good of the party and
country.
	   In another development, Kit Siang said the CEC had decided to
bring forward the party congress by four months to Aug 22-23. He
said this was decided at Wednesday night's meeting.
	   ``This is to allow the party to elect a new leadership,
especially as a general election is imminent,'' he added.

World Cup: Norwegians concentrate on set pieces
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ Check out Norway's set-piece statistics
in competitive games and it's easy to understand why the
``Drillos'' spent much of Monday's practice session working out on
free kicks, penalty shots and corner kicks.
	   During its unbeaten qualifying campaign, Norway scored 12 of its
21 goals after a dead-ball situation -- four on free kicks, four
after corner kicks, three after throw-ins and one penalty shot.
	   ``It was good to work on this during a closed practice
session,'' said coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen. ``There are no secrets
in soccer, but we hope to we able to come up with a surprising
set-piece trick.''
	   In just one of their eight qualifers, the 1-0 away win in
Azerbaijan that was the clinching point to France, did the
Norwegians fail to score off a dead ball situation.
	   Kjetil Rekdal, the midfielder who scored Norway's only goal in a
disappointing '94 World Cup, had three goals, one of them a free
kick and another one a penalty shot. He also set up five goals.
	   Rekdal is assigned to take possible penalty shots during this
tournament and is one of many alternatives for free kicks outside
the penalty area.
	   ``We can still improve on free kicks,'' said Olsen. ``We're
missing a Maradona-type shooter. Unfortunately, we have no real
free kick specialist on the team.''
	   In the last warmup game May 27 in Oslo, Rekdal had one goal as
Norway routed fellow World Cup side Saudi Arabia 6-0.
	   ``Compared to four years ago, we're naturally much more
confident now,'' Rekdal said. ``In the United States many players
were chasing new club contracts. Now the situation is different.
What we learned four years ago could be very helpful this time.''
	   Another key dead ball man is Stig Inge Bjornebye, the Liverpool
defender with the feared left-foot shot. He was involved in seven
of the goals (four corners, two throw-ins and one free kick) in the
qualifers.
	   ``Our goal should be to score even more on set-pieces,''
Bjornebye said. ``And we will if we get many chances and it's
working.''
	   Bjornebye is one of 11 players on the squad who failed to
qualify for the second round in the '94 Cup in the United States.
	   ``We learned a lot from that experience,'' he said. ``There were
too many press conferences and too many sponsors' meetings in the
States.''
	   Monday's training was Norway's last at their camp in
Saint/Andre-des-Eaux west of Nantes before its Group A opener in
against Morocco on Wednesday. The squad will fly to Montpellier
Tuesday, with an evening workout scheduled at Mosson Stadium.
	   Olsen said he will announce his starting lineup after that
practice.
	   ``I'm uncertain about one or two positions,'' he said.

World Cup: Surfer could start for United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo XLF104-5 &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ He's the surfer, the guy
with the wild dance.
	   When the United States beat Austria in April, Frankie Hejduk
broke into his reggae two-step, looking somewhat like a lost
airplane searching for a runway. Then his goal was disallowed,
making him look a bit silly.
	   A little bit later came redemption _ a goal that counted.
	   ``I made up for it the second time around,'' he said, breaking
into a smile.
	   U.S. players are loose as the geese at their camp in the middle
of Beaujolais vineyards, but no player is looser than Hejduk, who
in 1989 qualified for the U.S. Amateur Surfing team.
	   To get himself ready for next Monday's game against Germany, the
23-year-old midfielder takes walks into the field next to the 12th
century chateau and thinks among the Gamay grapes.
	   ``The vineyards, they're in a perfect place,'' he said after
practice Monday. ``I'll be out there an hour the night before the
game, getting some good French oxygen.''
	   Hejduk has played just 12 international games and scored twice,
but sat out the last month after pulling his right hamstring May 6.
He rejoined practice Sunday and will start at wing midfield if he's
healthy.
	   Hejduk missed three exhibition games and wondered whether he'd
heal in time. Coach Steve Sampson admitted he was close to dropping
him from the roster.
	   But time and deep muscle massages did the trick.
	   ``That was painful, but they really got the kink out of them,''
Hejduk said. ``It was a pretty good-sized kink.''
	   His speed attracted Sampson's attention, one of the reason the
coach switched to a 3-6-1 formation with Hejduk and Cobi Jones on
the midfield flanks.
	   But in January 1997, the Beach Boy act didn't play so well.
Hejduk missed a team flight to China and Sampson seethed, banishing
him from the national team.
	   ``He's come light years from a year ago,'' Sampson said. ``As
far as I'm concerned, at that time he was finished _ for this World
Cup. But his attitude changed dramatically.''
	   Hejduk got married later in the year _ after proposing to his
future wife in knee-deep ocean off San Diego, holding Kim with one
arm and his surfboard with the other. She gave birth to a son,
Frankie Nesta, on Feb. 25.
	   In the meantime, Sampson stayed in contact with Hejduk's coach
on the Tampa Bay Mutiny in U.S. Major League Soccer.
	   ``He's become more mature. It was in clear contrast,'' Sampson
said. ``I think his marriage and the fact he has a child has a lot
to do with his maturity. He's what I call a true professional. He's
not playing for just himself but for someone else in his life.''
	   If he winds up doing his dance next Monday, it will be the
Germans who are embarrassed. They're expected to beat the
Americans.
	   But for Hejduk, it's just another game.
	   ``If you look at it any differently,'' he said, ``you start
psyching yourself out a little bit.

	   THE Cannonball tree has always been considered as unusual. When
it flowers, it is something to marvel at: long stems bearing large
pinkish/white/yellow flowers which exude a fragrance.
	   The unusual trait of this tree species is that the
inflorescences are borne on the tree trunk where large
cannonball-like fruits later form.
	   There are not many of these in Kuala Lumpur. It was introduced
from South America almost 100 years ago together with the
well-known Brazil nut tree.
	   Many of the latter can still be found in the Lake Gardens in
Kuala Lumpur. However, sad to say, the cannonball trees planted in
the Lake Gardens have since been destroyed.
	   Known as Couroupita guianensis, the beautiful and remarkable
Cannonball tree is native to the northern part of South America. It
was first introduced in the Singapore Botanical Garden and later to
the Lake Gardens in Kuala Lumpur and other gardens in Malaysia.
	   It was a pleasant surprise to see a few of these planted (and in
flower) in one of the town parks in Kuching last year.
	   Couroupita is a small genus of trees in the Lecythidaceae
family, commonly called the Brazil nut family.
	   Other plants like the Barringtonia (native to Malaysia),
Bertholletia (Brazil nut), Couroupita guianensis and lovely garden
ornamental tree- shrub Gustavia all belong to this family.
	   There trees are commonly planted in must tropical climates where
they are grown successfully in botanical gardens and parks.
	   Couroupita guianensis is native to the jungles of northern South
America, along the Amazon river and towards Venezuela.
	   Flowering stems arise from the main trunk of the tree. The tree
gets its name from the round woody fruits that are as big as a
child's head. The fruits are brown in colour and dangle all over
the ``tree trunk''.
	   Many have described the tree as an oddity and it is considered
one of the strange wonders of the world.
	   The tree has a tall and rather narrow crown. It does not spread
out much.
	   The unusual trait of this tree is that the whole trunk can be
thickly set with the long woody inflorescences from the base
upwards.
	   The flowers are about 10-12cm across. They are fragrant and
stalked on rather long inflorescences 30-60cm long which are
usually not branched.
	   Each flower has six sepals and six petals. They are broad,
yellow on the outside, bright pink inside, and are beautifully
veined in apricot yellow.
	   The flowering stems arise directly from the tree trunk and never
from the branches or amongst the leaves like other flowering trees.
	   When flowering time comes, small special ``little'' branches or
protrusions sprout from the trunk for the blossoms to develop on.
	   These ``little'' branches get longer and longer from year to
year as more and more flowers are added to the inflorescence.
	   There are usually hundreds of blooms extending frequently from
the bottom level of the trunk upwards.
	   If the tree grows well, you can expect to see a sort of
beautifully decorated column, the reddish pink colouring of the
flowers contrasting with the greyish bark and the brilliant green
of the tree's foliage. It is indeed a lovely colour combination.
	   The flowers exude a sweet scent even at night.
	   The most unusual part of this tree is that after the flowers
come the ``cannonballs''. These are the seed pods or fruits.
	   These are round balls ranging from 10-18cm in diameter. They are
reddish brown to dark brown and these are suspended ``loosely''
from the trunk.
	   These ``cannonballs'' have a hard shell and when too many dangle
on the long stems they do look funny. The fruits take a long time
to mature - sometimes up to nine months or a year. These fruits
have a rather disagreeable odour.
	   In fact, the smell can be quite bad. Lots of seeds are embedded
in this cheese-like pulp.

	   WHAT used to be an alternative to the pocket has now become a
necessary accessory for all women to have and to hold.
	   We're talking handbags here. For most women, the practical
shoulder bag that marries form and function is the perfect daytime
carrier.
	   But for night, pretty pouches and chic cases are the sacks that
would put you seriously in style.
	   To quote Domenico Dolce of Dolce &AMP; Gabbana: ``The handbag a
woman uses for a special occasion should be as extraordinary as a
Victorian jewel...
	   and just as glamorous.''
	   Beaded or embroidered, ornate evening bags are indeed
one-of-a-kind. And when it comes to tapestry, the craze for
Chinoiserie needlework is still in. So are beaded purses which are
said to have been at the fingertips of glamorous ladies since the
late 1700s - more than 200 years ago! But if you don't want its
rich finishes to compete with your dress, carry a simple one then.
	   Minimalistic chic carriers, such as the square silver mesh with
metal handle from Isetan or the beige satin envelope clutch from
Metrojaya, would easily go hand-in-hand with whatever you wear.
	   On the other hand, if you prefer a carrier with character, there
are quirky and kooky ones to choose from like Metrojaya's hatbox
holder, Prada's velvet onion bag or Nina Ricci's multi-coloured
goatskin drum case.
	   Some, such as Judith Leiber's odd-shaped collectible containers
have been spotted on several jet-setting socialites and celebrities
who wear them as chunky necklaces! What a conversation piece. Get a
grip. Case closed.

French driver takes lead in Acropolis Rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ French driver Didier Auriol outpaced
Britain's Richard Burns to take a commanding lead in the second day
of the 45th Acropolis Auto Rally Monday.
	   Auriol, with Denis Giraudet as co-driver in a Toyota Corolla
WRC, took advantage of a problem Burns had in the special stages to
move from third to first place in total time of 2 hours, 52
minutes, 52 seconds.
	   Burns, in a Mitsubishi Carisma, dropped to fifth place after a
tree branch broke his windshield during the first of the five
scheduled special stages of a total of 128 kilometers (80 miles).
	   The British driver was only 11 seconds ahead of Auriol in the
opening day Sunday.
	   Another British team, Colin McRae with co-driver Nicky Grist in
a Subaru Impreza WRC, won two special stages to retain second place
in a time of 2:52.57.
	   Of the 103 cars which were flagged off at the foot of the Athens
Acropolis hill, 70 are still in the gruelling rally, considered to
be one of the toughest in the world.
	   Unlike previous races, this year's rally will end in the western
town of Delphi. The ancient Greeks considered Delphi to be the
center of the world. It was also the site of the oracle that
ancient Greeks consulted for prophesies of the future.
	   Two-time Acropolis Rally winner Juha Kankkunen of Finland in a
Ford Escort WRC improved his position by moving from fifth to third
place on the provisional standings.
	   The drivers will cover a total of 1,036 kilometers (647 miles)
through Greece's best and worst roads in the three-day rally.
	   The rally counts towards the world driving championship.
Mitsubishi, Subaru and Toyota of Japan, and Ford of Britain are
competing for the manufacturer's trophy.

Israel debates whether to allow return of Hamas leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Where does the leader of the militant
Palestinian group Hamas present a greater risk to Israel _ at home
or abroad?
	   While Sheik Ahmed Yassin roamed world capitals raising funds,
Israeli leaders and talk show hosts debated Monday whether he
should be allowed to return to his home in the Gaza Strip.
	   Yassin, who was serving a life sentence in an Israeli jail for
ordering the deaths of Palestinians who collaborated with Israel,
was released in October as part of a swap to free Israeli agents in
Jordan.
	   Pressure is mounting on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who
made the decision to release Yassin, to block Yassin's planned
return to the Palestinian-run Gaza Strip. Israel still controls
Gaza's borders.
	   Netanyahu's inner security Cabinet met Monday to discuss Yassin,
Israeli media reported.
	   ``The issue of Sheik Yassin is a very important one to the state
of Israel,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Carmi Gillon, former head of Israel's Shin Bet security agency,
said the 61-year-old quadriplegic Yassin was a threat to both
Israel and the Palestinians, and should not be allowed to return to
his followers in Gaza.
	   ``The threat of Yassin is in his presence in Gaza. It is a
threat to Israel, a threat to peace and a threat to our only
possible Palestinian partner,'' Gillon said on Israel Television,
referring to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu defended his decision to release the sheik
as necessary to improving shaky relations with Jordan last fall. He
said the decision was based in part on assessments by security
officials who feared Hamas retribution if the ailing sheik died in
an Israeli jail.
	   But Yassin's health has not prevented him from traveling through
the Muslim and Arab world and raising funds for Hamas, which
opposes peace with Israel. The Hamas military wing has killed more
than 100 Israelis in scores of attacks in recent years. Israeli
reports suggest Yassin has raised over dlrs 70 million in the past
four months of travels.
	   Yassin's fiery comments on his tour, such as ``Suicide attacks
are only seen as such by other countries. For us they are holy
missions, and whoever dies, dies for his country,'' have been
widely reported in Israel.
	   In Gaza, Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said that Yassin, who is
currently in Sudan, was planning to return home later this month,
but gave no specific date.
	   ``We will drum up international and Arabic support and organize
protest demonstrations in the streets,'' Zahar told The Associated
Press. Zahar said Hamas has sent letters to Arab leaders urging
them to stop Israel from making ``a reckless decision that can lead
the region to problems.''
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman said Monday he would support
Yassin's return, because ``It's better for him to sit in Gaza close
to us.''
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said the Palestinian Authority, which
issued Yassin a diplomatic passport, would insist that Yassin be
allowed to travel freely.
	   Israeli lawmaker Haggai Merom suggested Yassin be allowed to
return to Gaza, but not to leave again.
	   ``We should have been left him in jail because he was quiet
then,'' he said on Israel Television. ``Now he is running abroad,
raising millions of dollars for Hamas and appearing as a legitimate
alternative to Yasser Arafat. In my opinion, the best thing is to
accept him back and not allow him out of there again.''

BBC veteran to head Americas operations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British Broadcasting Corp. said Monday it had
appointed a veteran executive, Peter Phippen, as president and
chief executive of its growing BBC Worldwide Americas subsidiary.
	   Phippen had previously been managing director of BBC Worldwide's
British region.
	   Phippen will run BBC activities including the entertainment
channel BBC America, as well as various co-production and licensing
arrangements with broadcasters in the Americas and a partnership
with the television group Discovery in South America.
	   ``I'm excited and somewhat awed by the size of the opportunity
in the Americas,'' said Phippen, who will be based in New York.
``But the time is right to seize it.''
	   Phippen's old post goes to Peter Teague, who has been serving as
acting chief executive of BBC Worldwide, the commercial division of
the publicly-funded broadcaster. Teague will also become deputy
chief executive of BBC Worldwide.

	   THIS focuses on how CEOs and their second-in-commands think. How
do ideas shape the way businesses are run? Many management
researchers and writers have suggested how leadership has evolved:
from the way people are brought up, schooled, influenced by their
associates, superiors and subordinates; how organisations are
structured; how management teams are formed and work segmented; how
the empowerment of employees and flexibility in managing change
takes place.
	   I list below a summary of some of the beliefs and ideas on
leadership formed by prominent management experts: John Adair -
People can be trained for leadership, believed to be a transferable
skill, rather than an inborn aptitude. Task, team and individual
overlap to form leadership forces in working groups and
organisations.
	   Igor Ansoff - Pioneered the theory and practice of strategic
management.
	   Chris Argyris - Each individual has a potential that can be
developed.
	   Chester Barnard - The role of the chief executive is to manage
the values of the organisation and secure employee commitment.
	   Warren Bennis - Leaders do the right thing while managers do
things right.
	   Edward De Bono - Invented the concept of lateral thinking as
opposed to conventional thinking.
	   Alfred Chandler - Suggested structure follows strategy in
organisations.
	   Edwards Demings - Quality management is by reducing production
variation.
	   Peter Drucker - Introduced the concepts of management by
objective; the privatisation of government; the customer first;
stick to knitting; the decentralisation of organisation; long-range
planning.
	   Henri Fayol - From experience, distilled his 14 principles of
management: Division of work, authority with responsibility, agreed
discipline between employer and employee, no conflict of commands,
unity of direction, general interest above individual interest,
fair remuneration and equity of employees, stable tenure of
employees, centralisation/decentralisation depending on
circumstances, hierarchy of management, balance and order of
resources, initiative and team spirit; Charles Handy - Related
leadership to corporate culture; also suggested outsourcing amid a
core group of employees for the future organisation, an idea that
is catching on as ``networked'' organisation.
	   Frederick Herzberg - Identified motivation and hygiene factors
and introduced ``job enrichment'' to management vocabulary.
	   Joseph Juran - Introduced company-wide quality control and the
importance of human factors in this concept.
	   Rosabeth Moss Kanter - Empowerment, change management, strategic
alliances between partners were the new concepts introduced.
	   Theodore Levitt - Presented the idea that firms should be
customer- oriented and marketing is the key to business success.
	   Rensis Likert - Presented four management styles linked to
business performance; these can be measured using the Likert scale,
ranging from exploitative authoritarian to participative.
	   Douglas McGregor - Formulated ``Theory X'' (authoritarian
management) and ``Theory Y'' (participative management).
	   Kenichi Ohmae - Long-term plans versus short-term profits are
the fundamental difference the Japanese make in their global
strategy; commitment, competitiveness and creativity form his
prescription for success.
	   David Schwartz - One's thinking (by thinking big) can influence
the outcome of the person.
	   Richard Pascale - Organisation renewal is necessary for
continued survival.
	   Norman Vincent Peale - Positive thinking can affect a person's
life.
	   Peters &AMP; Waterman - Developed the 7-S model, comprising ``hard''
	   (strategy, structure and systems) and ``soft'' factors (style,
shared values, skills and staff); ``soft'' factors contribute to
more success.
	   Found that ``excellent companies'' do not exist because nothing
in today's chaotic world stays the same long enough. Constant
improvement is necessary.
	   Edgar Schein - Proposed the concept of corporate culture and
psychological contract between employer and employee; there is less
emphasis on material reward compared to opportunities for potential
growth; hence, the key to leadership is managing cultural change.
	   Richard Schonberger - The theory that world-class excellence is
achieved by regarding each function in business as a customer in
the customer chain.
	   Since the 19th century, management experts have tried to find
how best to manage, to develop leadership in their fields and to
achieve competitive advantage over business rivals. Although the
theories and practices have evolved, nobody knows what the best way
is, leading Tom Peters and Robert Waterman to individually conclude
that nothing stays the same long enough for excellence to be
sustained. However, it is good that companies continually search
for improvement and stick to practices identified with excellent or
world-class companies.
	   We need new ideas as the economic and business environment
changes, disrupting business communities. In the last two years of
the 21st century, this is more evident than ever. East Asia and
Southeast Asia are grappling with a new destabilising factor,
currency fluctuations, with factors last experienced in the 1980s
recession. How do businesses cope?
	   Nobody knows. A fundamentally strong shift in thinking is
required. This is called ``thought leadership'' - new ways to lead,
and not a single way, but like a combination lock, require a fine
balance of methods, human traits and experience. How this is done
is delineated in ten chapters of the book.
	   What is thought leadership?
	   Thought leadership involves out-thinking, out-flanking
competitors in boldness and innovation. Action and behaviour that
provide direction and reinforce the perceptions of outstanding
executive practices and values must support thought leadership.
Leaders commonly refer to it as ``walking the talk''. This thinking
distinguishes leaders from followers and makes them unique in the
business world. When top managers and advisors say ``impossible'',
thought leaders will say ``look at it from a different angle''.
Thought leaders do not think conventionally. ``Thinking out of
box'', an approach for creative thinking suggested by Edward De
Bono, is quite common for thought leaders.
	   Thought strategy is as important as the idea How does one
implement a good idea? Datuk Effendi Norwawi, now a major corporate
group owner, who ran the Sarawak State Economic Development
Corporation in the 1980s, could not increase the pay of his staff
due to statutory constraints on payroll. Monetary motivation could
not be used as much as it was in the private sector. However, he
used empowerment to differentiate his from other SEDCs.
	   Using ideas he observed overseas, he used inhouse television as
a tool; company events were filmed and broadcast by staff as a
communication channel for them. Excellent service ideas were used
in his group of companies. Under his leadership, the SEDC was one
of the most profitable government subsidiaries in Malaysia. His
quest for quality was relentless and he maintained standards for
his followers and other SEDCs to adopt.
	   Thoughts on people Having talented people in sufficient numbers
to run your business would be ideal. However, as good staff are
hard to come by, managing becomes a challenge. A successful thought
leader can overcome such odds by getting the most out of his staff.
The person believes in his people. A leader can inspire even the
weakest person to excel. Thought leaders like Dale Carnegie have
shown how people can be won over and friends made by mastering the
art of people handling. Similarly, John Maxwell and Jim Dornan,
both very successful leaders - the former in developing church
leaders, the latter in developing business leaders in his global
marketing organisation - believe influence comes from knowing how
to be a leader.
	   The people factor is the most important factor in thought
leadership, as ``leaders manage people, not things'' and there are
more business wisdom quotes on people than on any other element of
thought leadership.
	   Thought infrastructure This refers to good basic physical and
mental attitudes that enable a leader to think through tough issues
and maintain poise in crisis.
	   Selfesteem, humility, business sense, gut feel, confidence,
morale, patience, sense of humour, a naturally innovative mind,
imagination, entrepreneurship, survival instinct, right thoughts,
positive thinking, and habits are some important qualities that
affect good thought leadership.
	   Thought processes These include the mental steps taken to
mobilise sometimes limited human and material resources, to carry
out the organisation's plans. A thought leader will not allow
trivialities to obstruct him in promoting and delivering excellence
in the organisation.
	   Thought leadership culture The culture of thinking is an
interplay of the above elements of thought leadership on a holistic
basis and differentiates a leader from a non- leader. What is this
culture? It is not an airy concept. It is how business leaders
think and act, that makes other people think and act in like
manner; how the thought processes are brought together to enable
the delivery of business services and products, so people will say,
``This is the way we do things around here''. This includes extra
steps by leaders to make their company better; the style of
communication; the way people are viewed and rewarded by business
leaders.
	   Rich De Vos, billionaire co-founder of Amway and author of the
book Compassionate Capitalism, once complimented a dustman for the
way he emptied the rubbish from his house and always replaced the
bin cover (you should see the rubbish bins in my neighborhood after
the rubbish contract workers have made their rounds - all over the
place, sometimes in the middle of the road, as though a riot had
taken place!). The dustman was flabbergasted; in over 25 years,
nobody had complimented him in his lowly job.
	   De Vos answered, ``Without you, this town would be a mess. Keep
up the good work.'' Simple. Not much effort. Yet can you imagine
the effect on the man? Would this dustman do his job better? You
bet! A company cannot dictate everything the individual does. If
the thoughts of the leadership pervade the organisation, practised
even in life, imagine what amazing result this will have on the way
the whole organisation works.
	   Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad's success in publicising the
Multimedia Super Corridor as the technological equivalent of
Silicon Valley is a good example of how thought leadership helped
secure business success for Malaysia in the IT industry. Singapore,
Manila, Bangkok and Bangalore all have similar IT-focused areas in
development or in place, but it was our Prime Minister who
out-thought the other leaders in bringing to the attention of the
world Malaysia's seriousness about IT.
	   How did he do it? He brought Bill Gates and other global IT
leaders to Malaysia. That's why the MSC is now known throughout the
world.
	   In brief, thought leadership differentiates one from others and
guides the people in the organisation - or the country - to
understand how organisational transformation and transactions
should take place. Slogans and vision statements are meaningless if
the leadership (this includes the CEO, senior managers, managers,
section heads, supervisors) does not think the issue through and
``walk the talk'' through the organisation about how the business
should be conducted. This thinking must take place from the top to
the lowest-ranked person in the organisation.
	   In Part Two of this article, I will go through thought
leadership strategy to illustrate how this model works in
organisations.
	   Dr Chan Teng Heng was formerly chief operating officer and human
resource director with two separate listed companies. He was a
management consultant for nine years and taught at the Nanyang
Technological University, Singapore. Currently, he runs his own
firm, CEO Executive Search, and can be contacted at Tel:

Georgia negotiates with separatist provinces

when their car hit mine; TRIMS pvs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ An armored car carrying United Nations
observers hit an anti-tank mine in Georgia's breakaway region of
Abkhazia on Monday, and three people were injured, news agencies
reported.
	   The car carrying five military observers ran over the mine while
patrolling the Ghali district of Abkhazia, where more than 300
people died in recent clashes between separatists and Georgian
government troops.
	   Two Russians, interpreter Madonna Gurtskaya and military
observer Col. Sergei Isayev, have been hospitalized, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said. An Albanian observer was also injured, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Two more mines were later found and defused on the same road,
Interfax said.
	   Meanwhile, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze said Monday
that a meeting with the leader of another breakaway province, South
Ossetia, may be postponed because he is too busy monitoring talks
with Abkhazia. That meeting was set for Tuesday.
	   Georgian and Abkhazian officials have been meeting in Moscow to
arrange talks between Shevardnadze and Abkhazian leader Vladislav
Ardzinba, but little progress has been made.
	   Shevardnadze accused Abkhazia on Monday of failing to meet
Georgia's key condition _ permitting the return of 38,000 ethnic
Georgian refugees who fled the recent clashes in Abkhazia.
	   However, Abkhazian Prosecutor General Anri Dzhergenia recently
said his government has put no restraints on the return of civilian
refugees, and only opposes the return of Georgian militants who
took part in the clashes.
	   But the biggest impediment to a peace settlement is the lack of
agreement on Abkhazia's political status: Georgia is only willing
to allow the province broad autonomy, while Abkhazia refuses to
accept anything less than full independence.
	   Some 38,000 ethnic Georgians left Abkhazia during the fighting
May 19-25. They included 30,000 people who had only recently
returned to their homes after fleeing Abkhazia's 1992-93
independence war.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. Separatists drove out Georgian troops and
300,000 ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war, and fighting
erupts frequently in the region.
	   The other secessionist region, South Ossetia, broke away from
Georgia in 1990, when it was still part of the Soviet Union. The
region's mostly ethnic Ossetian populace has been calling for unity
with ethnic brethren in Russia's North Ossetia.
	   The fighting ended after Russian peacekeepers were deployed in
1992, but talks on political settlement have stalled.

Gen. Sani Abacha: brutal even by Nigerian standards
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Nigeria-Abacha &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Even in a country long battered by
hard-line military regimes, Gen. Sani Abacha stood out as icy and
unforgiving, willing to flout world opinion in his quest for
absolute power.
	   Critics, be they Nobel laureates, former heads of state, or
environmental activists, faced certain arrest and sometimes
execution if they persisted in challenging Abacha and the military
government that emerged from his November 1993 coup.
	   Increasingly paranoid as opposition to his rule increased,
Abacha spent his final years a pariah to the world, blocked by
diplomatic sanctions from getting a visa to seek medical treatment
in the West.
	   And he was a recluse in his oil-rich but impoverished country.
He rarely traveled, fearing a coup in his absence, and when he
visited neighboring countries it was usually for less than 24
hours. He never gave news media interviews and appeared in public
with his eyes hidden behind dark glasses.
	   Abacha died of a heart attack, friends of his family said
Monday.
	   Born Sept. 20, 1943 in the northern state of Kano, he was a
career soldier, enrolling in the army as an infantryman at the age
of 18 and attending military training colleges in the United
Kingdom and United States as well as at home.
	   He became a familiar figure to Nigerians watching a succession
of military governments come and go: When generals ousted Nigeria's
last civilian government in 1983, it was Abacha who announced it on
national television.
	   Two years later, Abacha went on state-run TV to announce that
dictator Gen. Mohammed Buhari was being replaced by Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida.
	   Babangida would soon appoint Abacha his defense minister, and in
1993 he used his power in that position to force Babangida's
resignation amid the civil turmoil that followed the army's
cancellation of civilian elections.
	   Babangida named a civilian government to rule in his place, but
three months later Abacha was on television again, this time
announcing that he had seized power himself.
	   Abacha's bloodless coup at first brought hope for relief from
the civil strife that developed after Babangida refused to accept
the outcome of 1993 elections that were to have returned Nigeria to
civilian rule.
	   Although Abacha banned most democratic institutions, he did
promise a return to civilian government and met with the
businessman who won the aborted 1993 vote, Moshood Abiola.
	   But Abacha's promises of democratic reform proved as hollow as
those of his predecessors. Elections that were to have given
Nigerians a civilian government in 1996 never materialized, and
Abacha announced that he was stretching his rule until the end of
1998.
	   When Abiola, frustrated by his stolen victory, marked the 1993
election's first anniversary by declaring himself president, he was
jailed on treason charges.
	   Others soon followed, among them former military ruler Gen.
Olusegun Obasanjo and 50 others accused of plotting a coup and
sentenced after a secret trial to terms ranging from 15 years to
life.
	   Not even Wole Soyinka, winner of the 1986 Nobel prize for
literature and a frequent government critic, was immune.
	   Tipped off that his arrest was imminent, Soyinka slipped out of
Nigeria in 1994, saying the country was ``retreating into the Dark
Ages.'' That didn't stop Abacha from charging him in absentia with
treason, a crime punishable by death.
	   But no act drew such public condemnation as the 1995 hanging of
environmentalist and playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other
political activists convicted in a closed military tribunal of
conspiring in the slaying of political opponents.
	   Critics said the charges were false, Abacha's revenge for
Saro-Wiwa's challenges to the military government and his criticism
of the environmental damage wrought by the oil industry.
	   The brazen brutality of the act stunned the world, coming even
as the Commonwealth and South African President Nelson Mandela
appealed for mercy. In response, the 53-member Commonwealth took
the unprecedented step of suspending Nigeria, and Mandela called
for international sanctions against Nigerian oil, which accounts
for more than 80 percent of foreign currency earnings.
	   As massive corruption and political unrest combined to send
Nigeria's economy plummeting, Abacha sought to regain some
credibility by portraying Nigeria as a regional peacemaker and
political powerhouse.
	   In 1996, he won credit for a peace agreement ending Liberia's
seven-year civil war and cleared the way for elections. The
peacekeeping army that oversaw the vote and was lauded for keeping
order throughout the country was led by Nigeria.
	   When army officers ousted the civilian president in neighboring
Sierra Leone, Abacha stepped in again, sending his troops on a
military assault in an attempt to restore the democratically
elected government.
	   Critics said it was all an attempt to sway public opinion in
advance of the elections he had promised for 1998 _ elections his
opponents said were certain to be unfairly tilted in his favor.
	   Abacha is survived by his wife, Maryam, and nine children. A
tenth child, their eldest son, Ibrahim, died in a plane crash in
January 1996.

Clinton urges international stand against drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Clinton, Annan, Zedillo speeches,
other developments &QL; 
 &UR; By SONYA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Armed with plans for a dlrs 2 billion
media campaign to help stanch the flow of narcotics across
international borders, President Bill Clinton asked world leaders
Monday to ``stand as one against this threat'' without blaming each
other for the problem.
	   In an opening address at the U.N. General Assembly special
session on drugs, Clinton told representatives of about 150
countries, including 35 heads of state and government, that it is
time to stop bickering over whether blame for international drug
trafficking lies with countries that demand drugs or those that
supply them.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who met privately with
Clinton before the session, called the drug scourge ``a tragic
reality'' and appealed to member nations to work seriously on
finding common ground on fighting drugs.
	   ``It is my hope that when historians study the work of humankind
in drug control they will write about the next few days as the
point at which this trend was reversed,'' Annan said. ``We must
never give in to the human toll illegal drugs are taking on our
societies.''
	   Also at the session were Presidents Jacques Chirac of France,
Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Rafael Caldera of Venezuela, Alberto
Fujimori of Peru, Hugo Banzer of Bolivia and Ernesto Samper of
Colombia.
	   Zedillo called for a ``balanced strategy'' to combat drug
trafficking ``so that no one can become the judge of others and no
one feels entitled to violate other countries' laws for the sake of
enforcing its own.'' This is a clear reference to the controversy
over ``Operation Casablanca,'' a major U.S. money-laundering sting
that led to the arrests last month of 42 people _ including about
two dozen Mexican bankers.
	   Clinton avoided any direct criticism of other countries'
efforts, saying, ``Pointing fingers is distracting. It does not
dismantle a single cartel, help a single addict, prevent a single
child from trying _ and perhaps dying _ from heroin. Besides, the
lines between countries that are supply countries, demand countries
and transit countries are increasingly blurred. Drugs are every
nation's problem.''
	   Clinton said a dlrs 2 billion, five-year media campaign against
drugs would be launched in the United States, targeting young
people with a message that ``drugs destroy young lives, don't let
it destroy yours.''
	   Similar campaigns will be launched in Mexico, Venezuela and
Brazil, Clinton said, adding that he discussed the issue with
Brazilian President Cardoso on Sunday.
	   Clinton brought along Attorney General Janet Reno; his drug
policy adviser, Gen. Barry McCaffrey; Latin American envoy Mack
McLarty, and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala.
They attended the U.N. session and briefed reporters afterward.
	   Congress will be asked to provide dlrs 175 million of the dlrs 2
billion for the media campaign, with the rest coming from
businesses and philanthropic organizations, said national security
adviser Sandy Berger.
	   Clinton reported a 49 percent drop in overall U.S. drug use
since 1979 and a 70 percent decrease since 1985. Changing young
people's attitudes is necessary if that trend is to continue, he
said, adding he would ask Congress to extend the anti-drug push
until 2002.

	   DECANI, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats saw devastation reminiscent
of the wars in Bosnia as they were escorted into battle-torn
western Kosovo province _ target of a Serb offensive that prompted
other European countries on Monday to impose new sanctions on
Serbia.
	   Besides burned-out houses and deserted villages, whose forced
evacuation have provoked comparisons to ethnic cleansing, visitors
to the besieged zone saw evidence of fierce fighting between the
Serbs and ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   Along with continued clashes and shelling Monday, the first-hand
look at the devastation provides stark evidence of a fast-worsening
scenario that Western powers fear could turn into another, broader
Balkan war.
	   ``What we've seen is all sorrow, all grief... all those villages
burned and destroyed, all the people had left,'' said Dutch
ambassador Jan Sizoo, who was among the first group of foreign
diplomats to visit the Decani region on Sunday since Serb police
and army forces began a punishing offensive there in late May.
	   Journalists were turned back from another convoy that went into
the region Monday.
	   The destruction in the southern Serb province has increased
foreign pressure on Serbia to stop using its police and army
against militants battling for independence for Kosovo's 9-to-1
ethnic Albanian majority.
	   Last week's fighting triggered an exodus of 20,000 Kosovo
Albanians into Albania. Another 7,000 to 10,000 refugees fled to
the neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro and more than
50,000 people are believed displaced within Kosovo itself.
	   The European Union tightened sanctions against Belgrade on
Monday _ banning new investments in Serbia and freezing its assets
abroad _ and urged NATO to consider military intervention.
	   Washington also has vowed to take strong action in the face of
the crackdowns by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   A prominent Kosovo Albanian, Nekibe Kelmendi, welcomed the EU
sanctions but said they were only a ``small step.''
	   Serb forces continued shelling the area around the Albanian
border Monday, according to the Kosovo Information Center, close to
the ethnic Albanian leadership. Its Serb counterpart, meanwhile _
the pro-Serb Media Center _ said ethnic Albanian militants attacked
two Serb villages in the Drenica region.
	   Serbs, in turn, have accused the pro-independence Kosovo
Liberation Army of attacks on Serb citizens as well as police.
	   After seeing only ``part of what one could call a battlefield,''
Sizoo said: ``We've been told (by Serb authorities) that the blame
is on the terrorists who started first. But, this statement is very
difficult to defend. For a conflict, you always need two parties.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders say more than 50 people have been killed
in the offensive and some 200 men were missing and presumed
captured.
	   In Kosovo's capital Pristina, a daily march by Kosovo Albanians
for peace passed off without incident Monday. On Sunday, more than
100 Serbian police broke up the demonstration, injuring at least
six Albanians.
	   Also Monday, Balkan foreign ministers meeting in Turkey
criticized Yugoslavia for human rights abuses in Kosovo but failed
to agree on a joint declaration on the deepening crisis.

EU struggles with imposition of gradual ban of drift nets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The EU governments struggled Monday with a
proposal that would gradually ban drift nets that are kilometers
(miles) long and cause the death of thousands of species such as
seals, dolphins and whales.
	   After seven hours of talks, the EU fisheries ministers were
deadlocked on when the ban should begin. France, Italy, Ireland and
Greece object to a ban in general, arguing it threatens the
livelihood of fishermen. The ban would be for all vessels, those
registered in EU as well as non-EU boats.
	   The issue has been on the table for years without EU nations
being able to reach an agreement.
	   EU Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino, and Britain, which now
holds the EU rotating presidency, have proposed to phase out all
drift nets as of Dec. 31, 2000 ``because of the side effects on
dolphins,'' Britain's Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham told
reporters on arrival here.
	   France, which has some 40 vessels using drift nets based in its
Atlantic ports, says if it comes to a transitional period, it wants
at least six years.
	   Italy argues Morocco and Tunisia are worse offenders. But EU
officials say Italy is the worst in the EU and estimate that its
plan to convert 500 vessels that now drag drift nets would still
leave some 200 in operation.
	   In 1992, the United Nations imposed a general moratorium on
drift nets. The EU responded by limiting them to 1.5 miles (2.5
kilometers), but under the EU proposal all nets would be banned as
of 2000.
	   Ecological groups, including Greenpeace have denounced the use
of the nets, which they say catch animals that fishermen don't want
such as sharks, dolphins, whales, turtles and diving birds.
	   The drift nets are dragged through the water. Because they are
so long, they have been nicknamed ``walls of death.''
	   In a statement, Greenpeace said 1998 ``is the UN International
Year of the Ocean and, after dragging its feet for years, the EU
can make a real contribution to protect the oceans.''
	   The organization displayed part of a drift net outside the EU
conference building where foreign ministers met.
	   The RSPCA, the British animal protection organization, published
a report last September highlighting the devastation and suffering
caused by drift nets.
	   The report revealed that in one season alone, almost 83,000 blue
sharks were caught by French boats, 8,000 dolphins by Italian
fishermen. Additionally, as many as 800 leatherback turtles died in
drift nets.

<TEXT>
	   MARIGNAC, France (AP) _ Calm returned to Chile's World Cup
headquarters Monday with Ivan Zamorano resuming training one day
after experience an alarming pain in the meniscus of his right leg.
	   Doctors gave the 31-year-old striker of the Italian club
Internazionale a clean bill of health.
	   ``You saw me, I trained normally and full of enthusiasm. There's
no problem,'' a smiling Zamorano told reporters after the two-hour
training session at the Robert Brettes Stadium in this southern
French town.
	   Zamorano complained about what he called exaggerated reports
back home that his injury was serious and could sideline him from
the World Cup debut against Italy on Tuesday.
	   ``It is a pity that that this sort of psychological war comes
from our own Chilean journalists,'' he said.
	   Teammates were delighted to see their captain back in action.
	   ``Ivan is our leader, the man who we follow in the field and it
is a real privilege having him,'' goalkeeper Nelson Tapia said.
	   Head coach Nelson Acosta also told reporters that they should
forget about Zamorano's health.
	   ``Ivan is fine. Period,'' he said.
	   Zamorano showed no affect from the injury during Monday's
training session, repeatedly practicing long distance shots along
with offensive teammate Marcelo Salas.
	   The Chile federation reported no injury problems in the team,
although defenders Javier Margas, Ronald Fuentes, Francisco Rojas
and Cristian Castaneda along with midfielder Luis Musrri were seen
just running casually around the field instead of training with the
rest of the team.
	   ``It's just a precaution, I feel 100 percent,'' Margas said.
	   He quickly ran onto the field to join a vigorous informal
scrimmage.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Workers who repair Britain's railroad tracks
threatened Monday to strike for 11 days, stirring fears that
travelers and commuters will face numerous delays and
cancellations.
	   ``It's going to have a very serious impact,'' acknowledged
Georgina Walsh, a spokeswoman for Railtrack PLC, which operates the
nation's railroad infrastructure. ``It's going to be chaotic, from
the look of it.''
	   It was impossible for anybody to predict just how bad the
disruptions could be, however.
	   Union bosses said the workers will stop maintaining tracks for
four days beginning June 19, then for seven more days beginning
June 29.
	   Unlike a strike by people who run the trains, the effects of
this walkout would be determined by how many problems occur on the
tracks, how bad the problems are, and how quickly the engineering
companies can fix them. Some minor problems require only that
drivers slow down; others can completely shut a section of track.
	   Roughly 9,000 of the nation's 15,000 railroad maintenance
workers are represented by the Rail Maritime and Transport union,
and managers are making contingency plans to operate with as many
non-union workers as possible.
	   The union threatened to walk off the job at nine engineering
companies that work as contractors to maintain Railtrack's
infrastructure.
	   The union's general secretary, Jimmy Knapp, says the engineering
companies want too many concessions from workers in a new deal that
would raise basic pay but force drastic changes in working rules.
	   While basic rates of pay might rise by as much as 20 percent
under proposals being made by some of the engineering companies, a
typical rail worker might see actual weekly pay fall to 260 pounds
(dlrs 424) per week from 300 pounds (dlrs 490) per week because of
less overtime, union spokesman Lawrie Harries said.
	   One of the big track engineering companies, Jarvis Facilities
Ltd., accused the union of playing dirty by calling a strike before
pay talks had even broken down.
	   ``Part of the agreement was that neither side would operate
under the threat of duress,'' said Ian McKellar, a spokesman for
the company's parent, Jarvis PLC. ``Clearly, the threat of four
days followed by seven days of strike action would be duress.''
	   The privatized operators who run the trains in Britain are not
directly involved in the labor dispute and declined to predict what
would happen to services during a strike.
	   ``Our point is to sit back and wait to see what happens,'' said
Jay Merritt, a spokesman for the Association of Train Operating
Companies, a lobbying group for 27 British rail operators.

Russian prime minister urges church to take part in czar funeral
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's prime minister has urged the Russian
Orthodox Church to decide how it intends to participate in the
burial of the country's last tsar, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko sent a letter to the patriarch
urging the church to take part, noting that the event will be an
important day of national reconciliation, Interfax said, quoting an
unidentified source.
	   The church has been hesitant about next month's ceremony, saying
that some believers still have doubts about the identity of bones
recovered from a pit in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg in
1991.
	   The nine skeletons have been examined by genetics labs in
Russia, Britain and the United States and identified as those of
Czar Nicholas II, his wife, three children and four servants.
	   After six years of deliberations, a government commission
declared the remains authentic earlier this year and scheduled a
funeral for July 17, the 80th anniversary of the family's execution
by a Bolshevik firing squad. Hundreds of foreign representatives,
including many royals, have been invited to attend.
	   Russian media have said that President Boris Yeltsin will not
take part unless the head of the church, Patriarch Alexy II, does.
	   The ceremony will be held in St. Petersburg's Peter and Paul
Cathedral, the traditional burial site of the Romanovs, who ruled
Russia for 300 years and were related through intermarriage to many
other royal families in Europe.
	   The church's ruling body, the Holy Synod, is scheduled to
discuss the church's representation on Tuesday. Russian media have
suggested that the synod may allow St. Petersburg priests to
officiate, but will not permit the church's highest officials to
attend.
	   The church has started proceedings to consider sainthood for the
royal family, which would make their bones holy relics.
	   The church has previously suggested that the bones, still held
in a police morgue, be interred in a temporary tomb until all
doubts about their identity have been removed.
	   Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov endorsed that idea Monday, saying the
decision to proceed with a funeral was too hasty. He had earlier
proposed that they be buried in Moscow's newly rebuilt Cathedral of
Christ the Savior.

	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ Nwankwo Kanu sat out Nigeria's first
full-squad practice in France with what a team source called a
minor ankle injury.
	   At the start of a morning training session in this small village
80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Paris, Kanu walked over to coach
Bora Milutinovic and pointed at his left foot.
	   The two spoke for a few minutes while other players began light
jogging. The Inter Milan striker walked off the field, accompanied
by a trainer.
	   The source said Kanu, who led Nigeria to the gold medal at the
Atlanta Olympics, met one of the team doctors and had his ankle
iced.
	   Kanu, 21, has been beset by a series of lingering leg injuries
over the past six months, hampering his comeback from 1996 heart
valve surgery.

	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Negotiations for the transfer of Italian
World Cup stars are officially suspended for the duration of France
'98. But rumors about club maneuvers for next season are a common
subject for discussion at Italy's training camp.
	   Midfielder Roberto Di Matteo blocked suggestions that he may
return to the Italian league from Chelsea, saying the English club
announced he's not for sale.
	   ``I'm going to respect the decisions of the club,'' he said.
	   Juventus striker Filippo Inzaghi denied rumors of his possiblek of
the Scottish World Cup fans on their arrival at Charles de Gaulle
airport.
	   They told them to remove their ginger wigs and tartan caps and
wash off the face-paint before they would let the fans through
customs.
	   ``It is absolutely ridiculous,'' said 36-year-old Andy Finley,
who was wearing a tailor-made Black Watch tartan suit complete with
waistcoat and top hat.
	   ``It took me hours to paint this flag on my face and the next
thing I'm told to wash it off or they won't let me in the country
because I don't look like my picture in my passport.''

Restaurants are scrambling to buy TVs. Street peddlers are hawking

	   Lebanon is not participating, but World Cup fever is in full
force here.
	   The tournament has always been a hit in this soccer-mad nation.
During the civil war from 1975 to 1990, militiamen were known to
stop shooting and residents would crank up electrical generators to
watch matches.
	   ``I have always been a German fan,'' said Fuad Khoueiry, a
grocer whose customers are greeted with a large picture of the
European champions.
	   Tony Zoghbi, 28, has put up the green Brazilian flag outside his
home.
	   ``I did it to spite my next-door neighbor, who's a German
fanatic,'' he said.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military strongman Gen. Sani
Abacha has died after suffering a heart attack, close friends of
Abacha's family said Monday.
	   In keeping with Muslim practice, a funeral will be held within
the next 24 hours, said the family members who spoke to The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   The government had no official confirmation of Abacha's death,
but leaders convened an emergency meeting in the capital, Abuja.
	   It was not immediately clear who would assume power. Abacha, 54,
had wielded absolute power since 1993 and was always secretive on
the issue of succession.
	   Abacha was supposed to have been at a special function in Lagos
last week but failed to appear. He has made few public appearances
since he greeted Pope John Paul II in March.
	   Legions of soldiers sealed off Abacha's residence and office in
the capital early Monday. Only top military brass were permitted to
enter the secluded leader's compound.
	   Senior military junta officials, including members of the
family, said they had chartered an airplane to take them from the
southern hub city of Lagos to Abuja for the funeral.
	   By late afternoon, journalists had been summoned for a second
time to the State House in Abuja. In an unusual move, senior aides
had called journalists a in earlier as well, but they were quickly
turned away by soldiers.
	   Scores of reporters, including those with state-controlled
media, were camped outside the State House awaiting an explanation.
	   Although the army and police usually maintain a high profile on
the streets of Nigeria, the extraordinary move of sealing the head
of state's residence triggered a wave of rumors in Abuja.
	   Abacha seized power in Nigeria in 1993 after canceling
presidential elections and suspending the constitution.
	   Although he has pledged to hand the government over to an
elected civilian administration, in April he became the only
nominated candidate for the presidency.
	   Opposition to Abacha's rule has been mounting in recent months
with the prospect that his junta might not honor its pledge to
stand down.

Israel debates whether to allow return of Hamas leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ While the leader of the militant
Palestinian group Hamas roamed through the Muslim and Arab world
raising funds, Israeli leaders and talk show hosts debated Monday
whether he should be allowed to return to his home in the Gaza
Strip.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin had been serving a life sentence in an
Israeli jail for ordering the deaths of Palestinians who
collaborated with Israel. He was released in October as part of a
swap to free Israeli agents in Jordan.
	   Pressure is mounting on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who
made the decision to release Yassin, to block his planned return to
the Palestinian-run Gaza Strip. Israel still controls Gaza's
borders.
	   Netanyahu's inner security Cabinet met Monday to discuss Yassin,
Israeli media reported.
	   ``The issue of Sheik Yassin is a very important one to the state
of Israel,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Carmi Gillon, former head of Israel's Shin Bet security agency,
said the 61-year-old quadriplegic is a threat to both Israel and
the Palestinians and should not be allowed to return to his
followers in Gaza.
	   ``The threat of Yassin is in his presence in Gaza. It is a
threat to Israel, a threat to peace and a threat to our only
possible Palestinian partner,'' Gillon said on Israel Television,
referring to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu defended his decision to release the sheik
as necessary to improving shaky relations with Jordan last fall. He
said the decision was based in part on assessments by security
officials who feared Hamas retribution if the ailing sheik died in
an Israeli jail.
	   But Yassin's health has not prevented him from traveling and
raising funds for Hamas, which opposes peace with Israel. The Hamas
military wing has killed more than 100 Israelis in scores of
attacks in recent years. Israeli reports suggest Yassin has raised
more than dlrs 70 million in the past four months.
	   Yassin's fiery comments on his tour, such as comparing his
group's suicide bombings to ``holy missions,'' have been widely
reported in Israel.
	   In Gaza, Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said Yassin, who is
currently in Sudan, planned to return home later this month, but
gave no specific date.
	   ``We will drum up international and Arabic support and organize
protest demonstrations in the streets,'' Zahar told The Associated
Press. Zahar said Hamas has sent letters to Arab leaders urging
them to stop Israel from making ``a reckless decision that can lead
the region to problems.''
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman said Monday he would support
Yassin's return, because ``It's better for him to sit in Gaza close
to us.''
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said the Palestinian Authority, which
issued Yassin a diplomatic passport, would insist that Yassin be
allowed to travel freely.
	   Israeli lawmaker Haggai Merom suggested Yassin be allowed to
return to Gaza, but not to leave again.
	   ``We should have been left him in jail because he was quiet
then,'' he said on Israel Television. ``Now he is running abroad,
raising millions of dollars for Hamas and appearing as a legitimate
alternative to Yasser Arafat. In my opinion, the best thing is to
accept him back and not allow him out of there again.''

Veron remains a starter, despite doping rumors

<TEXT>
	   L'ETRAT, France (AP) _ Argentine midfielder Juan Veron, the
subject of rumors concerning a failed drug test, practiced as usual
with the starting lineup Monday.
	   The fact that Veron was allowed to work out was a possible
indication that the Argentine federation considers his case closed,
especially considering that coach Daniel Passarella is a
disciplinarian who vowed to clean things up following Diego
Maradona's expulsion for failing a drug test at the 1994 World Cup.
	   Veron and the rest of the team kept silent on the issue Monday.
Practice was closed to the reporters, who managed to follow the
action from a hill 200 meters (yards) away. The team will hold on
open practice Tuesday.
	   The team was shaken Saturday by rumors, originating from a radio
station in Argentina, that Veron had failed an internal doping
test.
	   The team denied the report, although its physician Luis Seveso
admitted ``something might have showed up'' in one test.
	   Seveso suggested Veron took an anti-flu medicine containing a
banned substance and considered it a minor issue because the test
was administered more than a week before the start of the World
Cup. FIFA has not acted on the report because the test was given by
the Argentine Soccer Association.
	   Argentina plays Japan in its World Cup opener Sunday in
Toulouse.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Wells Fargo and Co. and Norwest Corp. are
merging in a stock swap that values Wells Fargo at about dlrs34
billion and would create a financial powerhouse with banks in 21
states in the West and Midwest.
	   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo and Minneapolis-based Norwest
would combine under the deal announced Monday to form a company
with about dlrs191 billion in combined assets, more than 90,000
employees, about 20 million customers and 5,777 financial services
outlets worldwide.
	   The new company would be the sixth-largest bank in the United
States if all other bank mergers announced this year are completed.
	   The proposed deal would be the seventh largest overall and the
third biggest in the banking industry after Citicorp's planned
merger with Travelers Group and Nationsbank Corp.'s proposed
combination with BankAmerica Corp.
	   The financial services industry has been a hotbed of merger
activity as banks, brokers and insurers are striking alliances that
can instantly expand their base of customers while lowering costs.
	   Wells Fargo has been in a big deal before, winning with an
dlrs11.3 billion bid for First Interstate Corp. of Los Angeles in
1996.
	   But Wells had to close hundreds of branches and eliminated 7,000
jobs after that deal. It also lost customer deposits, bounced good
checks and incorrectly withdrew money from some accounts and
deposited it in others.
	   Norwest, the nation's biggest mortgage underwriter, has been one
of the industry's top performing banks this decade.
	   In midday trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Wells
Fargo shares were up dlrs1.50 at dlrs3647.75 while Norwest shares
were down dlrs2.50 at dlrs37.18 3/4.
	   Under the latest deal, Wells Fargo shareholders would get 10
shares of common stock of Norwest in exchange for each share of
Wells Fargo common stock. That would leave Wells Fargo stockholders
with about 52.5 percent of the combined company and Norwest with
approximately 47.5 percent.
	   The combined compay would retain the Wells Fargo name and would
be based in San Francisco. Minneapolis will be headquarters for the
combined Midwest banking business.
	   Paul Hazen, chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo, would
be chairman of the combined company, while Richard M. Kovacevich,
chairman and chief executive of Norwest, would become president and
chief executive.
	   The combined company would have offices nationwide for mortgage
and consumer lending and have banks in 21 states across the
Midwest, Rocky Mountain and Western regions. It would also have
outlets in Canada, the Caribbean, Latin America and other
countries.
	   Wells Fargo and Norwest expect to save at least dlrs650 million
in costs annually by the third year in operation. Norwest spokesman
Larry Haeg said there have been no decisions made on job cuts, and
said efforts would be made to retrain any employees whose jobs may
be cut for other positions.
	   ``We believe the partnership of these two companies offers
terrific opportunities for customers, employees, and
shareholders,'' Hazen said in a statement.
	   Kovacevich said the merger would unite high performing companies
with complementary businesses, products, technology, markets and
customers.
	   ``It will be a leading franchise in the western United States
with all the resources necessary to meet all of our customers'
financial needs and serve them when, where and how they want to be
served,'' he said.
	   The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies, but
must also get approval from regulators and stockholders.
	   As part of the deal, each company was given an option to buy up
to 19.9 percent of the other company on favorable terms. Such
arrangements are commonly included in merger pacts to discourage
unwanted suitors from breaking up the deal.

Bishops and Vatican try to stem exodus of Iraqi Christians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In black turbans and red sashes, Christian
bishops gathered Monday to try to stem the flight of the faithful
from Iraq. But few held out hope of slowing an exodus that has cut
Christian numbers by a third since 1990.
	   ``This immigration is stripping us of our best brains and the
most well-off among us,'' the Rev. Youssef Habbi, an Iraqi
historian, told The Associated Press.
	   The rush of immigration dates to the Gulf crisis. Many Christian
clergymen blame the U.N. trade sanctions, sparked by Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait, for the flight of the Christians, mostly young
people.
	   The sanctions limit Iraq's export of oil and have devastated the
economy. Habbi said the flight since 1990 has cut from 750,000 to
500,000 a once thriving Christian community whose roots go back to
the first century.
	   About 80 percent of Iraqi Christians are Chaldaean Catholics,
but the three-day meeting of the bishops is also represented by
other denominations: Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholics, Armenian
Catholic and Armenian Orthodox.
	   Pope John Paul II's envoy, Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, is
attending, with a message beseeching Iraqi Christians to stay.
Others attending are bishops from Palestine, Lebanon and Russia.
	   The pontiff has repeatedly criticized sanctions on Iraq. He has
expressed a wish to visit the birthplace of Abraham, the Iraqi city
of Ur, and Etchegaray also will go to Ur to discuss a possible
papal trip.
	   The meeting is the third organized since 1991, but Habbi said
the gatherings did very little to check the flow, nor did a plea
from the pope read in churches in 1994.
	   Indeed, among Christians interviewed Sunday, several said
nothing would really be done to relieve their economic problems.
	   ``The pope lives in his mansions in the Vatican and knows very
little about our situation,'' said Jubrael Marouki who has already
sold his belongings to leave the country.
	   Added Daniel Auraha: ``The church is rich but it has practically
done nothing to help us.''
	   Patriarch Rafael Bedaweed, head of the Iraqi church, admitted
his failure in checking the immigration.
	   ``They are not fleeing because of religious or ethnic
oppression. They want us to solve their economic problems and
simply we are not able to do that,'' said Bedaweed, a Chaldaean.
	   More than 30,000 Iraqi Christians are now stranded in
neighboring Jordan waiting for visas to Western countries which
they rarely get, said Habbi, also a Chaldaean Catholic.
	   ``Frustrated, they give all they have to professional smugglers
who illegally transfer them to a Western country where they ask for
asylum mostly on humanitarian grounds,'' he added.
	   Iraqis traveling abroad must pay an exit fee of 400,000 dinars
(dlrs 300) and can only carry on leaving is dlrs 50. Moreover,
people with higher degrees like university professors, doctors and
engineers are banned from leaving.
	   To skirt the exit measures, several thousand Christians sold
belongings recently and fled to Greece via Turkey through the
Kurdish rebel enclave in northern Iraq.
	   Stories abound of families perishing on the snow-capped
mountains of Kurdistan or drowning when their boats capsized on the
way to Greece.
	   Habbi said Iraqi Christians have illegally made it to Sri Lanka,
New Zealand and even Iceland, adding, ``We simply cannot keep track
of this diaspora.''

Landslides, rain kill six in India's remote northeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Landslides triggered by pre-monsoon
torrential rains in India's northeast swept away a family of five
and flattened a mosque, killing a Muslim priest, officials said
Monday.
	   The deaths occurred Sunday night in Cachar, 380 kilometers (285
miles) south of Gauhati, the capital of Assam state, Superintendent
of Police J. H. Ahmed said.
	   More than 150 people were injured in the landslides in the
province, where flooded rivers also disrupted road and railroad
links.
	   Meanwhile, a severe cyclone with wind speeds up to 120 kph (70
mph), was moving in the Arabian sea and expected to hit western
Gujarat state on Tuesday.
	   In the eastern part of Assam state, a river flooded 400 villages
over the weekend. Nearly 6,000 villagers fled their homes and took
shelter in the relief camps set up by the military and the state
government, district officials said on telephone.
	   Earlier this week, another landslide flattened a cluster of
tin-roofed mud huts and killed at least 21 sleeping tea plantation
workers in Assam state.

Emotions choke outgoing FIFA president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-FIFA President &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Stepping down from the helm of world football after
almost a quarter century, even the normally businesslike Joao
Havelange choked with emotion.
	   Hundreds of delegates and guests attending FIFA's pre-World Cup
Congress rose to applaud their outgoing 82-year-old leader as
colleagues presented him with a gold-plated plaque as a token of
their gratitude for transforming a sleepy, eight-person bureau into
a giant with a projected budget of dlrs 184 million in 1998.
	   After receiving the prize, Havelange approached a microphone to
express his gratitude, but turned away when he broke into tears.
	   ``We understand the emotions confusing the president,'' said
FIFA's deputy secretary general Michel Zen-Ruffinen, who quickly
took over as Havelange composed himself and wiped his eyes with a
handkerchief.
	   Sepp Blatter, FIFA's general secretary, won the election to
secede Havelange, who was named honorary president.

World Cup: Pagliuca, Zamorano set to play a private game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS to France in dateline. &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Inter Milan teammates Gianluca Pagliuca
and Ivan Zamorano will be involved in two games when Italy and
Chile square off in their World Cup opener on Thursday.
	   Besides their Group B clash, the Italian keeper and Chilean
striker have been chiding each other on their team's respective
chances at France '98 _ and offering personal challenges.
	   ``It's not a real bet, but Ivan promised to score one goal on
me. He has been pestering me for weeks,'' Italy's starting keeper
said at the team's training camp north of Paris.
	   ``I told him he won't. But I am ready to surrender (a goal),
under the condition that Italy wins the match. I believe Italy is
stronger than Chile.''
	   Zamorano was expected to start against the Azzurri, despite
nursing a knee injury, and Pagliuca has said the presence of the
Chilean striker would help Italy play a more determined and focused
game.
	   ``He's a key, great player. If he's as good as in the UEFA Cup
with Inter, he can be very dangerous for Italy. But I'm not hoping
for his absence. I hope to play him, and beat him,'' Pagliuca said.
	   Zamorano scored the first goal and was a key figure in Inter's
dominating 3-0 victory over Lazio in the all-Italian UEFA Cup final
in Paris last month.
	   Pagliuca is also looking forward to playing another of his Inter
teammates in the World Cup _ Brazilian forward Ronaldo.
	   The Italian keeper, who will be starting for Italy in his second
World Cup, ascended to the starter's job when Angelo Peruzzi of
Juventus pulled a muscle and was dropped from the roster.
	   ``As usual the opening match will be crucial for (advancing).
Chile is a tough opponent, but I feel we will have a better start
than four years ago,'' Pagliuca said.
	   Italy lost 1-0 to Ireland to open their 1994 tournament before
reaching the championship match, where it lost on penalty kicks to
Brazil.
	   ``I still remember that lost final, but I have no nightmares
about it,'' said Pagliuca, who after holding Brazil to a 0-0 draw
through 120 minutes, stopped one penalty kick in the 3-2 shootout
loss.
	   ``Under the new rules, the strikers are going to shine in this
edition. It's going to Ronaldo's and Del Piero's World Cup,''
Pagliuca said.
	   Alessandro Del Piero, Italy talented forward, is not expected to
play Thursday due to his continuing recovering from a right thigh
strain.
	   He likely will be replaced by veteran Roberto Baggio.
	   Baggio, the 1994 World Cup hero, recently signed a lucrative
two-year contract with Inter.
	   ``With Baggio and Ronaldo in front, we will have no excuse next
season. We will have to win the league title,'' Pagliuca said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Education Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Najib
Tun Razak today urged teachers not to depend too much on textbooks
but to be creative when educating their pupils on environmental
protection.
	   He said the aim should be to instil a deep-rooted awareness of
and love for the environment.
	   He said this after launching the ``Wira Alam'' project and the
``Malaysia: Agenda 21 Versi Kanak-kanak'' (Malaysia: Agenda 21
Childen's Edition) and ``Alam Sekitar Anugerah Tuhan''
(Environment, a Gift from God) books at the Malaysian Islamic
Understanding Institute (Ikim).
	   The launch was jointly conducted with Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Datuk Law Hieng Ding.
	   Najib also said there should be an environment club in all
schools to create awareness among schoolchildren.
	   ``Most schools have already set up the club. The ones that have
yet to do so should do it soon,'' he said.
	   He said teachers and headmasters should encourage pupils to
participate in activities organised by the club.
	   The book ``Environment, a Gift from God'' was jointly published
by the Department of Environment and Ikim.
	   Law said its aim was to instil a love for the environment and to
create understanding about environment issues among schoolchildren.
	   The children's edition of the Agenda 21 was published by the DOE
based on the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit.
	   Both books are being distributed to all schools, public
libraries, universities and non-governmental organisations.
	   Najib said schools could use these books as a reference when
conducting lessons on the environment.
	   The ``Wira Alam'' project was initiated by the DOE and the
Malaysian Nature Society to provide motivation and an opportunity
to pupils to contribute to environmental conservation via
activities of school environment clubs.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A golden eagle didn't like the noisy
intruder over its turf and immediately engaged it in aerial combat.
	   The tiny model airplane didn't have a chance.
	   A tourist was flying a radio-controlled plane near the town of
Roeros late last month when the eagle swept down on it, grabbed the
model in its talons and shook it for several minutes, the Arbeidets
Rett newspaper reported Monday.
	   Local bird expert Oeyvind Lunde, who has studied eagles for 25
years, told the newspaper that he never heard of anything like it.
	   The model plane, with half the eagle's two-meter (yard)
wingspan, suffered a broken wing, and severe tears in its cloth
fuselage, said the local newspaper in Roeros, about 325 kilometers
(200 miles) north of Oslo. The tourist's name was not reported.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Aircraft used for aerial surveillance and
cloud- seeding will be installed with global positioning system for
more effective land and forest fires monitoring.
	   Science, Technology and Environment Minister Datuk Law Hieng
Ding said today the GPS, a network of satellites, could help the
authorities immediately detect fires and pinpoint the exact
location of the incidents.
	   ``These aircraft can be used not only for Malaysia, but also for
our neighbouring countries, particularly Indonesia.
	   ``As such, we have to get consent from Indonesia to allow our
aircraft to cross the borders when the need arises,'' he said after
launching the Wira Alam project, and the Malaysia: Agenda 21 -
Children's Version and Alam Sekitar Anugerah Tuhan books at the
Islamic Institute of Understanding Malaysia, at Langgak Tunku, off
Jalan Duta.
	   The launch was carried out jointly with Education Minister Datuk
Seri Najib Tun Razak.
	   Information Minister Datuk Mohamed Rahmat, who will be meeting
with Indonesian officials soon to discuss the implementation of the
Memorandum of Understanding on Disasters, is seeking approval for
future cross-border operations.
	   At present, 10 aircraft including helicopters being used for
aerial surveillance and cloud-seeding have already been installed
with GPS.
	   Law said a mobile GPS unit would cost about RM25,000 each and a
fixed one RM53,000. The battery for the mobile unit can only last
for two hours.
	   He said the units were easily available in Malaysia.
	   The Malaysian Centre for Remote Sensing has been asked to assist
in the installation process.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - A former officer with the Domestic Trade
and Consumer Affairs Ministry told the High Court today that she
received numerous complaints about direct selling company Nanang
International Sdn Bhd.
	   Noriyah Ahmad said the complaints were made in July 1995 through
telephone calls and letters to her office.
	   She had earlier testified that the complaints were about the
marketing plan used by the company in selling its Chinese herbal
products and also the company's licence.
	   Noriyah, now with the Energy, Telecommunications and Posts
Ministry, said she had given this information to The Malay Mail
journalist Yushaimi Yahaya when he called her at her office to find
out about Nanang International.
	   She was giving evidence in a defamation suit filed by Nanang
International against Yushaimi, New Straits Times Sdn Bhd group
editor Datuk A. Kadir Jasin, and the publisher, The New Straits
Times Press (M) Bhd.
	   Nanang International claimed that a series of articles published
in The Malay Mail and the New Straits Times between April and May
1996 had defamed it as they meant, among others, the company was
operating illegally, was marketing the product by using the
outlawed pyramid system and had used influential persons to put
pressure on enforcement officers.
	   The company is claiming damages with interest and costs.
	   The defendants pleaded justification and claimed that the
articles were not defamatory.
	   On the Ministry's rejection of Nanang International's
application to renew its licence, Noriyah said the Ministry was not
compelled to inform the company of the reasons for rejection.
	   Nanang International was represented by Harpal Singh while
Lorraine Cheah appeared for the defendants.
	   Hearing continues.

Hoddle confident with World Cup preparation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Coach Glenn Hoddle takes his England squad to
France on Tuesday confident he has done everything possible to make
the team a legitimate contender to win the World Cup.
	   Hoddle put the squad through its final preparations on home soil
Monday at Bisham Abbey and is now eager to face the first test of
the World Cup campaign against Tunisia on June 15.
	   Hoddle said the squad enjoyed the fact they had big expectations
on them.
	   ``After the way we qualified after last summer, there's no
reason not to be positive,'' he said Monday.
	   ``We're prepared better than any other England team has been.
The times when we've put a World Cup head on, when we've had a
World Cup team, we've been very impressive.''
	   Hoddle, who sparked a major controversy in Britain by dropping
star midfielder Paul Gascoigne from his 22-man squad for fitness
reasons, said his team had been prepared for seven games.
	   ``If it goes wrong, it goes wrong, but the approach has been
right,'' he said. ``Everything has been planned right through to
the final _ it's no good when something comes up halfway through
and for us to say `we didn't think of that'. That's not arrogance,
just professionalism.''
	   After omitting Stuart Pearce and Paul Gascoigne, Hoddle is
taking a squad to France which has no experience of playing in a
World Cup.
	   Hoddle admitted that was not ideal but was not insurmountable.
	   ``If we'd been going into it without the likes of David Seaman,
Tony Adams and Alan Shearer, if they'd all been injured, I'd have
said our chances were slim,'' Hoddle said.
	   Hoddle said the situation put extra responsibility on him as the
coach, as well as Ray Clemence and Kenny Sansom from his backroom
team.
	   All three were in the squads in 1982 and 1986, and Hoddle is
determined the lessons learned in Spain and Mexico will be put into
practice.
	   Hoddle has scheduled a behind-closed-doors match against French
Second Division side Caen when the squad arrives in France Tuesday.
	   The coach, forced to leave Graeme Le Saux (flu) and Sol Campbell
(leg injury) on the sidelines for Monday's session, said the reason
for the game was to keep players fresh.
	   ``We had to look at certain people in certain position and this
is an ideal time for us to play this kind of game,'' he said.
	   ``It's one step further than you'd get on a training ground and
a chance to try a few things out.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Twelve hours after collecting vehicles from
the manufacturers, limousines and executive coaches which
complement the Kuala Lumpur International Airport's public
transportation system were put on trial runs today.
	   Traffic congestion on major city roads following this morning's
downpour, delayed the ``scheduled'' trial runs by almost an hour.
	   Despite the downpour and late arrivals, the journey proper from
the temporary terminal at the Tun Razak hockey stadium car park in
Jalan Duta, went without a hitch.
	   Drivers taking part in the trial run said the vehicles were
collected from the manufacturers last night.
	   To get a first-hand view of operations, Entrepreneur Development
Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed turned up to take part in the trial
runs.
	   Accompanying him were his deputy Datuk Idris Jusoh, Ministry
secretary- general Datuk Abdullah Tahir, Commercial Vehicle
Licensing Board chairman Zakiah Hashim and senior Ministry
officials.
	   Also present were Datuk Mohd Nor Mohamad, DRB-Hicom senior group
director, which is invovled in the Kuala Lumpur City Bus company,
and Badardin Ahmad, Airport Limo managing director.
	   Besides the Airport Limo limousines, KLCB executive coaches and
PlusLiner coaches, red-and-white taxis were also invited to take
part in the trial runs.
	   Speaking to the media later, Mustapa said the journey went
without a hitch.
	   ``I am glad we had a smooth trip,'' he said.
	   He also expressed satisfaction with facilities for the executive
coaches and limousines available at the KLIA.
	   Leaving the hockey stadium carpark at 10.10am, the convoy of
vehicles proceeded towards the North Klang Valley Expressway, via
the Jalan Duta exit.
	   Proceeding along the NKVE, the convoy turned into the Elite
expressway at the Batu Tiga interchange.
	   At 11am, the convoy pulled into the KLIA's main terminal where
KLCB and Airport Limo's depots are located.
	   Present at the main terminal were senior officials from KLIA
Berhad, including its chairman Tan Sri Clifford Herbert, and
Malaysia Airports Bhd executives.
	   The ``passengers'' alighted at the KLCB terminal and were shown
check-in counter facilities at the bus terminal.
	   ``This enables passengers to check in their luggage, collect the
boarding passes and proceed to their departure gates without having
to lug their baggage around,'' a senior MAB official said.
	   For the return journey, passengers would be able to board the
limousines at the main terminal's arrival lounge while those
boarding the buses can do so at the KLCB terminal.

Turkish president rejects premier's early election deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - President Suleyman Demirel has refused to
back the early election deal presented by Turkey's premier last
week, reports said Monday.
	   ``I won't allow a government formula to be imposed on me,'' the
daily Hurriyet quoted Demirel as saying.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and Deniz Baykal, leader of the
Republican People's Party, agreed last week to call early polls on
April 18.
	   Yilmaz said he would resign in December in favor of an interim
government. Yilmaz and Baykal said they would not take on the
premiership.
	   ``It is up to the prime minister to resign and it is up to me to
decide what will happen afterwards,'' Demirel said on state
television Sunday after meeting Yilmaz.
	   The president traditionally designates the largest party's
leader as prime minister. Currently Turkey's largest party in
parliament is the Islamic Virtue Party with 143 seats.
	   Yilmaz's center-right Motherland Party has 140.
	   But nomination of an Islamic prime minister appears unlikely,
since Turkey's last Islamic-led government was forced to resign
last year under pressure from the staunchly pro-secular army.
	   Claiming it would bring political stability to the country,
Demirel has been lobbying for major constitutional reform that
would change the parliamentary system to a presidential system.
	   Three coalition governments have collapsed since 1995.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Police today arrested a man in connection
with a RM50,000 heist at a goldsmith shop in Jalan Kelang Lama,
where its proprietress was shot and injured by one of three robbers
last month.
	   A police party from the City Criminal Investigation Department
nabbed the man at a house in Bandar Sri Damansara about 10.30am.
	   He then led the party, led by Assistant Superintendent Thomas
Navamoney, to a workshop in Sri Segambut where a .45 Colt pistol
and a .38 Colt revolver were seized.
	   This brings to two, the number of people detained in connection
with the robbery at the Kedai Emas Lei Kim which occurred about
3.30pm on May 21.
	   The other man was detained when he sought treatment for a
gunshot wound in the shoulder at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital, a day
after the robbery.
	   City Criminal Investigation Department chief Senior Assistant
Commissioner II Mat Drus Sudin confirmed the arrest of the second
man and the seizure of the guns.
	   It is learnt the police have established the identity of the
suspected robber who is still at large.
	   In the robbery, the 36-year-old goldsmith shop proprietress was
shot and injured in the abdomen by one of the three robbers who
opened fire.
	   On seeing the commotion, a security guard at the shop returned
fire at the three men while they were trying to escape with three
trays of jewellery worth about RM50,000, hitting one of them.
	   However, the robbers escaped in a car which was found abandoned,
about a kilometre away from the shop.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The Ampang Sessions Court today fined a
contractor RM40,000 for carrying out open burning at a garbage dump
in Kajang.
	   PortPower (M) Sdn Bhd admitted burning the garbage at the dump
site about 4.30pm on April 9.
	   The company, situated at Jalan Melor Satu, Taman Sri Ramal,
Kajang, was represented by its directors Mohd Fadzil Mohd Said and
Hamzah Abdul Hamid, both 34.
	   It is responsible for supervising the disposal of garbage at the
Kajang Municipal Council garbage dumping site at Kampung Sungai
Kembong, Semenyih.
	   An officer from the Department of Environment and a technician
had discovered the open burning when checking the site.
	   The company was charged under Section 22(1) of the Environmental
Quality Act 1974 which carries a maximum fine of RM100,000 or five
year's jail or both.
	   In mitigation, counsel Mohd Bashir Abd Kadir, for PortPower,
said the incident was caused by a third party.
	   He said the company had spent about RM7,000 to spread sand over
the affected area and that it had pleaded guilty to save the
court's time.
	   The company, he said, had, in the interest of the public,
stationed a guard at the dump site.
	   Wan Abdul Latiff Wan Jaafar and Abdul Malik Ahmad prosecuted
before judge Hue Siew Kheng. PortPower paid the fine.

	   PENANG, Fri. - Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim
said today that Bumiputera control in the State's business and
housing was still very small.
	   He said this was reflected in reports received by the State
Bumiputera steering committee and the State Umno.
	   It was thus understandable, he said, that the State Umno Youth
had been calling on the Government here, local authorities and
agencies to be fairer in the distribution (of projects and
licences) to Bumiputeras.
	   ``We cannot allow the gap to widen among the races as it will
cause problems,'' he told reporters after chairing the meetings of
the two bodies today.
	   Anwar said he had told the two bodies to relay their grievances
through the proper channels so as not to jeopardise inter-party
relations and cooperation.
	   ``I have advised them to negotiate directly with the State
Government, the local authorities or agencies concerned.
	   ``I have also asked the State Government, the Penang Island
Municipal Council (MPPP) and Seberang Prai Municipal Council (MPSP)
to consider their dissatisfaction because some of the reports and
figures are really worrying,'' he said.
	   Commenting on a memorandum from the State Umno Youth calling for
the presidents of the MPPP and MPSP who are politicians to be
replaced with administration officers, Anwar said: ``Their
memorandum stems from the unsatisfactory figures gleaned from the
point of the implementation of projects, Bumiputera control of
business, housing and sites for doing business,'' he said.
``However, the solution is not in replacing any person or
department, but in ensuring that implementation is in accordance to
agreed policies,'' he said.
	   Asked about an apparent split in the DAP, Anwar said it was an
internal party matter. ``The more members they sack, the less our
problems (will be),'' he quipped.
	   The DAP yesterday announced the indefinite suspension of
national vice- chairman Liew Ah Kim and treasurer Fung Ket Wing.
National publicity secretary Wee Choo Keong was relieved of his
post for criticising the party leadership.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Fri. - Chief Minister Tan Sri Bernard Dompok said
today Finance Minister-designate Datuk Osu Sukam would take the
oath of office before the Yang di Pertua Negeri Tun Sakaran Dandai
at 11am on Monday.
	   Osu resigned as Federal Minister of Land and Cooperative
Development effective Monday to pave the way for his appointment.
	   It follows Datuk Abdul Ghapur Salleh's decision not be
re-appointed when the Cabinet under Dompok took the oath on May 28.
	   Dompok said Osu's appointment would further strengthen the State
Government, considering his 12 years in the Federal Government.
	   ``I have known him even before politics. With the experience we
have in Government all these years, I think there is no reason
people like us cannot work together for the good of the State and
the Government,'' he said.
	   Osu met Dompok at the Chief Minister's office this morning.
	   Meanwhile, Osu said although the State Cabinet comprised
experienced people, team work was more important.
	   The State Government must prove that despite the economic
problems, it could still meet the aspirations of the people.
	   On Ghapur's decision against re-appointment, Osu said it was his
(Ghapur) right.
	   ``What is important is he is sincere to give others a chance to
be appointed to the post,'' he told reporters before leaving for
Kuala Lumpur.
	   He added that Ghapur was still Sabah Umno deputy liaison chief.

World Cup: Clemente calls Nigeria toughest opponent in tough group
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ Puffing away and swearing as usual,
Spanish coach Javier Clemente told a press conference Monday that
he and his team were focusing exclusively on opening opponent
Nigeria, who he described as the toughest team in a tough group.
	   ``The team is thinking solely about Nigeria. I've watched them
14 times and I've studied them all over,'' Clemente said in an
hour-long conference, his first since Spain arrived in France on
Thursday.
	   ``I know very little about Paraguay and Bulgaria,'' the
tough-talking, red-headed Basque coach said about his other Group D
opponents.
	   He added that he would begin studying video tapes of his other
foes once Olympic champion Nigeria was out of the way.
	   ``We start out against the toughest team in a tough group,'' he
said, adding that although Nigeria ``played like dogs'' against the
Netherlands in a 5-1 loss on Friday, he felt friendly game results
were meaningless once the World Cup begins.
	   Obviously in good humor _ despite his customary grumpy frown _
and in the mood to talk, Clemente puffed away on cigarettes, made
frequent witty remarks and used common Spanish expletives
throughout the conference, which was attended by some 80 reporters.
	   ``I'm not in any way uptight,'' he said, answering a question
about reports to the contrary. ``I'm very relaxed and really having
a good time.''
	   On several occasions the 48-year-old, small, stocky coach
sparked rounds of laughter as he chastised journalists whose mobile
phones were ringing. He refused to continue talking until they
stopped.
	   Boasting that his squad was capable of taking the trophy, he
said the it was the fastest he's ever coached for Spain, and
technically and talent-wise in great shape. He went on to dispute
criticism that Spain has never been mentally focussed toward
winning the World Cup.
	   ``What's all this mentality stuff?'', he asked. ``Which player
in hell is not mentally prepared to win? Anyway, mentality is all
very well, but legs are what put goals in.''
	   He said the fact that Spain was now considered among the
favorites was due to its hard work, taking an 8-2-0 qualifying
record into the finals.
	   ``I like it being a favorite, but that doesn't help you win.
Only hard work does that,'' he said.
	   He announced that from Tuesday until Sunday, Spain would train
behind closed doors each day at 2:30 p.m. _ Saturday's kickoff time
_ so that the team would get accustomed to playing at an hour when
Spaniards normally have their main meal of the day.
	   For the first time in weeks, the Spanish squad also was without
any noteworthy injury problems, Clemente said. He stressed that
veteran goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta and Real Madrid forward Raul
Gonzalez were totally recovered, and also noted that only defender
Fernando Hierro and striker Kiko Narvaez had slight nagging ankle
problems.

World Cup: Clemente calls Nigeria toughest opponent in tough group
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT category coding. &QL; 
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ Puffing away and swearing as usual,
Spanish coach Javier Clemente told a press conference Monday that
he and his team were focusing exclusively on opening opponent
Nigeria, who he described as the toughest team in a tough group.
	   ``The team is thinking solely about Nigeria. I've watched them
14 times and I've studied them all over,'' Clemente said in an
hour-long conference, his first since Spain arrived in France on
Thursday.
	   ``I know very little about Paraguay and Bulgaria,'' the
tough-talking, red-headed Basque coach said about his other Group D
opponents.
	   He added that he would begin studying video tapes of his other
foes once Olympic champion Nigeria was out of the way.
	   ``We start out against the toughest team in a tough group,'' he
said, adding that although Nigeria ``played like dogs'' against the
Netherlands in a 5-1 loss on Friday, he felt friendly game results
were meaningless once the World Cup begins.
	   Obviously in good humor _ despite his customary grumpy frown _
and in the mood to talk, Clemente puffed away on cigarettes, made
frequent witty remarks and used common Spanish expletives
throughout the conference, which was attended by some 80 reporters.
	   ``I'm not in any way uptight,'' he said, answering a question
about reports to the contrary. ``I'm very relaxed and really having
a good time.''
	   On several occasions the 48-year-old, small, stocky coach
sparked rounds of laughter as he chastised journalists whose mobile
phones were ringing. He refused to continue talking until they
stopped.
	   Boasting that his squad was capable of taking the trophy, he
said the it was the fastest he's ever coached for Spain, and
technically and talent-wise in great shape. He went on to dispute
criticism that Spain has never been mentally focussed toward
winning the World Cup.
	   ``What's all this mentality stuff?'', he asked. ``Which player
in hell is not mentally prepared to win? Anyway, mentality is all
very well, but legs are what put goals in.''
	   He said the fact that Spain was now considered among the
favorites was due to its hard work, taking an 8-2-0 qualifying
record into the finals.
	   ``I like it being a favorite, but that doesn't help you win.
Only hard work does that,'' he said.
	   He announced that from Tuesday until Sunday, Spain would train
behind closed doors each day at 2:30 p.m. _ Saturday's kickoff time
_ so that the team would get accustomed to playing at an hour when
Spaniards normally have their main meal of the day.
	   For the first time in weeks, the Spanish squad also was without
any noteworthy injury problems, Clemente said. He stressed that
veteran goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta and Real Madrid forward Raul
Gonzalez were totally recovered, and also noted that only defender
Fernando Hierro and striker Kiko Narvaez had slight nagging ankle
problems.

U.S. Coast Guard repatriates seven Cuban migrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The U.S. Coast Guard repatriated
seven Cubans rescued last week from a 15-foot boat near the
Bahamas, officials said Monday.
	   They were taken to the port at Bahia de Cabanas, Cuba Saturday
morning. An eighth migrant was granted political asylum and sent to
the U.S. Navy Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to begin applying for a
visa.
	   The eight Cubans were found adrift June 2 about 30 miles
southeast of Cay Lobos in the Bahamas. The boat's engine had
failed, the Coast Guard said.

Blatter is new head of FIFA, arrests made, pilots make free offer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECT attribution of quote from Johansson to Blatter in 9th
graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sepp Blatter won a contentious fight for the FIFA
presidency on Monday, while two other battles _ against terrorism
and a potentially disruptive airline strike _ wore on just two days
before the start of the World Cup.
	   And somewhere in between, more teams set up training camps
throughout the countryside in anticipation of their first-round
games. Oddly enough, the latest arrivals were the French, who had
escaped all the hype to work out in Finland for a few days.
	   ``The team is bubbling with impatience,'' coach Aime Jacquet
said as his squad settled in Clairfontaine, among the woods
southwest of Paris.
	   Blatter, FIFA's general secretary and choice of outgoing
president Joao Havelange, defeated European confederation chief
Lennart Johansson 111-80 in balloting among FIFA membership.
Blatter, from Switzerland, needed two-thirds of the votes for an
outright victory, but his Swedish opponent conceded before a second
ballot could be held.
	   ``I would like to thank all of you _ those who voted for me and
those who did not vote for me, because we are in a democracy. The
great thing to do is to unite the family,'' said Blatter, who then
praised Johansson as a ``gentleman'' and a ``friend.''
	   Both candidates had promised to make FIFA more open and
democratic, a contrast to the dictatorial style associated with
Havelange. Among their differences was the proposed location for
the 2006 World Cup: Blatter has all but promised the tournament to
Africa for the first time, while Johansson favored Germany.
	   ``The result is there, consequently he is the winner and we will
have to cooperate for the good of the game,'' Johansson said. ``But
we're not dropping our program. I'm loyal to the president, but I'm
not going to obey everything he says.''
	   The election ended a bitter, globe-trotting campaign that cost
more than a million dollars.
	   ``There may have been a few fouls, but we never tackled from
behind,'' Blatter said. ``Now we need to think of what is fair.''
	   Havelange, 82, who chose not to run for another four-year term
amid questions of corruption and growing criticism of his
administration, wiped away tears after the result was announced.
His 24-year tenure as FIFA president expires at the end of the
World Cup.
	   As the ceremonies continued inside the Equinox Hall, French
authorities were combing the country in their vigilant campaign
against terrorist threats to disrupt the World Cup. Nine more
suspects were arrested Monday, and police urged the public to watch
out for bombs.
	   The suspects were considered close to aides of Hassan Hattab, a
leader of the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria, who allegedly has
ordered an attack during the tournament.
	   ``We have to be vigilant, every citizen must be vigilant without
losing their cool,'' Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement
said. ``If you see something suspect, first get away, then call.''
	   Seven of the suspects were arrested in the Paris area, while two
other people were apprehended in the southern city of Carpentras
and the northern city of Roubaix, police said.
	   Meanwhile, there was a novel twist in the eight-day old strike
by Air France pilots. The SNPL, main pilots' union, made an
unexpected offer to work for free to fly foreign fans to the World
Cup games.
	   Air France said it would study the measure, but three smaller
pilot unions on Monday rejected the proposal, saying they would
advise members not to cooperate.
	   The walkout shows no sign of ending soon, and is certain to
disrupt the World Cup, which begins Wednesday when Brazil plays
Scotland and Norway faces Morocco.
	   The huge cache of political developments overshadowed the
supposed centerpiece of the tournament _ the players.
	   Belgium, in its fifth consecutive World Cup, began training at
Monthieux in the eastern part of France and wasted no time praising
its neighbor, the Netherlands. The two teams meet in the first
round Saturday.
	   ``I'm so impressed with the Dutch,'' coach Georges Leekens said.
``It's a machine that is far better than we are.''
	   Another injury to versatile defender and midfielder Thomas
Helmer provided a damper to Germany's first full day of practice in
Nice.
	   Helmer showed up lame after hurting his right thigh in Sunday's
workout. Also missing was wing back Christian Ziege, who is
battling a fever.
	   ``It's a real, real shame for Thomas,'' coach Berti Vogts said.
``He was being treated this morning and perhaps he can do some
light jogging this afternoon.''
	   South Korea worked out under a cloak of secrecy, revealing few
tactics in a two-hour session opened to the public. Coach Cha
Bum-kun, who would not let his players speak to the foreign media,
said his biggest concern was a knee injury suffered last week by
three-time World Cup veteran striker Hwang Sun-hong.
	   ``It is a very grave situation,'' Cha said. ``... He's out of
the first game against Mexico, but I hope that he might recover to
play later in the tournament.''

	   PETALING JAYA, Fri. - Three senior DAP members, who were
suspended on Wednesday, have called for an ``independent and
impartial'' committee to investigate charges levelled against them.
	   In a two-paragraph statement, national vice-chairman Liew Ah
Kim, party treasurer Fung Ket Wing and national publicity secretary
Wee Choo Keong said they were innocent of all charges levelled
against them by party secretary-general Lim Kit Siang.
	   Yesterday, during a Press conference in Malacca, Kit Siang said
the decision to remove them was taken following complaints from the
Malacca and Perak State committees.
	   Kit Siang charged they had made statements that had undermined
party morale, created confusion and caused disharmony as well as
disunity among members.
	   Meanwhile, at a Press conference at the party headquarters
today, Kit Siang said he could accept criticism at specific forums
but not falsehoods and baseless allegations.
	   Kit Siang read from a prepared text, and when asked to elaborate
by reporters, refused to answer any questions.
	   He declined to answer questions on what were the ``falsehoods
and baseless allegations'' levelled at party leaders but said the
central executive committee removed Wee because it had lost
confidence in him as the national publicity secretary.
	   He said the CEC did not decide on whether the three had breached
party discipline, as this matter had been referred to the
disciplinary committee headed by Ahmad Nor.
	   Kit Siang said he had spoken to Fung yesterday and hoped that
there would be a new beginning whereby every party leader could
come together to work for the greater good of the party and
country.
	   In another development, Kit Siang said the CEC had decided to
bring forward the party congress by four months to Aug 22-23. He
said this was decided at Wednesday night's meeting.
	   ``This is to allow the party to elect a new leadership,
especially as a general election is imminent,'' he added.

Bus fire in Armenia injures at least 11 schoolchildren, teacher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with one death, report that 20 were injured. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ A bus exploded and burst into flames on
a country road south of the Armenian capital, killing one student
and badly injuring at least 10 others and a teacher, officials said
Monday.
	   The explosion occurred late Sunday near the village of
Bartsrashen, 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of Yerevan, when 40
students, teachers and parents were returning from a picnic.
	   Officials said the explosion was apparently caused by a gas
leak.
	   Most buses and other vehicles in Armenia run on natural gas.
Gasoline is in short supply due to an economic blockade imposed by
neighboring Azerbaijan because of the territorial conflict over
Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   The victims were hospitalized in the Yerevan Central Hospital
and some were in critical condition, said Norair Davidian, the
hospital's leading burn expert. The students were between the ages
of 12 and 14.
	   Hospital officials said 11 people were injured, and that one
later died. The ITAR-Tass news agency said 20 people were injured.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - There appears to be a Coca-Cola price war
in the Klang Valley as several supermarkets have lowered prices
since the last Wise Spending price check.
	   Aktif Lifestyle supermarket at the Mall has reduced the price to
RM1.25 per 1.5 litre bottle, Uda Ocean was selling the item at
RM1.95 while TMC reduced the price to RM2.29 from RM2.40 per
bottle.
	   Some supermarkets also increased the prices of certain items
slightly.
	   As an example, Carrefour was selling Clorox bleach at a higher
price of RM2.65 compared to RM2.15 per litre on May 29.
	   Meanwhile, Jusco One Utama has increased the price of the item
by 20 sen, offering it for RM2.85 per litre.
	   Prices of other items remained relatively stable.
	   In Ipoh, the prices of several items at supermarkets in the city
remained unchanged since early this week, though the prices of some
items recorded an increase.
	   For example, a 700ml Organics shampoo was selling for RM17.80 at
Super Kinta, but at Jaya Jusco the price was RM21.95. This was much
higher than the previous price of RM17.90 during the supermarket's
`Ma'al Hijrah' sale earlier this week.
	   Another item is the Kleenex brand tissue which was selling for
RM5.50 at Jaya Jusco compared to its earlier price of RM5, while
the price of Scottex toilet rolls at Super Kinta went down from
RM6.50 to RM4.50.
	   Super Kinta was also selling Clorox bleach at a cheaper price of
RM2.60 compared with its earlier price of RM3.30.
	   In Johor Baru, there was slight variation in prices of most
items at the different supermarkets.
	   However there was an exception for 700ml Organics shampoo priced
at RM19.05, which was RM3.40 more at Tops, compared to Pasaraya
Coop.
	   In Penang, prices of Organics shampoo 700ml remained the same
between RM16.35 and RM18.50 at the two shopping complexes.
	   Colgate toothpaste 250g was still unavailable at the Looking
Good while it was selling RM5.50 at the Super Komtar.

	   SHAH ALAM, Fri. - The Federal Territory Counselling and Service
Centre today submitted a 30-point memorandum to the State
Government on ways of solving the water problem.
	   The 11-page memorandum was handed over to State Secretary Datuk
Hashim Meon at his office by FTCSC president P. Gunaseelan.
	   Gunaseelan was accompanied by his assistant secretary S.
Selvaraj, treasurer Jaspal Kaur and technical adviser M.
Ghanaseharan.
	   During the brief closed-door meeting, Hashim reportedly welcomed
the proposals and assured FTCSC that their suggestions would
receive due consideration.
	   State Agriculture and Fishery, Research and Development
Committee chairman Datuk Abdul Fatah Iskandar, who heads a
committee set up to study underground sources of water and ponds,
said some of the FTCSC proposals had already been implemented.
	   ``There are some that we are seriously looking into as they are
long-term measures to prevent water shortage in future,'' he said,
adding that the proposals would be referred to Menteri Besar Datuk
Abu Hassan Omar and State Executive Councillors.
	   He said the proposals would also be forwarded to the State
Waterworks Department and Puncak Niaga (M) Sdn Bhd.
	   The State Government, he added, welcomed proposals and
suggestions from the private and public sectors, non-governmental
organisations, experts and individuals on how best to resolve the
water crisis affecting Selangor and the Federal Territory.
	   The FTCSC is the first NGO to come forward with suggestions in
the wake of the water crisis.
	   Gunaseelan said it took FTCSC three weeks to draw up the 30
proposals as it was felt the time had come for the organisation to
do their part to assist the authorities resolve the water problem.
	   The FTCSC proposals include the formation of ``Independent Water
Producers'', more water catchment areas and setting up a computer
data centre to ensure proper distribution of water.
	   Gunaseelan said the centre had also proposed sending volunteers
to assist in manning the Waterworks Department hotlines and also
accompanying water tankers to affected areas.
	   ``The centre is prepared to give whatever assistance the State
Government needs in terms of voluntary service,'' he added.
	   Set up two years ago, the centre, which has some 250 members,
has been active in raising issues of public concern and offering
suggestions to help resolve problems affecting the nation.

U.S. fines Honda dlrs17 million on pollution charges

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Honda Motor Corp. agreed Monday to pay
dlrs17.1 million in fines and restitution for disconnecting
pollution-monitoring equipment in 1.6 million cars. Honda also will
spend dlrs250 million on free tuneups and warranty extensions for
the cars.
	   The consent agreement that Honda reached with the government
included dlrs12.6 million in civil penalties, the largest ever
under the Clean Air Act.
	   The automaker also agreed to spend an additional dlrs4.5 million
to implement various environmental projects.
	   ``This settlement means cleaner air for the American people,''
said Attorney General Janet Reno. ``It will help eliminate
thousands of tons of exhaust emissions ... . And it will help save
Honda owners money because they will get an early warning that
their car needs repair.''
	   In a separate action, the Justice Department and the
Environmental Protection Agency also reached agreement with Ford
Motor Co. on the recall of 45,000 Econoline vans because of
emission-control violations. The alleged violations already have
been corrected by Ford on 15,000 Econoline vans, EPA officials
said.
	   Ford, as part of a dlrs7.8 million settlement, agreed to pay
dlrs2.5 million in civil penalties and spend another dlrs5.3
million on environmental programs.
	   The government alleged that Ford illegally installed a device
that defeated the emissions-controls system in the 1997 Econoline
vans, increasing fuel economy but causing higher tailpipe emissions
at highway speeds.
	   ``This action is another step taken by this administration to
ensure that companies fulfill their responsibility to protect
public health and environment,'' EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner
said of the Ford settlement. ``High levels of smog can cause
breathing problems for millions of Americans and aggravate asthma
attacks in our children.''
	   The actions involving the two automakers were announced at a
news conference by the Justice Department and EPA.
	   Honda and Ford spokesmen did not comment immediately.
	   The charges against Honda involved the 1995 Civic and the 1996
and 1997 Accord, Civic, Prelude, Odyssey and Accura. The automaker
was charged with disabling certain emission-control diagnostic
equipment.
	   As part of the consent agreement filed in U.S. District Court
here and a related agreement with the California Air Resources
Board, Honda will extend the emissions warranty for all affected
models to 14 years or 150,000 miles, provide an engine check and
any emissions-related repairs needed between 50,000 and 75,000
miles of use, and provide a free tuneup between 75,000 and 150,000
miles of use.

	   SHAH ALAM, Fri. - The State Government will hold meet-the-people
sessions on the water crisis to give them an opportunity to voice
their grievances, Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar said today.
	   He said the sessions would initially be held at a centralised
location in the next two weeks and if the response was good,
similar sessions would be held in affected areas.
	   ``State Assemblymen, politicians, community leaders,
representatives from the Waterworks Department, other relevant
departments and agencies and Non-Governmental Organisations will be
represented at the sessions.''
	   He said there was a need for such sessions as people should be
given the correct picture of the water problem, the causes, the
short and long-term measures taken by the Federal and State
Government to resolve it.
	   ``They should also be made aware of the water levels in the
catchment areas and dams and the alternative measures to boost
water supply in Selangor, especially by tapping underground water
and from lakes, ponds and mining pools.''
	   Abu Hassan said the government also welcomed ideas, suggestions
and proposals to resolve the water problem.
	   On the revocation of the permit for a dialogue session on the
current water crisis organised by the Federation of Malaysian
Consumers Association, Abu Hassan said it was the prerogative of
the police.
	   ``They have their reasons,'' he said.
	   Abu Hassan advised those badly hit by the water rationing
exercise to get in touch through the Waterworks Department
hotlines.

Giants, pygmies and more: the World Cup is beckoning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MORT ROSENBLUM &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World Cup madness infused Paris on Monday, with
giants in the street, pygmies in the park, and burly young men in
funny clothes punching out the odd soda machine.
	   In the Metro, two extra-large sized Danes muscled through the
crowd in puffy white and red top hats nearly as tall as they were.
	   Norman Bruce, a dour Scot, had on his kilt and tam o'shanter,
ready to watch his team face Brazil in the opening game Wednesday.
Families cruised the Champs Elysees in a dozen national colors.
	   And French commuters watched at it all bemused, as if wondering
what the next month would add to an always lively summer season.
	   The staid daily Le Monde caught the mood in a headline: ``A
certain indifference toward the sporting, economic and media event
makes way for enthusiasm.''
	   Not everyone was enthusiastic.
	   Amy Sarfati, married to a Frenchman, had to hurry back with her
infant daughter from a trip home to California because of an Air
France strike. She found only one alternate roundabout flight.
	   ``I laughed when I saw that Air France was the official carrier
of the World Cup,'' she said. ``It should have been USAir.''
	   But crowds of Parisians gathered to watch preparations for the
grand opening. Crews practiced maneuvering four 60-foot-high giants
meant to symbolize the different cultures taking part in the games.
	   Visitors to town included 10 pygmies from the jungles of
Cameroon, brought in to play drums for an extravaganza Tuesday
night at the Place de la Concorde.
	   They brought tree fronds to build huts in the Tuilerie Gardens
so they would not have to sleep under a roof. They had not,
however, planned on the Paris chill.
	   Late Monday night, they were moved to a hotel. ``It worked out
okay,'' explained Edward Brachfeld, one of the organizers. ``They
had practiced sleeping in beds for 10 nights in the Cameroon.''
	   Although games will be played in eight cities besides Paris and
nearby Saint-Denis, the French capital is where the World Cup opens
and closes. Many visitors expect to hang around for the duration.
	   A full schedule of concerts, exhibitions and outdoor parties
have been planned. Huge video screens will display games for those
without tickets.
	   An extra 1,000 police officers have been put into service just
in case things get out of hand. Already, young toughs were
punishing vending machines for not recognizing foreign coins.
	   When booze flows to celebrate victory or mourn loss, authorities
know, anything could happen.
	   Bruce, the kilted Scot, was reserving judgment. Asked what he
thought of Paris in World Cup mode, he shrugged. ``It's all
right,'' he allowed. ``So far.''

	   KOTA BARU, Fri. - Local authorities were today told to speed up
the signing of the interim agreement with private companies for
solid waste disposal.
	   Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh
said speed on their part would enable privatisation of solid waste
management to be carried out smoothly throughout the country.
	   ``Although the Government has yet to table a Bill, we have to go
ahead with the privatisation.
	   ``Hence, the local authorities should sign the interim agreement
with the concessionaires as soon as possible,'' he told reporters
after launching a fire prevention campaign at Sekolah Menengah
Chung Cheng here.
	   Also present were Kota Lama Assemblyman Leong Su Siang, Kota
Baru MP Illani Isohak and State Fire and Rescue Department director
Saari Mian.
	   The Government had appointed four companies to manage solid
waste disposal. They were DRB-Hicom Group, Northern Waste
Industries, Southern Waste Management Sdn Bhd and MMC Engineering.
	   ``This covers the whole country - south, north, central and east
region,''
	   he said.
	   The northern region comprising Penang, Perak, Perlis and Kedah
would be managed by Northern Waste Industries.
	   The Southern Waste Management Sdn Bhd would manage solid waste
disposal in Malacca, Negri Sembilan and Johor while DRB-Hicom
Group, through its subsidiary, Alam Flora, would be responsible for
the central region comprising Kelantan, Trengganu, Pahang and
Selangor.
	   In Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan, the concessionaire is MMC
Engineering.

	   The results of the Asia Pacific Collaboration on Coronary Heart
Disease Risk Factor Intervention (ASPAC) study was released last
May in a press conference supported by Merck Sharp &AMP; Dohme
Philippines to the Philippine College of Physicians. The study
indicates that the Philippines has one of the lowest ratings in
terms of high cholesterol diagnosis and management and obesity
management, both being significant factors in coronary heart
disease (CHD).
	   The ASPAC studies was conducted by a team of cardiologists,
physicians, nurses, and healthcare workers in Australia, Indonesia,
Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand, and Taiwan. Data from over 180 hospitals and 4,000
patients from these countries were included in the study.
	   The study examined major risk factors of CHD, including high
blood pressure, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
Other information, such as dietary advices, drug treatments, and
heart treatment procedures were also collected and analyzed.
Results indicated that the Philippines requires much improvement in
diagnosis and treatment of high cholesterol and obesity; otherwise,
the incidence of heart attacks in the country will increase
dramatically.
	   Dr. Antonio Dans, the Philippine ASPAC study coordinator,
explains, ``We have to sit down and talk about what is the ideal
way of managing heart disease...the best information needs to
trickle down to the private practitioners, so that we know the
patients are getting the best care.''
	   One of the reasons the Philippines has such a low rating is that
many patients with high cholesterol do not follow their diet
requirements nor take medication that will prevent their condition
from developing into more serious cardiovascular disease.
	   Dr. Cesar Recto II of the Philippine Heart Association Council
on Preventive Cardiology explains, ``A large part of the problem is
patient noncompliance with therapy. Responsibility for proper
compliance, however, lies with both the patient and the
physician.''
	   What can help boost the rating of the Philippines is the
development of disease prevention programs by the government,
especially with CHD.
	   Government is an essential player in improving the health of
citizens, especially in making sure that they receive the proper
healthcare.
	   ``The current state of treatment of coronary risk factors in the
Philippines has shown us that proper therapy is not reaching all of
our patients. We know how to treat these patients. Now we must make
it a priority to see they receive all the benefits they deserve,''
says Dr. Dans. - JTNones

Russian markets waiting for news from Yeltsin trip to Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks drifted slightly lower in light
trading Monday, while traders waited to see whether President Boris
Yeltsin would bring home an aid package from his two-day visit to
Germany.
	   The Russian Trading System closed down 1.1 percent, a far cry
from the wild swings caused by panic-selling late last month. The
ruble was unchanged at 6.18 to the dollar.
	   ``The stocks were too cheap to sell, and people too scared to
buy,'' said Eric Kraus, chief strategist at Regent European
Securities.
	   Although the markets have stabilized and the Russian government
insists no formal aid request has been made, traders still expect a
bailout either from Yeltsin's German trip or the meeting of Group
of Seven deputy finance ministers in Paris on Tuesday.
	   ``Without aid, the situation might get out of control,'' said
Mikhail Yemelyanov, a trader with Inkom Capital. ``Money from the
West might stimulate growth on the market, but that will also
depend on the timing and the size of the aid.''
	   Russia's financial crisis began two weeks ago week with a steep
drop in the stock market that many feared could lead to a run on
the ruble _ followed by price rises and possible social unrest.
	   The new government of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko responded
by tripling a key interest rate to keep investors in the market,
spending hundreds of millions to prop up the ruble and selling dlrs
1.25 million worth of bonds.
	   The government also announced a new crackdown on tax cheats to
bring in more revenue and enlisted the help of the country's
leading businessmen to draft longer-term solutions.
	   As part of Russia's desperate attempt to reduce its budget
deficit, the government announced Monday it will lay off 231,100
employees, or 3.6 percent of its workforce, the Interfax news
agency reported. The layoffs should save 5.86 billion rubles (dlrs
953 million), Interfax said.
	   And, in an attempt to spur economic growth, the government will
reduce rail transport rates for coal, iron ore, oil and fuel oil by
25 percent, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Russia's economic
growth has been hampered by rapidly rising rail transport costs.

Tories balk at bluebloods losing voting powers in Lords
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With confrontation looming over plans to strip
aristocrats of voting rights in the upper House of Lords, the Labor
Party government said Monday it will if necessary force through a
bill to carry out its campaign promise.
	   ``Quite frankly, the idea of the (Conservative Party) opposition
wheeling out their army of hereditary peers to try to block the
government's fulfillment of a manifesto commitment would itself be
a constitutional outrage,'' said Lord Richard, a lawyer who is the
Labor leader in the Lords.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair pledged in the platform on which Labor
swept to power 13 months ago to remove the right of dukes,
marquises and peers with hereditary titles to vote.
	   Negotiations have run into trouble with Lord Cranborne, scion of
an ancient family and heir to the 6th Marquis of Salisbury leading
opposition from Conservative Party peers.
	   The Conservatives are threatening not to cooperate in reforming
the Lords because Labor has failed to produce so far an alternative
long-term plans for the upper chamber of Parliament.
	   Initially Labor plans to put forward a bill, probably toward the
end of the year, to reduce the chamber of about 1,200 peers _
largely hereditary _ to some 500 commoners, many career
politicians, who have been given titles for life.
	   The Lords' powers are restricted to delaying for about six
months legislation passed by the elected House of Commons. But the
Lords, where the Conservatives have a built-in majority, could
frustrate the government by clause-by-clause challenges to the
bill.
	   Richard addressed a conference at the House of Lords organized
by London's Daily Telegraph, a pro-conservative daily.
	   A Gallup poll commissioned by the newspaper indicated that
two-thirds of people want the Lords abolished or reformed, with 35
percent wanting no change. The poll of 1,011 adults had a 3 percent
margin of error either way.
	   Labor, which has a huge majority in the Commons, denied charges
by critics that it plans to flood the Lords with appointed
supporters.
	   Cranborne said Tories will fight the plan until Labor produces
an alternative ``at least as independent'' as the hereditary Lords
- and accused Prime Minister Tony Blair of not wanting an
independent upper chamber.
	   ``He hates being held accountable to Parliament. He hates the
threat to his unfettered power that the existence of an independent
second chamber represents,'' said Cranborne.
	   ``He needs to unite his House of Commons troops against an enemy
which looks sort of formidable but which they feel is morally
indefensible,'' he said.

	   TUMPAT, Fri. - The National Unity and Social Development
Ministry has solved 502 cases of domestic violence since the
Domestic Violence Act was introduced in June 1996.
	   Its Minister Datin Paduka Zaleha Ismail said they were part of
852 cases reported to the Welfare Department, especially by
housewives.
	   She said this after launching the formation of Tumpat's Women
Affairs (Hawa) counselling committee at the District Council office
today.
	   Also present were State Unity Department director Abdul Ghani
Awang Hamat and Tumpat Umno division chief Datuk Kamaruddin Jaafar.
Zaleha attributed the rise in reported cases to the awareness among
women of their rights provided by the Act.
	   ``With the counselling services provided to the victim of
domestic violence, the response we received was overwhelming.
	   ``They do not hesitate or feel shy about reporting the violence
that they have been through,'' she said.
	   She added that some of the victims admitted that their lives
become more secure after receiving the counselling.
	   ``So, I urge those facing such problems or involved in quarrels
with their spouses which led to threats to their safety, to forward
their cases to the department.
	   ``We can apply for temporary protection from the court for them
if they feel their lives are in danger,'' she added.
	   Zaleha said the department had 29 centres to provide shelter for
the victims of domestic violence.
	   ``The centres will become safe places for them before any
decisions are made,'' she added.

	   The much-awaited Grand Centennial Ball - set to be the year's
most prominent social event - will cap celebrations marking a
Republic's 100 years of existence.
	   A festival of music, dance, and fashion will be the year's
fitting finale to the Centennial celebration of Philippine
Independence. Organized by Index Events and presented by the
National Centennial and Visitors Corporation (PCVC), the Philippine
Centennial Ball - to he held at the World Trade Center on June 13 -
will be graced by His Excellency President Fidel V. Ramos, and is
expected to draw over 5,000 guests.
	   For the occasion, the spacious World Trade Center will be
transformed into an elegant ballroom setting where Filipiniana-clad
guests will pay tribute to the country's 100 years of Independence.
Ballroom dancing, to be opened by Mr. Ramos' Presidential Waltz,
will commence after a formal dinner.
	   Musical performances will be provided by the Manila Philharmonic
Orchestra, Moonstrucks, and Family Birth Control Band. A program
will feature a dance showcase from the national champions of the
Asian Dance Sport Competition and socialite/dance school directress
Becky Garcia.
	   Ten Centennial Gowns will be showcased by members of the Fashion
Designers' Group (FDG), representing 10 decades of fashion design
trends, each highlighting the beauty and splendor of Filipino
fashion as well as the talent and ingenuity of local designers. The
designers will present the evolution of Philippine fashion from
1898 to 1998.
	   The FDG has assigned members with different decades in the
Republic's 100 years of existence: Danilo Franco (1898-1908), Bubum
Melgar (1909-1918), Cesar Gaupo (1919-1928), Gregg Centeno
(1929-1938), Lulu Tan Gan (1939-1948), Loretto Popioco (1949-1958),
Efren Ocampo (1959-1968), Rei Bancil (1969-1978), Mike de la Rosa
(1979-1988), and Rina Go Thorp (1989-1998). All designers did
research on historical fashion trends to come up with creations
displaying the fabulous styles of the Islands.
	   ``The Centennial Gowns,'' proceeds of which are intended help
raise funds for the Intramuros restoration project, will be
exhibited at the National Museum after the ball. A preview of the
gowns, featuring the designers, their stylists, and the models
(dubbed as ``The Centennial Ladies'') will be held at the Coconut
Palace.
	   Special events will also be incorporated into the ball.
	   There will be an auction featuring a showcase of prized
collections and valued memorabilia rich in cultural heritage like
masterpieces and contemporary artworks of Filipino artists to be
presided by art collector Joel Cruz. The Connoisseur's Lounge will
offer exquisite cigars, vintage wines, and spirits in a refined
setting. The Gallery will hold a formal portrait photography
exhibit, adorned with lavish period backdrops, dramatic lighting
effects, and framing treatments for guests' Centennial mementos of
the gala affair. - JTNones [Inquiries regarding the affair may be

Bosnian Croat party carved in two
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The Croat member of Bosnia's joint
presidency backed away from an agreement to maintain a united
political front in Bosnia, and said Monday he would persist in
forming a new party.
	   In an open letter to Croatia's president, Kresimir Zubak said he
was fed up with hard liners bent on concentrating power away from
Bosnia's capital and effectively ostracizing Croats in a small
southwestern pocket of the country.
	   Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who has acted as a patron to
Bosnian Croats since Yugoslavia's break up in 1991, tried to iron
out rifts within the Croat Democratic Union, hosting a meeting of
its leading members Friday in Zagreb.
	   Although Zubak appeared to have backed down over the weekend
from his plan to create a new party, his letter indicated he had
changed his mind.
	   ``I've come to the conclusion that the differences within the
political leadership of the party are unbridgeable,'' the Croatian
state-run HINA quoted Zubak as saying.
	   ``The reduction of fundamental Croat interests to only certain
specific regions in Bosnia is political suicide,'' Zubak wrote,
appealing for Tudjman's backing.
	   A moderate politician, Zubak pledged to respect the 1995 Dayton
peace plan, which envisages a united country and unimpeded return
of refugees of all ethnic groups _ something hard-line Croat
nationalists in Tudjman's party oppose.
	   Zubak also is dissatisfied with party leaders, who he said are
corrupt and have amassed wealth while in office.
	   Other prominent Croat politicians, including several ministers,
are likely to follow Zubak and join the new party.
	   The move comes only three months before general elections in
Bosnia and is expected to weaken the Croatian Democratic Union,
which has grown increasingly hard line in recent months.
	   International officials last week said Zubak's party would be
allowed to run in September elections.
	   A similar split in the Bosnian Serb leadership last year marked
one of the biggest breakthroughs in Bosnia since the 1995 end of
the war. Western powers used that chance to support Serb moderates
and sideline the old hard-line leadership.

	   PENANG, Fri. - Universiti Sains Malaysia, with the help of an
Indian computer scientist, aims to produce a parallel compiler
software system in two years.
	   Indian professor Dr R.K. Subramaniam heads the three-man USM
team to research and produce the software. He said the parallel
processor system would be a major asset for the growth of the
Multimedia Super Corridor.
	   ``The parallel software will distribute the workload of a single
processor, which is used now in all the sequential programme-based
computers, to various processors.
	   ``This will accelerate the execution of the workload by the
computers and produce computerised outputs faster and better,''
Subramaniam told a Press conference here today.
	   Also present was Professor Dr Zaharin Yusoff, dean of USM's
School of Computer Sciences.
	   The software project is financed by a RM200,000 Federal grant.
	   Subramaniam has so far spent three years on the project.
	   With the parallel processor software, Zaharin said USM would be
the first local university to produce a system with general
applications to all systems, programmes and computers.
	   ``Under the sequential software system, a processor in a
computer can only do one thing. But the parallel system will
distribute workload of a single processor to more processors in a
computer.
	   ``This will accelerate and multiply a computer's work in a far
quicker time,'' he said.
	   Zaharin meanwhile said USM had over the past four years produced
680 computer graduates skilled in the parallel software system.
	   This year 150 more will graduate to be followed by another 300.
	   Zaharin said USM now aimed to produce post-graduate experts with
masters degree in parallel computer system to meet the demand of
local computer experts for the MSC.

	   Q: I read that Jimmy Smits is leaving NYPD Blue. Is that really
true? - P.J.
	   A: It seems likely. Smits, 42, who was brought in to replace
David Caruso when he decided to opt for what turned out to be an
unsuccessful movie career, is getting restless and is looking at
other possibilities, such as cable movie and features. No doubt ABC
would like to keep Smits, and at this writing, the two sides are
still talking.
	   Q: I recently saw the young actress Natalie Portman in Everyone
Says I Love You, and I thought she was wonderful. Will she be in
anything else? - G.N.
	   A: The 16-year-old, who made quite an impression with her first
film role in The Professional (1994), has been onstage in New York
starring in The Diary of Anne Frank, so hasn't been available the
last few months for movie roles.
	   But that should change next month when Portman begins filming
Anywhere But Here, the adaptation of Mona Simpson's 1992 novel,
with Susan Sarandon, starring as a mother and daughter who relocate
from Michigan to Beverly Hills and undergo culture shock. Wayne
Wang (The Joy Luck Club) has signed on as the director.
	   Portman will also be seen next May as the young queen who is the
mother of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia in the first of three
Star Wars prequels.
	   She's also set to continue the role in the two follow-up films.
	   Q: I think Antonio Sabato Jr. is the handsomest. Is he involved
with anyone? And where is he from? - E.H.
	   A: The 26-year-old heartthrob is from Rome, where his father,
Antonio Sr., was a famous actor whose career suffered when he moved
the family to the United States. (Father and son recently
co-starred, however, in the HBO movie High Voltage).
	   At this writing, Antonio Jr. isn't involved with anyone. The
light of his life seems to be his three-year-old son, Jack, his
child with former girlfriend, actress Virginia Madsen.
	   Q: I was a big fan of last year's Lilith Fair concert. Will
there be another one? - P.L.
	   A: Indeed; the tour grossed more than $16 million last year, so
this year there will be a sequel. It kicks off June 19 in Portland,
Ore., and ends Aug. 31 in Vancouver, British Columbia, after
hitting cities such as New York, Detroit, Houston, Seattle, and San
Francisco.
	   And this year it will be even bigger, spotlighting local artists
in various cities and up-and-comers, in addition to the core group
of Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, Sheryl Crow, Erykah Badu,
Indigo Girls, and Shawn Colvin.
	   In the meantime, a two-CD set from last year's performances has
just been released.
	   Q: I thought Larry Hagman looked very good in the movie Primary
Colors.
	   Wasn't he sick just awhile ago? - G.S.
	   A: The 66-year-old actor, who recently re-created his most
famous role, J.R. Ewing, on a Dallas TV reunion movie, was very
sick three years ago, but he's fine now. He received a liver
transplant after years of heavy drinking produced cirrhosis of the
liver and then cancer. He's one of the lucky survivors, and he
truly appreciates that fact.

	   PLANTING annual flowers for colour is fast becoming popular. It
is not that difficult if you follow certain basic requirements in
soil preparation.
	   Most of the annuals planted here are from the summer-flowering
varieties, including marigolds, zinnias, asters, salvias,
sunflowers, cosmos, vincas, impatiens, phlox celosias, verbenas,
portulacas, calliopsis, coreopsis and balsams. Of course, there are
a lot more varieties available that are suitable for our tropical
gardens.
	   As mentioned earlier, all that's needed is a bit of effort to
dig the ground well and prepare the beds accordingly.
	   One variety I would like very much to recommend is petunia, both
for pot culture and for open beds.
	   While petunias need good sunshine, a little shelter from the hot
afternoon sun is preferred.
	   Petunias have bright colours and stunning colour combinations
especially those new varieties that are available in packets.
	   There are many types available nowadays, including those
imported seeds from Australia which have been available here for
many years now.
	   Petunias come speckled, striped or solid, and they let you adorn
your garden with a multitude of colours.
	   Most Petunia varieties nowadays combine interesting petal
designs and shapes with stunning colours. The blooms are still
typically trumpet- shaped, which may be short or long.
	   Blooms are wide and loose and these often dominate the smaller
leaves.
	   The petunia is a sun-loving plant. Its name is derived from
petun which is the Brazilian name for ``tobacco''.
	   As a matter of fact, the petunia is closely related to the
tobacco plant. It belongs to the family solanaceae to which popular
plants like tomato, brinjals and tobacco also belong.
	   Petunias are at their best during the hottest days of summer.
Our climate is thus very suitable for petunias. They bloom quickly
from seeds and grow well in a variety of soils.
	   The bedding petunias can be tall - some can grow up to 30cm in
height - while others can be rather dwarfish.
	   To a certain extent, petunias are rather hardy. The exhibition
types, especially, can withstand dry conditions. The double and
single exhibition varieties are good for pot culture.
	   To grow petunias, the soil should be well-tilled for good
drainage and aeration. It should be enriched with well-rotted
organic manure, in the absence of which you can safely rely on a
good soil conditioner upgraded with a compost or any organic
manure.
	   A good dressing of lime (ground magnesium limestone) is
necessary to ensure the soil is not too acid. A suitable pH reading
would be between six and 6.5 as for most other annual flowering
plants.
	   The use of organics in the soil will tend to decrease the pH
level. This build-up in acidity has to be rectified to a more
agreeable level, that is, pH 5.5 to 6.5.
	   Seeds should first be sown in seed boxes or seed pans.
	   When large enough, they are transplanted into polybags and
nurtured until they are at least 8-10cm height.
	   Then, they are transplanted into the open bed or into larger
pots. This should save you a lot of problems in the field.
	   Cultivation When planting, space the plants 20-25cm apart
depending on varieties.
	   After planting, always mulch the beds to ensure the soil is
protected from the hot afternoon sun.
	   Mulching also benefits the plants/beds in the following ways:
Conserves soil moisture, keeps the moisture in; Maintains an even
soil temperature; Suppresses weeds, thus reducing competition for
nutrients and water; Any organic mulch like peat will decompose and
in time adds to the nutrient level of the soil.
	   Petunias in mixed beds or borders make wonderful companions for
most strong hued flowers, particularly annuals in single strong
colours.
	   Petunias mix well and will complement marigolds and deep red
salvias.

Rain washes out play at Queen's Club
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rain washed out most of the play Monday at
Queen's, the prestigious grass-court tournament which serves as a
tuneup for Wimbledon.
	   Defending champion Mark Philippoussis of Australia managed to
split just four games with Spain's Jordi Burillo before play was
halted.
	   Only four other matches got underway, and none were completed.
	   Cedric Pioline, a semifinalist at the French Open last week and
runner-up at Wimbledon last year, was forced to withdraw with a
stomach ailment. The sixth-seeded Frenchman was replaced in the
draw by American Brian McPhie.
	   Never stepping on court was 11th-seeded Todd Martin, who was to
play Switzerland's Ivo Heuberger. Goran Ivanisevic, seeded No. 10,
never started his match against David Wheaton.
	   Ivanisevic was the losing finalist last year and will be seeking
to end a loss of form that saw him surrender in the first round of
the French Open and slide out of the top 20.
	   Also anxious to get the feel of grass under his feet is top
seeded Pete Sampras, who after an early exit at the French Open is
determined to raise his game after a mediocre season.
	   The four-time Wimbledon champion, who lost in the quarterfinals
here last year to Jonas Bjorkman, got a first-round bye and will
face qualifier Alejandro Hernandez of Mexico or Wayne Black of
Zimbabwe in the second round.
	   Second-seeded Greg Rusedski of Britain will play Jerome Golmard
of France or Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen. U.S. Open champion Pat
Rafter is seeded No. 3 and Bjorkman is No. 4.

	   Roel Hoang Manipon
	   Lost in Space (New Line, PG-13) directed by Stephen Hopkins
written by Akiva Goldsmith starring by Gary Oldman, William Hurt,
Matt LeBlanc, Mimi Rogers, Heather Graham, Lacey Chabert, Jack
Johnson
	   Lost in Space ran on TV from 1965-68. It was cheesy, they say, a
pioneer of the papier-mache set, the miniature saucers that didn't
look like anything except miniature saucers, and foil costumes.
	   Now they have turned it into a big movie marking William Hurt's
comeback and the no-nonsense effects of the '90s. Akiva Goldsmith
-- who wrote the last two Batman installments which turned out to
be more flash than flavor -- wrote the script. Surprisingly, this
one is different; it is riveting, touching, and wholly
entertaining.
	   The movie is set in 2058 and people are able to live in all that
is inhabitable in the universe. It will only take a few more years
for earth to be able to sustain human life. Dr. John Robinson
(William Hurt), in this sense, has been working on the Jupiter 1
project. This mission will take the Robinson family to Alpha Prime,
another planet deemed inhabitable, to colonize it. Dr. Robinson is
so involved with the project that he neglects to give the necessary
attention to his own family. He is not able attend his son Will's
(Jack Johnson) science fair, and Penny (Lacey Chabert) is being
rebellious, unwilling to leave all her earthly attachments.
	   Off they go, however, their grudges and sentiments against each
other still unresolved. But they are all intellectually compatible
and show their mettle at a time of distress. The wife (Mimi Rogers)
is a biochemist, eldest daughter Judy (Heather Graham) is also a
scientist, Will is a genius, and Penny is competently
technology-literate. Their cooperation is exciting to see. But they
have to put up with their emotional baggages during the flight
though these become both intense and dispensable when they get lost
in space.
	   Piloting Jupiter 1 is Maj. Don West (Matt Le Blanc of TV's
Friends), who considers himself the best fighter pilot and gripes
about this current job of piloting a family to who is, in his
words, going into ``an intergalactic picnic.'' Trouble is
personified by Dr. Smith (Gary Oldman). Involved with a seditious
gang, he re-programs the robot to destroy the Robinsons and the
ship, but gets trapped in it on flight. The Robinsons manage to
abort the robot's mission but the incident drives them off-course.
By using the hyperdrive to escape being scorched by the sun, they
eventually end up lost, not just in space but in time.
	   They realize that they have ended up in the future when they
discover the ship Proteus, abandoned and infested with menacing
space spiders, which is purported to have searched and rescued
Jupiter 1. They next crash in a desolate planet and need a
radioactive material to boost the ship into space again. The
material, however, is located in a time bubble. Robinson and Maj.
West venture into it, thus, entering another time frame of the
future where they discover a tragic fate that will befall the
Robinson family. After a lot of trouble, the Jupiter 1 people
escape the planet before it blows up, the family problems are
resolved, and the movie ends with anticipation of their next
thrilling adventure.
	   Lost in Space is an adventure story that truly entertains. Matt
LeBlanc is a plus, boyishly egotistic but lovable. The romance
between him and Judy Robinson is an obligatory addition to complete
the entertainment. I must mention that the ending is quite jolting
with techno music and flashy credits, but it is a good additional
blast.

	   DADAH addicts are believed to be behind the theft of RM95,000
worth of aluminium covers from antique lampposts erected by Kuala
Lumpur City Hall in preparation for the Commonwealth Games.
	   City Hall Press Officer Rozielawatie Rahmat said the thefts
began soon after the lampposts, costing RM450 each, were erected at
the beginning of the year. ``We have found that the lamp covers are
a favourite target of thieves as the covers or domes are made of
pure aluminium which fetches a good price in the market,'' she
said.
	   She said City Hall had lost about 200 covers up to last month.
``The number of covers lost is on the rise every month,'' she
added.
	   Asked what City Hall had done to prevent such thefts,
Rozielawatie said contractors had been appointed to inspect the
lampposts between 8pm and 12am daily.
	   However, this does not seem to have deterred the culprits.
	   ``They still continue stealing the covers. We believe this is
the work of dadah addicts trying to make a quick buck and that they
do it in the wee hours of the morning.''
	   She said police reports had been lodged over the thefts. City
Hall enforcement officers have also detained two suspects believed
to be behind the thefts at Jalan Sultan Ismail.
	   ``We are also in the midst of tracing buyers of the aluminium
covers,''
	   she said.
	   She added that City Hall enforcement officers would be directed
to make their rounds after 12am to curb such thefts. The antique
lampposts have been erected along Jalan Sultan Idmail, Jalan Syed
Putra, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Raja Laut and Jalan Raja
Abdullah.

	   Outgoing Finance Secretary Salvador Enriquez said yesterday the
incoming administration's plan to set up a guarantee fund for small
farmers would not work.
	   Enriquez said there had been a low compliance to the agri-agra
law, which required banks to allocate 25% of their total loanable
funds to agriculture and agrarian sector.
	   ``It's more for a show than for do,'' said Enriquez.
	   He said farmers were having a hard time complying with the
requirements set by commercial banks.
	   In a meeting Friday with President-elect Joseph Estrada, the
Bankers Association of the Philippines proposed the setting up of a
guarantee fund that would extend credit to small farmers.
	   The group noted that while there were various guarantee funds
for various sectors, there was no legitimate guarantee fund
catering solely to small farmers.
	   For Enriquez, however, the best solution to help small farmers
was not to put up another guarantee fund but for government to free
the prices of agricultural products.
	   ``Through this, they will make agriculture a business and not as
a subsistence occupation,'' he said.

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ African and U.N. leaders on
Monday condemned Ethiopia and Eritrea for escalating deadly border
clashes, as Ethiopia's foreign minister unleashed a war of words
against Eritrea.
	   Several leaders attending an Organization of African Unity
summit in the Burkina Faso capital despaired that the 35-year-old
organization was unable to end strife on the continent.
	   Addressing the opening ceremony, OAU Secretary General Salim A.
Salim expressed shock at airstrikes traded by Ethiopia and Eritrea
in the Horn of Africa.
	   Ethiopian warplanes bombed an Eritrean military airport in the
capital, Asmara, for what it called incursions into Ethiopian
territory. Eritreans hit an Ethiopian town, killing at least 40
people.
	   ``Despite all efforts to contain and defuse the dispute, the
crisis has dramatically escalated in the course of the last few
days,'' Salim said. ``Everything should be done to secure an
immediate cessation of hostilities.''
	   U.N. assistant secretary-general Louise Frechette also deplored
the conflict, saying both Ethiopia and Eritrea had delayed making
serious efforts to end the conflict.
	   ``The U.N. will continue to work closely with both countries to
end this serious crisis,'' Frechette said.
	   Nelson Mandela, attending his last continental summit as South
African president, urged the OAU to devise new ways of solving
African conflagrations, saying old methods risked failure.
	   The summit, billed as a forum for peace, focused instead on
averting a potential war.
	   ``We must seriously address the question of what we need to do
to ensure that the continent truly and collectively takes charge of
its security and stability,'' the 79-year-old Mandela said in a
statement.
	   The OAU's outgoing and incoming chairmen also offered pleas for
peace.
	   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, who gave up the one-year OAU
chairmanship, said the two ``brotherly'' northeastern African
countries had turned nationalist pride into violence causing
``losses of human life and destruction of property.''
	   In his first speech as OAU chairman, Burkina Faso President
Blaise Campaore deplored the ``saber-rattling'' and ``fratricidal
conflict'' between the two nations.
	   On the sidelines of the summit, Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin launched a diplomatic assault on Eritrea, demanding
that Eritrean troops be withdrawn from the disputed border zone.
	   ``The first thing to be done is for Eritrea to withdraw its
troops and return to the status quo,'' Mesfin said. Eritrea is
``imposing war on Ethiopia by occupying certain territories.''
	   Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, who earlier accused Ethiopia
of declaring war, dispatched his foreign minister, Haile Woldensae,
to Burkina Faso. Ethiopia's Seyoum was representing Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi.
	   The OAU has had little influence on the conflict since border
clashes began May 6. But diplomats in Ouagadougou said delegates
plan to draft a resolution on the conflict after making
recommendations to their leaders.
	   OAU Assistant Secretary-General Pascal Gayama told journalists
that the organization would work closely with Rwandan and U.S.
mediators who have drafted a peace proposal.
	   In addition to African heads of state, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is also attending the summit.
	   There was speculation that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who
claimed Sunday to be brokering his own accord between the two
warring neighbors, might also show up at the summit for the first
time in more than a decade.

	   ``TO boldly go where no one has gone before.'' Quoting Captain
James T. Kirk to describe Asia's journey of self-discovery may seem
irrelevant, but in the case of the recent student conference in
Kuala Lumpur entitled ``Asia in Transition: Beyond the Miracle'',
it proved most apt - and then some! The quote, used by ISIS
chairman and CEO Tan Sri Dr Noordin Sopiee, hit home for some
delegates, among them Christine Susamma, 22.
	   An Indonesian Chinese university student, Susamma chose to
attend despite the fact that her family in Jakarta was in the thick
of the Indonesian riots just days before the conference started.
	   Angry mobs forced Susamma and her family out of their house,
where they were set upon. Susamma recalled that if it weren't for
the quick intervention of neighbours, her family would have been
killed.
	   ``The conference has given me hope,'' she said. ``Before I came
here, I had more or less decided to flee Indonesia. Now I know I
must return. The things I have learnt have given me a better
understanding of what I have to do to ensure those riots never
occur again.''
	   For Susamma and over 270 other delegates, the imperative is
clear. In the aftermath of the Indonesian riots, the current
economic slowdown and India and Pakistan's tit-for-tat nuclear
tests, the world is becoming an increasingly difficult place in
which to live.
	   The four-day conference at the Putra World Trade Centre was the
perfect opportunity for them to seek answers and let their hopes be
heard - the voice of the world's young adults, youths who are
leaders of the future.
	   Apart from Noordin, conference sessions were led by noted
speakers such as Deputy Primary Industries Minister Datuk
Hishamuddin Hussein, Malaysian AIDS Council president Datin Paduka
Marina Mahathir and New Straits Times associate editor Rose Ismail.
	   Kudos must go to the organising committee for a smooth and
well-handled conference. Consisting mainly of university students
and young professionals, the committee's professionalism resulted
in what was probably one of the best-organised conferences ever
held in Malaysia.
	   Delegates' questions, debates and discussions centred on the
concept of Asian values and their role in the development and -
currently - economic problems afflicting the region.
	   ``There is no such thing as Asian values,'' declared
Hishamuddin, pointing out that core ``Asian'' values have ``at one
time or another been an integral strength of European or American
society''.
	   Debunking the concept of Asian values, calling them as mythical
as the ``Asian miracle'', Hishamuddin called upon delegates to
seize upon recent regional events as a ``rare opportunity to
rethink the kind of economic development models to adopt for the
future''.
	   Citing the need for a balance in this future model, between
sustained economic growth and a strong measure of social justice,
Hishamuddin called this impending new Asian economic model ``Asian
realism.''
	   With intellectuals predicting an impending clash of
civilisations between East and West, Noordin spoke of this new
model and asked: ``Why not celebrate the differences between us,
and pick and choose the best from among each of our cultures and
civilisations, to create a `feast of civilisations'''?
	   Delegates were taken on a tour of the Multimedia Super Corridor,
to provide a glimpse of the future. Which, apart from the
technological aspect, is basically not very pleasant, as pointed
out by the panellists for the session on globalisation and its
social and environmental impact.
	   Speaking of the challenges faced by the individual within the
global village, Rose said: ``I think we forget, when all is said
and done, it comes right down to that one individual.''
	   Like Susamma, who made a request: ``Please dedicate your article
to all those who died during the riots.''
	   To whom, though, shall we impart the insights gained in the
cloistered atmosphere of the student conference?
	   That night, as delegates were deep in noble thoughts of boldly
going where no-one has gone before, came the answer: In the
darkness right outside the confines of the bright conference hall,
daredevils astride motorcycles, looking to be barely in their
twenties, were turning the roads around the PWTC into a makeshift
racetrack and tearing around at breakneck speed - right into a
massive traffic police operation! Offenders were promptly arrested,
handcuffed, and boldly taken by the police where none of the
delegates have been before: traffic police headquarters in Jalan
Bandar, where they were forced to squat in the parking lot, facing
the prospect of a hefty fine and jail sentence for reckless riding.
	   I notice their bowed heads, and the cowed silence of these
forgotten youths spoke more loudly than all that was uttered in the
well-lit conference rooms of the intellectual elite.
	   So much for boldly going where none has been before. So much for
getting together to discuss making the world a better place. Yes,
so much.

	   President-elect Joseph Estrada's economic team was taking a
second look at government's two-year ''precautionary arrangement''
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
	   Estrada told reporters over the weekend that a review of the
special arrangement with the IMF was underway to make it more
reflective of the current economic realities. The arrangement is
contained in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Program
(MEFP).
	   ``We are presently reviewing that (MEFP). And we are talking
with the right (government) authorities,'' Estrada said.
	   Estrada revealed that he and his designated Cabinet officials
were conferring with monetary and finance authorities as well as
with private bankers.
	   Government graduated from IMF tutelage in March but forged a
stand-by deal with the Fund involving an ''emergency fund'' of $1.4
billion.
	   Analysts who requested anonymity said adjusting MEFP to
realistic terms would help economic officials achieve targets
easily.
	   They noted that May inflation rate of 10.3% went beyond the 7.5%
to 8.5% range provided in the agreement.
	   The rate was the highest in the last two years. The last time
the country reached a double-digit inflation was in July 1996 at
10.4%.
	   Moreover, economic growth in general slowed down to 2.5% during
the first three months of the year from the end-December 5.5%.
	   Under the MEFP, a gross national product of 3% to 4% should be
attained by the close of the year as against the actual 5.7% GNP
for the entire 1997 which resulted from the severe depreciation of
the peso and the impact of high interest rates.
	   A review team commissioned by the Bretton Woods institution are
returning in August to conclude its assessment of the country's
performance.

	   EVERY Sunday when I pick up the New Sunday Times, the first
article I glance at is the Photo Finish section, for those cute
little creatures of the week. These little animals never fail to
amuse me.
	   One day, as I was driving along Jalan Masjid India in Kuala
Lumpur recently, something caught my eye. People were gathered to
watch other people's fortunes being read. The idea is to pay the
elderly chap some money, whereupon he will release a bird from a
cage, to pick a fortune card that supposedly tells your future.
	   I decided to try it. I paid this chap five ringgit and the bird
emerged to select a card. Going by the appearance of the bird, it
was starving to death! In my mind was the greatest plan ever ....
	   This old person interpreted my card, which stated that my dreams
would come true, specifically with regard to my SPM results. I
could expect a Grade One. I stood up just as he concluded reading
my so-called ``future''.
	   In the blink of an eye, I snatched up the cage and dashed away
as fast as I could! You know, just like Leo Di Caprio did before
boarding the Titanic? Mission accomplished! Today, those two birds
are free in my garden at home.
	   I am not attempting to be Ace Ventura or Captain Planet - it's
only that I hate watching animals suffer. The extinction of some
animals has made me realise how important they are to our lives. We
are today in the midst of the greatest mass extinction in human
history.
	   Although extinction is an ordinary part of the evolutionary
process, humans have drastically changed things. If extinction used
to take thousands of years, today it happens in decades.
	   In the next 40 or 50 years, various endangered species will
vanish from the wilds. These include the Siberian tiger, whales,
the giant panda, the African black rhino, Asia's black bear,
Africa's elephant, the polar bear, the list goes on.
	   Also on the hit list is our mascot for the Commonwealth games,
the orang-utan! Steps are being taken by non-profit organisations
like the World Wide Fund For Nature, Wildlife Conservation
International, non-governmental organisations and even local
authorities. They have launched conservation projects, campaigns
and public-awareness blitzes, and increased penalties for poaching.
The problem is these steps are not sufficient as they need your
co-operation in facing such overwhelming odds. Now, you may be
wondering - what can you do to protect these precious creatures?
	   Step One: When travelling to another state or country, watch out
for products made from scarce and endangered species. These include
medicines, ointments, ivory, carvings, figurines. Try to avoid
buying feathers from birds like the bald eagle, the bird of
paradise and others.
	   Parts of leopard, panther, tiger, ocelot, margay are no-nos.
Although such souvenirs may look attractive, they are more
beautiful if they are alive! Step Two: Preserve the environment and
prevent pollution. Basically, everyone knows pollution is
displeasing. The question is, why do we still pollute? Protection
of the environment can't be attained by authorities and
non-governmental organisations, as it requires commitment, concern
and interest to save the eco-system. All over the world, pollution,
deforestation and human encroachment has devastated many innocent
species and their habitat. We would be fortunate if polluters are
reported to authorities and sued! Many thousands of ringgit are
what you obtain for prosecuting them! Step Three: Plant more greens
at home. I'm not demanding that you plant an acacia or durian tree,
just several flower plants like roses, orchids or bougainvillaea.
For those with ample space, try planting a palm or a fruit tree. In
a few months, you can expect to encounter little creatures like
butterflies, grasshoppers, birds and others swarming around your
tree. Furthermore, these trees colour your garden and supply your
tummy with yummy fruit. Nowadays, with hydroponics, it's easier and
faster! I remember a documentary on doom called Faces Of Death
(Part 4, and banned in Malaysia). One segment depicted an East
Asian family boiling a puppy for soup. Step Four is to prevent this
from happening. Eating animals is one of the reasons for our
decreasing species. Not only dogs, but bear's paws, elephant meat,
squirrel meat, bats, pangolin, monkey's brains and even rats are
being devoured by humans - the so-called ``intelligent'' beings! I
believe if dinosaurs were alive, humans would eat them, too! Don't
they have some other food to eat? If you belong to this cannibal
category, do try changing your meals to something better and
kinder. These innocent creatures won't bring you luck, as this
practice adds to your sins and mortality rate.
	   Various endangered species are being hunted off the face of the
earth and poached out of existence. It's difficult to picture the
world without the beauty and strength of the tiger, the majesty of
the elephant, the ancient howl of the wolf and the equanimity of
the birds.
	   Failure to halt this destruction could threaten our own survival
as a species. If each of us can work together with NGOs and local
government to protect wildlife, we wouldn't need a Noah's Ark.
	   As Mahatma Gandhi wrote: ``The greatness of a nation and its
moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.''

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An alleged Bosnian Croat
paramilitary commander accused of allowing one of his troops to
repeatedly rape a Muslim woman went on trial Monday at the Yugoslav
war crimes tribunal.
	   Anto Furundzija, 28, has pleaded innocent to two war crimes
charges relating to the May 1993 rapes, allegedly committed while
he was interrogating the victim. He faces a maximum sentence of
life imprisonment if convicted.
	   His attorney, Luka Misetic, said the prosecution's case was
built on faulty recollections of the victim.
	   ``Her testimony will not convince you beyond a reasonable doubt
that Anto Furundzija is guilty as charged, and, make no mistake,
the prosecution's entire case is based on her testimony,'' Misetic
said. Her evidence ``is not credible, let alone convincing beyond
reasonable doubt.''
	   But prosecutor Michael Blaxill insisted testimony from five
witnesses would prove Furundzija's guilt.
	   ``The evidence will show that the accused conducted
interrogation and arranged a confrontation with another detainee
during which both were beaten and the female victim was again
subjected to further horrendous sexual abuse in the presence of her
interrogator,'' Blaxill told the three-judge panel.
	   Furundzija sat calmly in court throughout Monday's hearing.
	   Although rape has been considered a war crime in other cases
before the U.N. court, Furundzija's trial is the first to deal
specifically with sexual assault inflicted during an interrogation.
	   The alleged rapist, identified Monday by the names Cicko and
Bralo, has not been arrested. Furundzija was arrested in December
in the central Bosnian town of Vitez, near where his alleged
offenses were committed.
	   The victim, identified in court only as Witness A, was raped at
The Jokers' headquarters just outside Vitez, prosecutors claim.
	   The Jokers allegedly took part in a violent campaign by Bosnian
Croat forces to drive Muslims out of the central Bosnian Lasva
River Valley in 1993.
	   By failing to stop the rapes, Furundzija became a ``direct
perpetrator committing the crimes of torture and outrages upon
personal dignity,'' Blaxill said. Furundzija maintains he was not
present when the woman was raped.
	   The trial is the sixth to begin at the tribunal. Prosecutors
will only call five witnesses, including the alleged victim. A
Muslim community leader from Vitez testified Monday about events
leading up to the conflict.
	   Although Furundzija is a minor figure from the 3 1/2-year
Bosnian conflict, prosecutors at the U.N. court are keen to
establish case law involving sexual assaults as a war crime.
	   Set up in 1993, the war crimes tribunal has indicted 60 suspects
and has 27 in custody. Its most-wanted suspects, former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen.
Ratko Mladic, remain at large.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Yugoslavia's campaign against its ethnic
Albanian minority in Kosovo left it isolated Monday even by its
traditional supporters.
	   Foreign ministers from other Balkan nations joined forces at a
two-day regional meeting to press Yugoslavia to sign on to a
statement addressing the violence in the province, where Yugoslav
Serbs are fighting Albanian separatists.
	   They failed. Even Greece, a fellow Orthodox Christian nation and
once one of Yugoslavia's staunchest supporters in the West, was
unable to sway the Yugoslavs.
	   ``There is an ethical problem, a problem of civilization ... .
This concerns all people and not just the country where it is
occurring,'' said Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos,
referring to Yugoslavia's human rights record in Kosovo.
	   The meeting, held in a sultan's palace built shortly before the
collapse of the Ottoman empire, once again showed that solving a
Balkan regional problem can be an endeavour of Byzantine
proportions.
	   Problems with Yugoslavia over Kosovo bodes ill for the broad
Balkan initiative the meeting is designed to represent. The third
of its kind, the meeting aims at improving the economies of the
region and their infrastructures.
	   ``It is high time to overcome the difficulties which still
persist among ourselves and to develop appropriate tools to
transform into practice a common vision for our future,'' said
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
	   Foreign ministers from Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia,
Romania, Turkey, Yugoslavia and high-level officials from Bosnia
and Slovenia failed to issue a unanimous declaration that would
address Kosovo also.
	   Host Turkey is expected to issue a separate statement that will
include a condemnation of Yugoslavia.
	   ``If the tragedy in Bosnia is fixed in our memories with the
images of bombed villages, the massacred civilians and the biblical
exodus, I assure you that the same thing is happening in Kosovo,''
Albanian Foreign Minister Pascal Milo said.
	   More than 90 percent of the population in Kosovo is Albanian and
mostly Muslim. Western powers are against any change of borders in
the volatile Balkans, but want the Serbs to give Kosovo the
autonomy taken away by Serbia in 1989 as a way to suppress the
independence movement.

	   IT'S been a year since the Asian economic tiger was mauled by
the claws of a financial crisis. In its April/June installment,
Ethos, the ``journal for the International Malaysia Forum'', takes
an in depth look at the crisis.
	   Tan Soo Chuen analyses it while V.K. Tang examines the causes of
the crisis.
	   Race relations, a simmering topic that just about every
Malaysian is obsessed with, are also dealt with extensively in this
quarterly magazine.
	   Chen Tien Yue defines multiracialism and examines the Malaysian
case.
	   Next, we have three writers who speak frankly about belonging to
a different race in Malaysia's plural society.
	   Would a professor of economics be used as a yardstick to measure
coolness? Well, Khairy A. Jamaluddin takes a walk on the wild side
with ``cool'' academician Jomo K. Sundram, Universiti Malaya's
professor of economics - and is mesmerised by him.

	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ A landmark U.S. lawsuit aimed at
forcing an offshore Caribbean bank to surrender millions in drug
profits is unnerving a secretive banking industry that thrives on
lack of scrutiny and perceived inviolability.
	   The case dates to the 1980s, when two Massachusetts brothers ran
a large-scale marijuana business in New England. Once convicted,
they fingered their money launderer, who confessed and promised to
forfeit $7 million to the U.S. government.
	   The effort went awry when the man, John E. Fitzgerald of Boston,
died before handing over the money. Now the Justice Department
wants a Boston court to order the Antiguan bank where Fitzgerald
said he deposited the money to pay up.
	   The case against Swiss American Bank Ltd. and its non-offshore
sister Swiss American National Bank of Antigua Ltd. is now being
heard.
	   Local critics see the lawsuit as bullying of small island states
by Washington, which already had pressured its Caribbean neighbors
into allowing U.S. law enforcers to take their war on drugs into
their territory.
	   The Antiguan government, feeling both its sovereignty and its
prized offshore banking industry threatened, sent a diplomatic
protest urging the United States to withdraw the action.
	   Undaunted by the protest, Washington is looking for tougher
legislation to close ``loopholes related to foreign banking secrecy
laws,'' a U.S. State Department official said.
	   In addition to asset seizure and forfeiture laws, U.S. officials
want to use ``foreign-based crimes'' such as fraud against foreign
governments to justify U.S. money laundering prosecutions, the
official said.
	   For Caribbean offshore bankers, who contribute significantly to
the region's economy, it is an unwelcome assault at a time when
Britain is pressing them to release secret account information for
the drug fight.
	   That, they say, would destroy the industry by scaring away
legitimate clients.
	   ``We will not stand by and allow them to kill off our
business,'' said Neville Grant, managing director of the Cayman
Islands Monetary Authority, which controls about 500 banks and
companies, second only to Switzerland as an international banking
center.
	   Analysts estimate that up to 10 percent of the $5 trillion held
in offshore centers worldwide is laundered money.
	   Some governments voluntarily repatriate drug money to the United
States, which shares it with the cooperating government.
	   Antigua, which has been tarred with allegations of drug-related
corruption, shut down five offshore Russian banks last year under
U.S. pressure. But the government is supporting Swiss American
Bank's argument that the United States has no jurisdiction over an
Antiguan bank.
	   The $7 million was promised the U.S. government by Fitzgerald,
who pleaded guilty in 1993 to racketeering and money laundering.
	   However, Fitzgerald concealed the true ownership of the money a
little too well _ failing to prove his link to the string of shell
companies that held it.
	   Complicating matters, the bank now claims that one of its
managers, who was authorized by Fitzgerald to manage his account,
took $2 million and disappeared.
	   The remaining money was given to the Antiguan government in 1994
under a law about frozen accounts with no clear owner, the bank
said.
	   The United States says the bank had no right to touch
Fitzgerald's _ now the U.S. government's _ money. And Washington
has a big stick to wield: The offshore bankers depend on U.S. banks
to make investments, including treasury bonds.

	   There are two ways of reading Etiquette for Filipino Gay Men: as
gay (and the book is written expressly for them), or as non-gay. I
use the term non-gay for fear of stepping on toes. Should I say
normal or straight, I could be treading on the politically
incorrect. As author Jomar Fleras writes: ``Normal is relative and
standards differ from place to place, time to time. What is
'normal' is for a gay man to be sexually attracted to another man.
To deny that feeling is abnormal.''
	   Now it's my turn to feel disoriented. I thought all along that I
was ``normal''.
	   Maybe, I am only part of this ``continuum'' that allows
everybody to stand up and be counted. We all differ only in
degrees. At one end are the super ``straight'' men (and women), at
the other, the transsexuals and in between in various degrees of
orientation, the gays. As Gore Vidal wrote, ``there is no such
thing as a homosexual, no such things as a heterosexual. Everyone
has homosexual desires and impulses and responses.''
	   Fleras takes potshots at the homophobic -- those afflicted with
irrational fear of homosexuals? ``Heterosexuals guilty of
homophobia,'' he writes, ``are bigots who call themselves religious
but run around condemning us. That's not about religion. That's
about hate. Your relationship with God is a personal issue.'' The
gays are urged always to be on guard, to protest each and every act
of discrimination.
	   Are you homophobic? The book lists indicators. But go get a copy
and find out for yourself. A word of advice, though, before
plunking down some pesos for the Fleras opus: Be sure your feet are
on stable ground. You know who you are, what you are. You're
getting the book because you're curious. You want to know how the
third sex lives. If, however, reading Etiquette for Filipino Gay
Men makes you confused and wondering, where you have been all the
time, go see a psychiatrist.
	   There's no reason why heterosexuals may not enjoy reading
Etiquette and find it both entertaining and enlightening. At least,
you pick up some sward lingo about which you were always curious
but were afraid to ask.
	   Words and expressions homosexuals use among themselves and
create an exclusive circle where no other may tread unless he can
tell lip service from intrafemoris sex.
	   'Coming out', for instance. If you thought that coming out
refers to debutantes' balls, think again. Coming out, in the
homosexual sense, is letting the world know you are neither male
nor female. You're gay. ``It is a long painful process,'' writes
Fleras. ``It may take years from the time you had your first blow
job (oops!) to the time you ventured into gay bars to the time you
came completely out of the closet proclaiming to all and sundry,
I'm gay and I'm proud.''
	   On coming out, a few pieces of advice: Be sure that when you
come out to your family, your father has not recently suffered a
heart attack. You do not have to come out to your parents when it
means you will lose millions in inheritance. (Get the money first).
Come out to a good lawyer first before you come out to your boss
(just in case you will need to file discrimination charges).
	   It is nice to know: Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Marcelo
Mastroianni, Richard Burton, Davie Bowie are not gay but have
publicly acknowledged that they have had at least one homosexual
experience. Sort of like Clinton admitting he experimented on
marijuana when he was in college but gave it up after the first
try.
	   If the book does not tell one which fork to use and whether
bread should be broken with the fingers (ala Miss Manners), it
still carries very practical advice from which one can pick up a
trick or two. Trick here, by the way, is used in the American
Heritage Dictionary-sense of a special skill, a knack. Not the
homosexual meaning of ``a lover picked up while cruising.''
	   Cruising, if you're wondering, does not mean getting into the
presidential yacht Ang Pangulo and going around the Bay (although,
why not? The coming administration promises to be less uptight than
Cory's). Cruising as Fleras defines it is ``going out on a prowl,
looking for a guy to love for a night or for eternity.''
	   Item: Smiling will make you look prettier and more approachable.
Never scowl as it will reveal all of your wrinkles (and the
foundation might crack).
	   Item: If your partner hurts you, walk out.
	   Item: Never talk about politics or religion. In science,
opposite poles attract. But in politics and religion, opposite
poles kill each other.
	   Like heterosexuals, homosexuals come in various types. (Need one
also specify sizes? Homosexuals don't seem bothered about size. In
the chapter titled ``How long is long?'' Fleras makes clear, he is
not referring to ``long dongs,'' whatever they be, but to
``relationships''. Nor about Viagra, incidentally. Maybe for the
aging gays, says Fleras, but so far, he hasn't come upon Filipino
gays who have problems of, uhm, ``impotency''.
	   Still, it should be useful to be able to size them up. If there
is the ``pa-Min'' - the butch (military style cropped hair, jeans,
tight-fitting shirts), there is also the ``pa-Girl'', the
``proverbial woman trapped in a man's body. She takes birth control
pills for breast augmentation.'' The bisexual -- AC-DC -- goes for
both sexes but is really more gay than straight, has a wife or
girlfriend as a front. The MSM -- man who has sex with another man
-- is a young professional (doctor, engineer, lawyer, sales
executive, money market broker, advertising executive), wears
slacks and neckties, has barber's cut hair, goes to Giraffe and
Fashion Cafe. The transsexual or operada is self-explanatory. The
``parlorista'' are the hairdressers or manicurists but the word is
also a pejorative for the scandalous and uncouth gays. You can tell
the closet queen from his chunky gold jewelry.
	   Naturally, the book will have pointers on safe sex. Flera,
managing director of ReachOut, the Reproductive Health Foundation,
has been into AIDS prevention and awareness work. They once planned
to put up a condom cafe in Makati but Jejomar Binay refused to give
them a permit.
	   Whatever one's sexual orientation, safe sex, defined in Fleras'
book as ``any sexual activity where there is no possibility for
blood, semen or vaginal fluids to enter the bloodstream,'' may not
be ignored. Thus, considered safe are kissing, hugging, embracing,
masturbating, massaging each other, urolgania, frottage,
coprolalia, intrafemoris (there go those words. But, sorry, I do
not have all the space to go into what they mean), etcetera....
O..hum.
	   For homosexuals, there is, as yet, no legally acceptable
marriage bond that keeps a couple tied till death do them part. It
becomes more imperative for them to watch out for signs that tell
them, life is no fairy tale, it is seldom that couples live happily
ever after. One is reminded: letting go is very painful, even if
both partners realize it's not working. The first morning you wake
up alone can be devastating. But here's a cliche that often works:
time heals all wounds.

	   LAST week saw Raz and me tearing about in a tall building smack
in the middle of where they hold illegal motor races - and there is
a foreign palace being built. We were hired to help organise a week
of seminars pertaining to the film industry.
	   After being holed up in the seminar room for three days, we
pontenged for a quick breather outside the room and found a new
world had appeared in the empty rooms across us. Across the
function room, the world's youthful elite moved briskly around us
as they discussed Southeast Asia's relationship with the world,
nuclear tests in India and saving whales.
	   We plonked ourselves at the table outside our room to observe
the confidence and suggestion of arrogance with which they
swaggered about, as they mingled with counterparts from Ivy League
and Oxbridge schools.
	   Heavily-accented English was spoken - from the
grapes-in-the-mouth variety to the clipped diction used by the Ivy
Leaguers.
	   They were young, they looked good, Louis Vuitton bags were the
order of the day and they knew they were important; one day, they
knew, they would be part of their conglomerates and governments,
and perhaps rule their countries.
	   Raz and I noticed with great interest that most of the young
women scholars, who swooshed by us kutus, had big boobs. We
pondered about a correlation between their ample curves and their
intelligence and looked at each other. We deduced that was why we
hadn't attended their schools and ended up as writers and aspiring
filmmakers, instead of would-be politicians and policy-makers.
	   Their ``do'' was very well-attended by members of the Press,
recognised names in politics, Malaysian business and economics.
According to Raz, who had met these students when she was studying
in the UK, the sustageniuses and their causes/work are greatly
supported by our Government and the suits.
	   Cut to OUR humble abode for the past week. Azhar (a pseudonym)
was bargaining with the ladies in charge of ticketing. He was an
Arts student from ITM, and he truly wanted to attend one of our
seminars. It's just that he didn't have enough money, so could they
bring down the price a bit? He was saving up for Awards night. No
go.
	   Another bunch of bedraggled kids who had come all the way from
Bandar Utama lined up. When they found out the price of the
seminars, they squawked, ``Aiyoh, so mahal-lah! Miss, we are
students, where can pay so much one? We also want to go for the
other seminars!'' After much haggling, they had to pay the hefty
levies, and helped two of their friends who did not have enough
money to pay. I blinked.
	   I mentioned the incident to the powers-that-be and was told
that, hey, if their parents can afford to pay RM25,000 a year for
their tuition, they can jolly well cough up money to pay for the
seminars. Raz and I gaped - did they truly think all parents who
send their children to colleges and universities are millionaires?
Some of them have to mortgage their homes to pay for school! Some
of the kids are on grants and scholarships; does that make them any
richer? A young person from the OTHER SIDE turned up to inspect our
little exhibition. She carried herself well. She had the poise we
adults are still struggling to find, and she spoke well. I felt
like a hooligan in my shirt, jeans and boots. Azhar popped out of
the seminar room for a quick dash to the loo. He was in an old Tee,
worn jeans and very scuffed sandals.
	   I thought, how good to know that governments and corporations
are supporting the young and bright by sponsoring such events, and
their studies. It shows they are more than willing to invest and
help train these Einsteins and Madeleine Albrights for better
futures, theirs and their countries'. Yes, many of these kids came
from affluent backgrounds, but you can't blame them for being
privileged can you? They lead a blessed life. Parents supporting
them in all their endeavours, personalities encouraging them in
their pursuit of success.
	   And here we have a bunch of scarecrow kids who weren't bright
enough to receive prestigious scholarships to preppy universities.
Who are their parents, anyway? Just normal parents who want the
best for their kids, but they aren't intellectual and don't hold
high positions in society.
	   These kids pulak, have chosen a different path - filmmaking.
There is nothing wrong with that career, I happen to think anything
creative is nobler than anything else in the world - apart from
religion, of course.
	   But do you seriously think anyone would sponsor these kids'
ambitions? A play maybe, for the prestige; we Malaysians are big on
fame and prestige, and plays are pretty elitist in this country.
The kids may not rule our country one day, but they do deserve some
form of support! Raz and I perused the susta-geniuses' magazine. Ya
Allah, apa punya bahasa ni? You needed to wade through a dictionary
to understand what they were pontificating about! Wargh! They must
have eaten books and encyclopaedias when they were babies!
Scrutinised the contributor's column - aiyoma, these kids are not
normal-lah! They read law, biology, politics; you name it - some
high-falutin' subject! Read the stuff in the mag. This new breed of
intellectuals - they write very well, but are they in touch with
the grassroots? Do they truly understand what the rakyat needs and
demands? It's all very well to TALK and WRITE about it, but, baby,
if you go to a prep school and mingle with the right people, you
ain't never gonna be in touch with the real world.
	   It is very cle-vah to talk about the NEP, and it sounds
impressive when one debates politics, but to a kutu like me, it's
hollow.
	   The scenario reminded me of the years I spent in a boarding
school. One night as we slogged through prep (I daydreamed of
running away and setting the school on fire), my dorm-mate sighed,
``Adoi, kalau aku dapat 24 aggregate pun cukup. Sure tak dapat JPA
punya. Kesian mak bapak aku, depa sape; dah lah aku ni kes blur -
lingkup la.'' (If I get 24 aggregate, I'd be happy. I won't get
that JPA scholarship for sure. My poor parents, they'll be so
ashamed, who are they anyway. I'm not smart. I'll fail.) I believe
it's high time for the powers-that-be to look at underdogs in a
different light. These kids may not be on debating teams, may not
participate in some crazy scheme their schools concocted, but they
have fertile minds, which may not exist in the bright sparks.
	   Schools, teachers and educationists should stop berating the
kids' for so-called laziness and worthlessness. What makes them
think a kid who does not finish her homework and prefers to
daydream is worthless? How dare they look down on these youths, for
not scoring straight As or being school prefects! They must believe
in them. Teachers should stop thinking of how much more money they
can make at tuition. Do they know how it hurts inside and how it
screws up your mind when they constantly put down your
capabilities? I should know, okay, I was one of those kids destined
to fail.
	   Raz wondered out loud, ``Dins, imagine if we attended Yale or
Oxford, where do you think we would be now?''
	   Oh God, can you just imagine us? Raz an economist and me a
finance minister? We'd bleed the country dry with our shopping
sprees, arts festivals, saving the orangutan and propping up the
film industry! We packed our bags and left for home.
	   Kids, don't back down from a fight. You go out there and make a
movie.
	   When you do, that snotty geek from school will want to rub
shoulders with you and you'll have the privilege of using his
character as villain in your next movie. Ain't life sweet?

	   IMAGINE being cuddled up beside a crackling fireplace bundled
snugly in warm clothing, enjoying a hot cup of cocoa with the
family while a chilly wind roars outside your Scottish-built
bungalow; or reeling in a thrashing big fish out at sea, then
actually staying overnight with the fisherman and his family at
their island village.
	   If those vacations don't grab you, then how about checking into
a rustic jungle lodge in the primeval rainforest, followed by an
arduous camping trek to a native settlement deep inside the jungle?
	   Alternatively, if you are the sort of person who prefers your
creature comforts when on vacation, you could choose from several
scenic golf resorts, or even have a beach getaway with lots of
sand, sun and fun while remaining in comparative luxury.
	   And the most remarkable thing is that there are NO tiring
flights or tedious sea voyages involved! Every single one of the
vacations described above can be found within Selangor itself -
dramatically proving the point that Malaysia is one of the most
fascinating destinations around, even for the jaded domestic
tourist! A phone call to the Hulu Selangor district office will get
you a booking at the quaint Scottish-built resthouse at The Gap,
the forested mountain pass at the foot of Fraser's Hill, just an
hour's drive from Kuala Lumpur.
	   The western food here is evocative of a grandiose and bygone
era, while the rooms with their high ceilings seem to resemble
something out of the film Sense and Sensibility.
	   To add to the adventurous ambience, the lights go out a little
after midnight, ensuring that you get into bed for a deep, restful
sleep in the cool mountain climate, with jungle insects chirping a
quiet lullaby.
	   For an entirely different vacation experience, take the
air-conditioned KTM Komuter train to Port Klang. The train stops at
the jetty, where a representative of Riverview Fishing Tours will
meet you and help you board a motorboat to Pulau Ketam.
	   A rustic fishing village on the island comprises houses, streets
and other buildings built entirely on stilts! Apart from fishing
and birdwatching trips, you can visit the last traditional kelong
in the area, and stay overnight at a fisherman's home.
	   Needless to say, all meals are included in the package, and they
feature the freshest and most delicious seafood you can imagine.
Caribbean sites will face stiff competition! For the more
adventurous, the Jungle Lodge in Gombak is just a short distance
from the Orang Asli Centre. Situated at the 20km Jalan Gombak, the
centre nestles amidst lush forest and features an Orang Asli museum
and craft shop.
	   Apart from providing attractive accommodation in a jungle
setting, the Jungle Lodge management also organises barbecues,
jungle hikes and even a camping trek to a native village deep
inside the jungle.
	   Business executives and committee members looking for a quiet
hideaway for planning workshops or training programmes need not
check their passports or flight schedules any longer because there
is an idyllic new resort at Sepang, just off the KL-Seremban
Expressway at Salak Tinggi.
	   Commanding a panoramic view of the surrounding countryside, the
DePalma Resort is built on a steep hillside and provides
air-conditioned chalets and all the basic facilities for a good
retreat.
	   In the three days I spent there, I sighted no less than 25
different species of birds, including raptors, kingfishers and
woodpeckers. Serious birdwatchers and nature-lovers, however,
should head for Kuala Selangor, less than an hour away from Klang
or Kepong by road.
	   The Kuala Selangor Nature Park is well-known in international
birdwatching circles, with over 150 species recorded in the 240
hectares of coastal scrub, mangroves, wetlands and intertidal
mudflats.
	   Run by the Malaysian Nature Society, KSNP, as it is popularly
known, also organises nature camps and workshops for groups.
	   For those who insist on three-star comfort, the DePalma hotel is
a posh replica of KSNP, with birdwatching towers, air-conditioned
chalets, swimming pool, tennis courts, seminar rooms, restaurant
and conference facilities.
	   To reach this oasis, drive past the fire station and police
station at the older part of Kuala Selangor town.
	   The world-famous firefly colony at Kampung Kuantan and the Pasir
Penambang seafood village are equidistant from Kuala Selangor, in
opposite directions from the foot of historic Bukit Melawati.
	   If mangrove-fringed coastlines aren't your idea of a seaside,
check out the secluded beach at Bagan Lallang. Although quite
modest by east coast standards, it is clean and fairly serene,
fringed by typical Malaysian rural greenery.
	   The Hotel Seri Malaysia has 100 air-conditioned rooms, a
swimming pool, outdoor fitness station and reflexology walk,
barbecue area, restaurant and conference facilities.
	   Sea fishing and horseback riding along the beach are favourite
leisure activities here, while the more sedate visitor can go
birdwatching, walking or just take a refreshing rest in the
landscaped grounds of the hotel.
	   Veteran domestic tourists looking for a seaside holiday in
Selangor can head for the recently-renovated Hotel Sri Morib, a
classic feature in the area for decades.
	   The adjacent golf course is an additional draw to Morib,
although the dedicated golfer might prefer the luxurious golf
resorts such as Hyatt Saujana in Subang or the Pan Pacific
Glenmarie Resort in Shah Alam.
	   The latter is a firm favourite for a couple of busy doctors I
know, who check in with their children for a restful weekend when
the going gets tough and a long journey seems just too rough.
	   Like many hardworking Malaysians, they are discovering that
there are amazingly exotic and enjoyable holidays easily available
at attractive and affordable prices within our own country - even
in an unexpected place like surprisingly Selangor!

	   Rep. Joker Arroyo (Ind., Makati) has urged President-elect
Joseph Estrada to address the $45 billion debt problem by working
for the imposition of a cap on debt servicing and on government
borrowings.
	   In a statement, Arroyo also proposed the repeal of the Automatic
Appropriations Act contained in Presidential Decree 1177. PD 1177
mandates the allocation of at least 30% of the national budget for
debt servicing.
	   ``There is no law that limits what the government can barrow.
Without such a law, the government can adopt a sky-is-the-limit
borrowing attitude,'' he maintained.
	   The Makati lawmaker, a candidate for House Speakership, recalled
that the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos left the country with a P26
billion foreign debt which President Corazon Aquino inherited in
1986.
	   When Aquino's term ended in 1992, her successor President Fidel
V.Ramos inherited some $29 billion debt. The administration stands
to inherit $45 billion external obligations.
	   Congress in 1993 had attempted but failed to put a limit on
government borrowings. Attempts by progressive legislators to
repeal PD 1177 had also been unsuccessful.
	   Arroyo also slammed finance officials for being ``less than
candid'' about their reports on the country's debts.
	   ``When Estrada spoke only of foreign debt, finance officials
interspersed both the foreign and domestic debts,'' he said.
	   At the same time, Arroyo urged the Finance department and the
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to make public how government spent the
$45 billion or how much of the amount was guaranteed by the
national government.
	   Meanwhile, the Freedom from Debt Coalition (FDC) also asked
Estrada to closely monitor the debt-management procedures to be
implemented by his officials.
	   FDC President Ma. Theresa Diokno-Pascual, said the Ramos
administration's penchant of labeling the country's financial
obligation as ''manageable'' was over-simplistic as funds borrowed
from other sources were used to service debts.
	   ''These government officials would like us to ignore the
disturbing manner by which government pays these debts. The
incoming Estrada administration would be wise to seriously examine
and address this problem, because it (debt) has not gone away,
contrary to the officials claim,'' she added.
	   ''The only way government knows how to get out of the crisis is
to borrow some more. That is not an option, it is a necessity. So
the debt is manageable only for as long as government can continue
to borrow. That does not speak much of our economic independence as
a nation,'' she pointed out.
	   Diokno-Pascual said government allocated an average of $4.362
million a year for external debt service between 1992 and 1996.
	   ''This amount together with interest in domestic debt of over P1
trillion would have easily eaten up 60%-70% of tax revenues last
year,'' she stressed. FDC also appealed for the abolition of PD
1177.
	   ''It has been a grave injustice that Filipino taxpayers have
been carrying the burden of government's debt while the poor are
severely neglected through the lack of vital infrastructure and
social services,'' Diokno-Pascual argued.
	   ''The economy's dependence on foreign money has not diminished
over the years. In fact, the recent crisis only shows how much
bigger that dependence has grown,'' she pointed out.

Expanding labor conflict threatens air traffic in Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A union on Monday began ordering key
aviation workers to join a strike that already has crippled much of
Norway's surface transportation.
	   A more than three-week strike by about 10,000 transport workers
has hobbled bus routes, road transport and delayed mail in much of
the country. Meanwhile, the national Academics Union expanded a
separate strike to 8,500 workers, including some airport staff, on
Monday.
	   The Civil Aviation Administration closed the local air service
from the western town of Kristiansund Monday after air traffic
controllers, technicians and aviation administration employees
organized by the union walked out on strike.
	   Geir Ingebrethsen of the air administration said if the strike
hits technicians at the main Norwegian Aeronautical Information
System, or ANISE, in the city of Bergen it could disrupt air
traffic in much of the country.
	   The union has temporarily exempted technicians needed to keep
the traffic control system running. If they do strike, even a small
technical problem would stop the crucial system.
	   The Academics Union ordered a strike on May 28, after rejecting
pay raises averaging about six percent. The strike has so far hit
some schools, universities, hospitals and public administration.
Friday's escalation will effect airports and road works.
	   The transport workers rejected pay raises averaging about 10
percent, and walked out on May 14 in a conflict that mainly over
benefits.

Blatter is new head of FIFA, arrests made, pilots make free offer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new grafs 15 &AMP; 16 with possible bus strike, fan quote &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sepp Blatter won a contentious fight for the FIFA
presidency on Monday, while two other battles _ against terrorism
and a potentially disruptive airline strike _ wore on just two days
before the start of the World Cup.
	   And somewhere in between, more teams set up training camps
throughout the countryside in anticipation of their first-round
games. Oddly enough, the latest arrivals were the French, who had
escaped all the hype to work out in Finland for a few days.
	   ``The team is bubbling with impatience,'' coach Aime Jacquet
said as his squad settled in Clairfontaine, among the woods
southwest of Paris.
	   Blatter, FIFA's general secretary and choice of outgoing
president Joao Havelange, defeated European confederation chief
Lennart Johansson 111-80 in balloting among FIFA membership.
Blatter, from Switzerland, needed two-thirds of the votes for an
outright victory, but his Swedish opponent conceded before a second
ballot could be held.
	   ``I would like to thank all of you _ those who voted for me and
those who did not vote for me, because we are in a democracy. The
great thing to do is to unite the family,'' said Blatter, who then
praised Johansson as a ``gentleman'' and a ``friend.''
	   Both candidates had promised to make FIFA more open and
democratic, a contrast to the dictatorial style associated with
Havelange. Among their differences was the proposed location for
the 2006 World Cup: Blatter has all but promised the tournament to
Africa for the first time, while Johansson favored Germany.
	   ``The result is there, consequently he is the winner and we will
have to cooperate for the good of the game,'' Johansson said. ``But
we're not dropping our program. I'm loyal to the president, but I'm
not going to obey everything he says.''
	   The election ended a bitter, globe-trotting campaign that cost
more than a million dollars.
	   ``There may have been a few fouls, but we never tackled from
behind,'' Blatter said. ``Now we need to think of what is fair.''
	   Havelange, 82, who chose not to run for another four-year term
amid questions of corruption and growing criticism of his
administration, wiped away tears after the result was announced.
His 24-year tenure as FIFA president expires at the end of the
World Cup.
	   As the ceremonies continued inside the Equinox Hall, French
authorities were combing the country in their vigilant campaign
against terrorist threats to disrupt the World Cup. Nine more
suspects were arrested Monday, and police urged the public to watch
out for bombs.
	   The suspects were considered close to aides of Hassan Hattab, a
leader of the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria, who allegedly has
ordered an attack during the tournament.
	   ``We have to be vigilant, every citizen must be vigilant without
losing their cool,'' Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement
said. ``If you see something suspect, first get away, then call.''
	   Seven of the suspects were arrested in the Paris area, while two
other people were apprehended in the southern city of Carpentras
and the northern city of Roubaix, police said.
	   Trouble also was brewing on the ground with a strike call by
Bordeaux bus drivers for Thursday _ when droves of tourists are
likely to arrive for the soccer match between Italy and Chile.
	   ``They shouldn't be striking on this occasion,'' said Carlos
Bandolfo, 56, a visiting Brazilian soccer fan. ``It should be a
party.''
	   Meanwhile, there was a novel twist in the eight-day old strike
by Air France pilots. The SNPL, main pilots' union, made an
unexpected offer to work for free to fly foreign fans to the World
Cup games.
	   Air France said it would study the measure, but three smaller
pilot unions on Monday rejected the proposal, saying they would
advise members not to cooperate.
	   The walkout shows no sign of ending soon, and is certain to
disrupt the World Cup, which begins Wednesday when Brazil plays
Scotland and Norway faces Morocco.
	   The huge cache of political developments overshadowed the
supposed centerpiece of the tournament _ the players.
	   Belgium, in its fifth consecutive World Cup, began training at
Monthieux in the eastern part of France and wasted no time praising
its neighbor, the Netherlands. The two teams meet in the first
round Saturday.
	   ``I'm so impressed with the Dutch,'' coach Georges Leekens said.
``It's a machine that is far better than we are.''
	   Another injury to versatile defender and midfielder Thomas
Helmer provided a damper to Germany's first full day of practice in
Nice.
	   Helmer showed up lame after hurting his right thigh in Sunday's
workout. Also missing was wing back Christian Ziege, who is
battling a fever.
	   ``It's a real, real shame for Thomas,'' coach Berti Vogts said.
``He was being treated this morning and perhaps he can do some
light jogging this afternoon.''
	   South Korea worked out under a cloak of secrecy, revealing few
tactics in a two-hour session opened to the public. Coach Cha
Bum-kun, who would not let his players speak to the foreign media,
said his biggest concern was a knee injury suffered last week by
three-time World Cup veteran striker Hwang Sun-hong.
	   ``It is a very grave situation,'' Cha said. ``... He's out of
the first game against Mexico, but I hope that he might recover to
play later in the tournament.''

Ancient cathedral discovered in Kiev construction site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Workers repairing underground
communications cables in central Kiev stumbled upon the foundations
of an 11th century cathedral, archaeologists said Monday.
	   The church discovered last week may be one of two cathedrals
that archaeologists have been searching for in Kiev, a religious
and cultural center of the Slav people with more than 1,500 years
of history.
	   Archaeologists hailed the find but complained that city
authorities had nearly destroyed the remains by failing to notify
them in advance about their repair work.
	   ``There was a lack of technological coordination. The
authorities wanted to end the repairs as soon as possible and did
not take into account the archaeological character of the site,''
said Ivan Movchan of the Academy of Sciences' Archaeological
Institute.
	   ``It takes more time for an archaeologist to dig than for a
foreman,'' he complained.
	   Although proper procedures call for municipal authorities to
consult with archaeologists before starting major projects, they
failed to do so in this instance, said Gleb Ivakin, deputy director
of the archaeology institute's Kiev department.
	   But Yakiv Dihtyar, the Kiev city administration official in
charge of protecting historical monuments, suggested that
archaeologists should thank the city for locating the site.
	   ``Without our repairs, nobody would have discovered the ancient
foundation for another 10 to 15 years,'' he said.
	   The site is near Kiev's most famous church, the Cathedral St.
Sophia.

Korda and Krajicek advance at Gerry Weber Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ Top-seeded Petr Korda, still fighting a
flu, advanced into the second round of the Gerry Weber Open Monday
by struggling to a two-set victory over Germany's Kevin Goellner.
	   The Czech player, who dropped five kilos (13 pounds) while sick
at the French Open, beat Goellner 6-1, 7-6 (7-5) at the dlrs
875,000 grass court tuneup for Wimbledon.
	   ``I'm still very weak,'' said Korda, the Australian Open
champion. ``But I'm sure I'll get better and better with each
round.''
	   Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the no. 2 seed and defending champion, and
no. 3 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands both started slowly but
recovered to claim three-set victories.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon winner, ousted Vincent Spadea of
the United States, 5-7, 6-2, 6-2, while the Russian stopped Andrei
Medvedev of the Ukraine, 1-6, 7-5, 6-1.
	   The tournament has drawn five top 10 players including French
Open finalists Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja of Spain.
	   Korda, ranked third, again failed to claim the world No. 1
position at the French Open, then arrived early to practice his
grass game on the center court that replicates the one at
Wimbledon.
	   ``It's a perfect place to practice,'' Korda said.
	   Korda, ousted Goellner after the German argued a call in the tie
break, then netted an easy volley at match point.
	   The Czech player broke through at the event last year, showing
he had shaken off a two-year groin injury by reaching the event's
final. Afterwards, his ranking soared.
	   Sweden's Magnus Larsson also reached the second round by
sweeping Austria's Thomas Muster, 6-3, 6-2. A last-minute
replacement for Andre Agassi, Steve Campbell, also upset Germany's
Jens Knippschild, Germany, 1-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3.
	   Boris Becker said he will use his performance at the grass event
to gauge if he's ready to play Wimbledon, starting June 22.
	   ``On Friday, I will announce if I will play Wimbledon or not,''
said Becker, a three-time champion of the grand slam event.

	   The Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) will set aside
some P500 million in minimum capital infusion in line with its
proposed rehabilitation of the Cavite-based Unified Savings and
Loan Association Inc. (Uni-Save).
	   DBP said the fresh new capital will provide Uni-Save the
much-needed resources after it suffered from liquidity problems due
to increasing withdrawal of funds by depositors.
	   For the past few months, government has been supervising the
sale of Uni-Save so as not to disrupt the present stability of the
local banking system.
	   DBP, which has offered to help rehabilitate the thrift bank,
reportedly had initial talks with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
(BSP) and the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC) on the
financial assistance to Uni-Save.
	   Aside from the P500-million capital infusion, 20% of the total
loans, including the exposure to all affiliates which have not been
past due for more than 90 days with satisfactory security, will be
assumed by DBP.
	   DBP earlier planned to conduct a due diligence procedure on
Uni-Save to determine the extent of assistance that will have to be
provided to help rehabilitate the bank.
	   Because of its presence in various parts of the country, many
banks have expressed interest in buying out Uni-Save from its
present owners. Uni-Save has 32 branches strategically located in
Rizal, Nueva Ecija, Laguna, Batangas, Bulacan, Pangasinan, Isabela,
and Cavite.
	   Last year, it was among the top five savings and loans
associations in the Philippines but suffered from liquidity
problems after its real estate projects were severely affected by
the financial crisis.
	   As of the first quarter of the year, Uni-Save's operational cost
has reached P27.5 million.

	   LOVE and care is important when looking after the sick and
elderly. This is what the College of Nursing in Klang is strongly
stressing to its student nurses.
	   To instill the caring concept in them, the college organised a
one-day seminar for some 80 student nurses at its premises in Jalan
Istana, Klang on Wednesday.
	   Specialists in the field of gerontology presented a few papers
on the topic and stressed the need for love and care when caring
for the elderly and the sick when they are warded in hospitals.
	   The seminar was one of the activities held by the College of
Nursing in conjunction with the recent Nurses Day celebration.
	   Eighty-seven staff members and student nurses donated blood to
the Tengku Ampuan Rahimah's hospital blood bank recently.
	   For some of the student nurses, it was a new experience but they
took it in good spirit as they felt that such a contribution was
another way of showing that they cared for those in need.
	   Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital deputy director Dr N.K.S.
Sathiaseelan, who was present at the blood donation drive, said the
student nurses and staff of the college were sporting as they did
not hesitate when told that they was an appeal to donate blood to
the hospital blood bank.

	   Los Angeles -- The striking picture of contrast presented by
teenagers of at least two decades ago vis a vis their counterparts
of today -- more specifically, their own offspring -- is something
that has held the conversational spotlight in many close and
friendly gatherings.
	   A good number of parents have a great deal in common.
	   High on their list is: how they cope with their teenagers ,and
vice versa, without being considered ``weird'' by the latter.
	   The consensus is that specific periods have been accompanied by
experiences close to trauma and even parents who are specialists in
their respective fields, M.D.s and Ph.Ds, admit that their
professional and academic problems are nothing compared to
monumental tasks involved in coping with their teenagers.
	   (This parent-child relationship, as everyone has been quick to
describe, has all the earmarks of a gathering storm. Though they're
getting used to it, they that even the diplomacy and skills of a
Madeleine Albright would not suffice to handle such turbulent
relationships). The requisites of being parents of today's teens
include vigilant, unscheduled -- and if possible -- uninterrupted
incessant threshings-out of pros and cons of issues, all boiling
down, of course, to that oft-heard process called communication.
	   Naturally, yesteryears' teenagers would and could not help but
point out how fortunate these children of their are today: these
children are allowed to speak out as long as they do not raise
their voices. And if they do raise their voices, they claim it's
for emphasis and clarity (''I can't help it if I talk this way. .
.'').
	   How many among us can remember how we reacted to one-way
conversations (lectures would be a more appropriate description),
and how we weren't supposed to leave the lecture scene unless we
were dismissed by our parents?
	   Too, how many of us can recall how we ever made acquaintances
with the opposite sex without the surveillance that was considered
acceptable, and taken with resignation (not with resentment,
because that was part of being obedient)?
	   And how many were allowed by their elders to do as they pleased
because they had ``come of age''? Hardly any.
	   I could go on and on with more and more comparisons of the two
sets of teenagers; however, we would still return to one double
solution to the dilemma that has engulfed today's teenagers in the
US - communication, and more communication, when necessary.
	   I now pause to wonder if today's teenagers realize that their
parents really try hard (even harder than they can dream of), not
because they wish to impose their own value systems on their
children. Instead, they let them know that these very systems
worked for them.
	   For myself, I thank all those participants who unwittingly
contributed their insights and sentiments to this column. Their
opinions and openmindedness reflect both an encouragement and
caution to the parents who try to make a go of the situation here.
They demonstrate that it is possible, with patience, understanding,
and constancy, to arrive at a meaningful and rewarding relationship
with their children.
	   Yesteryears' teenagers will no longer worry about today's ones
when they make the latter realize that, after all, there isn't that
vast a difference between generations when everyone takes time to
seek and learn.

	   DESPITE the seemingly never-ending economic turmoil, KL Mutual
Unit Trusts, a member of the Public Bank Group, believes there is a
silver lining waiting to emerge from the dark clouds.
	   To prove this, KL Mutual organised its sixth annual awards nite
and dinner themed Cultural Extravaganza at a hotel in Sungai Besi,
Selangor recently.
	   The function was to reward its long serving staff, besides
saying thank you to all staff for contributing to the company's
success.
	   Long service award recipients for 15 years were Charanjeet Kaur,
Foong Kuan Mun and Wong Woon Cheng while those who had served for
10 years were Juraidah Jabar, Azmah Ismail and Yong Nyee Chin.
	   Among others awarded that night were S. Ramachandran Seevaratnam
(Top Personal Producer), T. Manogaran (Top Group Agency Manager),
Thniah Lily (Top Agency Manager), Zaridah Zainal Abidin (Top Agency
Supervisor) and Selvarani K. Thuraichamy (Top Agent).
	   As at other dinner functions, staff were to good food and ample
fun.
	   Entertainment was provided by Elaine Kang, after which lucky
draws were held.
	   All in all, the staff enjoyed themselves at the event.
	   KL Mutual chairman Mohamed Nizam Tun Abdul Razak, in a
statement, said the achievements that KL Mutual was enjoying was
made possible by the loyalty and dedication of staff who helped
make it happen by pulling together and persevering through hard
times.
	   He said KL Mutual reported a 29 per cent increase in sales and
20.1 per cent increase in profit last year, compared to the
previous year, despite the economic turbulence faced by Malaysians.
``Every single agent and staff of KL Mutual is responsible for this
achievement and tremendous success,''
	   he noted.
	   He added that Malaysians were now faced with tougher times and
the collective conscientious action of agents and employees would
set a good company apart from the rest.
	   ``This as an impetus to boost not only the morale of the
workforce but also the confidence of investors and public,'' he
said.
	   Meanwhile, chief executive officer Edmond Cheah said 1997 was a
good year for KL Mutual despite the economic turmoil that rocked
Asia in the latter part of the year.
	   ``KL Mutual emerged relatively well, by industry standards, a
good margin ahead of our nearest competitor,'' he said.
	   ``It is precisely this excellent teamwork between agents and
staff that has made this company the leading private unit trust
manager in Malaysia.''
	   He, however, stressed that the success did not mean they should
celebrate too hastily.
	   ``The mounting macro problems, crystalised by the recent
financial fiasco, will not simply disappear though we are
encouraged to note that the Government is determined to restore
investor confidence by maintaining tight monetary and fiscal
policies.''
	   He urged the people involved to concentrate more on the
financial planning programme, which KL Mutual had developed,
essentially to support and assist the sales force of the trust
fund.

Lebed says premature to talk of meeting with Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former national security chief Alexander Lebed,
starting work as governor of a huge region of Siberia, said Monday
it was premature to talk of a meeting with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
	   Lebed said he plans to be in Moscow next month for a meeting of
the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament,
whose members include regional governors.
	   ``I do not preclude that some questions for the Russian
president will mature in a month,'' Lebed said, according to the
Interfax news agency. But he said no meeting has been arranged.
	   Lebed placed third in the 1996 presidential elections in which
Yeltsin was re-elected for a second term. Yeltsin appointed the
former general his national security adviser, but fired him months
later.
	   Lebed was sworn in Friday as governor of the Krasnoyarsk region,
a job seen as a springboard for another run at the presidency in
2000.

	   SEVENTY-seven children from Asrama Damai, Kuang, Selangor were
treated to a fun field day at Zoo Negara recently as they
participated in activities organised by the Arab-Malaysian Group.
	   The children, aged between five and 17, were put in groups of
not more than nine each.
	   They had lots of fun during the walkabout where the children
were asked questions about the animals and plants at the zoo.
	   Each group was awarded points for correct answers and were later
given prizes.
	   Before the activities, Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank Berhad
general manager Fauziah Yacob said despite the busy schedule, the
organisation had not forgotten to lend a helping hand to the less
fortunate.
	   ``We have always helped the elderly, orphaned, abused children
and the handicapped. We normally give donations in cash, or
sometimes in kind,''
	   she said.
	   Fauziah said the group had chosen Asrama Damai after a community
service project in December.
	   She said during the project, they got to know the home and
decided to help the orphaned children there.
	   Also on the itinerary that day was a three-legged race and
``wrapping the mummy'' contest.
	   The children were enthusiastic and happy to participate in the
competition and win prizes.
	   After the games, the children enjoyed lunch at the Kentucky
Fried Chicken outlet.

	   The Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) should devise measures to
counteract the adversarial outcomes of the recent cargohandling
rate hike, otherwise, there would be ``no more foreign shipcalls at
the Port of Manila.''
	   The point was raised by a key official of one of the major
shipping in reaction to the government port agency's jacking up of
cargohandling fees for containerized shipments by 15% and
conventional shipments by 10% at the Port of Manila.
	   ``This has made the country the second costliest port of
destination in Asia. We are now next to Hongkong,'' the official
told The Business Daily over the weekend.
	   The official, who agreed to be quoted on condition of anonymity,
noted such development should not put a laurel over the head of
port authorities since this threatens the competitiveness of the
local shipping enterprise.
	   ``We cannot be happy with this because we are severely affected.
It is very possible large ocean liners which contribute to
government's collections will skip the Port of Manila. They can
look for other cheaper yet more upgraded ports in the region,'' he
said.
	   The PPA made the adjustment a couple of weeks ago after
cargohandlers Asian Terminals Inc. (ATI) and International
Container Terminal Services Inc.
	   (ICTSI) applied for a 20% increase.
	   The increase was on top of the 20% cargohandling rate hike port
authorities granted ATI and ICTSI in January.
	   ATI, exclusive contractor of the Manila South Harbor and ICTSI,
sole operator of the Manila International Container Terminal,
pointed out in their petition that the severe depreciation in the
value of the peso has made them cash-strapped.
	   They noted expansion projects were deferred after steep falls in
the peso-dollar exchange rate pulled up the cost of their foreign
currency-denominated loans.
	   Moreover, return on investments has been minimal to cushion the
financial imbalance.
	   However, the official lamented that the PPA had to involve other
port users in the economic problems of the two terminal operators.
	   ``The two cargohandlers made the loans themselves and this does
not concern us. I think this is unfair. Now, we have to pass this
additional cost to our clients which is unfavorable to the
public,'' he said.
	   ``The increase exacerbates the problematic financial conditions
of the liners. This is not to mention that importation, which makes
up the bulk of the port industry, continues to be sluggish,'' he
said.
	   The official said a ``co-loading trend'' among shipping lines is
expected to result from the cargohandling rate hike. ``For example,
Sea-Land's cargoes will be loaded in APL's ship since operational
costs are now too high.''

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his
ministers came to Germany, a key trading partner, on Monday seeking
counsel on their financial turmoil at home.
	   Yeltsin's talks with his good friend, Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
were expected to focus on international credit for Russia following
a collapse in Russia's financial markets last month.
	   ``New problems keep emerging which need to be solved quickly and
energetically, and the both of us, Helmut and I, will solve these
problems this way,'' Yeltsin said upon arrival at the Bonn-Cologne
military airport.
	   Germany also will try to persuade Moscow to support the European
Union's decision Monday to punish Serbia for attacks on its
separatist region of Kosovo.
	   But asked before dinner with German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel whether Russia would get behind the EU's economic sanctions,
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said: ``No, I don't think
so.''
	   The EU decided in Luxembourg to ban investment in Serbia and
freeze its assets abroad, measures Russia has been reluctant to
endorse.
	   Yeltsin also was to discuss a broad list of political,
financial, trade and social issues in the talks, which were planned
before the current fiscal crisis. He and Kohl were to hold a news
conference Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin has stressed his country's need for foreign credit while
it negotiates loans from the International Monetary Fund.
	   But he and his top officials insist Russia has rebounded from
last month's financial market collapse following a drop in oil
prices. They say vigorous tax collection will ensure stability and
that they have made no ``official'' request for direct foreign aid.
	   ``The begging time for Russia is over,'' Yeltsin told Der
Spiegel, a German newsmagazine, in this week's issue. ``We're not
asking now like we once did: Give, whoever can give.''
	   Despite the disclaimers, investors have said they believe a
bailout package may be unveiled after Yeltsin departs Germany,
possibly when deputy finance ministers from the Group of Eight
economic powers meet in Paris on Tuesday.
	   German government spokesman Otto Hauser said Germany would
provide no direct aid to Russia, but would not rule out taking part
in a rescue package put together by the IMF.
	   Since the fall of communism, Germany has become Russia's most
important trade partner outside the former Soviet Union, and a key
source of aid and credit. Germany has been key to negotiating
Russia's acquiescence to the eastward expansion of the NATO
military alliance.
	   Yeltsin also is scheduled to meet Tuesday morning with
opposition chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder.
	   Yeltsin returns to Moscow on Tuesday.

Meles threatens more military action if Eritrea does not withdraw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia will be forced to resort
again to military action against Eritrea if its neighbor to the
north does not withdraw from Ethiopian territory, Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi said Monday.
	   ``What we have is a pattern of prevarication, a pattern of
trying to draw out the process and consolidate the hold on our
territory,'' Meles told The Associated Press. ``If that's the case,
and it appears to be the case, then the opportunities for resolving
this problem peacefully could be fastly disappearing.''
	   The 43-year-old former rebel leader would not be drawn on who
struck first on June 5. But he said Ethiopian aircraft only hit a
military airport in the Eritrean capital, Asmara, while Eritrean
fighters bombed a school in Mekele in northeastern Ethiopia,
killing at least 40 people, among them children. Ethiopian fighters
	   ``I can't think of any rational reason for their invasion. It's
true we have our disagreements on border issues, we have
disagreements on trade and related issues, but you don't go
invading a country whenever you have a dispute on trade issues,''
he said. ``We have more civilized mechanisms on resolving such
problems.''
	   Eritrea claims its forces are within internationally recognized
borders drawn by colonizer Italy in the late 19th century.
	   Meles said Ethiopia was trying to work towards a peaceful
solution to the border conflict but was preparing for war at the
same time.
	   ``So clearly the ball is in the Eritrean court, and whatever
international efforts at peacemaking there might be, I think they
are perhaps rightly directed at Eritrea,'' he said.
	   In Asmara, Yemane Gebremeskel, spokesman for President Isaias
Afwerki, said Ethiopia had effectively declared war on its small
neighbor and was using the threat of renewed air strikes to
blockade air and seaports.
	   ``They have refused to negotiate,'' Yemane said. ``These are not
the actions of a nation that wants peace.''
	   The United States and Rwanda have put forth a four-point peace
proposal that includes a recommendation that Eritrea withdraw to
positions it occupied prior to May 6 when border skirmishes first
broke out. Ethiopia has accepted the plan, but Eritrea says it
needs more work.
	   The war of words between the two countries continued Monday as
the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry accused Eritrea of expelling 3,000
Ethiopian citizens and jailing another 500. An estimated 100,000
Ethiopians live in Eritrea, which was part of Ethiopia from 1962
until 1993.
	   Although several African leaders deplored the Horn of Africa
conflict at an Organization of African Unity summit in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, Monday, Meles said there were no plans for a meeting
there between the Ethiopian and Eritrean foreign ministers there.
	   He said Eritrean troops had ``practically destroyed'' the town
of Zala Ambessa, 600 kilometers (372 miles) north of Addis Ababa,
and that its 15,000 residents had fled.
	   ``It is not a surprise that the Ethiopian people are very angry
at a government they considered to be a close friend would stab us
in the back at a time when we are exclusively focussed on the war
against poverty and ignorance,'' Meles said.
	   With per capita annual incomes of less than dlrs 300 a year,
Ethiopia and Eritrea are among the world's poorest countries.
	   Asked whether the Ethiopians would try to retake the town, Meles
said: ``We would not necessarily be limited to the scope of action
on Zala Anbessa only. We have to address the whole invasion.''

	   THE Malacca Big Bikers' Association organised its first joint
cavalcade with the Pan Pacific Legacy Hotel from the hotel premises
in Jalan Hang Tuah, Malacca, to the Mahkota Parade complex in Jalan
Merdeka.
	   Eighteen bikers clad in macho leather jackets and riding garb
escorted hotel staff who rode in two Eleksuria, the electric car
manufactured by Perusahaan Otomobil Elektrik Malaysia.
	   Passing through Jonker's Street and the historical complex in
Jalan Laksamana, the entourage of Harley Davidsons, Hondas and
Yamaha Viragos were cheered as they went along these routes.
	   Association secretary Norman Abdul Rahman said apart from
holding programmes to boost fellowship among bikers, MBBA organised
trips to old folk's homes.
	   ``We also hope to participate more actively in tourism-related
events to attract tourists to our State,'' he said.
	   Hotel marketing communications manager Sherry Lee Ming Ming said
the cavalcade was to promote Malacca for the Commonwealth Games.

	   The Chase Manhattan Corp. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.
recently announced that they have reached a definitive agreement
under which Chase will acquire global custody business of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. Terms of the purchase, which is expected to be
completed later this year, were not disclosed.
	   The two Morgan Stanley entries involved in the agreement --
Morgan Stanley Trust Co. and Morgan Stanley Bank Luxembourg, S.A.
-- have more than $400 billion of assets under custody. The clients
and staff joining Chase will be integrated gradually into Chase
Global Investor Services, the bank's worldwide securities trust and
custody Business.
	   James Zeigon, head of Chase Global Services, which includes
Global Investor Services, said, ''This acquisition will strengthen
Chase's leading position in the custody business and further
underscores the bank's commitment to remaining the pre-eminent
provider in the industry.'' The addition of the Morgan Stanley
business will increase Chase Global Investor Services' assets under
trust and custody to more than $4.7 trillion, of which
approximately $1.8 billion will represent cross-border assets.

	   SILENCE accompanied the superb performance of the Selangor
Philharmonic Chamber Choir and the Selangor Philharmonic Choir at
the Kuala Lumpur City Hall auditorium in Jalan Raja Laut during the
Konsert Klasik Variasari recently.
	   Eyes intent, the audience seemed to be holding their breath
every time the choir rendered the songs. At the end of each song,
loud applause would follow.
	   The singers were accompanied by the Orkestra Kuala Lumpur under
the guest conductor Eprodito G. Bartolome.
	   The two choirs sang old favourites including Malam Ku Bermimpi,
Getaran Jiwa, Matona - Lovely Maiden, Dahil Sa Iyo, O La, O Che
Buon Eco and evergreens including In the Still of the Night,
Somewhere Out There and the Sound of Music.
	   The Selangor Philharmonic Chamber Choir was formed in 1996 and
consisted of 20 members. The choir specialised in singing acapella,
ranging from folk songs to modern arrangements.
	   The choir appeared for the first time in December 1996 when it
presented a selection of Christmas carols.
	   The Selangor Philharmonic Choir was set up in 1993 and appeared
for the first time in the Philharmonic Society's presentation of
Cavalleria Rusticana.

	   The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT) recently bared
details of its plan to implement a network computing infrastructure
in the Philippines called Phil-Net, first announced yesterday by
Antonio O. Cojuangco, PLDT President and CEO.
	   Robert R. Romulo, PLDT chair, said that Phil-Net which has been
renamed ''Network Pilipinas'' to avoid confusion with the
government-owned project PHNET has already begun implementation of
Phase I of the project. Phase I involves the linking up of
educational and technical institutions to a central repository
where they can share data without going through the internet.
	   Two schools are set to join the network -- Far Eastern
University (FEU) and the University of Asia and the Pacific (UA&AMP;P).
Lease line provisioning is already in place and the schools have
already chosen a place in their campuses to house the network
computers. Each school will have 40 Network Computers attached to a
Central Network Computer server located at PLDT.
	   This common network will be attached to Infocom to provide
internet connection including e-mail services and web development.
	   Phil-Net, signed exactly a year ago between Oracle Corp. Chair
and CEO Larry Ellison and PLDT Chair Roberto Romulo and witnessed
by President Fidel Ramos, aims to provide low-cost distribution
channel for information products and services and to provide a
backbone for members to share information with each other
independent of the Internet.

	   TO promote domestic tourism, a local travel, leisure and
lifestyle magazine, known as Mystical Malaysia was relaunched on
June 2 by the Minister of Culture, Arts and Tourism Datuk
Sabbaruddin Chik at the Kuala Lumpur Tower.
	   The magazine was first published in January 1988 and had won
awards for the ``Best Travel Publication'' and ``Best Travel
Writer'' at the Tourist Development Corporation's annual Tourism
Gold Awards.
	   The publication was stopped for five years and now, BN and
Associates has resumed its operations and the publishers are quite
confident of repeating the previous successes.
	   BN and Associates publisher Bernice Narayanan said the time was
right again to promote domestic tourism.
	   She said 10 years ago, the company focused on promoting the
country to the foreign tourists to visit Malaysia.
	   ``Now, times have changed. We have to promote domestic tourism
to our own people. We have so many beautiful places with rich
culture and heritage to visit,'' she said.
	   ``It is sad that most Malaysians do not visit the wonderful
places we have but prefer to travel overseas which they find
glamorous.''
	   She said the timing was right, in the light of the current
economic situation, to bolster the viability of locals travelling
within Malaysia as well as attracting foreign tourists to visit
Malaysia.
	   This time, however, the magazine will feature a revamped cover
design, giving it a more vibrant and modern appeal which will be
reflected in its use of design, layout and typeface.
	   Mystical Malaysia will feature articles on local cuisines,
nightspots, sports and recreation.
	   Bernice said the purpose was to make the magazine more
attractive to a wider audience.

	   THE chef at the Kuala Lumpur Parkroyal Hotel has come up with
something different for patrons at the Parkroyal Court located at
the lower lobby.
	   Roger Leong, who has been preparing traditional Chinese dishes,
particularly Cantonese cuisine, for the past five years, has
created a new combination of garlic-filled dishes.
	   ``The creations are a combination of Western and Asean
ingredients. The prawn, lobster and crab shells are brewed first
before making the chowder soup,'' Leong explained.
	   ``These preparations are more suited for the Chinese as they are
used to taste of garlic and its aroma.''
	   Leong said others who liked garlic might also want to give the
dishes a try.
	   Among his creations are superior seafood chowder with toasted
garlic flakes, deep fried soft-shell crab with garlic pepper,
pomfret with minced garlic and shark's fin in crab gravy, steamed
crab with rice wine and smashed garlic, among others.
	   Reasonably priced, these dishes will be prepared steaming hot
for guests.
	   Parkroyal Court food and beverage manager Jason Pope said the
idea of using excess garlic in these preparations was to give
guests a different taste.
	   ``Guests need not order every dish that comes in the
garlic-list. They can order other dishes available in the outlet,''
Pope said.
	   ``This way, those who are not able to stand the taste of excess
garlic or its smell have other dishes to choose from.''
	   He said soft-shell crabs were imported from Vietnam, deep fried
with minced garlic and shredded conpoy, which made the shell even
softer and more edible.
	   ``Garlic is extensively used in Asia and more so in Malaysia.
Though Malaysians use garlic almost every day in their daily
cookings, these special creations with `extra' garlic really gives
a different and unique taste,'' he added.

EU calls for review of loans to Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union recommended Monday a delay
of loans to Pakistan through international financial institutions
such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
	   EU foreign ministers issued the same recommendation against
India on May 25 for carrying out five nuclear tests. Pakistan
responded with six tests of its own, and tension between the two
neighbors is high.
	   After recommending a delay of loans to India, EU countries
``will likewise review the advisability of (international financial
institution) lending to Pakistan,'' the ministers said in a
statement.
	   But the extent to which the loans are delayed for Pakistan
should be decided ``in light of the economic and financial
circumstances'' of the country, the statement said.
	   The ministers said the EU executive Commission should examine
whether Pakistan can still benefit from an EU system under which
selected developing countries enjoy certain privileges in trade
with the 15-nation bloc. A similar recommendation was issued
against India last month.
	   They reiterated their appeal to India and Pakistan to sign and
ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban treaty and to open talks
towards a peaceful settlement.
	   ``The European Union calls upon the leaders of both countries to
engage urgently in dialogue on regional stability issues, including
with China,'' they said.
	   They warned that the EU would take ``all necessary measures
should India and Pakistan not take early steps to accede to ...
international non-proliferation treaties and resume their bilateral
political dialogue.''
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars in the last 50 years,
two of them over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, now divided
between them.

	   PROJEK Lintasan Kota Sdn Bhd or Prolintas, the concessionaire
for the country's first elevated highway, will not build a
pedestrian bridge over Jalan Hulu Klang to facilitate Sekolah
Menengah Hulu Klang students to cross the road.
	   A Prolintas spokesman said the bridge was beyond the company's
jurisdiction.
	   Jalan Hulu Klang, which is now part of the Middle Ring Road II
project, is under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department.
	   The spokesman said the company would be building a bridge over
Sungai Ampang for vehicles and would keep the service road in front
of the Flamingo Hotel partly open for pedestrians, especially
students.
	   ``When the bridge over the river is ready, it can be used by
motorists to go to the school while students who walk or cycle to
the school can still use the service road as we will not close it
entirely,'' she said.
	   The plan to build the bridge, she said, had been included in the
original highway plan but until now it was still being deliberated
by the four authorities involved - Prolintas, Malaysia Highway
Authority, Ampang Jaya Municipal Council and the Drainage and
Irrigation Department.
	   Prolintas' response came following a query by Ampang Jaya
Municipal Council councillor Tai Beng Hoe during the council's full
board meeting last month.
	   Tai had asked the council to pursue the pedestrian bridge
construction matter with Prolintas as the project had not
materialised despite having had few discussions.
	   Tai had claimed Prolintas had totally closed the service road
and this had forced students to go through Kampung Berembang, cross
Sungai Ampang and take Lorong Awan 14 in Kampung Kuala Ampang
before reaching the MRRII.
	   ``We have not closed the service road entirely and we will not
do so even after the bridge over Sungai Ampang is completed,'' she
said, adding that safety of the students using the service road
would be taken care of.
	   ``We will also have workers to facilitate our machinery to go in
and out of the area and ensure the safety of the students when
plying the road,''
	   she said.
	   To date, she said, the elevated highway construction at the
service road site had not been carried out in full swing but the
piling work was nearing completion.
	   The 7.4 km stretch from Sultan Ismail to Ampang, which is the
first phase of the elevated highway project, will be completed in
the middle of next year.
	   The second phase will begin in 2013.

	   NCR Corp., one of the world's leading suppliers to the retail
financial services industry has signed a letter of intent to join
Visa International's Visa Smart initiative as part of NCR's
commitment to the fast-growing smart-card sector.
	   Visa Smart brings together NCR with other leading suppliers and
a comprehensive group of providers of chip-based products and
services to help Visa's member banks around the world launch smart
card programs quickly and cost-effectively.
	   The alliance with Visa, announced recently at the CardTech '98
show in Washington DC, further establishes NCR as a leading player
in the area of smart cards-chip-enabled bank cards that can store
electronic cash. The cards can be used to upload cash from a
variety of access points such as automated teller machines (ATMs)
and telephones. This electronic cash can then be used instead of
small change to buy goods and services ranging from food to
transport tickets and many other items.
	   NCR is already working with many banks around the world on their
smart-card solutions both by upgrading ATMs to take the new cares
and by integrating the transactions that flow from the cards into
banks' payments systems.
	   ``We're firm believers in the potential of smart cards and we're
proud to be part of the Visa Smart program,'' said Peta Matthews,
NCR's director of smart card programs. ``Over the next few years
we'll see many new smart-card applications that will both excite
consumers and offer new opportunities for banks.''
	   Visa is the largest consumer payment system worldwide with more
volume than all other major payment cards combined and has 21,000
member financial institutions. Visa has more than 70 smart card
programs in 30 countries and on the Internet, with 22 million Visa
chip cards, including eight million Visa Cash cards. Visa is
pioneering SET (Secure Electronic Transaction?) programs to enable
and advance Internet commerce.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Facts and figures about Nigeria:
	   ___
	   PEOPLE: 115 million, Africa's most populous nation, mainly
Hausa, Fulani, Yoruba, Ibo ethnic groups. English is official
language. About 50 percent are Muslim, 40 percent Christian, and 10
percent practice indigenous beliefs.
	   ___
	   LAND: 923,000 square miles (373,500 hectares) in West Africa,
twice the size of Sweden. Bordered by Atlantic Ocean, Benin,
Cameroon, Chad and Niger.
	   ___
	   ECONOMY: One of world's leading oil producers with an output of
2 million barrels a day. Oil sector provides 95 percent of foreign
exchange earnings and 80 percent of budget revenues. Tight control
of oil by military governments has discouraged investors and led to
high inflation and unemployment. Largely subsistence agricultural
sector has failed to keep up with rapid population growth. Per
capita income was about dlrs 1,300 in 1996.
	   ___
	   GOVERNMENT: Military government since 1983. In 1995, government
of Gen. Sani Abacha announced it would turn power to democratically
elected civilian authorities in 1998; In April, Abacha became only
nominee for president for August 1998 elections after the five
sanctioned parties were pressed to endorse him.
	   ___
	   HISTORY: Independence from Britain in 1960. Generals ousted
Nigeria's last civilian government in 1983. Abacha seized power in
1993 after canceling presidential elections and suspending the
constitution. Moshood Abiola, the businessman who won the aborted
vote, declared himself president in 1994 and was jailed.

Top U.S. officials defend `Operation Casablanca'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With UN-Drug Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The top U.S. drug policy official Monday
defended using U.S. undercover agents in a money-laundering sting
in Mexico but acknowledged ``there is room'' for other tactics in
the cross-border war on drugs.
	   Mexico has criticized the three-year ``Operation Casablanca'' as
a violation of its sovereignty. U.S. undercover agents appear to
have operated in Mexico without the government's approval of the
sting, which netted 160 indictments and the seizure of millions of
dollars and several tons of drugs.
	   Retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey defended the operation in a news
briefing with Attorney General Janet Reno during the U.N. General
Assembly special session on drugs.
	   Echoing many of the speakers Monday, McCaffrey said one country
cannot fight the drug problem alone.
	   ``We have to do this in partnership with our neighbors and with
absolute respect and deference for their own sovereign
institutions,'' said McCaffrey, director of the White House Office
of National Drug Control Policy.
	   He acknowledged, however, ``there is room here for us to look
through how we can even more effectively coordinate these
(operations) in the future.''
	   Reno pledged that the U.S.-Mexican effort to fight drugs was
still on course. ``In any investigation, there may be problems that
arise, but we always work through them,'' Reno said.
	   In his speech to the General Assembly earlier Monday, Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo referred indirectly to the operation,
which has prompted Mexican officials to call for the extradition of
the U.S. agents to face trial.
	   He called for a ``balanced strategy ... so that no one can
become the judge of others; and no one feels entitled to violate
other countries' laws for the sake of enforcing its own.''
	   U.S. officials have said they needed to keep the operation
secret to ensure the safety of American agents.

	   AS a stand-up comedienne, everything about Joanne Kam Poh Poh is
jolting when she's up on stage. For starters, the sight of her in
full costume, draped in an ``in-your-face'' attitude, will knock
anyone's socks off.
	   Then, there's the fact that she's big, brash, loud and
hilariously funny.
	   But like the rest of humanity, Kam is all these and much more, a
multi- dimensional character for the rather colourful times we live
in now.
	   While the rest of us can safely say that our first day at our
respective first jobs was unspectacular, she lays claim to slightly
more. Kam still remembers her first day at work clearly.
	   ``It was July 4, 1990,'' she gleefully recalls.
	   She had just joined the troupe of performers at Singapore's Haw
Par Villa, having been hired to entertain visitors there. And what
a riotous troupe it was with the likes of BiBi Kay Poh and Kumar in
it.
	   BiBi is now Kam's partner in crime on stage while Kumar is a
drag show personality from south of the border (Singapore), who
also happens to be famous up north in Penang in the club circuit.
	   ``I was a very naive Chinese girl from Johor with poodle hair,
black stockings, wearing a short skirt and pink chiffon blouse with
polka dots ... very the Ah Lian one,'' Kam recalls, grimacing at
the thought.
	   Ah Lian is, of course, the national term of ridicule describing
the village girl whose small town sensibilities make her the butt
of jokes in the city.
	   Born in Johor, she was living there at the time with her mum,
having just completed her Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia exams. At Haw
Par Villa, the Chinese theme park across the causeway, Kam
underwent training for three months before becoming a full-fledged
performer.
	   Kam remained there for two years and she acknowledges that the
place did a lot of good for her - the training, discipline and
exposure.
	   If on the first day she was scared and nervous about stepping
out onto the stage, today, the fear has subsided somewhat, although
she does admit that some butterflies still manage to break free and
create havoc in her stomach before that crucial first step, from
out of sight into the limelight.
	   But once she is on stage, ``Joanne the Showgirl'' takes over.
	   For those unfamiliar with Kam's performance, its content ranges
from fat jokes done in self-mockery and parody to sex organ jokes.
	   The words ``subtle'' and ``understated'' do not exist in her
vocabulary when onstage. And the audience that seeks her out,
revels in the grotesquery of her performances.
	   Needless to say, she was a hit when she was performing in KL's
former party central, the Boom Boom Room, for two years till 1995.
Since then, she has been performing on a freelance basis.
	   Kam, today, is an eight-year veteran of the local entertainment
business. As many would imagine, in person, off stage, Joanne is
much more subdued. She does not threaten people with her body or
bawdy jokes.
	   Instead, one will be confronted by a very animated person, with
a permanent smile plastered on her face and always bursting with
dramatics.
	   This is when her feet-firmly-on-the-ground side comes to the
fore.
	   ``I'm in transition now. I am now trying to groom a lot of
talent and would like to see more of my productions on stage,'' she
says.
	   She has always performed with a group of performers although
people usually think of her as being a solo artiste. Her troupe,
almost always comprising a trendy set of young dancers and an
assortment of talented transsexuals (more politely referred to as
divas in the club circuit), usually performs the opening number to
warm up the crowd for Kam and also takes to the stage when the
comedienne takes a breather or does a change of costume.
	   Since Kam and her dancers perform on a freelance basis nowadays,
correspondingly, she uses a lot of freelance dancers.
	   The entertainment circle in the country being small and mainly
concentrated in the capital, she says that it is easy to get in
touch with the dancers when a job comes their way.
	   There are 10 freelancers whom she uses regularly, but the number
varies depending on the nature of the show, the budget for it and
also the venue.
	   Like a business pro, she has memorised the good times when she
can capitalise on bookings.
	   ``There are peak and low seasons. The period from the end of the
year till the Chinese New Year - it's the time to try and cash in
on the demand for shows.
	   ``After Secretaries' Week in April, things will slow down. May,
June and July are the quiet months. August onwards, things start to
pick up again,''
	   she says, reading off a mental showbusiness chart.
	   During off-peak seasons, Joanne digs into her ``rainy day''
stash and travels a lot. Usually, it is to places like Bangkok,
Thailand and Australia where she has many friends.
	   She also goes to India but it's for a whole different reason,
one that very few people know about.
	   ``I go to India, to a place near Goa, for spiritual purposes...
to do some meditation. I'm into Tibetan Buddhism and have a teacher
in India, a Tibetan who was brought up in America.''
	   He is a guru, a friend and also a teacher to her.
	   ``I usually go up there to work out stress, take in the fresh
air, go mountain climbing and visit the holy places.
	   ``After working in this environment (the entertainment field),
there are so many things you have to deal with.''
	   Just as this sort of unwinding is spiritually and emotionally
important to her, so does her work on stage help audiences loosen
up in the evenings after a long, hard day at work.
	   Kam mines for material from her very self in order to do this.
She makes fun of her body. ``It is part of the itinerary. To get
people comfortable with me, I make fun of the obvious. Then, it is
easier for the rest of the jokes to follow,'' is her explanation. A
typical line during her show would be: ``Hey you... I saw you
staring at my watermelons! Yes, you in the green shirt with the big
smile on your face. Come up here!''
	   On her part, Kam is very fussy about her audience.
	   She strongly feels that clubgoers need to have the same
wavelength. Boom Boom Room, a trendy club, was an ideal place for
Kam. The trendiest of sets hung out there flanked by numerous
tourists who'd heard of the place and Kam's shows.
	   Kam currently wouldn't mind invitations to perform in clubs in
the capital.
	   ```I am open to the prospect of performing in a `permanent'
space in a club here. I would like to go back to the party scene in
KL but the venue will have to be appropriate,'' she says.
	   Seeing how the nightlife here badly needs a... err, life, having
her back in the circuit would definitely give KL's nightlife a
boost it desperately needs.
	   As a stand-up comedienne, Kam says that she still enjoys doing
it.
	   ``When I am up on stage, entertaining people, it gives me an
inner sense of achievement,'' she says.
	   Ladieeeess and gentleeeeemen, that's Joanne Kam for now.

	   Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor gets things done because she knows
what she is doing, and odds never seem to daunt her. Her crowning
achievement thus far is getting the majority of Bureau
International des Expositions (BIE) in Paris to vote for Quezon
City as site of the first Recognized World Expo in 2002. It was
pretty much mission impossible but the Philippines won over
Australia in an unprecedented second balloting.
	   Unknown to the public was the backbreaking preparation,
planning, and lobbying (country by country) over the past year that
went into the country's final bid. The QC Recognized Expo in 2002
will be the first ever, and in a developing country at that. It is
an international tribute to the Philippines. It elevates the
country to the big league of hosting world class expositions.
	   Launching Pad Evidently, the 2002 Expo in QC will provide the
Philippines an extraordinary launching pad to showcase its wares
and the capacity of its human resource to compete in the big
leagues. It will also establish a world class environment that will
compel Filipinos to thereafter perform accordingly.

	   THE Securities Commission yesterday revoked the licence of Omega
Securities Sdn Bhd following its failure to come up with a
restructuring exercise by April 30, 1998.
	   Omega Securities ceased trading on May 4 for failing to meet the
minimum liquid funds requirement and was subsequently issued a show
cause letter on the same day on why its stockbroking licence should
not be suspended or revoked.
	   The decision not to grant written consent was due to the deficit
of RM555.59 million which Omega Securities failed to address.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, on the directives of the SC,
had informed the stockbroking firm on April 15 to undertake a
restructuring exercise in the form of a merger or acquisition
within a two-week period.
	   However, Omega Securities failed to comply with the directive.
	   The SC said Hwang DBS Sdn Bhd has agreed to participate in the
reimbursement of Omega Securities clients by undertaking to pay
them a total sum of RM70 million.
	   It (the scheme) will involve clients closing their accounts with
Omega Securities and Hwang DBS reimbursing each client a
pre-determined and pre- approved value for the net amounts owing to
them.
	   All clients are entitled to the full amount of their claims if
it is below RM100,000.
	   For those with claims of RM100,000 and above, they will be
reimbursed for their first RM100,000 in full, while reimbursements
for the excess of the claim will be pro-rated in decreasing
percentages.
	   If there is any sum remaining at all from the reimbursement
scheme it will be deposited in the Compensation Fund.
	   The reimbursement scheme was structured by SC to mitigate
potential losses which stockbroking company clients may suffer as a
result of mismanagement and violations of rules, regulations and
securities laws.
	   The scheme involves a willing stockbroking firm deemed fit by
the SC to reimburse clients of a stockbroking company whose licence
has been revoked.
	   By undertaking to implement the scheme, the firm will be allowed

	   SECURITIES Clearing Automated Network Services Sdn Bhd has
instituted default proceedings against Halim Securities Sdn Bhd due
to its inability to meet its obligations as a Clearing Member.
	   In a statement yesterday, Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange said Halim
Securities' clearing and settlement privileges were revoked
effective 5pm on June 5.
	   KLSE's on-site team, in place at Halim Securities since the KLSE
took control, will together with other KLSE officials address
investors' concerns.
	   KLSE officials will be on hand to handle investors' enquiries on
June 8 from 9am to 5pm.
	   Meanwhile, clients of Halim Securities can continue to conduct
their normal CDS transactions while those who wish to trade can
transfer their shares to a CDS account with another stockbroking
company.
	   Representatives from KLSE's subsidiary, Malaysian Central
Depository Sdn Bhd, will be available to assist with the transfer
beginning Monday.
	   The KLSE will also waive the fee for ordinary transfers for
affected clients of Halim Securities.
	   ``Investors should note that shares held in CDS accounts are
fully protected as stockbroking companies act as authorised
depository agents of the principal which is MCD. Shares in the CDS
accounts are protected under the provisions of the Securities
Industry (Central Depositories) Act 1991.
	   ``All share transactions executed through the KLSE's automated
trading systems are protected by virtue of the rules of the
exchange requiring monies received by the stockbroking companies to
be paid into a trust account. Clients with margin accounts are
advised to refer to the terms of the Margin Facility Agreement
signed with Halim Securities.''
	   Where appropriate, an investor can make a claim from the KLSE's
compensation Fund against stockbroking companies.

	   LIKE most companies in times of an economic slowdown, Nylex
(Malaysia) Bhd is not spared the consequences and has seen its
profit margin eroding with the weakened ringgit for the first four
months of this year on the back of higher sales.
	   Furthermore, the rising bill for imported materials is only
partially recouped through modestly higher sales prices.
	   However, the company feels that prospects are promising,
especially for its engineering division as it banks on large orders
from overseas markets such as China, Hong Kong, and Australia.
	   Nylex has four main divisions; engineering, packaging, polymer
and building products.
	   The engineering division manufactures switchgears, and
electrical and electronic products.
	   Glass containers are produced by the packaging division and the
polymer unit produces films and coated fabrics, golf bags, sub-soil
drainage and rotomoulded products.
	   The building products unit manufactures glasswool insulation and
roofing products.
	   ``For the first four months of 1998, order bank and sales for
the group were higher than for the same period last year with good
performance achieved by all units in the engineering division,''
said Nylex chairman Graeme Charles Pearson.
	   ``However, due to the sharp depreciation of regional currencies
and the economic turmoil pervading the Southeast Asian region,
profitability of the group has been affected by increased material
costs, of which only a portion has been recovered from the market
through modest price increases.''
	   He told reporters this after Nylex's annual meeting in Petaling
Jaya yesterday.
	   Pearson said that steps to cut cost and attention to working
capital are bearing fruit, with a reduction in gearing to 29 per
cent for the year ended Dec 31, 1997.
	   He added that the company is aiming to further reduce its
gearing.
	   Nylex has traditionally operated within a gearing of 20-to-29
per cent of shareholders' funds.
	   For the year ended Dec 31, 1997, it recorded a group pre-tax
profit of RM69.89 million on a turnover of RM590.93 million. Total
shareholders' funds stood at RM440.48 million.
	   The company's borrowings totalled RM120 million at the end of
last year, comprising mainly short-term trade or working capital
type of borrowings.
	   Asked if there is a possibility of the company going into the
red, he said: ``Absolutely not. We are trading profitably and there
is no reason this will not continue.''
	   For the rest of the year, Nylex will develop products for
expansion into new markets especially in the Asia Pacific.
	   Currently, about 30 per cent of its turnover is derived from
exports.
	   This contribution is set to grow as the company positions itself
for larger export volume in order to benefit from increased
competitiveness brought on by the weakened ringgit.
	   As the company's strength lies with its operations in the Asia
Pacific, it will take steps to entrench its position in those
markets.
	   The engineering division will focus on China, the Middle East,
Singapore and Vietnam. For the roof tile business, the main markets
are Europe, Sri Lanka and the Indian Ocean islands.
	   Its insulation materials are mainly sold to Asean countries,
while glass containers are mainly exported to the Philippines and
Australia.
	   On the outlook for the domestic market, Pearson said it depended
on the type of product, but the group largely commanded a big share
of the markets it operated in.
	   It is currently the leader in the polymer and switchgear
businesses.

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ African and U.N. leaders on
Monday condemned Ethiopia and Eritrea for escalating deadly border
clashes, as Ethiopia's foreign minister unleashed a war of words
against Eritrea.
	   Several leaders attending an Organization of African Unity
summit in the Burkina Faso capital despaired that the 35-year-old
organization was unable to end strife on the continent.
	   Addressing the opening ceremony, OAU Secretary General Salim A.
Salim expressed shock at airstrikes traded by Ethiopia and Eritrea
in the Horn of Africa.
	   Ethiopian warplanes bombed an Eritrean military airport in the
capital, Asmara, for what it called incursions into Ethiopian
territory. Eritreans hit an Ethiopian town, killing at least 40
people.
	   ``Despite all efforts to contain and defuse the dispute, the
crisis has dramatically escalated in the course of the last few
days,'' Salim said. ``Everything should be done to secure an
immediate cessation of hostilities.''
	   U.N. assistant secretary-general Louise Frechette also deplored
the conflict, saying both Ethiopia and Eritrea had delayed making
serious efforts to end the conflict.
	   ``The U.N. will continue to work closely with both countries to
end this serious crisis,'' Frechette said.
	   Nelson Mandela, attending his last continental summit as South
African president, urged the OAU to devise new ways of solving
African conflagrations, saying old methods risked failure.
	   The summit, billed as a forum for peace, focused instead on
averting a potential war.
	   ``We must seriously address the question of what we need to do
to ensure that the continent truly and collectively takes charge of
its security and stability,'' the 79-year-old Mandela said in a
statement.
	   The OAU's outgoing and incoming chairmen also offered pleas for
peace.
	   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, who gave up the one-year OAU
chairmanship, said the two ``brotherly'' northeastern African
countries had turned nationalist pride into violence causing
``losses of human life and destruction of property.''
	   In his first speech as OAU chairman, Burkina Faso President
Blaise Campaore deplored the ``saber-rattling'' and ``fratricidal
conflict'' between the two nations.
	   On the sidelines of the summit, Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin launched a diplomatic assault on Eritrea, demanding
that Eritrean troops be withdrawn from the disputed border zone.
	   ``The first thing to be done is for Eritrea to withdraw its
troops and return to the status quo,'' Seyoum said. Eritrea is
``imposing war on Ethiopia by occupying certain territories.''
	   Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, who earlier accused Ethiopia
of declaring war, dispatched his foreign minister, Haile Woldensae,
to Burkina Faso. Ethiopia's Seyoum was representing Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi.
	   The OAU has had little influence on the conflict since border
clashes began May 6. But diplomats in Ouagadougou said delegates
plan to draft a resolution on the conflict after making
recommendations to their leaders.
	   OAU Assistant Secretary-General Pascal Gayama told journalists
that the organization would work closely with Rwandan and U.S.
mediators who have drafted a peace proposal.
	   In addition to African heads of state, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is also attending the summit.
	   There was speculation that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who
claimed Sunday to be brokering his own accord between the two
warring neighbors, might also show up at the summit for the first
time in more than a decade.

World Cup: Coach delays decision on injury
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Monday practice in 3rd graf; SUBS last three
grafs to trim and ADD Akita comments.
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Japan's coach says he may not
decide until the last minute whether to allow injured captain
Masami Ihara to play in the World Cup opener against Argentina.
	   On Monday, Ihara took part in a regular practice with his
teammates for the first time since hurting his right knee during
training last week. He ran about and kicked the ball lightly with
his teammates for 15 minutes. The rest of the practice was closed
to the media.
	   Ihara did not play in Japan's two warmup matches last week _ a
1-0 loss to Yugoslavia in Switzerland, and a 1-0 victory over
Gueugnon of the French second division on Sunday.
	   Coach Takeshi Okada said hopes were high that Ihara, one of
Asia's best defenders, will be ready for by June 14 for the
Argentina match in Toulouse.
	   ``If I decide at the last minute that he is not ready, I will
tell him,'' Okada said after Sunday's game. ``But I don't want to
pressure him by setting a date for that.''
	   The team canceled a jog scheduled for Monday morning to give the
players a rest.
	   Calm and soft-spoken, Ihara is the most experienced player on
Japan's World Cup squad. The 30-year-old defender has taken part in
more international A matches than any other Japanese player.
	   Midfielder Motohiro Yamaguchi has been captain in Ihara's place.
	   ``If he can't make it, I know I can do a good job,'' Yamaguchi
said.
	   Defender Yutaka Akita said the team is adjusting well to Ihara's
defense replacement, Toshihide Saito.
	   ``Of course, Ihara as the captain has a certain presence,''
Akita said. ``But Toshi is gaining experience, too, so there's no
problem.''

	   Exclusive Deal
	   The Business Daily is pleased to announce that as part of
continuing efforts to afford the best possible service to
subscribers and readers, TBD has entered into an exclusive
agreement with Los Angeles Times Syndicate and Review Publishing
Co. Ltd., publisher of Asia's business newsweekly, the Far Eastern
Economic Review (FEER).
	   Starting this month, FEER articles -- including cover stories --
will see print exclusively in TBD.
	   The agreement with FEER is a major development, coming on the
heels of another exclusive agreement signed in December last year
between TBD and The Washington Post Writers Group and Newsweek, the
international news magazine owned and operated by Newsweek Inc.,
New York.
	   Newsweek articles -- including cover stories from the news
magazine's different world editions (Atlantic, Pacific, Latin
American, US, UK editions) -- have since then been published
exclusively by TBD on a simultaneous-release basis.
	   The new agreement with FEER allows for transmission of stories
to TBD on Thursdays, the magazine's issue day, for use the next
day. Hence, TBD will print the cover story on Mondays and carry
FEER stories throughout the week.
	   Published weekly (every Thursday) in HK since 1946, FEER is
``the world authority on Asian current affairs, business, economics
and investment.''
	   Review Publishing Co. Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dow

	   UNCOLLECTED rubbish, stinking to high heaven, can rile even the
calmest of people on the best of days.
	   Alam Flora Sdn Bhd, of course, is well aware of this. Its
experience in Kuala Lumpur has left it rich with knowledge on what
happens when collection schedules are not met.
	   But this writer feels it, nevertheless, necessary to repeat the
dire consequences of leaving garbage uncollected.
	   This will at least underline the importance of the task, being a
perpetual reminder to those charged with ensuring empty garbage
bins in areas currently served by several local authorities.
	   Come July 1, Alam Flora Sdn Bhd will assume, besides garbage
collection, other urban services like drain cleaning and grass
cutting in areas including Petaling Jaya, Kajang, Semenyih,
Beranang, Ulu Semenyih, Hulu Langat and Cheras.
	   The guardians of our garbage bins in Kuala Lumpur will take on
the task with the benefit of hindsight.
	   The numerous run-ins with residents, traders and sometimes
elected representatives will be of great help to the company as it
leaves the city centre for less developed areas.
	   Petaling Jaya may stand out from the rest of the new areas as it
is a developed area in its own right, sharing many similarities
with Kuala Lumpur.
	   But for the rest of the new areas, it will almost be a new ball
game for Alam Flora Sdn Bhd, given the peculiarities of garbage
collection and grass cutting and drain cleaning services in small
towns.
	   We are told that the company will be responsible for the
clearing of all illegal dumps, a major problem in the rural areas.
	   Illegal dumps have cropped up in Kuala Lumpur before, perhaps
not with the regularity of areas out of the city where supervision
is sometimes lax and civic-consciousness wanting. It is in this
context that Kuala Lumpur City Hall director-general Datuk Noordin
Razak's recent reminder to Alam Flora Sdn Bhd to improve services
in the outskirts of the city must be seen.
	   While unhappy with services provided by contractors hired by the
company in these areas, he qualified his statement by saying he was
satisfied with services provided in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Alam Flora Sdn Bhd's no-nonsense acting chief executive officer
Mohammed Siraj Abdul Razack should, therefore, keep all new
contractors coming into the fold on a tight rein.
	   It is quite natural for contractors away from the direct
scrutiny of headquarters to relax a little when it comes to the
job.
	   It is here that he and his officers have to draw the line. They
have to make it crystal clear that they will not tolerate any such
behaviour from the contractors.
	   The quality of service in both urban as well as less developed
areas has to be the same - the people will accept no less.
	   With a work force dedicated to specific tasks unlike the local
authorities which had to handle almost all urban services besides
development projects, Alam Flora Sdn most certainly has its work
cut out for it.
	   The company has scheduled training sessions for workers and
contractors later this month, surely a step in the right direction.
	   While teething problems may make their presence felt, they have
to be handled swiftly and efficiently. The public will expect this
as the company is no newcomer to the field.
	   In this respect, local authorities have to set up panels to
monitor urban services provided by Alam Flora Sdn's contractors.
	   The MPPJ is in the process of setting up a unit to monitor and
receive complaints on garbage disposal services, according to
council president Mohamad Nor Bador.
	   Other councils should follow suit in their best interest.

	   IT will be the end of water woes for some 20 children of the
Ti-Ratana Welfare Society and they have to thank The Rotary Club of
Kuala Lumpur DiRaja.
	   The club, at its weekly meeting, donated two water tankers with
electrical pumps costing RM6,500 as part of its community service
project.
	   Present to receive the contribution from the club president
Jimmy Lim was Rev K. Dhamma Ratana.
	   The Ti-Ratana Welfare Centre located in Salak South Garden was
officially opened in June last year.
	   The society houses 20 children between the ages of three and 14
and has been managing its affairs through donations and its Sponsor
A Child Programme.
	   Ratana said the economic slowdown had significantly reduced
donation and the recent water rationing had affected the home
badly.
	   The Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur DiRaja is the oldest and the
biggest of the Rotary Club in Malaysia with a membership of about
120.
	   During the weekly meeting, the club's very own website was
launched by Miss Malaysia/Universe 1998 Sherine Wong and Ms Tourism
1998 Ooi Bee Bee.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite President Clinton's appeal to
avoid ``finger-pointing,'' leaders of the world's drug-producing
nations showed no hesitation Monday in blaming consumers for the
global narcotics problem.
	   Their message: if rich countries such as the United States want
our help in fighting against drugs, show us the money.
	   ``The illicit drug trade is demand-driven,'' the prime minister
of the tiny Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis told the
opening session of the U.N. General Assembly special session on
drugs.
	   ``How can we truly expect small, poor countries such as mine to
defeat the wealthy drug lords if the rich countries, with their
wealth of resources, are unsuccessful in limiting the demand,''
said the prime minister, Denzil Douglas.
	   In his opening speech to the three-day conference, President
Clinton urged world leaders to stand together and avoid
finger-pointing in attempting to devise new, coordinated strategies
in the fight against drugs.
	   ``Pointing fingers is distracting,'' Clinton said. ``It does not
dismantle a single cartel, help a single addict, prevent a single
child from trying _ and perhaps dying _ from heroin.''
	   Clinton said ``the lines between countries that are supply
countries, demand countries and transit countries are increasingly
blurred. Drugs are every nation's problem.''
	   But Latin American countries, who account for most of the
world's supply of cocaine, don't see it that way.
	   ``We need resources, and it must come from the international
community,'' Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori told reporters as
he arrived for the opening session. ``And I think this will
consolidate the reduction of production _ it might in the Peruvian
case - the production of cocoa leaves.''
	   President Hugo Banzer of Bolivia said his government was
committed to eradicating illegal production of cocoa, which is used
in the production of cocaine.
	   But Banzer said the program will cost dlrs 952 million over five
years, including dlrs 700 to provide alternative crops and markets
for the 35,000 Bolivian families whose livelihood comes from the
illegal crop.
	   He appealed to the United States and other wealthy countries to
pick up 85 percent of the cost of the program, reminding them that
``each dollar we devote to combating drug trafficking has painful
social costs.''

	   THE 16th Commonwealth Games to be held between Sept 11 and 21
will have an added attraction in the form of a 35ha International
Garden in Bukit Jalil.
	   The garden will have a boating pond, ornamental lake, picnic
site and a cascading waterfall as well as 28 international themed
gardens with 10 of them being ready for the games.
	   The international themed gardens include those depicting
English, Japanese, Iranian, Holland, Peruvian, Indonesian, Thai,
Canadian, Chinese and Malaysian gardens.
	   The RM30 million project is being undertaken by Seri Merga
Construction Sdn Bhd on a turnkey basis from the Kuala Lumpur City
Hall. Its deputy general manager Raffique Osman said about 40 per
cent of the work had been completed. It is expected to be ready by
October.
	   He said although contractually the company was not obliged to
complete the garden before the Games, it is going to oblige with a
request from City Hall to complete the portion facing the road and
Games village.
	   He said some 400 indigenous tree saplings will also be planted
in between the existing rubber trees. These will include saplings
of ciku (achras zapota), damar minyak (agathis dammara), buah keras
(aleurites moluccana) and kelempayang (anthocephalus chinensis).
	   Others include mata pelanduk (ardisia elliptica), terap
(artocarpus elasticus), sukun (artocarpus incisus), mambu
(azadirachta indica), berangan (castanopsis inermis), kapok (ceiba
pentandra) and pong pong (cerbera menghas).
	   Raffique said work on the cascading waterfall and other water
features will begin this week, including the fabrication of
elevated features while City Hall's Parks and Recreation section
assumed a supervisory role.
	   He said the company had to come up with concepts on how a
particular garden should look like and so far it had identified the
garden with an Islamic theme with a lot of water features, while
phoenix palms will take the place of date palm trees.
	   He said the company had sent someone to study gardens overseas
and it found the Malaysian garden at an international gerden in
Osaka was very disappointing as it did not project a Malaysian
identity at all.
	   ``We shall ensure that the Malaysian garden will have the
multi-racial nature of the people living here and other features
will include fragrant flowering plants,'' he said.
	   Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Shariff said earlier more
areas in Kuala Lumpur will be turned into gardens under a Kuala
Lumpur City Hall plan to create a bigger green belt giving it a
``garden city'' look.
	   He had said a total of land area of 400ha in several areas
including Pudu Ulu, Taman Metropolitan Kepong, Taman Metropolitan
Jinjang Utara, Taman Manjalara and Tamam West Valley in Bukit Kiara
had been identified for the project.
	   He had also said City Hall was embarking on planting shady trees
and landscaping mining areas and rivers in the municipality, like
Sungai Kuyoh in Bukit Jalil, where the Commonwealth Games Village
is sited.
	   Kamaruzzaman has said the landscaping and beautification project
will include routes which were being used for the Games. A sum of
RM7 million has been allocated for landscaping projects.
	   City Hall's budget for landscaping and tree-planting activities
this year is RM3 million while that for cleaning, beautification
and upkeep of rivers is RM11 million.

World Cup: Romanians train together behind locked gates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with evening practice. &QL; 
 &UR; By VIOREL URMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALBI, France (AP) _ Looking refreshed after a night's rest
following their trip from Bucharest, Romania's World Cup squad
trained twice Monday _ once behind closed doors and guarded by more
than a dozen uniformed French police.
	   With reporters climbing atop cars at a distance to look over a
concrete wall surrounding the field, the squad took part in a
90-minute workout _ their first since arriving Sunday.
	   Coach Anghel Iordanescu followed the training session with a
lengthy address to the team. The squad opens its World Cup schedule
June 15 against Colombia.
	   In late afternoon, the Romanians allowed the public and media
into their second training session, but made no statements to
reporters.
	   In a possible indication that Iordanescu is looking to take the
iniative against Colombia, the Romanian coach worked intensively
with playmaking midfielder Gheorghe Hagi of Turkish club
Galatasaray, striker Ilie Dumitrescu of Mexico's Atlante, Chelsea
wingback Dan Petrescu and midfielder Gheorghe Popescu, the team's
leading scorer in qualifying with eight goals.
	   However, one of the biggest problems for Iordanescu is defense,
where 23-year-old Cristian Dulca of Rapid Bucharest, who has only
five caps, seemed more likely to replace Atletico Madrid's Daniel
Prodan as the central marking defender. Prodan had surgery on his
right knee last month and is still recuperating.
	   Another problem for the Romanians is that they are short on
match practice. Iordanescu has complained that his squad was denied
a chance to attend a training camp in Switzerland and has faced
only lightly regarded opponents in friendly matches, the last
against Moldova last week.
	   ``The federation has repeatedly told me they do not have the
necessary funds,'' he said.
	   The Romanians instead had to be content with a training camp in
the Carpathian Alps, north of Bucharest.

	   THE last time I saw Karthik was in Uthavikku Varalamah, another
of those movies which tries to solicit laughs by using the
``mistaken-identity''
	   formula.
	   There are a number of songs added to the tiresome fare although
you could not fault Karthik's acting in that movie. In Harichandra
(this one has nothing to do with the oldie with the same name),
Karthik is at his best in both comedy and drama.
	   Newcomer Cheyar Ravi shines in this truly entertaining movie.
	   Normally, you can predict how a story will go but here it is
totally unpredictable as director Cheyar Ravi surprises with new
elements. It was absolutely delightful until the end.
	   Harichandra, as you may know, is the name of a king who lived
long ago, who was known for his absolute honesty and morals.
	   Here, the hero of the movie, Harichandra (Karthik), is just the
opposite. He drinks, smokes and lies but in his parents' eyes, he
is the paragon of virtue.
	   Hari works in an advertising firm. While out shooting a
commercial, he chances upon Nandhini (Meena), a teacher. Hari falls
head over heels in love with her although his friends say she hates
those who smoke, drink or lie.
	   One lie leads to another and before Nandhini knows it, she is in
love with Hari.
	   But the lies begin to unravel and Hari has a tough time keeping
his girl.
	   Ravi ensures the songs (by newcomer Agoshi) do not interfere
with his story by pacing them at 40-minute intervals.
	   To satisfy action fans, a few fights have also been added but
they are necessary for the storyline. The cinematography by Ravi
Yadav and the art direction are a treat for the eyes.
	   Harichandra is one of the better movies this year after Ponmanam
and Thulli Thiruntha Kaalam. It has a good story, direction,
cinematography and fun.
	   It is now playing at the small cineplex in Wilayah Complex,
Kuala Lumpur. If you are patient, you may enjoy it better when it
plays at the bigger cineplexes or theatres in Klang.

	   THE Chair is about how one event can change someone's life.
	   This monumental ``event'' concerns a retired septuagenarian
newspaper editor in a town in China. He uses his pension to buy a
simple yet elegant wooden chair from an antique shop.
	   The chair soon becomes his source of misery as it's mistaken for
a ``national treasure'' that was reported stolen from a museum. The
old man goes to great lengths to clear his name.
	   Viewers won't understand the hullabaloo over a chair, albeit a
national treasure. Although this is different from the usual
``stolen-property-puts- innocent-man-in-trouble'' story, The
Chair's meandering plot and leisurely pace make it a dud.
	   I was willing to overlook the controversy over the chair in the
hope that the movie would provide an insight into family, community
and cultural relationships in a China that's slowly opening up to
the world, but to no avail.
	   The most viewers can take from The Chair is that twentysomething
single women spend most of their time on exercise machines and
``hang out'' with their good-for-nothing boy-friends.
	   The old man is Gu Yifu (Bi Geng), who has his hands full with
the chair.
	   His daughter Millie (Jiang Li Fen) takes a dislike to the chair
and asks him to return it. But the store won't accept it. So Gu
goes all over town trying to offload it.
	   There's also been a break-in at a museum, and the police suspect
that the missing chair is in Gu's possession.
	   Everyone gets on Gu's case over the chair, and the old man can't
have a single moment of peace.
	   Millie's boyfriend Yang Cong (Ma Chuan) purports to want to help
Gu by secretly selling the chair to an antique dealer.
	   The deal, however, backfires when the chair is discovered as
being nothing more than ... a chair.
	   Yang's presence is hard to fit into the puzzle of The Chair. It
isn't certain what he does, and the movie at one stage dissolves
into grainy images of him performing in a music video.
	   Millie, too, is hard to categorise. When we're first introduced
to her, she's on one of those machines that supposedly pares down
the tummy. For the rest of the movie, she harangues her father to
get rid of the chair.
	   In one scene, Millie, wearing a vest, looks into the mirror and
examines her breast for lumps.
	   This may be what writer-director Zhang Tae Lin would like
viewers to think, and he gets no complains from me, but it comes
off as a gratuitous piece of titillation with no bearing on the
movie.
	   Bi does enough as the old man with too much time on his hand.
His character introduces us to the others. His role is passive as
he reacts to others' actions.

Martinez makes his pitch for Latin record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ In this country, 243 is hardly a number that
stirs baseball passions like 56, 61 or 755.
	   In Latin America, though, it's big. Very big.
	   Dennis Martinez of the Atlanta Braves has equaled Juan Marichal
as the winningest Latin-born pitcher in baseball history, winning
his 243rd game last week with a 12-hit shutout at Milwaukee.
	   On Tuesday night, the 43-year-old Nicaraguan will go for No. 244
against the Boston Red Sox in an interleague game at Turner Field.
A thousand miles away, Nicaragua waits to unleash the sort of pride
it felt on that night in 1991 when he pitched a perfect game.
	   Viva, El Presidente!
	   ``We as a Spanish-speaking population see it a different way
than the American population,'' said Martinez, who is 243-189 in a
major league career that began in 1976 _ one year before Braves
teammate Andruw Jones was born. ``The people of Nicaragua feel the
most proud. Now they feel like, `Yeah, we are somebody. He put our
country on top now.'''
	   While Marichal led a wave of players from the Dominican Republic
to the majors leagues, Martinez is the only significant player to
emerge from Nicaragua. That makes him more determined to give the
Central American country a lasting spot in baseball history.
	   ``People will know where we're coming from, where we are,''
Martinez said. ``They can see us on the map and find out where
Nicaragua is. All that recognition will allow most people to know
where I come from. It's great.''
	   The significance of the record hasn't escaped Martinez's
teammates, especially those of Latin descent. When he finished the
record-tying victory against Milwaukee, Ozzie Guillen and Andres
Galarraga _ both natives of Venezuela _ were the first ones to
arrive at the mound with smiles and hugs.
	   ``There's probably not too many people making a lot out of what
he's doing right now, but for all the Latin players it means a
lot,'' Galarraga said. ``It's a lot of games, it's a lot of wins,
it's a lot of years. It's something really special for us.''
	   Marichal, who injured his head in a car wreck in April, has been
recuperating in the Dominican Republic. Elected to the Hall of Fame
in 1983, he had a 243-142 record and 2.89 ERA while pitching for 16
seasons, mostly with the San Francisco Giants. He worked in 471
games, winning 20 or more six times.
	   Martinez, pitching in his 21st season, needed 657 games to reach
243 wins. He has never won 20 games in a season and his career ERA
(3.68) is much higher than Marichal's, but the Nicaraguan has
managed double-figure wins 15 times _ the first in 1977, the most
recent in 1995.
	   The keywords for Martinez are consistency and durability.
	   ``He's unbelievable,'' Galarraga said. ``He's a good role model
for the young guys from any country in South America, or even the
United States. This guy, he works hard every day. He's running,
he's doing anything he can to stay in the big leagues. He is
something special, the way he works.''
	   They call Galarraga the Big Cat, but it's Martinez who has nine
lives. His career was in tatters after three straight seasons with
ERAs above 5.00 for the Baltimore Orioles in the first half of the
1980s, but he became one of the NL's top pitchers after a trade to
Montreal.
	   In May 1997, the end was at hand again when Martinez, bothered
by knee and elbow problems, was released by Seattle after going 1-5
with a 7.71 ERA. The right-hander sat out the rest of the season,
then earned a spot with the Braves during a spring training tryout.
	   Martinez was hit hard the first three weeks of the season, but
his ERA is 1.11 since April 24. Overall, he's 2-2 with a 3.86 ERA.
	   For the second time, he's filling in for John Smoltz in
baseball's best rotation. Martinez made two April starts with
Smoltz on the disabled list after offseason elbow surgery, then
returned to a starting role when Smoltz's elbow began bothering him
again two weeks ago.
	   When Smoltz comes back, it's back to the bullpen for Martinez,
who has made 14 relief appearances this season. His 43-year-old arm
has shown amazing resiliency in a variety of roles, which is only
appropriate for a pitcher who's made that the trademark of his
entire career.
	   ``I feel like a Hall of Famer, too,'' he said. ``You look at
yourself and start thinking about what you have done in this game,
what you have achieved. Luckily, I put some good numbers out
there.''

	   THE Conseil General (General Council) responsible for the Val
d'Oise industrial area in France is on an aggressive drive to woo
foreign companies, including Malaysian ones, to set up base there.
	   Val d'Oise is situated some 20km from Paris.
	   Saying that there were five Malaysian companies mostly involved
in the manufacture of electronic components that had settled there
in the last three years, export manager attached to the council
Yves Gitton said the industrial area had the advantage of being a
transportation hub to the rest of Europe.
	   The area, which boasts the Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport as
well as a TGV train station, is expected to attract more companies
in the near future, as European integration draws near.
	   ``It is ideal for foreign companies that want to have a foothold
in Europe,'' Gitton told a Press conference at the Mines exhibition
centre in Sri Kembangan, Selangor, yesterday.
	   Some of the incentives offered are tax exemption for a minimum
of five years (depending on size and sector), lower social
contribution if the company employs the jobless, and a 25 per cent
discount on the price of land purchased from the conseil.
	   On its language barrier, Gitton said the French who have
traditionally identified strongly with their language were now
beginning to give more importance to the English language as a
result of the Internet.
	   Currently 450 foreign companies operate there with the bulk from
the US and Japan. Most are in the high-technology business.

	   NEGOTIATIONS are underway for a Malaysian company to purchase
from Sichuan Donghua Machinery Works of China, a complete MDF
(medium-density fibreboard) plant to manufacture furniture.
	   The US$3 million (RM11.7 million) deal is pending as ``they (the
Malaysians) are hoping for a better exchange rate'', said Yang
Jinchun, general manager of CMIC International Exhibition Co Ltd.
	   CMIC was formed in 1980 specifically to coordinate economic and
technological co-operation between Chinese and foreign companies.
	   Yang was speaking at a Press conference during the five-day
International Machine Tool &AMP; Metalworking Exhibition (IMX) in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday.
	   He said the 10 participants from China were fewer this year
because of ``worries about the Malaysian economic condition''.
	   Last year, a total of US$300,000 was contracted on site by the
Chinese delegation which represented 20 companies.
	   Yang said for the last three years, a joint venture for
operating the complete plant for the manufacture of non-bake bricks
has been ongoing between China-East Resources Import &AMP; Export
Company and a Malaysian company.
	   The Chinese company had invested US$1 million in the project.
	   On how Chinese-made machinery can compete with other countries,
Yang said: ``The quality of Chinese-made machinery is comparable to
those made in Japan or other countries.
	   ``China is also near Malaysia in terms of physical distance,
culture and language, thus facilitating after-sales service.''
	   Since its establishment, CMIC had acquired more than 1,000
technological transfer projects for the mechanical and electrical
industries in China.

World Cup: French return, but Zidane's health for opener still
</HEADLINE>
questioned &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with French arriving, quote on Zidane health, PICKS UP
8th graf.

	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ The World Cup must be close when
even the French are in the country.
	   After a four-day escape to Finland, the French team returned
Monday but with a certain amount of anxiety _ is their creative
genius, Zinedine Zidane, healthy?
	   After a difficult 1-0 victory over Finland on Friday, playmaker
Zidane has been struggling with a sore ankle, and reassuring
messages from the medical camp have hardly lifted the dark cloud
hanging over the team.
	   Zidane, with whom all French hopes of winning the World Cup rest
upon, had to be rested on Saturday and could only run for 10
minutes on Sunday because his right ankle still was bothersome.
	   Upon their return to France, team Dr. Jean-Marcel Ferret was
swamped with questions about the team's biggest star.
	   ``Yes, for sure, for sure,'' he will be able to start in the
opening match, Ferret said.
	   The Juventus Turin midfielder hopes to resume regular training
Tuesday, just three days before France's World Cup opener against
South Africa in his hometown of Marseille. Saudi Arabia and Denmark
complete Group C.
	   Ferret said Zidane was fighting through the worst pain a few
days after the injury.
	   ``I wouldn't worry too much,'' he said.
	   All through the weekend, coach Aime Jacquet criticized Friday's
referee that could have cost France its brightest star. Zidane was
tackled often and hard and Jacquet even considered pulling him off
the field to protect him.
	   ``It was a scandal,'' Jacquet said.
	   In case Zidane does not recover in time, his place would most
likely be taken by 24-year-old Robert Pires of Metz, the runner-up
in the French league.
	   Zidane's was the only injury for the French. Other difficulties
were tactical, centering on who would provide the French goals.
	   Jacquet had long promised that France would turn from a
defensive and conservative team into an ``audacious'' one for the
World Cup, but words have come easier than performances.
	   Captain Didier Deschamps knows that an overnight change is
tough.
	   ``We will never produce fireworks,'' he was quoted by the sports
daily L'Equipe. ``We cannot have a revolution in one week.''
	   On top of that, the French expect South Africa to do little else
than defend and hoping for a counterattack goal.
	   ``We won't fall for that trap,'' said Deschamps, arguing against
an all-out assault from the start.
	   The French team will stay for three days at its training camp in
the woods southwest of Paris before heading to Marseille on
Thursday for their Coupe du Monde debut.
	   ``The team is bubbling with impatience,'' Jacquet said.

World Cup: Germans squeak past young French side 2-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ One week before its opening match against
the United States, Germany did not look like a World Cup favorite
in struggling to a 2-1 victory over a selection of young French
second-division players Monday.
	   It was the final warmup game for the European champion before
its clash with the United States June 15 in Paris.
	   The Germans, who arrived in France Sunday, obviously did not
push hard but their defense was caught embarrassingly flat-footed a
few times.
	   Coach Berti Vogts used 17 players. Thomas Helmer was out with a
thigh injury, Christian Ziege because of fever and Andreas Moeller
because of a foot blister, while Christian Woerns and third
goalkeeper Jens Lehmann were spared.
	   Before the match, a minute of silence was observed for the
victims of last week's train disaster at Eschede, Germany.
	   Playing a professional but mostly junior selection of players
from second-division clubs Nice and Cannes, Germany used a starting
lineup that is not likely to take the field against the United
States.
	   The three-time World Cup champion started as follows: Andreas
Koepke, Juergen Kohler, Markus Babbel, Lothar Matthaeus, Stefan
Reuter, Jens Jeremies, Dietmar Hamann, Thomas Haessler, Michael
Tarnat, Ulf Kirsten, Olaf Marschall.
	   Marschall scored the only goal in the first half with a
long-range shot that was deflected by a French defender in the 32nd
minute.
	   While the Germans naturally dominated the game, their defense
was caught off guard several times by some clever French moves. The
Germans based their game on attacks down the wings with a lot of
crosses into the penalty area, something they have been doing a lot
in practice.
	   In the second half, Germany used the following lineup: Oliver
Kahn, Steffen Freund, Babbel, Olaf Thon, Joerg Heinrich, Jeremies,
Hamann, Haessler, Tarnat, Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann.
	   Bierhoff made it 2-0 in the 57th, slamming the ball home from
close range after good work on the right by Heinrich. Klinsmann
soon hit the bar, but then the French side scored a magnificent
goal. A through ball split the German defense, David Andreani
picked up the pass, danced around Kahn and put the ball under the
bar in the 69th.
	   Vogts used the game to practice several tactical moves. Thon
played a more offensive libero than Matthaeus in the first half and
the combination of Klinsmann and Bierhoff in attack looked sharp.

	   FACTORIES in the Hulu Klang Free Trade Zone which are hard hit
by the water crisis in the Klang Valley have been forced to cut
their production by as much as 50 per cent, forcing them to suffer
losses running into millions of ringgit.
	   If the lost business and other opportunity costs are taken into
consideration, the water fiasco may have cost the country billions
of ringgit in export earnings.
	   Major factory operators in the FTZ who have been complaining to
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry are reported to
have issued an ultimatum at a meeting on Wednesday.
	   They cannot go on suffering losses especially when water supply
is still uncertain. The companies, as investors in the country,
hoped MITI will be able to highlight their plight.
	   Some have even allocated money to increase their water storage
capacity.
	   Harris Semi-Conductor (M) Sdn Bhd had to reduce 30 per cent of
its production due to water shortage while SEH Malaysia Sdn Bhd,
one of the world's largest manufacturers of silicon wafers, had
previously stated that it had to reduce production by almost 50 per
cent.
	   Harris Semi-Conductor, which prides itself in its ``On Time
Delivery''
	   programme, had to delay some of its deliveries, thus ending up
paying penalty fees to its customer, a source said.
	   ``Apart from that, the company has been receiving complaints
from its customers about the poor delivery. Deliveries have been
delayed for a day or two and, in some cases, it had to cancel
deliveries.''
	   It is believed that Harris Semi-Conductor has incurred a total
loss of between RM15 million and RM18 million for the past nine
months due to the water shortage.
	   For production SEH, which claims to be Klang Valley's single
largest user of water, previously used between 9,000 and 10,000
cubic metres of water for a full-day operation.
	   Since the water shortage hit Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, water
supply to the companies has been inconsistent.
	   ``Due to the poor transparency and planning in supplying or
rationing water, Harris Semi-Conductor, which has invested nearly
RM600 million in the country for the past 24 years, has to suffer
significant losses.''
	   Harris Semi-Conductor has to date allocated RM300,000 for the
construction of three wells. Currently, its contractor has
completed a 630-feet well.
	   The three wells are expected to provide the company with at
least 68.10 cubic metres of water.
	   However, Harris Semi-Conductor has to analyse the water content
before the company can use it for the production of
semi-conductors.
	   Another company hard hit is Texas Instruments (M) Sdn Bhd. To
date it has spent RM2 million to increase its water storage
capacity.
	   ``The money was used to build new wells and purchase water
recycling equipment,'' managing director James Lamn said.
	   ``We purchased water recycling equipment in order to reduce our
consumption. We recycle the water used for manufacturing.
	   ``Apart from that, we have also dug more wells. If our stored
water runs out, we will use the well water,'' he said, adding that
the measures taken do not increase the company's storage capacity
but helps reduce its water consumption.
	   On the current water situation, he said: ``For the past two
months, water was supplied every other day. However, our taps have
been dry for the last five days. If the situation persists, Texas
will be in jeopardy.''
	   The company, which has been in Malaysia for 25 years, needs 4.54
litres of water per minute.

	   CUTE characters - check! Humour - check! Plot - err, raincheck.
Memorable songs - nyet! Voice - oh dear! Like this checklist, the
formulaic animated film from Warner Bros. has its moments and loses
them, both with equal ease.
	   Quest For Camelot tells the tale of litle Kayley, the daughter
of Sir Lionel who is one of King Arthur's knights.
	   Kayley gets embroiled in the search for the King's magic sword,
Excalibur, after Lionel is killed during an attempt on the King's
life by the evil Ruber and the sword is stolen by a griffin.
	   For adults, the story is pretty ho hum and the action picks up
only after Kayley enters the forbidden forest when the two-headed
dragon, Devon and Cornwall, comes into the picture.
	   Up to this point, the humour is weakly sustained by Bladebeak,
an amorous... err, male chicken who is... err, henpecked by his
missus! When Devon and Corn-wall come into play, the humour gets
distinctly wicked and hilarious. Campy even.
	   The gem of jokes comes from this duo when they sing that they
are one of the reasons why cousins shouldn't marry.
	   The hero, Garrett, is a strange one. Being blind, he is a total
departure from the physically perfect leading men we normally see
in animations, with the possible exception of Disney's Hunchback of
Notre Dame.
	   At the risk of being petty, it must be said that some of the
plot developments are improbable - like how Garret is blinded or
how Lionel is killed.
	   Hey, these are things that are only supposed to happen in real
life, in a cartoon, the audience would surely like to forget such
things and have a good time, right?
	   And also, some intriguing characters are on for too brief a
period, especially the rock ogre and the magician Merlin.
	   It's like eating a teensy weensy bit of a delicious chocolate
cake on an empty stomach. You want more.
	   VERDICT: Regardless of whatever grouchy and jaded reviewers say,
for kids this animated feature should be a nice distraction. Devon
and Cornwall are sure to provide them with endless laughter in the
cinema hall.

KIWI International Air Lines begins weekly Newark-San Juan flights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ KIWI International Air Lines will
begin once-a-week flights between Newark, New Jersey and San Juan,
Puerto Rico on June 26, the company said Monday.
	   The airline said service will be on Boeing 727-200s. Flights to
Newark will depart on Fridays at 6:45 p.m., and flights to San Juan
on Fridays at 2:20 p.m. Fares will be dlrs 119 until June 24.
	   The Newark airport is in northern New Jersey, about 10 miles
west of New York.
	   KIWI will also add a third flight between Orlando, Florida and
San Juan on Wednesdays beginning June 22. Flights to San Juan will
leave at 7:10 p.m., and flights to Orlando will leave at 2:30 p.m.
	   KIWI was formed in 1992 by former employees of Eastern Airlines
and the original Pan Am, which closed in 1991. The employees
referred to themselves as kiwis, a kind of flightless bird, after
the two companies closed.
	   The company was rescued from bankruptcy liquidation by a
Baltimore surgeon in July and has taken over flights to Aguadilla,
Puerto Rico, and San Juan from the renamed Pan Am, which now flies
only charters.

	   SHAH ALAM, Fri. - The Selangor Museum board members appointed
for 1998- 2000 have been urged to use their professionalism to
promote the museum.
	   Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar said they should also be
dedicated and committed in their duty as board members.
	   Abu Hassan said the museum was a showcase of Selangor's history,
culture and traditions which should be made aware to the people.
	   ``We must not forget our culture and traditions which indirectly
help us to live a healthy lifestyle,'' he said when launching the
International Museum Day celebration at the State-level today.

Siberian mayor to stand trial for embezzlement, tax fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The mayor of a small Siberian city will stand
trial for tax fraud and embezzlement, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said Monday.
	   The charges against Gennday Konyakhin relate to his work as a
businessman before he became mayor of Leninsk-Kuznetsky, the news
agency said, quoting local prosecutors.
	   Konyakhin as been in custody since his arrest in October 1997.
	   Prosecutors on Monday charged him with causing 800,000 rubles
(dlrs 131,000) worth of damages to the state, including
misappropriation of 235,000 rubles (about 38,500 dollars) of budget
funds and 55,000 rubles tax fraud (dlrs 9,000) in tax fraud
resulting from improper registration of automobiles.
	   Konyakhin was elected in the spring of 1997 and became known
nationwide after the influential newspaper Izvestia accused him of
being linked to the mob.
	   President Boris Yeltsin threw his weight behind the newspaper
story, calling for a thorough investigation of Konyakhin's
activities and saying the case exemplified the growing criminal
infiltration of officialdom.

	   TWO of the four Malaysian students charged with conspiracy to
commit fraud via the Internet at the Stoke-on-Trent magistrate's
court on Thursday were believed to have been caught red-handed by
Staffordshire police.
	   It is learnt that police detained Khairul Anuar Ariffin, 28, and
Norlie Mohamad Shah, 23, following a tip-off.
	   The two were in the midst of processing a credit card
transaction via the Internet at a house in Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent,
about 240km from London.
	   Sources said the police were alerted by a bank about the
transaction and managed to trace the address in Shelton.
	   It is learnt that the other two students, Shafik Rizal Shaaban,
23, and Riza Musauwir, 22, were roped in to fence the goods.
	   The group is believed to have been operating since January and
had made purchases worth about STG6,000 (RM39,000).
	   Khairul Anuar, a private computer science student at the
University of Staffordshire, is believed to have master-minded the
transactions.
	   The four were remanded for seven days under the custody of the
Staffordshire police for conspiracy to defraud a number of
companies.
	   Norlie, a computer science student at the University of
Liverpool, is a Public Services Department scholar.
	   Shafik Rizal, a Mara scholar and Riza, a Yayasan Perak scholar,
are also students of the University of Staffordshire.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysian Students Department director Abdul Rahim
Mohamad said its warden in Birmingham had been visiting the
students at the police lock-up to check on their welfare.
	   ``We have submitted a report on the incident to the Education
Ministry in Kuala Lumpur and the parents of the students are being
kept informed of the latest developments.''
	   Two local lawyers have been assigned to provide legal aid to the
students.
	   The four are expected to be brought to court again early next
week.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Mara said it would wait for a complete report
on the arrests.
	   ``The information available to us is based only on media
reports,'' Deputy Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Idris
Jusoh said today.
	   ``We will liaise with the Malaysian Students Department and our
High Commission there to obtain a clear picture,'' he added.
	   Idris was asked whether Mara would revoke the financial aid
provided for its sponsored student following the incident.
	   ``We will wait for a complete report and the Minister will
decide accordingly,'' he said.

	   PETALING JAYA, Fri. - Fifty-two underprivileged children will be
able to see a whole lot better, thanks to the generosity of the
Inner Wheel Club of Bangsar which donated spectacles worth RM2,000
to seven schools today.
	   The schools are Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Midlands Klang,
Sekolah Rendah Sea Port, Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Sri Kelana,
Sekolah Rendah Ladang Seafield, Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan SS19
Subang Jaya, Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Castlefield and Sekolah
Rendah Kebangsaan Kinrara.
	   It also donated sports equipment worth about RM1,000 to Sekolah
Rendah Ladang Seafield.
	   Its president, Datin Naresh Kumari, said the schools' principals
took the children for eye check-ups two months ago.
	   ``About 100 pupils went and 52 of them were told they needed
glasses,''
	   she said.
	   Ten-year-old Marina Ramly, a recipient of a pair of spectacles,
said, ``I could not see the writing on the blackboard before. Now,
I am so glad as I will be able to see better.''
	   This sentiment was shared by R. Logeswari, also 10, who said
that she was ``very, very happy'' to receive the glasses.
	   The club, comprising wives, mothers and sisters of Rotary Club
members, have projects for the needy each year.

Windsor Castle fire renovation shares design award with American

Air Museum &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Windsor Castle's renovation following a
devastating fire shared a top design award Monday with the American
Air Museum near Cambridge.
	   Restoration of the castle's badly damage octagonal lobby and the
museum's futuristic half-dome were joint winners of the Building of
the Year Award 1998, sponsored by the Royal Fine Art Commission and
British Sky Broadcasting.
	   The fire at Windsor Castle in November 1992 gutted the octagonal
lobby, which was once a private chapel. As part of the 37 million
pound (dlrs 60 million) restoration, it was remodeled into an
anteroom with a roof reminiscent of a timber umbrella with eight
oak columns supporting a fan of 25 curving ribs.
	   The room was designed by the Sidell Gibson Partnership as part
of the restoration by Donald Insall Associates. The air museum's
design work was by Foster and Partners.
	   A panel of judges chaired by Lord St. John of Fawsley chose the
winners and the awards were presented at a luncheon at the Savoy
Hotel.

 &UR; Britain's Prescott calls for improving social conditions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Combatting the drug problem requires
comprehensive programs which include education, treatment and
rehabilitation, Britain's deputy prime minister told the opening
session of the U.N. drug summit Monday.
	   But deputy Prime Minister John Prescott also said the answer
does not lie entirely in reducing demand in the major drug-consumer
countries.
	   ``It is no good hoping to eliminate the demand for drugs without
tackling the supply,'' he said.
	   Speaking for the European Union, Prescott said Britain and other
European states ``have learned that tackling drugs successfully
means looking at the whole range of social problems, covering
housing, unemployment, poverty, crime and family life.''
	   ``Education, prevention, rehabilitation and treatment must be
part of any program,'' he added. ``To coin a phrase, we need to be
tough on drugs crime and tough on the causes of drugs crime.''
	   He said the goal was not simply to eradicate crime ``but to also
give people a fresh chance.''
	   He acknowledged that rich countries such as Britain must do more
to reduce demand -- a major argument of Latin American leaders
whose nations account for much of the world's supply.
	   But he said those efforts will not succeed without programs to
convince farmers to abandon illicit crops and help them make the
transition to legal cultivation.

World Cup: Injury to Helmer causing problems for Vogts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS last graf to UPDATE with scrimmage result. &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ The latest injury to hit versatile defender
and midfielder Thomas Helmer is the biggest shadow over Germany's
sunny headquarters on the French Riviera.
	   With one week to go before Germany opens its quest for a fourth
World Cup title against the United States in Paris, Helmer failed
to practice Monday because of a right thigh injury. Also missing
was wing back Christian Ziege, who is battling a fever.
	   ``It's a real, real shame for Thomas,'' coach Berti Vogts said
at his first news conference since the team's arrival Sunday.
	   ``He was being treated this morning and perhaps he can do some
light jogging this afternoon,'' Vogts said.
	   Helmer had just gotten over a thigh strain and played one half
and scored a goal in Germany's 7-0 thrashing of Luxembourg Friday.
Vogts said the new injury, a tensing of the muscle, was different
from the old one.
	   Dr. Hans-Willhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt, a team physician who also
is Helmer's club doctor at Bayern Munich, was flying in and would
examine the player before giving an update on Helmer's condition.
	   ``The doctor's arrival was planned long in advance, it has
nothing to do with this injury,'' Vogts said.
	   Helmer, the 33-year-old Bayern Munich captain, had to break off
Germany's first practice Sunday afternoon, which also was missed by
Ziege.
	   ``He was coming back very well after his original injury,
especially mentally, and I hope he doesn't get down again now,''
Vogts said.
	   Helmer is one of the team leaders who can play as a central
defender, a defensive midfielder, or even as a libero.
	   The 20 healthy players had a light workout Monday morning at the
Charles Ehrmann stadium at a Nice suburb, not far away from the
team's headquarters at the four-star Mas d'Artigny, a wooded,
secluded compound in the hills above Nice.
	   ``We have ideal conditions, from the hotel to the training
grounds and I hope we stay here a long time,'' Vogts said. The team
has reserved its rooms for a month, obviously hoping to reach at
least the semifinals.
	   Monday evening, the Germans played a charity match against a
local selection made up of second-division players and scraped out
a 2-1 win. Olaf Marschall and Oliver Bierhoff scored for the
European champion.

Moderate Bosnian Serbs to run together in September elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In a move aimed at
consolidating moderate Serbs' influence in Bosnia, three reformist
Bosnian Serb parties said Monday they would join forces to win key
posts in September elections.
	   The three parties, with Western support, already dominate the
government of the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia _ the Serb
Republic.
	   They said the new alliance, which is expected to win formal
approval soon from their party boards, is intended to jointly
secure them three top positions: the republic's presidency and two
posts reserved for Serbs in Bosnia's joint presidency and
government.
	   The Serb National Alliance, Socialist Party and Independent
Social Democrats are expected to agree on a joint slate of three
candidates for the posts, with each party contributing one. The
leader of the Serb National Alliance, Biljana Plavsic, is thought
likely to be the consensus choice for Serb Republic president, a
post she already holds.
	   If successful, the alliance could unseat two key Bosnian Serb
hardliners: Momcilo Krajisnik, who holds the Serb seat in the
three-man Bosnian presidency, and Boro Bosic, who is a co-chairman
in Bosnia's joint government.
	   The parties said they will run independently in the Serb
Republic's parliamentary elections, also to be held in September.

	   MALACCA, Fri. - Two Singaporeans, arrested in connection with
the murder of two men whose bodies were found in a car at a police
roadblock in Pahang on Tuesday, may have been looking for a place
to dump them.
	   Initial police investigations indicate the possibility that the
foreigners had travelled about 300km from Malacca to Kuantan to
dispose the bodies of Chai Cheon Keat  &LR;  Peter, and a Singaporean,
both 30.
	   One of the victims who had a stab wound in the chest and wrapped
in a blanket, was found in the boot of the vehicle while the other,
believed to have been strangled, was found in its rear seat.
	   When the two Singaporeans arrived at a police roadlblock at the
100km Kuantan-Segamat highway, Pahang police arrested the duo after
finding the bodies in the white Toyota Corrolla bearing
registration number MAF 433 about 3.30pm.
	   It is understood that this morning, police took the two
Singaporeans to a stretch of road to retrieve an assortment of
documents which they were believed to have dumped while heading
towards Pahang on Tuesday.
	   The New Straits Times learnt today that police suspect that Chai
and the foreigner were killed at a house in Taman Cheng Perdana in
Malacca when a business transaction reportedly involving a group of
Singaporean businessmen, failed.
	   It is believed that a meat cutter and a rope, believed to have
been used in the killings, were found in the house.
	   Chai was the manager of Syarikat Latem Metal Industry Sdn Bhd
based in Malacca while the foreigner who police declined to
identify, was one of its directors.
	   Police believe that following the killings, the bodies were
taken in a car driven by the two Singaporeans for disposal when the
vehicle was stopped at the roadblock near the junction of Bandar
Muadzam Shah.
	   Malacca police chief Senior Assistant Commissioner I Arthur
Edmonds said today that apart from the probability that the bodies
were taken to Pahang for disposal, police were looking into other
leads as well.
	   A new court order has beeen obtained to remand the two
Singaporeans for 14 days.
	   ``We are also working closely with the Interpol branch of the
Federal police headquarters in Bukit Aman and the Singapore police
to assist us in the probe,'' added Edmonds.

	   THE Malaysian rubber market continued to weaken yesterday, as
trading remained lacklustre on lack of fresh leads.
	   ``Players are noticeably absent from the market awaiting
positive factors to emerge to spur the dull market,'' said a rubber
trader.
	   In addition, the local rubber is facing a stiff price
competition from neigbouring countries such as Thailand which is
offering cheap rubber in the international market, the trader said.

	   CRUDE palm oil (CPO) futures on the Kuala Lumpur Commodity
Exchange (KLCE) extended Thursday's gains due to technical buying
on the continued weak ringgit ahead of the weekend.
	   The market which opened encouragingly, gradually increased in
mid morning on technical buying when the ringgit weakened to 3.9950
against the US dollar.
	   It however, plunged sharply on profit taking in mid afternoon
which capped heavy gains.
	   Meanwhile, crude palm oil physicals finished higher on continued
weakening of the ringgit.
	   June-South surged RM5 to RM2,385 per tonne.

Fired lawyer accuses Woodward mother of submitting phony bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dan Sharp, husband of the lawyer fired by Louise
Woodward, on Monday accused the mother of the British former au
pair of submitting a forged bill for accommodation to a fund for
her defense, Sky TV reported.
	   Sharp, whose British-born wife, Elaine Whitfield Sharp, was
fired by Woodward last week, said a dlrs 15,400 (9,131.50 pound)
bill purportedly for four months accommodation for Sue Woodward at
the Sharp home was phony.
	   ``It is a forgery, and I would note a poor one at that,'' Sharp
said, shown on Sky examining the bill at his home in Marblehead,
Mass., near Boston.
	   ``I don't believe we ever charged her (Sue Woodward) a dime for
anything, but we certainly never charged her dlrs 15,400 for
anything,'' added Sharp.
	   The bill showed charges for accommodating Mrs. Woodward last
year during her daughter's trial in the death of an 8-month-old
baby in the young Briton's care.
	   A jury convicted Louise Woodward last fall of second degree
murder of Matthew Eappen. A judge reduced the verdict to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she had served in
prison since her arrest. She has to stay in Massachusetts while
defense lawyers and prosecutors appeal the verdict.
	   Sky TV said it obtained the accommodation bill from a vicar, the
Rev. Ken Davey, a vicar who runs the Woodward appeal fund in her
home village, Elton, in Cheshire, England.
	   Davey has said the fundwas at dlrs 400,000 (245,000 pounds) in
December, but dropped to about dlrs 80,000 (50,000 pounds) after
paying for the appeal.
	   Sky said lawyers for the Susan Woodward denied the bill was a
fake, and agreed that the amount shown on the bill had been paid to
the Woodward parents in January.
	   Ms. Whitfield Sharp was fired last week after allegedly telling
a trooper who arrested her for drunken driving May 22 that she now
believes Louise Woodward, now 20, is guilty and is having ``a hard
time handling it.'' She denied making the remark.
	   Sky said it spoke to Dan Sharp, also a lawyer, because Ms.
Whitfield Sharp has been advised not to talk to the media. She was
shown in background during the news item examining pictures of the
dead baby's brain.
	   Asked how he could prove the accommodation bill was phony, Dan
Sharp said that, for example, the name ``Elaine Whitfield-Sharp''
was printed on the front, and his wife never used a hyphen in her
name.
	   He said the handwriting on the bill, which was on the Sharps'
office letterhead, was the same as that on a note to his wife that
Susan Woodward had enclosed with a gift.
	   The charges marked the latest step in soured relations between
Louise Woodward and the lawyer who was once a key supporter.
	   A London tabloid, The Mirror, last week reported that Ms.
Whitfield Sharp had said in a taped phone conversation that Louise
Woodward lied to her and negotiated secret book and newspaper deals
about the highly publicized case.
	   Louise Woodward moved out of Ms. Whitfield Sharp's home two
months ago, her lawyers say.

	   OMAR Ahmad, Jamaluddin Rashid and Romainun Zakaria are not big
names. They are not even as glamorous as Ogy Ahmad Daud, Erma
Fatima or Raja Azura.
	   In fact, you may not have heard of Omar, Jamaluddin and
Romainun.
	   That, however, should not deter you from catching Kena Main, the
play they are involved in, that is now showing at Matic in Jalan
Ampang, Kuala Lumpur.
	   The play, written by Khalid Salleh and presented by the Society
of the Blind Malaysia, is about the blind, and since the three are
visually- impaired, you can probably imagine the rest. Really, Kena
Main, which made its debut more than five years ago (and has been
staged by different parties several times) offers a good laugh and
a big dose of humility.
	   It delves into the lives of the visually-impaired, particularly
four people who make their money busking by the roadside and
shopping complexes.
	   Kena Main, in a light-hearted way, shows us life from a
different perspective. The play hinges on their dreams, aspirations
and motivation, which are not really that different from what the
rest of us have.
	   Kena Main also touches on exploitation and under-estimation,
while highlighting that certain ``human spirit'' each of us
possesses.
	   It cautions us about the danger of being too protective about
those whom we think are ``helpless'', while reminding us about
respect (and self- respect).
	   Rest assured, however, that the play does not have that
condescending tone, as shown during its Press preview last
Wednesday.
	   Having ``real people'' playing the roles does have its
advantages. The three unknowns, Omar, Jamaluddin and Romainun, fit
the characters so well.
	   And since the script is well-written, they did not seem to have
that much problem ``fitting in''.
	   In fact, the three simply upstaged everyone, with all the right
timing and clever ad-libbings at all the important junctures.
	   Romainun gave that ``sensitive and cute'' touch to Mona, the
timid blind girl who runs away from home to escape her family who
has been making her feel ``useless and hopeless''.
	   Jamaluddin, on the other hand, triumphed through his
interpretation of the Mr Knowall (with little up there), Daud, a
bongo player who seeks the attention of Mona, who plays the
tambourine in his blind busking troupe.
	   The most juicy character, the street-wise and pragmatic Pie, is
played by Omar brilliantly. During the preview, Omar also ``saved''
the show with his wit several times when there were slight
technical hitches. Khalid, who also directs, is a good anchor to
all the characters in the play, while the other non-blind actor who
shone was Mohamed Rodi Mohamed Nor who played the sly drug-addict
to a T.
	   Other ``incidental'' cast members include Safian Arshad (Jamil)
and Ambang Klasik singer Alina Hassan (Laila).
	   Of course one would wish for a tighter presentation, but when
you have a high level of humour, why complain?

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri - The National Land Council has decided on
guidelines on the sale of Felda land for redevelopment in a bid to
ensure that the interests of both Felda settlers and developers are
protected.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today these
guidelines were important to ensure the price paid for Felda
settlers' land was fair and in tandem with prevailing market
prices.
	   He said among other measures adopted by the council was to have
two- thirds of the settlers' agreement before any approval was
given to sell the land for redevelopment.
	   Settlers will also be discouraged from giving power of attorney
to developers who can use it to the settlers' detriment.
	   Anwar said this after chairing the council's 54th meeting at
Wisma Tanah here.
	   ``I feel this is important as in the past concerns have been
raised about efforts made by developers to coax Felda settlers to
sell their land at very low prices,'' he said.
	   Anwar also said problem would arise when some settlers in a
Felda scheme sold their land while others did not as the developer
only got part of the land required to complete his development.
	   He said the Land and Co-operative Development Ministry would
distribute the guidelines to all Felda settlers to ensure they did
not fall victim to unscrupulous developers.
	   Asked about the position of Malay reserve land, Anwar said the
land and its importance would continue to be defended in line with
the country's Constitution.
	   He said to acquire and replace a piece of Malay reserve land
with an area of the same size but of lower value was unreasonable,
especially in the case of land taken in strategic parts of cities.
	   ``This will adversely affect the Malay ownership of land. The
matter is being studied so that the procedures and regulations are
strengthened.''
	   Anwar said the council stressed the importance of early approval
of State land for agricultural purposes and had received progress
reports from State Governments.
	   ``The level of approvals has been encouraging and the States are
giving their full co-operation to ensure land is developed for
agriculture. We hope the whole machinery is put in motion to reduce
food imports.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Malaysians generally have a low awareness
of matters relating to the law on negligence, which explains the
high rate of road crashes due to carelessness on the part of
motorists.
	   The Chief Justice of the Federal Court, Tun Mohd Eusoff Chin
said this was why the insurance premium for motor vehicles was high
as claims relating to crashes due to negligence ran into millions
yearly.
	   ``About 60 per cent of cases in the civil and magistrate's
courts involve such accidents,'' he said after launching a book
titled Nathan on Negligence today.
	   The author, High Court of Malaya judge Datuk R.K. Nathan, said
there was a need to instil public awareness on negligence law as it
could help reduce traffic accidents, careless driving and even road
rage cases.
	   He said negligence law was about the right of the victims of
negligence cases to get the right compensation, a factor that would
make people more careful in what they did as they become aware of
the claims related to accidents.
	   For example, Nathan said, people would get vehicle insurance if
they have a basic understanding of negligence law as they would
realise in the event of an accident, they would be liable to
charges of negligence and costly lawsuits.
	   In other words, negligence law could become a deterrent that
could stop people from wrongdoing not just in traffic related
cases, but also in professional fields like accountancy and
medicine.
	   The 400-page book, published by the Malaysian Law Journal Sdn
Bhd, was aimed at lawyers dealing in negligence cases.
	   Eusoff described it as an authoritative text that would serve
practitioners, law lecturers and students alike.
	   MLJ editor Zahid Taib described it as a complete source of
reference on Malaysian negligence law.

`Guardian Angel' of Peru's Nazca Lines dead at 95

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Maria Reiche, a German mathematician who spent
more than half a century studying and protecting Peru's enigmatic
Nazca Lines, died Monday of cancer. She was 95.
	   Reiche died at a military hospital in Lima. She had been
diagnosed with ovarian cancer on May 8.
	   Also known as ``the Lady of the Lines,'' Reiche was captivated
by the vastness and solitude the Nazca plains, which cover a
35-mile (60-km) stretch of high desert plain and are Peru's major
tourist attraction after Machu Picchu.
	   ``When I do die, I want to be buried in this fascinating place,
which I love so much,'' she said.
	   Threats to the lines have included vandalism, a government
project to ``reconstruct'' the drawings, acid rain from mining
operations in nearby mountains and even a plan to flood the plains
for agriculture.
	   Reiche fought them all alone.
	   ``This precious thing should be treated like a very fragile
manuscript that is guarded in a special room in a library,'' she
once said.
	   Her death left many Peruvians wondering about the fate of the
lines, which she protected by paying guards with money she earned
from the sale of her book about the drawings.
	   ``Maria Reiche's death saddens all Peruvians, particularly
archaeologists, because, with her, we had the certainty that this
ancient legacy of Peru would be preserved '' said Federico
Kauffmann-Doig, one of Peru's leading archaeologists. ``And now
that she is dead, all this work is in danger.''
	   Afters year of study, Reiche concluded that the designs
represented a giant calendar linked to the movements of the sun,
moon and constellations, which told ancient desert dwellers when to
plant and irrigate crops.
	   The shallow lines were made more than a thousand years ago _
hundreds of years before the Inca empire _ by clearing the stony
surface of the plains and exposing the whitish soil underneath.
	   Thousands of lines, some more than five miles (9 kms) long,
cross the plains straight as arrows and climb distant hills. Others
zigzag or spiral over the desert surface.
	   Scattered among the lines are dozens of figures, including a
hummingbird, monkey, heron, whale, cat with a fish's tail, spider
and flower, ranging from four yards (meters) to 900 feet (300
meters) in length.
	   In 1946, armed with a broom and a rake, Reiche began cleaning
the lines of small rocks and other debris, revealing to the world
their dimensions. She spent weeks at a time on the desert, living
off a meager diet of fruit and nuts and slept under the stars.
	   ``I like solitude,'' she said once. ``As a little girl I used to
close myself up in the dark basement of my house. God kept me
company.''
	   Residents in Nazca, the small town on the edge of the lines, 250
miles (400 kms) south of Lima, initially thought she was ``crazy,''
she liked to recall with a chuckle.
	   In time, they admired her for putting their town on the world
tourist map and bringing in badly needed dollars.
	   Her birthday became an annual event celebrated with street
dances and ceremonies. In 1993, the government honored her with the
Order of the Sun, its highest award.
	   ``The people of Nazca are in mourning. We are all with her,''
Nazca Mayor Luz Torres said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The cost of promoting Malaysia as a tourist
destination in the United States has shot up by 15 per cent since
the currency devaluation.
	   Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Sabbaruddin Chik said
today the cost of putting up billboards and the likes in major
cities in the US like New York, was much more expensive now.
	   However, although the Ministry had to cut down on expenditure,
the budget for promoting tourism overseas would not be affected, he
said.
	   ``Last year between RM40 million and RM50 million was allocated
for promotional efforts.
	   ``We will be spending that same amount this year and next
year,'' he said after meeting with officials from the Kuala Lumpur
and Selangor Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry which are
organising the forthcoming ``Love Malaysia Consumer Fair 1998''.
	   Sabbaruddin said a balance had to be struck between expenditure
cuts and promoting the country overseas which was crucial now.
	   This was so, he said, because tourists from countries using
dollars and sterling pounds found Malaysia a cheap holiday
destination.
	   He said there was a 13 per cent drop in tourist arrivals in 1997
compared to 1996.
	   ``Last year there were 6.2 million tourist arrivals bringing in
RM10.5 billion in tourist receipts compared to 7.1 million tourist
arrivals and RM11.2 billion earned in revenue in 1996,'' he said.
	   Sabbaruddin said there was a marked decrease in the number of
tourists from the top five countries visiting Malaysia every year.
	   On the consumer fair, Sabarruddin said those from the travel
industry promoting their services at the fair should only be
allowed to promote local destinations.
	   Organising chairman Mew Jin Seng said so far the fair had
attracted 320 participants.

MAY BE USED I Pas's domestic cultural policy seems to be driven by a
narrow and exclusivist conception of Malay culture which is shaped
by its own ideological slant. In its claim to represent what it
thinks is the ``true''
	   nature of Malay-Islamic identity, the party has single-handedly
drawn back the cultural and historical boundaries of the Malay
world by hundreds of years.
	   Its condemnation of traditional Malay arts such as Mak Yong and
Wayang Kulit was motivated mainly by a paranoid fear that these art
forms might still be able to beguile and mesmerise ordinary Malays
and turn them back into superstitious pagans and idol-worshippers.
Presumably, Pas would have us believe that any Malay who watches a
Wayang Kulit performance would immediately proceed to the nearest
bomoh and order a magic spell or two, or perhaps stop and worship
the first rock or tree he comes across.
	   In this respect, at least the ideologues of Pas seem to share a
common view with the famous Islamophobe V.S. Naipaul, that the
Malays are essentially a backward and primitive people who are
prone to such neurotic fits all the time.
	   Linked to this is Pas's own over-heated rhetoric of
``purifying'' Islam of all un-Islamic elements which has now turned
into a witch-hunt against all those who continue to cherish the
cosmopolitan and universal elements which make up the diverse and
complex structure of Malay culture and civilisation. Not only does
Pas see fit to condemn performances like Wayang Kulit and Mak Yong
as ``un-Islamic'', it also seems to be suggesting that those who
enjoy such performances are bordering on apostasy as well.
	   The net effect of the campaign to demonise traditional forms of
art and culture, however, is the narrowing of the cultural
frontiers of the Malay world. It leads to a situation where the
only acceptable history and culture of the Malays is that which has
been officially cleared by the ideologues of Pas.
	   Lest it be forgotten, we need to remind ourselves that Malay
history extends backwards for more than a millennium and that the
pre-Islamic elements that existed in the Malay world are as much a
part of Malay identity as the Islamic ones. Our ancient fables,
hikayats, syairs and pantuns are replete with examples of different
cultural influences from practically every part of the world: from
China to India, Persia to Europe.
	   Many of these ideas, concepts and forms were retained even after
the coming of Islam to the Malay world. (Which ranks as one of the
most amazing events in world history considering the manner in
which Islam managed to penetrate into the Malay archipelago with
such ease).
	   Furthermore, much of what has come to us from the Islamic world
is also a result of the interaction between cultures and
civilisations. The Malay- Islamic Hikayat Iskandar D'zulkarnain,
for instance, is fundamentally a Malay version of a Persian epic
which is based on the life of the Macedonian conqueror Alexander
the Great (who, in the Malay version, travelled to the East and
whose descendants decided to buy some real estate in Minangkabau,
Sumatra, and sow the seeds of every royal family in Malaysia
today).
	   These elements remained part and parcel of the Malay identity up
to the beginning of the 20th century: they made up the basic
components of Malay folk tradition and assumed the status of
hallmarks of the Malay identity itself. For hundreds of years, art
forms like Wayang Kulit, Mak Yong, and Dikir Barat were seen as
being both - the Malay and Islamic identity, without any problems
whatsoever.
	   Ironically, the early Malay-Muslim activists and nationalists
who fought for the independence of the Malays were also more
broad-minded than most of the so-called ``Muslim activists'' who
make up the vanguard of Pas today.
	   Dr Burhanuddin al-Helmy, for example, was an individual who was
comfortable with his identity as both a Malay and a Muslim. Being
one of the latter did not entail having to exclude the former for
him. Like many other Muslim activists of his generation, he worked
to create a political environment where the cosmopolitan and
multicultural nature of Malaysian society would be protected and
cherished, and argued against a monolithic and mono-cultural
society.
	   These activists knew that the dynamism and vitality of
Malay-Muslim society could only be maintained if the Malay world
remained open to the flow of ideas and concepts from outside. They
understood that one of the most important factors that ensures the
civilisational dynamics of any society was its willingness to
engage with the Other, both from without as well as from within. It
was a broader, more cosmopolitan and universal Malay-Muslim world
that these early Muslim pioneers were working for.
	   Today the question that needs to be asked is this: How far do
the epistemological, cultural, philosophical and historical
boundaries of the Malay world extend?
	   Do the cultural frontiers of the Malay world extend as far as
Gunung Mahameru and the land of Indraprashtha? Do we still include
among our gallery of epic heroes figures like Iskandar and
Darmawangsa?
	   Or are we going to go the other way and turn our backs on our
complex and multicultural past, with its cacophony of vibrant and
contending voices, its myriad of genealogies and topographies?
	   Will the Malays of today choose to live in a homogeneous world;
a ``microwave'' culture with a history lasting all of 20 seconds
(or maybe slightly more) that begins only with the consolidation of
Islam not too long ago and ends with the monocultural utopia
envisaged by Pas?
	   Like Darmawangsa longing for the day when he and his brothers
would be able to return to Indraprashtha, there are many Malays and
Malaysians who long to return to the vast legacy of history,
literature and art that is Malay in the broadest sense of the word.
They do not fear the loss of their Islamic identity in the process:
Indeed, the encounter with the Other of our past will only
strengthen our awareness of our own identity in the present.
	   The advent of globalisation ought to inspire us to broaden our
horizons rather than retreat to refuge of the coconut shell. For it
is within the narrow and suffocating confines of that coconut shell
that we will find the exclusivist utopia that is the dream of Pas
and the nightmare of others.

	   YESTERDAY was World Environment Day. It is perhaps a good time
for each one of us to ponder upon our personal report cards on how
we have treated Mother Nature, at the very least in the past year.
	   All of us are constantly interacting with the environment. In
the process, we can either make it a better place to live in or
otherwise.
	   Nobody can claim immunity from this.
	   It is a known fact that most of our daily activities have
deleterious effects on the environment. Some are inadvertent,
though.
	   For example, we have no other mode of travel except for
motorcycles and cars. Buses are also extensively used to ferry
passengers. Goods have to be transported via lorries and trucks.
	   Such hustle and bustle of vehicles contributes to pollution in
urban areas.Like it or not, all road users are actually party to
this repulsive phenomenon.
	   Although we cannot avoid polluting the urban air, why not try to
minimise it? The less travel we do, the better.
	   When our vehicles start to emit black smoke, it is time to have
the engine checked and repaired. If we can car-pool, and the crowd
is right, then why not? If the LRT runs along the routes convenient
to us, then we should take it.
	   If any of these is not possible, and you still have to drive
your own car, then practise eco-driving. This is actually a
two-in-one concept, that is driving with economy and ecology in
mind.
	   Thus, you should go easy on the accelerator. Also, do not leave
the car engine idle for too long. Not only would you save fuel, but
also reduce the emission of pollutants into the air.
	   Then, there is refuse. Everyday we consume food, lots of it.
Some indulge in more courageous activities like smoking. The amount
of leftovers, by-products and other forms of garbage that come out
of these rituals are simply mind-boggling. Fortunately, most
Malaysians know how and where to dump these. Sadly, a few do not.
	   How many times have you missed being hit by missiles in the form
of plastic bags and fruit skins thrown out of moving vehicles? And
surely you must have been fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of
the smoker dropping his cigarette butt on the floor and
extinguishing it with a Humphrey Bogart-like twist of the sole?
	   The only problem with this seemingly exquisite scene is that
almost always, our Bogarts never pick up the stubs to put them in
the ashtray or dustbin.
	   It is evident that a portion of the waste material and products
generated by both the public and industry still finds their ways
into our waterways. Despite an extensive media blitz and a ``Love
thy River''
	   campaign, there are those who continue to dump rubbish, toxic
waste and sewage into rivers without the slightest feeling of
guilt.
	   Wastes that are put into rivers are carried downstream. But
there is a limit to the amount of wastes a river can take before it
begins to suffer.
	   A number of our rivers are so heavily polluted that they have
been considered uninhabitable. They do not support any forms of
biological life anymore. They are virtually dead.
	   The apathy towards maintaining a healthy river system by the
litterbugs and polluters may be attributed to the fact that they
consider the river as a mere conduit for transporting rubbish to
the borderless dumping site, otherwise known as the sea.
	   This type of ignorance is contributing to three-quarters of
marine pollution. In addition to the waste, certain areas of coral
reefs are being threatened by silt deposition. The silt normally
originates way upriver where extensive soil erosion takes place due
to indiscriminate and uncontrolled deforestation.
	   The seas and oceans are important components of the global
ecosystem.
	   These huge water systems play a major role in setting our
weather and climate.
	   They also play a vital role in the water-cycle by contributing
to atmospheric moisture that falls back on land to replenish our
freshwater supply.
	   The marine ecosystems are also crucial in maintaining the
desirable proportion of gases in the atmosphere. Marine plants and
bacteria absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen during the
process of photosynthesis.
	   Thus, polluting the marine ecosystems is like choking Earth's
life support system.
	   The seas and oceans are also important for a variety of economic
activities. Among these are fishing, the search for energy and
mineral resources, trade, transport, tourism and recreation. That
is why securing control of the seas and oceans has been the goal of
every nation.
	   In view of the urgency of creating awareness the world over on
the importance of protecting and maintaining sustainable marine
ecosystems, the United Nations has declared 1998 as the
International Year of the Ocean. It is appropriate that the theme
``For Life on Earth: Save our Seas''
	   has been chosen to mark this year's World Environment Day.
	   Some of us who are inland dwellers might feel that we have no
dealings whatsoever with the seas and oceans. But pollutants
released by thousands of smokestacks and millions of vehicles are
carried by winds and dropped over the waters off the coasts.
	   Domestic and industrial waste and sewage flow into rivers and
eventually into the sea. So do excess fertilisers and residues of
pesticides used for agriculture.
	   The bulk of marine sediment is also attributed to man's
overzealous clearing of the forest along the rivers. Therefore, we
cannot underplay our responsibility to save the sea.
	   The environmental-care report card of our generation reveals
that we have not performed well. How could this be? The environment
is not ours.
	   We have merely borrowed it from the future generation.
	   Before we leave this world, we have to return it, intact, to our
children and grandchildren. This is one loan the future generation
cannot afford to write-off.
	   Many of us realise that the greed and apathy of a certain
section of our generation have contributed to the rather sad state
of the environment.
	   And it seems that not much can be done to right this obsession
for quick material gain.
	   If we are unable to honour fully our loan agreement, then
probably some kind of remedial work has to be initiated. While the
good Samaritans among us go on working extremely hard to conserve
and preserve the environment, the rest should also help out in
various ways.
	   A noble gesture that we can easily carry out is instilling the
love for nature in the hearts and minds of our children. We must
equip them with sufficient understanding of the man-nature
interaction. This can be started at a very early age and has to be
done on a continuous basis.
	   Numerous books and magazines on nature are now available in
libraries, information centres and book stores. Newspapers
regularly carry articles on ecology and conservationism. Good
documentaries on the environment are broadcast over television.
	   Best of all though, a first-hand encounter with nature would
undoubtedly put the whole concept of environmental care in the
right perspective in the minds of the youngsters.
	   Parents should take their children to some of the forest
reserves, sanctuaries and marine parks located all over the
country. By doing so, we may be able to minimise the possibility of
having greedy and apathetic individuals among the next generation.
	   Finally, let's not wait another year to review our report cards
on care for the environment. Prophet Muhammad advises Muslims to do
this every evening, just before we tuck ourselves into bed. By
doing so, we could begin to work on improving our grades the very
next morning.

	   ACCEPTED rules of democracy do not require the electorate to be
unquestioningly obedient to every administrative or political
decision that is made. Conversely, it is the elected government
that must respond to the vox populi, especially if this carries
distinct tones of dissent from the majority who want change for the
better. There is nothing abnormal or threatening about this process
within social development, even if the debate does heat up to an
uncomfortable degree for decision- or policy-makers.
	   The past week saw the police rejecting an application by the
Federation of Malaysian Consumers Association to hold a public
forum on the water shortage that has hit parts of the Federal
Territory and Selangor. It was to have brought decision-makers
face-to-face with expectedly irate consumers, for clarification,
feedback and solutions. The meeting was not allowed to be held
because of worries over ``internal security''.
	   That the police should be empowered to preserve public safety
without hindrance is beyond question. This presumes, though, that
intelligence work has uncovered probable cause that can be backed
by irrefutable evidence. What exactly prompted refusal of Fomca's
application, however, has not been made clear.
	   Was there imminent danger to racial or religious harmony if the
forum had been held? Is discussing the issue of water shortage
seditious, slanderous or against the Constitution? If the answers
are ``No'', then the police will have to concede they have been
inflexible this time around.
	   The handling of the application has given rise to the
unfortunate impression that the police acted more in the interests
of a public-service agency, rather than the public.
	   Where services break down to the point of disrupting daily
routines, taxpayers have a right to have their misgivings heard
out. The forum may have answered their needs without being
subversive in intent, or attracting law-breakers. Within a society
striving to attain the ideals of transparency and participatory
governance in a responsible and reasonable manner, all authorities
have to accommodate the fundamental human right of citizens to
freedom of speech.
	   The present system of discretionary approval of permits needs to
be reviewed, to provide space for civil society discourse and
prevent misunderstanding. Where there is reason to believe that an
event may be hijacked by disruptive elements, the evidence must be
presented to the organiser first for a satisfactory explanation. If
none is forthcoming, the police would then have grounds for
rejecting the application.
	   However, where there is no justification for anything other than
caution, the police could set down conditions that hold organisers
accountable for order. As a precaution, security could be stepped
up, using plainclothes personnel, so as not to place the public in
a state of fear or to stifle free participation.
	   A progressive police force would keep pace with a changing
social environment in which complexities and contradictions are
challenges to be met and overcome, not avoided. It would know how
to differentiate between situations that threaten public order and
those in which citizens are staking a claim to well-being. As the
force heads into the next millennium, it should confidently leave
behind the frayed security blanket to which it has clung in past
years of uncertainty and suspicion.

World Cup: Heel bruise keeps South African captain out of training
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ A bruised heel kept South African captain
Lucas Radebe out of Bafana Bafana's first World Cup practice in
France, but coach Philippe Troussier believes the Leeds United
defender will play in Friday's opening match against France.
	   Radebe, who anchors the back line and also can play in the
midfield, got hurt near the end of Saturday's 1-1 draw with Iceland
in South Africa's final World Cup tune-up.
	   After a fast-paced practice Monday evening at Vichy's Omnisports
Complex watched by about 500 people, Troussier said Radebe needed
to rest after the long English season and his South African
commitments.
	   ``He just needs 48 hours,'' Troussier said. ``He's played in
every warmup game and he needs a break.''
	   Team doctor Victor Ramathesele said Radebe's injury had
responded well to treatment so far, but he was unable to guarantee
Radebe would be ready to take on the French in Marseilles on
Friday.
	   ``I'm fairly optimistic,'' Ramathesele said. ``He's certainly
better than he was on Saturday.''
	   During a half-field attacking drill Monday, third-string
goalkeeper Andre Arendse appeared to twist or bruise his left knee
and walked off grimacing.
	   Arendse, of Fulham in England, was the starter when South Africa
won the African Nations Cup in 1996, but was dropped after former
coach Clive Barker resigned in December. He is expected to back up
Hans Vonk and Brian Baloyi at the World Cup.
	   The crowd at the training field applauded as the players
practiced attacking patterns with wide passes and crosses that led
to hard shots on goal.
	   South African players expressed surprise at the enthusiastic
reception received in the central France town, where hundreds of
people welcomed their arrival Sunday night and a crowd of about 60
waited outside the team hotel for autographs Monday afternoon.
	   ``It's like a dream,'' said defender Willem Jackson, who has
played his pro soccer in South Africa. ``I thought maybe it was
going to be quiet, we wouldn't have support or people watching
us.''
	   It is South Africa's first World Cup appearance after being
banned for 28 years from international soccer until 1992 because of
apartheid.

Soyinka: Abacha's death `incredible opportunity' for Nigeria

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dictator Gen. Sani Abacha's death is an
``incredible opportunity'' for Nigeria to return to democracy,
exiled playwright Wole Soyinka said Monday.
	   Soyinka, winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize for literature and an
outspoken opponent of military rule, fled Nigeria in 1994. Abacha's
military regime charged him with treason, a crime punishable by
death.
	   In an interview with reporters in Jerusalem, where he was
lecturing at Hebrew University, Soyinka said Abacha's death was
``an opportunity for Nigerian civic society, an opportunity for the
Nigerian military, and an opportunity for the international
community.''
	   Even while Abacha was still in power, Nigerians were struggling
to restore democracy, Soyinka said.
	   ``The people were sick of military dictatorship,'' he said. ``So
it's up to the military to recognize this _ and up to the
international community to say that we're sick and tired of the
degeneration of a potentially great society.''
	   Soyinka said he did not know whether Nigeria would return
immediately to democracy, or whether there would be a power
struggle within the military to succeed Abacha.
	   ``But there is an opportunity,'' he said.
	   Soyinka said the military should release all political
prisoners, including Mashood Abiola, the apparent winner of
Nigeria's aborted 1993 presidential elections, and name Abiola head
of a transitional national unity government.
	   ``There's only one choice for Nigeria _ that's a democratic
option,'' he said. ``And the structure is there. The
president-elect is waiting.''
	   Until that happens, the international community should increase
pressure and sanctions on the military government, Soyinka said.
	   Asked his personal feelings about Abacha's death, Soyinka said,
``I think he is a very lucky person.''
	   ``If it's a natural death, he got a very graceful exit,'' he
explained. If Abacha had continued flouting the will of the people,
``his end would have been very nasty.
	   ``So if he's really gone, I think Allah was very kind to him,''
he said.
	   Soyinka said he could not wait to return to Nigeria and resume
his life there, but did not know if that would happen soon.
	   ``If the military wants to prolong ... this `hiatus,' that's
OK,'' he said.
	   ``I have no expectations. We set out on this democratic struggle
as a marathon. We didn't delude ourselves it was going to be a
100-yard sprint.''
	   ``The ball is in the court of the military,'' Soyinka added.
``They have an incredible opportunity to bow out gracefully. Let us
pray that they take it.''

	   SHAH ALAM, Fri. - A businessman, who posted bail for his brother
and had part of it forfeited by a magistrate's court, filed a suit
in the High Court today seeking a declaration that the forfeiture
was unlawful.
	   Pua Kok Sang, who filed the suit at the Shah Alam High Court
registry, named the magistrate and the prosecuting officer of the
Kuala Selangor magistrate's court and the Malaysian Government in
his suit.
	   In his statement of claim, Kok Sang said he stood bail for his
brother, Pua Kok Sheong, who was facing a gaming charge at the
Kuala Selangor magistrate's court and had deposited RM12,000 as
bail.
	   Kok Sang said he was not told of his responsibilities as a
bailor by the court when he posted the bail.
	   He said that on March 11, Kok Sheong did not attend his hearing
and an arrest warrant was issued for him (Kok Sheong).
	   Kok Sang said his brother asked him to attend the court at the
next hearing date (April 24) and when he did, the magistrate asked
him why RM10,000 of his bail money should not be forfeited.
	   Kok Sang said the magistrate then ruled that RM10,000 be
forfeited for Kok Sheong's absence. He also increased the bail to
RM60,000.
	   Kok Sang claimed that he was then taken to a lock-up until the
RM10,000 (which was in a bank) was deposited to the court.
	   Kok Sang said that although he was not put in a lock-up, he was
asked to sit near the lock-up for about three hours until a court
staff who had gone for lunch could return and assist him in
depositing the forfeited sum in the court.
	   He said that only after he had deposited the sum was he allowed
to leave.
	   Kok Sang claimed that he was treated like a criminal and was not
allowed to eat, drink or move about without the magistrate's
permission.
	   Kok Sang is also seeking declarations that: his rights were
violated by the defendants by their actions, and, the prosecuting
officer had not carried out his duties in protecting him from being
put under wrongful confinement.
	   Kok Sang is also seeking the return of the RM10,000 with other
damages with interest and costs.

U.S. delegation weighs prospects of business, violence in N.

Ireland

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A business delegation led by
U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley on Monday weighed the
opportunities for American investments in Northern Ireland versus
prospects for renewed street violence here.
	   ``The truth is the whole world is watching what's going on in
Northern Ireland,'' Daley said after introducing executives of 16
top U.S. firms _ including Boeing, Monsanto, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals
and Sara Lee _ to political and business leaders eager to build on
last month's ratification of the Belfast peace agreement.
	   ``The flip side of that is, if something negative happens,
they're still watching,'' Daley said.
	   He emphasized that the potential for street confrontations
between Protestant marchers and Catholic protesters, which have
caused widespread rioting the past two summers, could easily spoil
investors' improving perceptions of this long-unstable territory.
	   Daley envisioned the possibility that executives in coming weeks
could ``go to their boards and their investment committees and say,
`Here's a place we're looking at to locate and make a sizable
investment' _ and someone says, `Gee, I just saw last night on TV
that all hell's breaking loose there.'''
	   During the delegation's visit to Northern Ireland's largest
private employer, Short Brothers PLC, the Canadian-owned aerospace
firm announced it had secured a new parts contract with The Boeing
Co. of Seattle that would produce 350 new jobs.
	   Shorts chairman Ray McNulty said this provided ``a good
illustration of how business between North America and Northern
Ireland benefits everybody.''
	   ``We've been a good supplier to Boeing. The Boeing business in
Shorts today supports about 1,100 jobs. So we all gain. It's the
sort of thing which hopefully will be repeated over and over again
in other industries in other sectors,'' McNulty said.
	   Daley addressed Belfast City Council and met separately with two
politicians who will be crucial if Northern Ireland's new
compromise government is to work: Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams.
	   Trimble's party represents a narrow majority of Northern
Ireland's pro-British Protestants, while Sinn Fein represents a
growing section of the north's Irish Catholic minority.
	   Trimble, predicted to become the head of the new government
after an election June 25, has refused to talk to Adams unless Sinn
Fein's military allies, the outlawed Irish Republican Army, start
disarming first.
	   ``They both shared, in their comments, a sense that a corner has
been turned,'' Daley said of Trimble and Adams. ``Both of them
almost said the same things _ that it's the people out there in the
streets that's driving this change in attitude.''
	   Daley and the business executives travel Tuesday to Northern
Ireland's second-largest city, Londonderry, which already has
several U.S. factories, including Seagate disc drives, Fruit of the
Loom textiles and DuPont chemicals.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister and
Treasurer Winston Peters's three-day visit here beginning June 16
is an indication of the highest level of the country's commitment
to close co-operation between Malaysia and New Zealand.
	   New Zealand High Commissioner to Malaysia Sarah Dennis said
today there were efforts on both sides for the strong and friendly
relations between both nations to grow further for mutual benefit.
``There is a commitment by New Zealand, its businesses and people
to look for new partnerships and this serves to further the
interests of both countries,'' Dennis said at a Press briefing on
the visit. Peters's visit is at the invitation of Deputy Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

	   THE five new Internet service providers awarded their licences
yesterday are expected to start offering their services only from
September onwards.
	   This is due to a number of issues yet to be ironed out,
particularly that of sharing the infrastructure cost for setting up
and operating the Internet gateway.
	   To assist in this process, a Telecommunications Consultative
Committee for Internet Service Provision has been set up, said
Energy, Telecommunications and Post Minister Datuk Leo Moggie
yesterday.
	   After giving out the ISP licences at his Ministry in Kuala
Lumpur, Leo Moggie said the sharing of infrastructure costs was
essential to prevent duplication of resources amongst the
operators.
	   He said a consortium was expected to be formed among the
operators to equally own the Internet gateway - which is now
currently owned by existing operators Mimos Bhd and Telekom
Malaysia Bhd.
	   The five new operators given the ISP licences are Binariang Bhd,
Celcom (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, Mutiara Telecommunications Sdn Bhd,
PrismaNet (M) Sdn Bhd and Time Telecommunications Sdn Bhd.
	   For its Internet gateway, Mimos currently has a T3 line capable
of transmitting 45 Megabits per second as the backbone link,
supplemented by a E1 line (1.5 Mbps) and a T1 line (2.1 Mbps) as a
back-up link.
	   Telekom Malaysia's TMNet service has a T3 line as its backbone,
with a T1 line as back-up.
	   The new ISPs would have to make adjustments to their existing
networks to accommodate the 151X numbering system to offer
discounted call rates to Internet users.

Soyinka: Abacha's death `incredible opportunity' for Nigeria

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dictator Gen. Sani Abacha's death is an
``incredible opportunity'' for Nigeria to return to democracy,
exiled playwright Wole Soyinka said Monday.
	   Soyinka, winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize for literature and an
outspoken opponent of military rule, fled Nigeria in 1994. Abacha's
military regime charged him with treason, a crime punishable by
death.
	   In an interview in Jerusalem, where he was lecturing at Hebrew
University, Soyinka said Abacha's death was ``an opportunity for
Nigerian civic society, an opportunity for the Nigerian military,
and an opportunity for the international community.''
	   Even while Abacha was still in power, Nigerians struggled to
restore democracy, Soyinka said.
	   ``The people were sick of military dictatorship,'' he said. ``So
it's up to the military to recognize this _ and up to the
international community to say that we're sick and tired of the
degeneration of a potentially great society.''
	   Soyinka said he did not know whether Nigeria would return
immediately to democracy, or whether there would be a power
struggle within the military to succeed Abacha.
	   ``But there is an opportunity,'' he said.
	   Soyinka said the military should release all political
prisoners, including Mashood Abiola, the apparent winner of
Nigeria's aborted 1993 presidential elections, and name Abiola head
of a transitional national unity government.
	   ``There's only one choice for Nigeria _ that's a democratic
option,'' he said. ``And the structure is there. The
president-elect is waiting.''
	   Until that happens, the international community should increase
pressure and sanctions on the military government, Soyinka said.
	   Asked his personal feelings about Abacha's death, Soyinka said,
``I think he is a very lucky person.''
	   ``If it's a natural death, he got a very graceful exit,'' he
said. If Abacha had continued flouting the will of the people,
``his end would have been very nasty.
	   Soyinka said he could not wait to return to Nigeria, but did not
know if that would happen soon.
	   ``The ball is in the court of the military,'' he said. ``They
have an incredible opportunity to bow out gracefully. Let us pray
that they take it.''
	   ``If the military wants to prolong ... this `hiatus,' that's
OK,'' he said. ``I have no expectations. We set out on this
democratic struggle as a marathon. We didn't delude ourselves it
was going to be a 100-yard (90-meter) sprint.''

	   PAST experience has shown that a tight monetary policy may not
be good for the country, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad said yesterday.
	   ``I do not necessarily endorse Bank Negara's tight monetary
policy. High interest rates have actually caused the economy to
contract,'' he told reporters at the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah
International Airport on his return from a five-day working visit
to Japan.
	   Dr Mahathir was asked what he thought of the central bank's
policy to maintain high interest rates.
	   He said although some parties felt his statements on the
interest rates differed from that of his deputy, Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim, this was not the case.
	   ``There is no difference between me and Anwar. What he has said
is what I have told you earlier.''
	   Anwar earlier this week said interest rates must remain firm and
their levels ought to be determined by market forces. However, he
noted that the business community felt that the existing rates were
too high.
	   Dr Mahathir said effective interest rates and lending interest
rates were different.
	   ``Interest rates went up to 24 per cent at one time, it was very
high.
	   Subsequently it came down to 15 to 16 per cent, but this was
still very high to us.
	   ``The interest rates fixed by Bank Negara is 11 per cent, which
businessmen here can survive with.
	   ``The problem now is how to reduce the cost of funds of banks.
We are trying to find a solution so that interbank rates do not
affect lending interest rates.''
	   The Prime Minister also said Malaysia would obtain loans
denominated in yen up to the equivalent of US$1 billion (RM3.9
billion) to US$2 billion.
	   He said there would be no more borrowings in US dollars because
the greenback had appreciated very fast.
	   ``If you borrow in US dollars, you are going to be in trouble.
It is better not to do business in US dollars at all if possible,''
he said.
	   Dr Mahathir said the idea of trading in the currency of trading
partners did not receive any objection, especially from Stanley
Fischer, deputy managing director of the International Monetary
Fund.
	   The Prime Minister met Fischer in Tokyo where both attended a
symposium organised by the Institute for International Monetary
Affairs.
	   ``In fact, there is no currency which can claim to be a world
currency,''
	   Dr Mahathir said, adding that Japan was willing to do business
in yen.

	   THE Malay Chamber of Commerce Malaysia, determined to increase
Bumiputera participation in strategic sectors of the economy, is
seeking the assistance of financial institutions to reduce costs of
borrowings for Bumiputera businessmen.
	   Its president, Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli, said financial
institutions could help by having special funds to assist ailing
Bumiputera businesses.
	   He described Bumiputera businessmen as being in a ``serious''
state of affairs with the Chamber receiving numerous complaints
daily.
	   ``With the increase in costs and tight liquidity, it is more
difficult for our businessmen to face the economic slowdown,'' he
said after chairing its exco meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Tajudin said the Government must help the Bumiputera
businessmen.
	   ``We don't want the Bumiputera equity lessened. We want to
ensure our presence at the operational and technical level of
businesses.'' He said the asset management company set up recently
would play an important role in ensuring the Bumiputera strength
was not diluted.
	   ``There is an imbalance in the Bumiputera participation in
various sub sectors like banking, telecommunications, transport,
power, oil and gas as well as pharmaceuticals.
	   ``We'll appoint representatives for the various industries who
will be entrusted with the task of monitoring the situation (in
those industries) regularly.''
	   The Chamber wants to increase the Bumiputera participation in
electric, electronics, land and sea transportation, aerospace,
upstream and downstream petrochemicals, textiles and clothing,
high-technology, agriculture and food products, machines, financial
services, infrastructural, trade and hospitality, wholesale and
retail as well as construction sectors.
	   ``We don't want to only be identified with traditional sectors
like agriculture,'' he added.
	   Commenting on the RM500 million additional boost to the
Bumiputera Entrepreneurs Fund announced yesterday, Tajudin said he
was happy and that any amount rendered to the fund at the earliest
possible time would enable the economy to pick up sooner.
	   An additional RM500 million will be allocated to the fund to
enable more Bumiputera businessmen to restore their businesses
after being hit by the economic downturn, Deputy Prime Minister
Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said yesterday.
	   The Bumiputera Entrepreneurs Fund was set up in 1989 and as at
January last year had RM750 million.

Jewish settlers move into Arab neighborhood; Palestinians protest

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In what Palestinians called a fresh threat to
the already tattered peace process, Jewish settlers took over a
pair of buildings in Arab east Jerusalem on Monday, clashing with
Palestinians as they did so.
	   At least two people were hurt in the melee, including Faisal
Husseini, the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem, who was
slightly injured when he was hit in the head by a rock.
	   The clash in the Silwan neighborhood was the latest in an
escalating series of confrontations in Jerusalem's eastern sector.
Each side accuses the other of trying to grab land in the bitterly
contested city.
	   Moving in before dawn, the settlers took over five apartments in
two buildings, plus a plot of land. They trucked in furniture,
strung barbed wire, and hung Israeli flags.
	   ``I see things getting worse,'' said Husseini, who has called
for mass street protests by Palestinians to block such settlement
activity. ``This provocation is pushing the situation to the edge
of disaster.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
United States hoped the dispute could be resolved peacefully.
	   ``We're looking into the incidents, but let me say this: We call
on both sides to exercise maximum restraint, both in their actions
and their rhetoric, especially when it comes to issues as sensitive
as Jerusalem,'' Rubin told reporters.

Newly elected Greek Archbishop says his life was threatened
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Archbishop Christodoulos, leader of the
Greek Orthodox Church, on Monday revealed he had received anonymous
calls threatening his life, media reports said.
	   Following implications he made during a church service in the
port city of Piraeus that his life was in danger, the archbishop
told reporters that the archdiocese in Athens last week received
several anonymous threatening telephone calls, local media said. He
gave no further details.
	   Elected to the position on April 28 after the death of
conservative Archbishop Seraphim, Christodoulos was initially
considered a forward-looking reformer. But he quickly provoked
controversy by making statements many considered to indicate his
intention to meddle in politics.
	   ``There is no reason for anyone to worry. I am not aiming to
become a prime minister nor a statesman,'' he said during Monday's
service. ``Those governing (the country) can sleep easy.''
	   Raising his voice above the thunderous applause of his
congregation, he dismissed his critics as being ``people who don't
know the Church, who are far away from the Church.''
	   Shortly after his election, the government reacted angrily when
Christodoulos criticized its cornerstone policy of joining Europe's
Economic and Monetary Union. The archbishop warned that attempts to
make Greeks more European would lead to ``perdition and
destruction.''
	   Last week, he criticized Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos
for meeting with leaders of the Old Calender Orthodox, a Christian
religious order considered to be heretical by the Church of Greece.
	   Stephanopoulos is president of all Greeks, the government
retorted.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian strongman Gen. Sani Abacha died
Monday of a heart attack at age 54, ending the latest in a long
string of military dictatorships in his oil-rich but impoverished
country.
	   A uniformed officer stood before the State House in the capital,
Abuja, to make the announcement. Martial music filled the
state-controlled radio airwaves to officially mark his death.
Unofficially, his myriad critics and opponents poured into the
streets of Lagos to celebrate. Top officials convened an emergency
meeting.
	   In life, Abacha offered little indication of who might take his
place, wielding absolute power in Africa's most populous nation
ever since canceling presidential er for the capital territory of Abuja.
	   Word of Abacha's death came after soldiers sealed off his home
and office in Abuja. Only the top military brass were permitted to
enter the secluded leader's compound.
	   In keeping with Muslim practice, he was buried in his hometown
of Kano, near the border with Niger, before sundown on Monday,
Radio Lagos reported.
	   The military has long justified its seizing power by saying that
strong central rule is crucial in Nigeria, where rival ethnic
groups have often turned to violence in order to assert power over
one another.
	   Abacha was a pariah abroad for his repressive policies,
including the 1995 hanging of playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
other activists despite worldwide appeals for mercy. The men were
convicted on conspiracy-murder charges that critics called
trumped-up.
	   And he was a recluse at home, rarely venturing far afield,
always wearing dark glasses and never granting news media
interviews.
	   Although he pledged to hand the government over to an elected
civilian administration, in April Abacha became the only nominated
candidate for the presidency.
	   Opposition to his rule has been mounting in recent months with
the prospect that his junta might not honor its pledge to stand
down.

	   DECANI, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Scenes of devastation reminiscent of
wartime Bosnia confronted diplomats escorted into battle-torn
western Kosovo _ target of a Serb offensive that prompted new
international sanctions Monday against Serbia.
	   Besides burned-out houses and deserted villages, whose forced
evacuation have provoked comparisons to ethnic cleansing, visitors
to the besieged zone saw evidence of fierce fighting between the
Serbs and ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   Along with continued clashes and shelling Monday, the first-hand
look at the devastation provides stark evidence of a fast-worsening
scenario that Western powers fear could turn into a broader Balkan
war.
	   ``What we've seen is all sorrow, all grief... all those villages
burned and destroyed, all the people had left,'' said Dutch
ambassador Jan Sizoo.
	   Sizoo was in the first group of foreign diplomats to visit the
Decani region of western Kosovo, on Sunday, since Serb police and
army forces began a punishing offensive there in late May.
	   The destruction in the southern Serb province has increased
foreign pressure on Serbia to stop using its police and army
against militants battling for independence for Kosovo's 9-to-1
ethnic Albanian majority. Tens of thousands of villagers have fled.
	   The European Union tightened sanctions against Belgrade on
Monday _ banning new investments in Serbia and freezing its assets
abroad _ and urged NATO to consider military intervention.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
United States has not ruled out military options and is likely to
reimpose sanctions on Yugoslavia soon.
	   A prominent Kosovo Albanian, Nekibe Kelmendi, welcomed the new
sanctions but said they were only a ``small step'' compared to the
situation on the ground.
	   Serb forces on Monday pounded seven southwestern villages near
the Albanian border with artillery, helicopters and artillery,
according to the Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic
Albanian leadership.
	   Its Serb counterpart, meanwhile _ the pro-Serb Media Center _
said a Yugoslav army soldier was killed in an attack by militants
west of Djakovica near the Albanian border. It also said ethnic
Albanian militants attacked two Serb villages in the Drenica
region.

	   LANGKAWI, Fri - The State Government will study proposals to
limit the number of visitors to the Pulau Payar marine park to
prevent destruction to its rich marine life, Menteri Besar Tan Sri
Sanusi Junid said.
	   He said if the marine ecology of the island was being affected
by the increasing number of visitors, then measures would be taken
to preserve the park.
	   The park is the only one of the 38 in the country located in the
Straits of Malacca. The others are in the South China Sea.
	   Sanusi said the Government would also look into imposing a levy
on visitors ``but the amount should not be too high''.
	   He said this after presenting Amanah Saham Kedah dividends to
104 people under the Hardcore Poor Development Programme today.
	   The authorities had also been looking to impose a levy on
visitors to another of Langkawi's attraction, Pulau Singa Besar.
	   However, the process, including privatisation of the island, has
taken quite some time to study, Sanusi said.
	   During a talk here on the Langkawi Marine Environment last week,
Universiti Sains Malaysia marine scientist Associate Prof Dr
Zulfigar Yasin proposed a limit on the number of visitors to Pulau
Payar to prevent further destruction of its aquatic life.
	   He had urged the authorities to also consider closing the island
to visitors for a short period during the spawning season of the
marine life.
	   Pulau Payar with its crystal clear waters is about an hour's
boat ride from here and is a popular attraction for tourists.
	   Last year more than 100,000 tourists, mostly foreigners visited
the island compared to a mere 13 in 1988.
	   Dr Zulfigar had said that researchers and divers who five years
ago scoured the rich marine life, including many endangered
species, had since noted the damage.
	   He had also said the short stretch of white sandy beach and
pristine waters should not be made a mere picnic destination.
	   He cautioned that the island could face competition from the
Thai islands of Taratau and Adang which also have a rich marine
life.

	   THE late Tan Sri Abu Bakar Samad Mohd Noor came from an era
where the civil service was much respected, and as a civil servant,
he was held in high esteem.
	   Although he went on to a career in the private sector after
retirement, many remember him for a resolute devotion to principles
and duty, traits which marked his civil service career which began
during the British era.
	   Abu Bakar died on May 26 after a short illness, surrounded by
his wife Puan Sri Salmah Idrose, son Abdul Razak and six daughters
- Zainun, Zainariah, Noreen, Maria, Nazlee and Marina.
	   Speaking on behalf of the family, Marina said, ``he managed a
smile until the end''.
	   Abu Bakar began his service as a Malay Officer, briefly under
the Japanese administration. After the war, under the British
administration, he was re-appointed a Malay Officer and was posted
in various towns.
	   He was sent to Trinity College, Cambridge for the overseas
service course, after which he returned to Malaya which had just
gained independence.
	   He joined the Federal establishment and then the Ministry of
Home Affairs. He went on to be the controller of supplies and
budget in the Treasury, rising to be the Finance Ministry's deputy
secretary-general.
	   In 1969, Abu Bakar moved on to the Defence Ministry where he
stayed until his retirement in 1977 as the secretary-general.
	   In this capacity, he had many achievements including the
founding of the Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera, and a pension
scheme for retired soldiers and benefits for widows and families of
soldiers.
	   His dutybound nature is clearly remembered by a close friend,
Tan Sri Sheikh Hussein Sheikh Mohamed who was also in the civil
service.
	   ``He held very strong views that public service should remain
neutral from politics. He was strong enough to give his advice
freely to Ministers, whether an Englishman or Malaysian,'' Sheikh
Hussein said.
	   Far from fading away after retirement, Abu Bakar was invited to
join the boards of several companies, to lend his expertise and
experience.
	   At various times, he was with Boustead Holdings Berhad, Tenaga
Kimia, Malaysian Explosives, RHB Berhad, Asia Insurance, Alpha
Laval, Bestobel, Federal Auto Holdings and Ericsson group of
companies.
	   It was his close ties with the Swedish companies that won him
the Royal Order of the Northern Star, awarded by King Carl Gustaf
of Sweden in 1987.
	   He was only the second Malaysian to receive the award after
former Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sri Ghazalie Shafie.
	   Abu Bakar was honoured for his outstanding contribution in
promoting Swedish-Malaysian relations. He was then chairman of the
Malaysian-Swedish Business Association and had worked with Swedish
authorities for 15 years.
	   Like many of the elite community at that time, Abu Bakar had his
early education at Victoria Institution and Kolej Melayu Kuala
Kangsar. He then furthered his education at Raffles College in
Singapore.
	   Despite his ``upperclass upbringing'' which gave him what some
described as an ``aristocratic bearing'', he was always
down-to-earth, said his old friend Michael Loh.
	   Loh, who insisted that they were worlds apart in social status,
said Abu Bakar never let this got in the way of friendship.
	   ``He had no airs about himself,'' said Loh, who first knew Abu
Bakar at the age of 19.
	   Marina said Abu Bakar's gregarious nature had brought people
from all walks of life, and all races, into their home.
	   He was ``cosmopolitan'', agreed Sheikh Hussein.
	   Like many of his era, Abu Bakar was broadminded about other
cultures including those now deemed as ``western''.
	   He enjoyed ballroom dancing, a love which he shared with his
wife and four of his daughters, and golf. His love for golf was
well-known and in his younger days, he was a single handicapper.
	   Marina said in golf, ``he was pedantic on the rules and
etiquette''.
	   The family remembers him most for his caring nature, which
extended to animals - 17 cats, three dogs, one monkey and one
squirrel, all strays, at one point, added Marina.
	   His philosophy in life, she said, was humility and generosity.
	   ``Two weeks before he died, he reminded us: `To err is human, to
forgive, divine'.''

	   A city councilor lambasted city administration officials
yesterday for chronic corruption and collusion practices as the
reason behind the huge amount of money missing from the city
budget.
	   Djafar Badjeber, head of Commission B for economic affairs, said
many officials from the lowest to the highest ranks were involved
in the malfeasance mainly due to the absence of control and
supervision.
	   ``There are actually some mechanisms of control and supervision
for officials and their performance, but none of them work
properly,'' he said.
	   He declined to give an exact figure for losses in the
administration's budget, but some media claimed last week that it
reached about 35 percent a year.
	   ``I don't know the exact amount but I think it might just be
more or less the same. But I'm not surprised. This country has
always been labeled the most corrupt country in the world,
anyway,'' he said.
	   He said the administration always defended itself from public
criticism and vowed to fix officials' performance, but no action
had ever been taken.
	   ``It is hardly a secret that until now some administration
officials still collect illegal fees, mark up the value of the
projects they handle or receive bribes,'' he said.
	   Many errant officials have taken advantage of the budget by
marking up the value of the projects managed by their departments,
he said.
	   The markup of projects not only led to improper construction,
but also to low quality infrastructure and public facilities, he
added.
	   ``Developers certainly downgrade the quality of their projects
because they lack the funds to meet all the demanded
specifications, as part of the money would be given to officials in
the first place,'' said Djafar.
	   Meanwhile, Deputy Governor of Finance Harun Al Rasyid defended
his personnel, saying the councilor should not make such
accusations until after a thorough investigation had been
conducted.
	   ``Leakage and malfeasance in the budget or revenue can't just be
seen with bare eyes. They must be proven. We can't just accuse,''
he said Friday.
	   Harun instead said leakages in the budget or city revenue could
just as easily be committed by the administration's business
partners who deliberately marked down a project's value or did not
pay the proper taxes and levies.
	   ``Maybe it's just their way to gain more profit,'' he said.
	   Harun admitted that the administration had a problem with
inefficiency.
	   ``It certainly exists here. Well, we're only human. But I think
we have to reactivate the internal supervision to help reduce
inefficiency,'' said Harun.
	   According to Djafar, the administration should change its
payment system if it wants to reduce leakage and malfeasance.
	   The current system requires the public to pay fees or levies for
services from the administration directly to officials at related
departments.
	   ``The current payment system really gives some errant officials
a chance to be easily involved in corruption or collusion,'' said
Djafar.
	   He said all payments should be made through an administration
fund account at city-owned Bank DKI.
	   The administration should also establish an independent board to
audit its assets and then control the utilization of the assets in
its activities or projects, he added.
	   ``The purpose is to make sure the administration earns a
profit,'' said Djafar. (cst)

Diplomats ordered to vacate official residences in Minsk

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus is trying to evict 22 ambassadors
from their homes in violation of international law and tried Monday
to weld shut a gate to the American residence, U.S. Ambassador
Daniel Speckhard said.
	   The Belarusian government served notice in April that it wanted
to overhaul water and sewage pipes in the diplomatic complex on the
outskirts of the capital, Minsk, where the ambassadors live with
their families, Speckhard said at a news conference.
	   Residents of the compound protested, saying they would prefer to
make arrangements to remain in the compound during the repairs,
Speckhard said.
	   Under international law, ambassadors' residences are considered
foreign territory and governments have no right to enter without
permission or insist that diplomats leave.
	   Speckhard took reporters to his home in the diplomatic complex
at Drozdy and arrived to find a team of workers and a policeman
trying to weld shut the side gate. A small American flag was lying
on the ground. The workers left when Speckhard protested.
	   Speckhard called the incident the most serious violation of the
Vienna Convention on embassy operations since the end of the Cold
War.
	   ``To lock ambassadors into their residences and weld their door
shut is not becoming to the dignity of your country,'' Speckhard
told Belarusian reporters.
	   Speckhard said that he doesn't doubt that some repairs are
needed on the pipes leading to the complex, built after World War
II to house the Communist Party elite. But he insisted that the
government must reach agreements with the foreign missions and
cannot simply evict them.
	   He said the United States has had a lease on the residence since
1992, the year after Belarus gained independence with the collapse
of the Soviet Union, and has spent dlrs 800,000 on repairs. The
lease does not expire until 2001.
	   If the government forcibly evicts the ambassadors, it would be
the first violation of the Vienna Convention since Iranian
militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, an embassy
spokeswoman said.
	   Speckhard said he and a number of other ambassadors are refusing
to vacate the compound, and appealed to President Alexander
Lukashenko to rescind the order.
	   ``I am hopeful that this press conference today will help to
inform the president of the situation in case he has not been
receiving the right information from his bureaucracy,'' Speckhard
said.
	   The Belarusian Foreign Ministry offered the ambassadors small
apartments elsewhere in the city, an offer that embassy officials
said was unacceptable.

	   Soeharto once told B.J. Habibie that it was lonely at the top.
The former president who turns 77 today may be finding life can be
even lonelier at the bottom.
	   Less than a month ago, 202 million Indonesian people called him
president, but now only his trained parrot at home -- screeching
``Good morning Bapak president'' -- does.
	   For the first time in 32 years, Soeharto greets his birthday in
a totally different atmosphere.
	   Many people, from tycoons to Cabinet ministers and other people
with vested interests, often ignored Soeharto's often-voiced
complaint that he preferred to celebrate his birthday with only his
six children, 12 grandchildren and one great-grandchild at his
private residence on Jl. Cendana, Central Jakarta.
	   But some people found one way or another to be around when the
Soeharto clan gathered for his birthday celebration.
	   Now, ``Since he quit as president on May 21, only a few people
still sincerely want to meet him. It's because closeness to Pak
Harto, which often meant rewarding careers or lucrative business
deals in the past, has become a headache in this reform era,''
complained an official, who has worked with Soeharto since the
1970s, Saturday.
	   Since Soeharto's retirement, the former first family has faced
mounting pressure to hand over its wealth to the state. Some
opposition figures have demanded that Soeharto be tried for alleged
abuses of power.
	   Soeharto now spends most of his time at home, reading newspapers
and watching TV. Palace officials claim he is very healthy and
relaxed as he is able to spend more time with his grandchildren.
	   But he is also disappointed over charges that he amassed his
wealth illegally. He plans to hold a news conference tomorrow to
counter the allegations.
	   Presidential security guards, including adjutants with the rank
of colonel, still work for him around the clock, although their
number will be gradually reduced.
	   ``However, as he is no longer president, they do not give him a
military salute anymore. But Bapak is very happy with his new
status as an ordinary citizen,'' said an official.
	   As a president, Soeharto was exempt from traffic regulations.
His driver once joked that he missed Jakarta's traffic jams.
	   ``But now, his car has to stop at red lights,'' said the
official.
	   Soeharto performed his last official duty as president of a
foreign country in May, when he visited Egypt. President Hosni
Mubarak acted the perfect host to Soeharto, and saw him off on May
14 at Cairo airport.
	   When Soeharto replaced Sukarno in 1967, the country's economy
was on the brink of bankruptcy and prices were skyrocketing. He led
the nation to a better economy, where the gross national product
(GNP) was more than US$1,100 up to July last year.
	   But he stepped down when the economy was dying.
	   ``Our GNP now is no more than $300,'' said chairman of
Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Aburizal Bakrie on
Friday. (prb)

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - About 350 participants in 100 vehicles will
be off ``In Search of the Perak Man'' - the theme of the National
Press Club-Lovan Treasure Hunt '98 on June 20.
	   In addition to top prizes, which include trips to Cairo and
Cebu, the Philippines, courtesy of Malaysia Airlines, participants
can also look forward to prizes in the numerous categories created
to make the event more enjoyable.
	   There are at least 10 categories, like the Most Sporting Team;
Most Adventurous Team; Deep Fried Team; Most Creative Team; Most
Innovative Team and the Most Organised Team.
	   Meal, entertainment, petrol vouchers and prizes aside, the
winning teams in each category will also walk away with Caltex
Havoline Formula 3 Motor Oil and brake fluid.
	   Caltex Malaysia managing director Robert J. Gregory today handed
over the company's sponsorship of 60 packs of four-litre
lubricants, 72 packs of brake fluid and 144 packs of battery water
to NPC president, Zainon Ahmad, at the NPC, Jalan Tangsi. Also
present was Caltex marketing director Khoo Thian Choe.
	   ``The treasure hunt gives the participants an opportunity to
explore places of archaeological interest,'' Gregory said, adding
it also helped build camaraderie among members of the Press.
	   Response towards the treasure hunt has been overwhelming with
the organisers having to turn down numerous entries.
	   ``We acheieved our target of 100 cars even before the closing
date of May 29,'' Zainon said.
	   The hunt will start at 7.30am at the Museum Negara carpark and
will finish at the Orient Star Lumut, Lumut, for an overnight stay
and prize presentation.
	   The hunt's main sponsor is Lovan Industries, a Penang-based
manufacturer of high quality hi-fi audio visual racks. In addition
to the RM70 Caltex petrol vouchers, the company is also giving 100
AV hi-fi racks. Bee Leong Industries is giving 200 vouchers
redeemable for its three ranges of knitwear - Rediscover, No Age
and Dinos.
	   Zaman Manufacturers is sponsoring an assortment of 200 export
quality travelling and sports bags while A. Clouet &AMP; Co (KL) Sdn
Bhd, distributor of Ayam Brand products, is providing sandwich
breakfast. Nestle is providing hot nescafe and cold Milo drinks.
	   Other sponsors to date include KTM Berhad, Mayban Finance;
Metroplex Holdings; Royal Selangor; Sunway Lagoon; Gillette
Malaysia; Maybank; KFC and Carlsberg.
	   Hawk Rent-A-Car Sdn Bhd is providing transport for all officials
involved in the treasure hunt.
	   Participants who have yet to be notified of their competition
numbers are urged to contact NPC secretaries at 03-7198195.

	   The government's decision last week to eliminate press bans has
caused a surge in public expectations over the roles the media
should play in society.
	   Communications expert M. Budyatna and political commentator
Wimar Witoelar, interviewed separately Saturday and yesterday,
agreed the newfound freedom meant the media would have to be
managed even more professionally, and that it should facilitate
even further reform.
	   Budhyatna, a professor at the University of Indonesia, said the
media must keep their feet firmly planted on the ground following
the revocation of the controversial regulation that allowed the
government to nullify the licenses of publications.
	   ``The press must be even more responsible in their reports and
should no longer give readers inaccurate stories,'' said the former
dean of the university's school of social and political sciences.
	   He said now was the time for the Indonesian press to provide
better quality reporting and join the campaign to improve human
resources.
	   He also said the press should uphold the principles of
integrity, impartiality, independence and neutrality.
	   ``The press should never voice the interests of certain
parties,'' Budhyatna said.
	   Criticism must be accompanied by propositions, paving the way
for ``solution journalism'', he said.
	   Meanwhile, Wimar Witoelar said he now expected the press to lead
the people another step toward reform. The famed television talk
show host, known for his in-depth interviews with prominent
individuals, said the campaign for reform was now ``stuck'', halted
in the middle of nowhere.
	   ``The press, given its integrity and access to diverse kinds of
sources, is the most prepared social institution to represent the
public campaign for reform,'' he told the Post yesterday.
	   Wimar said the press should become ``a transparent and neutral
clearing house, a discourse center'' where the public could expect
it to exercise social control over the government on behalf of the
people.
	   He said the press should campaign for an ``immediate''
extraordinary session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
in order to ``get back the people's sovereignty from President B.J.
Habibie''.
	   ``What Habibie has now is not the people's mandate, but (former
president) Soeharto's mandate,'' he said, adding that the press'
nature of being part of people's daily lives gave it the role to
campaign for the cause.
	   According to Wimar, it is the press which can help bring back
the momentum of reform ``that was lost'' when the public fell into
euphoria following the downfall of Soeharto.
	   Wimar said the ``legitimacy crisis'' of Habibie's government
could only be cured through an MPR extraordinary session, otherwise
the crisis of confidence in the government would cause the
country's economic crisis to worsen even further. (byg/aan)

	   Q: I HAVE always enjoyed your column and I would appreciate
recipes for a Moist Banana Cake and a Moist Carrot Cake without any
sort of nuts in them as my daughter doesn't like cakes with nuts.
	   A: YOU can generally omit the nuts from banana or carrot cake
recipes if the amount stated is insignificant. However, you will
have to reduce baking time to turn out a moist cake.
	   Here's a great recipe for a simple banana cake which is moist
and loaded with bananas. Use very ripe bananas and mash them well.
I prefer pisang rastali for this recipe.
	   BANANA CAKE Sifted ingredients (combined): 250g self-raising
flour 1 tsp baking powder 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 1/4 tsp salt
240g caster sugar 250g cold margarine, diced Banana Mixture
(combined) 1/3 cup milk 1 cup well-mashed ripe bananas 1 tsp
vanilla essence 2 large eggs Method Line a 23cm square cake pan
with greased baking paper.
	   Put sifted dry ingredients into bowl of a food processor
together with salt and caster sugar. Whizz for a few records to
combine mixture. Add margarine and process until mixture turns
crumbly. Beat in combined milk and banana mixture.
	   Pour into prepared pan and bake in moderately hot oven 190
degrees Celsius for 25-30 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the
centre of the cake comes out clean.
	   Cool cake in the tin for 15 minutes before turning it out onto a
wire rack to cool completely.

World Cup: Arsenal's Wenger visits to root for Japanese team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Now that the Japanese have made it
to the World Cup, some of their players may soon be signing with a
European league club _ perhaps with London's Arsenal.
	   Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger said Monday the idea wasn't
far-fetched. He would like to see Japanese play on European teams,
including his own team, although he refused to say which players he
was especially interested in.
	   ``Like Japanese baseball players who have gone to the United
States and were a success. Why should not Japanese football players
come to Europe and be a success?'' Wenger said while visiting the
team as a guest of the resort town of Aix-Les-Bains, Japan's
training camp during the tournament.
	   ``The Japanese team has qualities that are superior to the South
American and European teams. They have quick reaction and tight
teamwork. But they are weak against direct contact.''
	   Wenger, who led the Gunners to their first league title since
1991 in the season just ended, has long been a friend to Japanese
soccer, having coached J-League Nagoya Grampus three seasons ago
before signing on with Arsenal in 1996.
	   But the Frenchman, now one of the most popular coaches in
England, said he didn't come to give the Japanese any advice, just
to cheer them on.
	   Still, Wenger watched the team practice and was deluged with
questions from Japanese reporters at a news conference at the town
hall. He was also scheduled to meet with Japanese coach Takeshi
Okada.
	   Wenger acknowledged he was disappointed more players from his
old J-League club weren't chosen for the national team. The only
Grampus player on the team is 23-year-old midfielder Takashi
Hirano.
	   ``I thought Ogura had a good chance, but he's injured,'' he said
of Grampus striker Takafumi Ogura.
	   Wenger had praise for Japanese players, including midfielder
Hidetoshi Nakata, whom he described as ``a world-class player,'' as
well as 18-year-old Shinji Ono and goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi.
	   But he also had a warning for Japanese fans: Don't expect too
much at the first World Cup.
	   ``That's dangerous,'' he said.

	   Hundreds of leaders of the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) have agreed to
set up a political party -- 14 years after Indonesia's largest
Islamic organization shunned politics.
	   The scholars gathered at the Raudhatul Thalibien pesantren
(boarding school) in Central Java town of Rembang on Saturday to
discuss their stance following the opening of political corridors
that enables individuals and organizations to set up their own
political parties.
	   Attending were, among others, Cholil Bisri, Syukron Makmun and
Matori Abdul Jalil from Jakarta; Attabik Ali from Yogyakarta; Yusuf
Muhammad from Jember, East Java; Rawasid As'ad from Situbondo, East
Java; and Aziz Mashuri from Jombang, also East Java.
	   NU was established in 1926 as a socioreligious organization.
Prior to 1984, NU was involved in politics, first as a political
organization and later as a faction within the United Development
Party (PPP) which was a fusion of several Moslem parties.
	   In 1984, it broke away from PPP out of disappointment over party
executives' policies and vowed it would shun politics.
	   Recently, some NU figures flirted with the notion of
establishing a political party, which was neither discouraged nor
encouraged by the executive board. Chairman Abdurrahman Wahid,
however, insisted that NU members await the board's directives on
the issue.
	   Cholil, also a member of the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR), said the time had come for the NU to again play a role in
the national political arena.
	   The Indonesian Women's Party (PP), the Indonesian Workers Party
(PPI), the Musyawarah Kekeluargaan Gotong Royong (MKGR), the
Chinese-Indonesians for Reform Party (Parti) are several political
parties that have been established recently.
	   The NU leaders and scholars also agreed to assemble again in
Jakarta on Aug. 17, to officially form the new party.
	   Existing laws say only the dominant Golkar, PPP and the
Christian-nationalist alliance Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)
are allowed to contest general elections. President B.J. Habibie's
government is preparing a draft to amend the laws and enable more
parties to participate in polls.
	   PDI
	   Meanwhile, several local PDI chapters in Deli Serdang, North
Sumatra, and in Lampung declared Saturday their support for ousted
PDI leader Megawati Soekarnoputri. They called on her rival
Soerjadi, who with government support ousted Megawati in 1996, to
step down and let her lead the party to win the next elections.
	   The Deli Serdang PDI chapter issued a statement, signed by 11
activists in Lubuk Pakam on Saturday, calling on Soerjadi's
executive board to stand down and voluntarily hand over leadership
to Megawati.
	   The chapter also urged Megawati to replace members of PDI
factions in the House of Representatives (DPR) and MPR who obtained
their seats through alleged practice of collusion and nepotism.
	   Activist Effendy Manulang said PDI secretary-general Buttu
Hutapea, House Deputy Speaker Fatimah Achmad and Panangian Siregar,
now minister of environment, should be dismissed from the
legislative body because they did not win the minimum votes
required in last year's elections.
	   ``They are representing not PDI members but the computer used to
manipulate the number of PDI votes in North Sumatra in the last
general election,'' he said.
	   A number of PDI activists and sympathizers in Lampung also
declared support for Megawati's leadership and urged PDI chapters
in the provinces and others to follow suit. (har/21/rms)

	   Former minister of sports and youth affairs Hayono Isman has
named former vice president Try Sutrisno, Yogyakarta's Sri Sultan
Hamengkubuwono X and former minister of defense Edi Sudrajat as
potential candidates to replace incumbent Harmoko as Golkar chief
at an extraordinary congress next month.
	   ``I see them as the most suitable choices and have the best
chance to lead Golkar in the future,'' said Hayono, who is an
official of Kosgoro, one of the founding organizations of the
Golkar grouping.
	   Speaking in Yogyakarta Saturday, he stressed it would be
inappropriate if present cabinet members were nominated to lead the
dominant faction.
	   He underlined a need to erase perceptions of any collusion
between those working in the government and the grouping.
	   Facing mounting dissension and calls for chairman Harmoko to
step down, Golkar executives last week decided to hold an
extraordinary congress in July, two months ahead of the five-yearly
congress scheduled for October.
	   The congress is expected to decide whether to choose new
leadership and discuss if it is still necessary to maintain the
board of patrons and board of advisors.
	   Former president Soeharto is Golkar's patron and its leaders
include his daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana.
	   With the current wave of reform sweeping the country and
political parties allowed to be formed almost at will, Golkar has
seen its solid unity slowly crumbling with traditional allies
breaking ranks.
	   Musyawarah Kekeluargaan Gotong Royong (MKGR) severed its
allegiance to Golkar last week and established itself as an
independent political party. Some members now campaigned for
chairwoman Mien Sugandhi to resign in order to save the
organization.
	   Kosgoro, the business wing of Golkar, hinted that it too was
considering a similar move.
	   Hayono encouraged the regional chapters of Golkar to run the
extraordinary congress and simply let the central board organize
it.
	   He argued it would be ``unethical'' for the central board to
arrange the running of the meeting since the aim of the congress
was to censure the chairman.
	   Such an arrangement, Hayono remarked, indicates that the central
board was still trying to retain power while reality showed they
were unpopular.
	   Hayono hoped the congress could help revive Golkar's image to
the voting public.
	   ``I hope that Golkar's image will improve after the
extraordinary congress because it is meant as a correction (of the
past leadership),'' he said as quoted by Antara.
	   Nevertheless, he admitted being skeptical on whether it could
help swing voters in Golkar's favor in the coming election.
	   ``Even with the extraordinary congress, Golkar will be lucky to
get 30 percent of the votes in the next polls,'' he remarked. (mds)

	   SEREMBAN Views (NST, May 11) had much to say on uncollected
rubbish and dirty drains being in need of urgent attention by the
authorities.
	   It baffles me. How can ratepayers assist in keeping the
environment clean and tidy if necessary facilities and pro-active
action is lacking from the authorities.
	   As they say, it takes two to tango! There must be reciprocal
action by both, otherwise things end up much the same as before.
	   All must be seen to be involved in the final push to clean up
for the coming Commonwealth Games.
	   Otherwise, visitors will have much to comment on when they see
so much general uncleanliness. Let us keep our surroundings spick
and span for the big day.
	   Garbage is a dirty word. If there is a lack of bins or whatever,
get them and stop looking for excuses.
	   On a more positive note, I have noticed that the traffic problem
seems to have improved in town.

	   Political scientist Ryaas Rasyid, a member of a committee
reviewing the five political laws which govern the current
political system, said the House of Representatives should be given
the right to scrutinize candidates chosen by the President to hold
prominent positions.
	   Ryaas, rector of the Institute for Public Administration, told a
discussion here Saturday that such a mechanism would help single
out the best people for important positions.
	   ``House members should have the right to hold hearings with the
candidates,'' Ryaas said.
	   Ryaas said that as a member of a special team that was preparing
a review of the five political laws, he had proposed the idea to
the Ministry of Home Affairs and the House of Representatives.
	   According to Ryaas, while the President still has the
prerogative to choose particular individuals, legislators should be
allowed to screen them before they are formally appointed.
	   Positions which should be screened by the House include
ministerial posts, that of chief justice, head of the Supreme Audit
Agency and head of the Supreme Advisory Council, Ryaas argued.
	   Under the current system, the House has little say on who the
President appoints to fill the country's most important positions.
	   Former president Soeharto in March was criticized for being
nepotistic when he appointed his daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana
to the post of minister of social services and golfing buddy
Mohammad ``Bob'' Hasan as minister of industry and trade.
	   President B.J. Habibie dropped the two from his Reform and
Development Cabinet but did retain 20 members from the old Cabinet.
	   Ryaas also hinted yesterday that among proposals being debated
was a requirement that the government must notify the House prior
to making any crucial decisions.
	   ``The government, for instance, should consult with members of
the House before signing a foreign debt agreement,'' Ryaas said
during a discussion held by the National Council of Islamic
Students Alumni (KAHMI).
	   Ryaas said the new law would enable the House to be more active
in initiating its amendment rights.
	   The government and the House are expected to finish their
reviews of the five political laws -- which cover mass
organizations, the role and function of the House and the People's
Consultative Assembly, political parties and Golkar, and regional
administrations and elections -- within a six-month period before
the People's Consultative Assembly holds an extraordinary session,
which will be a precursor to the promised general election next
year.
	   Earlier during the discussion, former minister of finance Mar'ie
Muhammad said the country would be economically unable to get back
on its feet unless an atmosphere of political certainty was
created.
	   ``We need legitimization of the ruling power and a lessening of
political risk, which is very high at the moment,'' he said.
	   He pointed out that the current business climate in Indonesia
was not conducive since it contained a high degree of political
risk. He added that one way to resolve this was to have a definite
timetable for elections, and not just mere rhetoric about polls
being held as soon as possible.
	   However, he warned that an effort to create certainty and reduce
political risk should not be interpreted as trying to maintain the
status quo.(byg/mds)

FTC moves against computer chip maker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with commission vote, details of complaint. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE GEARAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Federal Trade Commission voted Monday
to bring an antitrust complaint against Intel Corp., alleging the
giant microprocessor chip manufacturer froze out and punished
competitors that needed help in developing new products.
	   When three companies tried to enforce their own patents on
computer parts and technology, Intel retaliated by withholding
vital technical information and threatening to cut off the supply
of chips, the agency charged in an 11-page complaint.
	   ``If Intel can use its monopoly position in the market for
microprocessors to prevent other firms from enforcing their own
patents, other firms will have little incentive to invent new
features to challenge Intel's dominance,'' said William J. Baer,
director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition.
	   Asked what remedy he had in mind, Baer told reporters at a news
conference that he wanted an order preventing Intel from continuing
the alleged practice.
	   Intel controls 90 percent of the world market for microprocessor
chips, which are the brains of a computer system.
	   The FTC complaint contends that Intel has misused its monopoly
power in the chip market.
	   The complaint is an internal FTC action which goes first to an
FTC administrative law judge for trial. Attorneys familiar with the
process say it could take a year or more for the case to be heard.
	   From there, the losing side could appeal to the five-member
commission, and thereafter to a federal appeals court.
	   The commission voted 3-1 to bring the complaint, said Chuck
Molloy, the company's spokesman. Molloy said the company was
preparing a statement in response to the FTC action.
	   Earlier this year, the Department of Justice filed an antitrust
suit against Microsoft Corp., which is nearly as dominant in
operating software as Intel is in chips. The Microsoft suit is
scheduled to go to trial on Sept. 8.
	   The FTC's move comes in the wake of two private lawsuits against
Intel, claiming the $25 billion company threatened to withhold
vital technology from its customers.
	   It was not immediately clear whether Intel executives had met
with FTC commissioners, which often happens before the commission
votes on bringing a lawsuit.
	   Intel had previously acknowledged that the FTC was conducting a
``broad business practices investigation.''

	   IT is indeed disheartening to read in the Press recently that
the Subang Jaya Municipal Council intends to launch the parking
coupon for Subang Jaya Town Centre without first solving the
parking woes for the residents, businessmen and shoppers.
	   It was reported in the News Straits Times (March 12 1997, March
21 1997 and again on June 27 1997) that MPSJ was to convert the
much neglected mall at SS15 into parking space to ease the traffic
congestion for the businessmen and shoppers.
	   After a lapse of more than one year, nothing has been done and
the pedestrian mall at SS15 remained an eyesore to the residents
and visitors.
	   We see no valid reason how the parking coupons system will solve
the parking woes if MPSJ did not first tackle the basic problem.
	   The only benefit from the system is to enrich the revenue of the
MPSJ at the expense of the motorists.
	   Even the State Assemblyman Lee Hwa Beng had promised in his last
general election manifesto to resolve the two-decade mall problem.
After more than four years, no positive action has been taken.
	   We urge that the Ministry of Housing and Local Government to
defer the implementation of the parking coupon system for Subang
Jaya until and unless the parking problem has been resolved by the
council.

European Union calls for swift return to democracy in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The European Union on Monday called for a swift
restoration of democracy in Nigeria following the death of the
country's military strongman, General Sani Abacha.
	   A statement issued by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook,
whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said the 15 EU
members also look forward to the ``election of an accountable
civilian government which will restore and respect human rights.''
	   Abacha's death from a heart attack at the age of 54 came in the
run-up to presidential elections in Nigeria. As the only candidate,
his victory was assured. His death creates a political vacuum.
	   The EU's brief statement said: ``We hope that following the
death of General Abacha, there will be an opening for a stable
transition to an early return to democracy, with the election of an
accountable civilian government which will restore and respect
human rights.''
	   Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Emeka Anyaoku, himself a
Nigerian, expressed condolences to Abacha's family and hope that
his succession will be based on ``genuine national consensus.''
	   The 54-nation association of Britain and its former colonies
voted to suspend Nigeria's membership in 1995 in protest against
the execution of author and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa.
	   ``I have no doubt that all Nigerians would wish to ensure that
peace prevails and that the succession arrangements are based on
genuine national consensus,'' Anyaoku said in a brief statement
issued at the Commonwealth's London headquarters.
	   Nigeria is the world's sixth largest oil exporting country, and
Royal Dutch Shell is one of its major foreign investors. In a brief
statement issued in London, the company did not mention politics.
	   ``The death of General Abacha will be a source of deep sorrow to
his family and our thoughts are with them and with the nation at
this time. Shell will continue to work with Nigeria as it has for
many years,'' the Royal Dutch Shell Group said.

	   Indonesia's economics guru Sumitro Djojohadikusumo is suggesting
that the government use US$3 billion to $5 billion out of the
IMF-arranged $43 billion bailout fund to recapitalize millions of
small and medium-scale businesses that have become virtually
paralyzed.
	   Sumitro said over the weekend that small and medium-scale
businesses were the backbone of the economy in terms of productive
employment, real income and foreign exchange generation.
	   ``Reinvigorating these businesses is most urgent and imperative
now to rescue our economy, which is on the threshold of a
depression,'' asserted the 81-year-old, who was a minister in the
late 1960s and 1970s.
	   He said the government should lobby strongly the International
Monetary Fund to immediately allocate between $3 billion and $5
billion out of its sponsored bailout fund into a trust fund to
extend credits at concessional interest rates to small and
medium-size businesses.
	   If the IMF does not agree on such an allocation, the government
should allocate that fund from its international reserves, he
added.
	   ``These businesses are now crippled. But these small
businesspeople do not know what has hit them, why prices suddenly
are skyrocketing beyond their purchasing power, why many of their
neighbors, relatives suddenly find themselves unemployed,'' Sumitro
noted.
	   The Central Bureau of Statistics reported last week an 8.5l
percent contraction in gross domestic product for the first
quarter, predicted a total negative growth of over 10 percent for
this year and inflation exceeding 85 percent.
	   ``My own prediction is a contraction of between 10 and 15
percent and inflation minimally at 100 percent,'' Sumitro said.
	   He reaffirmed a suggestion he made several years ago that funds
derived from 1 percent to 3 percent of profits of state companies
which so far had been spent on the development of cooperatives
should be pooled into an investment fund.
	   It would be much more efficient and effective to manage these
funds under an investment fund instead of being spent separately by
state companies, he added.
	   Sumitro said he had actually decided to retire from economic
policy debates unless an emergency situation arose.
	   ``The present crisis is a call of duty for me to speak my mind.
Because in the hurly-burly of the nationwide clamor for overall
reform, nobody seems to give attention to the fate of the millions
of small and medium-size enterprises.''
	   This, he hastily added, did not mean he wanted to belittle the
importance of overall political, judicial and social reform. This
reform instead was a precondition to a solution to the economic
crisis.
	   ``But while the reform agenda is being pushed through, we
urgently need to revive small and medium-scale businesses to
prevent a more devastating disaster,'' he pointed out.
	   He said he had received many letters from families in various
provinces complaining about the severe economic hardships, the
pains of having to discontinue their children's education.
	   ``These hardships, in addition to the pervasive malfeasance and
dishonesty within the state bureaucracy, were the main trigger of
the nationwide student demonstrations over the last few months.
They went out and expressed the aspirations of a segment of society
which had long been ignored but which had remained silent.''
	   Last January, Sumitro warned that the nation could plunge into a
prolonged depression if economic and political reforms were not
implemented speedily, firmly and consistently.
	   He said that what the country was facing was not merely an
economic crisis but an explosion of the cumulative pain from a
series of institutional diseases in the nation's entire political
body.
	   Sumitro reiterated the urgency for overall bureaucratic reform
to create good governance.
	   But the drive for overall reform from the central government
down to village administration and the correction of past mistakes
should always be based on the rule of law, he added.
	   ``Racial, ethnic and religious prejudices should be abolished
once and for all,'' he said. (vin)

	   PARAGON Union Bhd's founder and director Tan Siew Chin failed to
get re- elected to its board at the company's annual meeting
yesterday.
	   Managing director and chief executive director Lawrence Wong
Fook Heng said 56 per cent of the shareholders who attended the
meeting voted against Tan's re-election.
	   The shareholders also voted against three Paragon Union's
shareholders, holding not less than 10 per cent interest each in
the company, from being appointed to the board.
	   They are Tan Siew Tyan, Chua Tuan Hua and Raymond Kok Poo Him.
	   Wong, who was speaking to reporters after the meeting at its
factory in Balakong, Selangor, said another director Tang Swee Lan
had voluntarily resigned from the board.
	   Both Tan and Tang were unavailable for comment during the Press
conference.
	   Following the development, Paragon Union's current board of
directors comprise Wong, its chairman Datuk Lim Hui Boon, Tengku
Datuk Ibrahim Petra and Teoh Tek Siong.
	   Paragon Union and its subsidiaries manufacture and trade
commercial and car carpets and automotive components, machining and
production of stamped parts for the automotive electrical and
electronic industries.
	   Its current paid-up capital stands at RM14 million.
	   Tan Siew Chin is formerly the managing director of the company,
which was listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange second board in
November 1994. He relinquished his position in July last year.
	   As at Dec 31 last year, Tan held 1.57 million shares in the
company while Lim, who is currently its substantial shareholder, a
total of 2.58 million shares.
	   On the company's operations, Wong said Paragon Union is
currently taking the necessary steps to improve its business.
	   For the year ended Dec 31, 1997, the company registered a
pre-tax loss of RM437,154 against a pre-tax profit of RM3.08
million previously.
	   However, its turnover increased to RM45.48 million from RM40.35
million previously.
	   ``The company's outlook will remain the same for the next two to
three years,'' said Wong.
	   In the company' annual report, Lim said Paragon Union was well
prepared to face the challenges of the coming years.
	   He said its management had decided to discontinue the metal
stamping and machining operationsfrom last March and implemented an
austerity programme to reduce expenses.
	   Asked the reasons behind the change in the date of its annual
meeting, initially scheduled for Tuesday , Wong said the earlier
date was a typographical error.

	   PATIMAS Computers Bhd, is confident it will be able to meet its
profit guarantee as stated in its prospectus despite the country's
slower economic growth, executive director Ng Back Heang said
yesterday.
	   Patimas Computers has guaranteed its shareholders it will be
able to secure 90 per cent of its forecast group pre-tax profit of
RM13.03 million for the year ending Dec 31, 1998.
	   Patimas Computers, which is listed on the second board of the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange is an investment holding company with
subsidiaries involved in providing software solutions and services.
	   It has subsidiaries in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia,
Philippines and India.
	   Speaking after Patimas Computers' annual meeting in Bukit Jalil,
Selangor, Ng said the company hopes to register more than the
forecast figure for the year ending Dec 31, 1998.
	   ``Our business will not be affected by the economic slowdown as
it mainly provides software solutions to financial institutions and
manufacturing companies,'' executive director Dan E. Khoo said.
	   He said both the financial and manufacturing sectors were the
main contributors to total revenue of the country's information
technology industry.
	   ``Unless the companies and institutions close down or stop
operating, we will not be affected by the current economic problems
in the country.
	   ``The next 12 to 18 months are a crucial period for most
financial institutions and companies as they have to become year
2000 compliant,''
	   Khoo said.
	   Patimas recently secured two contracts - one from a company in
the United Kingdom and another from an American company.
	   It will be developing software-modules related to the automotive
industry for the UK-based information technology company.
	   And for the American company, it will develop modules related to
the manufacturing industry.
	   For the year ended Dec 31, 1997, Patimas Computers' group
pre-tax profit increased to RM11.28 million from RM8.77 million in
the previous corresponding period.
	   Turnover increased 47.5 per cent to RM84.10 million from RM57.04
million in 1996.

	   State-owned electricity company PLN has unilaterally annulled
its power purchase contract with PT Cikarang Listrindo after the
latter refused to renegotiate their deal.
	   PLN president Djiteng Marsudi told reporters Saturday he had
notified Cikarang Listrindo, an independent power producer owned by
former president Soeharto's cousin Sudwikatmono, that his firm
would stop buying power from it beginning June 15.
	   PLN was obliged to buy from Cikarang Listrindo for 20 years
under a contract signed in 1996.
	   ``I am ready to face a lawsuit as a result of this move,''
Djiteng said.
	   Cikarang Listrindo, which runs a 150 Megawatt (MW) gas-fired
power plant in Bekasi, West Java, started operation in 1993 with
the exclusive right to supply power for industrial plants in
Bekasi.
	   According to Djiteng, PLN was forced to buy some of the
company's power in the same year because its supply was
insufficient at the time.
	   PLN was ``obliged'' to purchase ever increasing volumes of power
in the following years, he said, reaching Rp 22 billion (about
US$2.2 million) last month.
	   Djiteng indicated he might take a similar action against other
independent power producers (IPP) which refused to renegotiate
contracts to alleviate PLN's financial problems amid the monetary
crisis.
	   ``In the beginning, I would rather face a lawsuit in the local
court,'' Djiteng said. He was referring to the possibility that PLN
might face lawsuits in international courts as most other IPPs were
controlled by foreign investors.
	   PLN asked the IPPs to renegotiate the contracts following the
heavy financial burdens resulting from the sharp depreciation of
the rupiah against the U.S. dollar.
	   PLN suffered a loss of more than Rp 500 billion last year and
has predicted losses this year would exceed Rp 2 trillion due to
the rupiah's sharp depreciation. It has tripled the company's
dollar-based spending, including for power purchase and foreign
debt payment.
	   PLN buys power from IPPs at an average price of 6.4 U.S. cents
or Rp 640 per kilowatt hour, compared with its average selling
price of Rp 234 per kilowatt hour.
	   The company has signed contracts with 26 IPPs, most of which are
owned by international power companies in partnership with
Soeharto's family and cronies.
	   Most of the power projects are still under construction or were
postponed by the government in a retrenchment measure to cope with
the crisis.
	   Pressure
	   IPP power plants which have come into operation include the
Sengkang power plant in South Sulawesi owned by Australia's Energy
Equity, El Paso of the U.S. and Soeharto's daughter Siti Hardijanti
Rukmana, and the Salak geothermal power plant in West Java, owned
by the U.S. Unocal Corporation and the Nusamba Group, controlled by
longtime Soeharto associate Mohammad ``Bob'' Hasan.
	   Djiteng confirmed that PLN would stop taking power from Sengkang
starting this month but had yet to annul its contract.
	   ``There is already a power oversupply in the province,'' Djiteng
said.
	   He emphasized PLN would not pay the company despite a
contractual take-or-pay clause stating PLN has to pay the company
for 80 percent of its power generation capacity, whether or not it
used its power.
	   ``PLN has no money now,'' he said.
	   Djiteng said he was disappointed over the reluctance of the IPPs
to renegotiate the contracts with PLN.
	   ``We were once invited to a meeting where we revealed our
financial difficulties. But none of them asked a single question or
made any comment.''
	   Djiteng noted PLN actually did not need most of the private
projects but the company was forced to enter into the contracts.
	   ``Most of the power projects were given without tender. I was in
one way or another pressured to sign the contracts.''
	   Djiteng cited as an example the $2 billion coal-fired Paiton II
awarded to PT Jawa Power, owned by Germany's Siemens, Britain's
Power Gen and Bumipertiwi Tatapradipta, controlled by Soeharto's
son Bambang Trihatmodjo.
	   He said the signing of the contract was made in 1995 during a
state visit of Soeharto to Germany.
	   ``I was invited to go along, unaware that I was going to sign a
power purchase contract there. I was taken aback after realizing
the fact but couldn't do anything at that time but sign the
contract in front of Soeharto and (German chancellor Helmut)
Kohl,'' Djiteng recalled. (jsk)

	   THE Pacific Bank Group recorded a 67.8 per cent higher pre-tax
profit of RM27 million for the first quarter ended March 31 1998.
	   The higher profit was attributed to the significant reduction in
losses experienced by the group's insurance subsidiary.

	   THE Securities Commission has withdrawn its written consent to
Halim Securities Sdn Bhd to carry on its licensed business
activity.
	   In a statement yesterday, the SC said the move was taken
following default proceedings taken by the Securities Clearing
Automated Network Services Sdn Bhd (SCANS) and the SC's rejection
of Halim Securities proposed corporate restructuring plan.
	   SC's move was pursuant to Section 20A of the Securities Industry
Act, 1983 (SIA).
	   Based on a report from the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange and
SCANS, SC said Halim Securities had not only defaulted on its
payment of RM9.67 million to SCANS, but has also failed to meet the
minimum liquid funds required under rule 17A of the Exchange's
rules relating to member companies.
	   The SC's rejection of the corporate restructuring plan is due to
numerous reasons including the inadequacy of the proposed capital
injection.
	   From Monday, Halim Securities will have to stop from dealing in
securities until such time, as in context of Section 20A of the
SIA, it is able to fulfill KLSE's minimum liquid funds
requirements.
	   It will also have to settle its debt to SCANS.
	   Said SC: ``Halim Securities had been given opportunities to
regularise its financial position in compliance with the KLSE's
rules and the Securities' rules.''
	   ``SCANS had also given several notices and extension of time to
Halim Securities to settle the RM9.67 million.''

	   The mass rioting in Jakarta and other cities in the middle of
May badly affected many businesses owned by Chinese Indonesians.
Director of the Indonesian Business Data Center, Christianto
Wibisono,proposes measures to revive their businesses.
	   Question: How much do you estimate the direct losses incurred by
the arson, destruction and looting in the recent rioting?
	   Christianto: The direct losses might have been as high as Rp 10
trillion (US$909 million) since thousands of houses, shops and
other buildings were burned, destroyed and looted. In my daughters'
housing complex in West Jakarta alone, where about 60 houses were
set ablaze, the losses might have totaled Rp 6 billion. We have yet
to calculate the indirect losses, which includes the halt in the
operation of shops. The cessation of their operations also means
the obstruction of distribution for industrial activities.
	   Even though the targets of the rioting were generally the assets
of the ethnic Chinese, why did some Chinese Indonesians also take
part in the looting?
	   The Chinese Indonesian looters were those living in slum areas.
That indicates that the rioting was also partly caused by the
widening gap between the rich and poor, besides racial prejudices
between indigenous and nonindigenous people.
	   Did the rioting cause capital flight?
	   Yes. But the amount of funds sent abroad by the ethnic Chinese
after the rioting was not much because most of them, as well as
corrupt government officials, had already put their money,
estimated to reach tens of billions of dollars, overseas not long
after the start of the monetary crisis last July.
	   How long will it be before ethnic Chinese businesspeople restart
their businesses?
	   I think it will not be too difficult for them to revive their
business facilities and generate new capital. The most difficult
thing for them now is how to cope with their trauma. My traumatized
daughter, for instance, will never return to her home. They need a
feeling of safety to resume business activity. The funds which are
now being saved overseas will never return either, unless security
is guaranteed.
	   President B.J. Habibie has promised that he would no longer
tolerate discrimination based on differences of race, religion or
groups. Is such a presidential promise adequate?
	   Such a promise has been issued several times by the government
but when seemingly organized criminals incited the mid-May rioting,
no security forces were available to stop their arson, looting and
vandalizing.
	   So, I think we need a law to protect the interests of
minorities. Furthermore, more than 20 existing regulations, which
are discriminative in nature, must be revoked or revised. The
regulations include the one on civil registration, which has
encouraged local administration officials to offer ``better
services'' in return for illegal levies.
	   Is it possible for indigenous Indonesians to develop the
country's economy with a high growth rate without the participation
of ethnic Chinese businesses?
	   It would be difficult because the ethnic Chinese contribute
about two-thirds to the country's economy. Chinese Indonesians
contribute little to business sectors dominated by state-owned
companies but play a major role in other sectors.
	   In train transportation and business ventures for fuels,
asphalt, fertilizer, dynamite and methanol, for example, they play
no role. The government is the main manager of these sectors. But
the ethnic Chinese dominate in bus transportation, banking,
construction, coffee plantations, forestry and the production of
alcohol, textiles, pulp, paper, electronic products, jewelry and
cigarettes.
	   The ethnic Chinese also strongly dominate in the distribution of
goods. That's why as soon as their shops were burned, the
distribution network in the country almost collapsed. The
government is now trying to encourage cooperatives to play a bigger
role in the distribution of goods but are they ready for the job?
The State Logistics Agency (Bulog) has actually prioritized
companies owned by indigenous Indonesians to distribute its goods,
such as sugar, but those companies, in turn, assign nonindigenous
Indonesians to carry out their jobs on a fee basis.
	   Is it true that ethnic Chinese conglomerates have developed
through collusive practices with government officials?
	   Only a few of them have developed through collusive practices
but because their businesses are big, the amount of funds involved
were big too.
	   What do you think is the best way to narrow the gap between the
rich, which are mostly ethnic Chinese, and the poor, which are
mostly indigenous Indonesians, to reduce social jealousy?
	   I wouldn't mind the introduction of an affirmative action law
with the aim of, say, providing privileges to indigenous people.
Such an affirmative action program, in spite of its discriminatory
principle, would be positive because it would offer assistance to
the weak. But such a policy should not allow any resistance to the
growth of the strong or drive indigenous Indonesians to become
lazy, by selling their job accreditations to other parties.
	   The collection of funds equal to 2 percent of companies' net
profits -- if the profits exceeded Rp 100 million a year -- under a
presidential decree issued by former president Soeharto was a bad
example of helping the weak by taking from the strong. Furthermore,
such fund collections created discipline problems in
state-budgeting and their accountability was doubtful. (riz)

	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The EU governments agreed after several hours
of talks Monday to phase out high sea drift nets by Dec. 31, 2001,
to prevent the unnecessary death of thousands of species such as
seals, dolphins and whales.
	   Two countries, France and Italy, voted against the agreement
that applies to boats registered in EU countries. Ireland
abstained.
	   Britain's Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham called the
negotiations ``on the whole amicable but tough.'' The negotiations
have been on the agenda since 1994, he said.
	   France, Italy and Ireland argued the ban would threaten the
livelihood of fishermen.
	   ``A technique of fishing has been sacrificed,'' French
Agriculture Minister Louis le Pensec told reporters. ``The
fishermen have been unjustly affected ... such a decision is
unacceptable for France.''
	   EU Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino, and Britain, which now
holds the EU's rotating presidency, had proposed phasing out all
drift nets as of Dec. 31, 2000.
	   Cunningham said Monday's decision was reached after the
countries agreed on a number of measures to help fishermen was
included in the deal.
	   To implement such measures by the end of this year _ including
retraining fishermen for other jobs _ the countries concerned will
have to dig into the EU funds allocated for poor regions. Ireland
has more poor regions than France and Italy.
	   ``We know that there is money at least as far as France and
Italy are concerned. In Ireland's case, the situation is more
difficult,'' said Bonino. ``We'll have to see what we can do.''
	   France had said if it came to a transitional period, it wanted a
period of at least six years. Italy is considered by EU officials
to be the worst offender.
	   In 1992, the United Nations imposed a general moratorium on
drift nets. The EU responded by limiting them to 1.5 miles (2.5
kilometers).
	   The drift nets that are kilometers (miles) long are dragged
through the water. Because they are so long, they have been
nicknamed ``walls of death.''
	   Ecological groups, including Greenpeace have denounced the use
of the nets, which they say catch animals fishermen don't want such
as sharks, dolphins, whales, turtles and diving birds.
	   The RSPCA, the British animal protection organization, published
a report last September highlighting the devastation and suffering
caused by drift nets.
	   The report revealed that in one season alone almost 83,000 blue
sharks were caught by French boats, 8,000 dolphins by Italian
fishermen. Additionally, as many as 800 leatherback turtles died in
drift nets.

	   Every citizen concerned about and committed to improving the
fate of the nation is indigenous, regardless of their ethnic group,
President B.J. Habibie said here Saturday.
	   Habibie told a group of mass media leaders at the Wisma Negara
state guesthouse that even a person of Bugis ethnicity from South
Sulawesi was considered a nonindigenous ``if he thinks only of
himself and doesn't care about the nation's problems''.
	   His comment was in response to a question on the widely
perceived public and state discrimination against ethnic Chinese in
the country, a minority most branded ``nonindigenous'' and which
was the major target of assaults during days of unrest last month.
	   ``There is no discrimination against the ethnic Chinese. I don't
see any reason to close the door against any Indonesian citizen
from becoming a civil servant or anything else,'' he said,
responding to the question.
	   ``One major general in the Army is from the ethnic Chinese
community. There is no limitation for citizens who are ethnic
Chinese,'' he said.
	   Habibie's answer was supported by Minister of Information
Muhammad Yunus, an active Army lieutenant general formerly known as
Yunus Yosfiah, who said: ``The major general was in the same class
as me (in the military academy).''
	   ``So gentlemen, let's not make an issue out of this problem
anymore, because the real Pancasila (state ideology) will not
tolerate SARA of any form,'' he said, referring to animosity rooted
from the issues of tribal affiliations, religion, race and societal
groups.
	   Ethnic Chinese are traditionally the usual target for mob
violence during times of hardship in Indonesia due to their
perceived wealth and because they control much of the trade and
commerce throughout the vast archipelago, although they only
constitute about 4 percent of the 202 million population.
	   Shops and homes of ethnic Chinese were burned and looted during
riots in Jakarta and elsewhere last month that helped topple former
president Soeharto, who handed the reins over to Habibie on May 21.
	   Many women of ethnic Chinese were allegedly sexually abused by
rioters in the days of violence, in which 1,200 people from various
ethnic groups were killed.
	   There is still deep concern in the Chinese community over the
future.
	   A group of Chinese-Indonesians declared on Friday their
intention of setting up a political party to remove misconceptions
between their community and native Indonesians.
	   The party will be called the Chinese-Indonesians for Reform
Party, the group said. (prb/aan)

	   JUST as fusion has crept into Chinese food, it has also made its
inroads into Japanese. It's modern Japanese cuisine, with western
flavours, one which the young people in Japan are enamoured with.
	   ``The young people will not go into a traditional Japanese
restaurants any more,'' said Eji Kamada, general manager of
Restaurant Suntory at the Kuala Lumpur Hilton Arcade West Main
Lobby. ``They go into this kind of restaurant. Now in Japan, there
is a little western culture and we want to show customers the new
Japanese-style cuisine.''
	   An example of new-age Japanese food would be the beef fillet
with foie gras that is one of the 10 courses in the kaiseki meal we
had. Foie gras is essentially French, and the goose liver is
marinated in balsamico and a little soya sauce before being sauteed
on a teppan.
	   An elderly Japanese couple seated next to our table was most
interested in the cracker served with scallop tartare sauce we had
before the kaiseki dinner. The Hotate Taru Taru Cracker was like a
large canape, with a heap of creamy chopped raw scallop with onions
and topped with flying fish roe resting on a full-size cracker. It
made a crispy, yet smooth and piquant hors d'oeuvre.
	   More finger food came in the Beef Cutlet Supaicy Sauce, which
was a piece of meat fried in a light batter, each on a lettuce leaf
and accompanied by shredded spring onion and carrot. The sauce
served with this was surprisingly hot - I detected cumin, a tinge
of curry powder and chilli.
	   If you are drinking beer or even sake, the Tomo Momo Mustard or
Grilled Chicken with Mustard Paste makes another good appetiser. I
could taste the hot, piquant mustard on top of the chicken which
has been lightly breaded and fried.
	   The kaiseki dinner shows you all the creativity of the chef.
First there was this bamboo-lined lacquer tray of hors d'oeuvres
called Sanshu Mori with boiled fresh soyabean pods in a large
hollow bamboo, grilled cold eggplant marinated in soya sauce and
sesame and topped with sesame seeds in a Chinese spoon and chilled
egg tofu in a glass bowl flavoured with ginger juice and some
shrimps.
	   These tasty, subtle appetisers put you in the right mood for
even more adventurous fare to come. The Kawai Zushi Santen Mori
offers three kinds of sushi in their nori or seaweed cases. The
small squid marinated with special soya fills the topping for one,
the intense sweetness of this burst on the palate as you bite into
the smooth squid.
	   Even more unusual was the crabmeat blended with miso paste in
yet another sushi. It was creamy, tinged with sweetness from the
miso but you would still get the inimitable flavour of crab. The
last sushi was one of salmon roe.
	   The Asari Dobin Mushi is a clear soup with short neck clam in a
special pot. I never cease to wonder at the delicacy of this soup
which is poured out of a spout in the pot on to a little teacup
which is the cover of the pot. You sip the soup from the tiny cup,
appreciating the flavour of the clams and the few drops of lemon
juice you have squeezed into it.
	   A hot soup is followed by sashimi - Kurodai Aarai Yuzomiso which
is raw black sea-bream with Yuzu miso paste. The sea-bream has a
clear taste, and I liked the springy texture of it. It's sashimi,
not dipped in the conventional soya sauce and wasabi, but a
delightful miso paste.
	   Anago Yanagawa is braised sea eel, Yanagawa style. The eel is
braised in soya sauce with onions and shredded burdock root and
finished in egg. It looks like a steamed egg dish, with the
ingredients making a striking presence. It is served in flat stone
dish.
	   Still on a traditional note in this kaiseki dinner is the
Shirauo Edamame Kakiage, which has shredded eggplant, white fish
and soya bean dipped in batter and fried into a crispy friteer.
	   Fusion food came from the teppan in the form of Foie Gras Gyu
Fillet Steak, very rich and very French, but with a touch of
Japanese.
	   Just when we were feeling full, we were presented with
Shimeiwashi Sanbaizu which is sardine with vinegar, seaweed, slices
of raw yam and cucumber and grated ginger. The tart sardine brings
everything into balance, especially with the crunchy raw yam and
the spicy, refreshing ginger.
	   I don't know why my favourite cold Japanese noodles - Inaniwa
Udon - had to come at the end of the dinner. You dip the chilled,
thin and wonderfully smooth udon in the bowl of sauce with grated
ginger, wasabe, and chopped spring onions.
	   Dessert was a small Japanese red bean tart.
	   The kaiseki could be likened to a course by course gourmet
dinner, that offers a selection from the raw appetisers to the
cooked ones, and to main courses that are deep fried, cooked on the
teppan or braised. It costs RM180 to have this feast at Suntory,
and you simply must take your time savouring the different
gastronomic ingredients brought together. A kaiseki meal should
rightly last for hours.
	   Kamada is trying to open up the world of Japanese food to
Malaysians.
	   ``For instance, there are many kinds of rolled sushi,'' he said,
``but Malaysians only want California roll. You can't find this in
Japan.'' He would also like to steer them away from staples like
tempura, to a more adventurous food..
	   The restaurant also has a Robatayaki counter, that offers the
Japanese hotpot, like a steamboat.
	   Suntory is a huge conglomerate in Japan that is involved not
only in 400 restaurants there and overseas, but also in liquor such
as whisky, wine and beer, medicine, golf clubs, health club, music
halls, museum, advertising and soft drinks, fruit juices and
ice-cream!

	   I am an American expatriate teaching in Surabaya. On May 28, I
had to visit the Attorney General's Office in Jakarta about a
problem I had. While in Jakarta, I had a chance to see and
experience the worst and best the capital currently has to offer
expats. I will begin with the bad, go to worse and worst and end
with the good because it was so surprising.
	   Upon arriving at Gambir station, my fiancee and I were
surrounded by taxi drivers offering to take us to the Supreme Court
with prices from Rp 10,000 to Rp 15,000 but we thought the taxi
booth would be safest. How sad it was to have our first impression
of Jakarta be a taxi driver first take us south on Jl. Medan
Merdeka Timur, then in a circle, pretend to ask directions and end
up with a metered fare of Rp 7,000 at the court, which turns out to
be within walking distance of Gambir station.
	   After a sadly disappointing meeting, we took a bajaj to Mangga
Dua with a kind man who laughed at our experience with the taxi and
said we had to be careful with Jakartans but that he was from East
Java. But I guess he had been in Jakarta too long because he
charged us Rp 10,000, after first asking Rp 15,000, whereas when we
returned to Gambir, another bajaj driver only asked for Rp 4,000.
	   But the worst experience of Jakarta ``hospitality'' was the
bakso (meatball) seller near the National Monument. My fiancee, a
Surabaya native, first asked him if we could have bakso for Rp
1,500 each which he agreed to but when we finished he demanded Rp
8,000. I really felt that being bule (white) in Jakarta means
people can lie, cheat and steal.
	   However, I am not really writing this to complain about the bad
but to tell about the amazingly good experience we had. When we
went to purchase tickets back to Surabaya, we discovered to our
horror that an envelope containing Rp 500,000 was missing and that
we did not have enough money to return home. I could only imagine
that the money, in a plain unmarked envelope, had fallen out at the
Supreme Court. My fiancee was in utter despair, saying it was
hopeless to even try looking for it.
	   However, I went back to the Supreme Court and saw a Pak Agung
Putra and asked him if anyone had found an envelope.Amazingly, he
replied, dengan uang? (with money). I praised God for such an
honest man. He said another guest had actually found the envelope
and given it to him. Since it was unmarked, he did not really know
whose it was but he thought it might have belonged to me.
	   I just wanted to write that while there may be many small men in
Jakarta who are ready to lie, cheat and steal, there is at least
one great man named Agung Putra who should be praised for his
actions to a guest to his city.

	   Megawati Soekarnoputri's call on all Indonesians to stop
defiling fallen president Soeharto was an act of chivalry. Having
endured the same agony of being publicly defiled when her father
was ousted, she could indeed empathize with Soeharto's family.
However, one should also understand why this bashing occurs, and
acknowledge the feelings of the Indonesian people.
	   Having been repressed for 32 years, where criticism toward
Soeharto was almost considered blasphemous, and when people could
only vent out their feelings by circulating jokes and rumors, this
certainly is an opportunity for people to speak out now.
	   The same thing happened after the fall of Sukarno in 1966.
However, much as Sukarno was a popular figure, and is still much
loved and admired by many Indonesians (including myself), we should
not deny the fact that he was, after all, a dictator too.
	   So back to Megawati's question, ``Do we have to replace our
state leaders through such treatment every time?'' The answer is
no, it will not happen again, provided that the present and future
leaders of Indonesia are able to refrain from abusing their powers
and ruling this country like a dictatorship.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers took over two buildings in an
Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem before dawn Monday, stringing barbed
wire and setting off angry stone-throwing clashes with Arab
neighbors.
	   It was the latest in a series of escalating confrontations in
Jerusalem's eastern sector as both sides accuse the other of trying
to grab land in the bitterly contested city.
	   At least two people were injured in Monday's clashes, including
the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini. He was
hit in the head with a stone and slightly hurt before police and
soldiers broke up the melee.
	   Adding to the volatile mix, about 20 activists from the Peace
Now group arrived at the site in the Silwan neighborhood to protest
the settlers' arrival. Police dragged them away after they refused
to disperse.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
United States hoped the dispute could be resolved peacefully.
	   ``We're looking into the incidents, but let me say this: We call
on both sides to exercise maximum restraint, both in their actions
and their rhetoric, especially when it comes to issues as sensitive
as Jerusalem,'' Rubin said.

	   Demands for reform in all fields are being yelled out
everywhere. I would like to suggest the reformers reform the
misleading perception toward ethnic Chinese. It is common knowledge
that some Indonesians relate the majority of Chinese-Indonesians
who were born in this country with riches. This perception, which
is not correct, will hurt national unity and have a bad impact on
the county's development.
	   The recent riots which were followed by burning business centers
where many Chinese-Indonesians earned their living is a good
example. These businesses were started from the ground up, with
round-the-clock toiling and perspiration. Why must this happen? The
masterminds who steered the mobs might be laughing in glee, leaving
innocent victims in a state of trauma and bankruptcy.
	   Let's be sensible. Why must the ethnic Chinese be disliked and
targeted in any social unrest here? What has gone wrong with our
logical thinking? We agree that there are some Chinese
businesspeople looting the country by manipulating the power of
their Indonesian partners. Aren't there many other people who earn
their living honestly, without any connection to government
officers, paying their taxes and providing employment?
	   These people, realizing the hardship faced by other Indonesians
due to the economic turmoil, organized the cheap sale of packages
of staple foods. They donated their blood to the Red Cross when
there was a dengue fever epidemic.
	   It should also be realized that there are many ethnic Chinese
working as public transportation drivers, street vendors or even
beggars. Like their Indonesian brothers, sky-rocketing living
expenses gave them an extremely hard burden.
	   If there are ethnic Chinese making their way by violating the
law, let them be severely punished. Ethnic Chinese are not equated
with richness. This misleading perception is harmful to national
unity and stability.

	   Freedom of expression, that inalienable right guaranteed by our
Constitution, has flourished in Indonesia these past few months
after being virtually missing for more than two decades.
	   It has returned together with the current reform movement. The
demand for sweeping changes could not have been as well articulated
were it not for the insistence of students and reform campaigners
to exercise their constitutional right. They broke the
psychological barriers which had, for far too long, prevented our
people from expressing their thoughts and ideas in the open.
	   Some members of the media quickly hopped on the reform bandwagon
when it began early this year; others joined a little later. But
there was no doubt that the reform movement has helped restore
freedom of the press. The press, which had been held under strict
government controls, suddenly found the courage and strength to
break away from their prison mentality and defeat their old fears
of authority.
	   Now with the old regime out of the way, it is only natural to
expect the new government to roll back those rules that have
restricted freedom of expression, including freedom of the press.
But few people expected Minister of Information Muhammad Yunus to
move so swiftly in reforming the information sector.
	   On Friday, Yunus removed a 1984 ruling which gave his
predecessors the right to revoke the licenses of press
publications. This ruling was an outrageous, yet effective, tool of
the previous government in controlling the press.
	   Several newspapers and magazines lost their licenses for
printing reports that were critical of the government. With the
fear of losing their license, the press practiced self-censorship
not only to avoid offending the government, but at times even to
please the powers that be. This often meant suppressing
information, or helping disseminate government lies. The few press
publications that dared to criticize the government were labeled as
opposition elements, which until recently were considered dirty
words that could have landed them in deep trouble.
	   It was particularly encouraging to hear Yunus' statement which
he so often repeated since his appointment to the cabinet last
month that freedom of the press is crucial to democracy, and that
he was counting on the press to help eliminate the corruption,
collusion, cronyism and nepotism that had characterized the
previous government. This is an official recognition that the
absence of a free and critical press in the past had allowed the
nation to degenerate as low as it did.
	   The removal of the minister's power to revoke the permits may
have appeared to some as a formality since the press has been
operating in a relatively free environment these past few months.
Nevertheless, it is a milestone in the development of a healthy and
independent press in Indonesia. It marks the beginning of a new
course for the press to play its role in a much more constructive
and professional way in the never-ending process of building this
nation.
	   Freedom entails responsibility, and with too much liberty, there
are bound to be excesses and abuses. But the legal system is there
to protect public interests against possible abuses. The press
council exists as the industry's watchdog to promote a free and
fair press. Peer pressure can also ensure that the press uses its
newly found freedom wisely. Failure to do so would not only
undermine its credibility, but could be counterproductive and lead
to the return of the old restrictive rules. If that happened, the
press would have no one to blame but themselves.
	   With its new freedom, the press must join forces with others in
society to continue the fight for reform, including the fight for
greater freedom of expression and the development of a healthy
democracy in this country. Since the press owes its freedom to
society, it would only be right that it return this favor now.

forensic expert said yesterday.
	   Mun'im Idries of the Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital said
the body was exhumed yesterday from South Jakarta's Tanah Kusir
Cemetery at the request of the Jakarta Military Police Command in
order to remove the bullet from the body of Heri Hartanto.
	   ``The bullet was found in the left chest of Heri's decomposed
body,'' Mun'im told The Jakarta Post yesterday.
	   He reiterated that Heri and his three friends -- Elang Mulya,
Hendriawan Sie and Hafidhin Royan -- were shot dead with live
ammunition.
	   Mun'im, who examined the bodies at Sumber Waras hospital on May
12, said he managed to remove only one real bullet from
Hendriawan's neck that night.
	   ``We could not remove the one from Heri's chest that night
because of the crowded situation at the hospital,'' he said, adding
that Elang and Hafidhin were shot in the chest and head
respectively, but the bullets had exited their bodies.
	   The four students were shot dead in a large demonstration at the
university campus on Jl. Kyai Tapa in West Jakarta after hundreds
of police and soldiers tried to disperse them.
	   The military police have named 18 suspects in the shooting, all
of whom are police officers. Two of the suspects faced their first
court-martial session Saturday.
	   Jakarta Military Police Commander Col. Hendardji told the Post
yesterday that the bullet taken from Heri's body was needed as
evidence in the case.
	   ``At first, Heri's family refused to give permission for the
exhumation, but changed their minds on Saturday after consulting
with Moslem scholars.
	   ``We took the bullet, a 5.56 mm caliber from a Steyr AUG rifle,
Sunday morning at Tanah Kusir Cemetery,'' Hendardji said.
	   The bullet has been submitted to the National Police Forensic
Laboratory for further investigation, he said.
	   ``The ballistics report will determine who was responsible. It
will uncover the truth behind the fatal shooting. I expect the
report to be submitted to us soon.''
	   Hendardji said the bullet, as new evidence, could be used to
strengthen the charges against the suspects, who have been charged
under Article 338 of the Criminal Code on murder. The article
carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.
	   When asked about the possibility of finding further suspects
based on new findings (such as the bullet from Heri), Hendardji
said the case would develop and new suspects may emerge.
	   ``We are sure that the 18 suspects are responsible for the
incident,'' he said.
	   If there are new suspects, he said, their names will come from
subordinates of the eight middle-rank police officers in charge of
security when the incident happened.
	   ``The suspects might have used live ammunition due to a
deviation in the procedure of ammunition distribution from their
home base,'' he said.
	   Based on that, he said, it was possible that officers in charge
of distributing ammunition could be named as suspects.
	   Separately, National Police Chief Gen. Dibyo Widodo reiterated
Saturday that none of the police officers on duty during the
demonstration had been armed with live ammunition.
	   ``We have checked with every officer assigned there and found
that none of our men used live ammunition,'' Dibyo said after
formally installing Maj. Gen. Nurfaizi as new Central Java Police
chief, replacing Maj. Gen. Noegroho Djajoesman who became the new
city police chief. (jun/edt)

	   HAVING obtained Sirim's approval in a full range of standards,
SRII Bhd will now focus on securing international standards for its
fire-fighting equipment.
	   In an interview with Business Times, SRII managing director Ong
Yow Siang said Third World export markets such as Africa and West
Asia do not emphasise much on international standards.
	   He said these markets will accept a product as long as the
company complies with the minimum standards of the countries.
	   However, given SRII's objective of increasing product
penetration into advanced countries, it has intensified efforts
towards securing more international standards.
	   According to Ong, advanced countries such as Japan and Europe
impose stringent standards, which may take up to three years for
approval and can be costly.
	   In addition to securing certification for its fire extinguishers
in Australia, SRII is trying to obtain certification in Europe.
	   Ong said the company is ensuring its fire-fighting products
comply with international standards right from the start.
	   SRII currently complies with a few international standards,
including British and Australian.
	   On its export plans, SRII hopes to capitalise on the weaker
ringgit by being export driven to boost incomes.
	   ``We have been working hard to drive up our exports to take
advantage of the lower ringgit against the greenback,'' Ong said.
	   He added that the export business is expected to be the
company's main business in five years.
	   He said total exports for this year should account for 40 per
cent of last year's revenue of RM66.29 million, up 25 per cent.
	   In the next 10 years, the group plans to achieve exports of at
least 60 per cent of its revenue.
	   Ong said profit margins for exports are more significant, given
the increase in the value of the US dollar in which its products
are traded.
	   ``Although the local market is rather small, with only a handful
of smaller competitors, we still command on the average between 40
and 50 per cent of the local market share,'' Ong said.
	   SRII's reputation for quality and reliability has made it a
trusted name throughout Malaysia and in over 30 countries worldwide
including the Asean, UK, East Asia, West Asia and Africa.
	   In UK SRII's exports account for between 15 and 20 containers
every year, while in Australia exports account for four containers
a month.
	   On the local contracts in hand, Ong said SRII has not less than
RM60 million in outstanding contracts for its fire-fighting
products, which should see the company through the next one to two
years.
	   He said SRII is also trying to get more government-backed
industrial and Multimedia Super Corridor projects.
	   These contracts include deals to supply to the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport, Kuala Lumpur City Centre and Tawau Airport.
	   Meanwhile, SRII signed a MOU with Cerberus Malaysia AG of
Switzerland last month to set up a joint venture company, Cerebus
Malaysia Sdn Bhd, to manufacture, assemble, market and distribute
Cerberus fire alarms, gas detection, security products and systems.
	   SRII's proposed stake of 10 per cent in the joint venture will
be subscribed through its 100 per cent owned subsidiary, Vital
Engineering Sdn Bhd, while the rest will be held by Cerberus.
	   Vital Engineering will have an option to buy additional shares
of up to 30 per cent at par value from Cerberus or the proposed
joint venture within the first three years of operation.
	   The joint venture will allow SRII to penetrate more effectively
into the fire and electronic security engineering markets in
Malaysia and the Asia Pacific.
	   On SRII's short-term financial performance, Ong said the group
should meet its first quarter sales and profit forecast despite the
economic slowdown.
	   Due to prudent financial management, the group has virtually no
gearing with RM19 million in the bank or 90 sen per share, he

	   Over 150 students' parents stormed private Ricci II Catholic
school on Jl. Utama II near Bintaro here on Saturday in protest of
the school management's decision to raise tuition fees by up to 50
percent without consulting them.
	   The parents, most of whom were housewives, started arriving at
the school compound, which houses elementary, junior and senior
high schools, at 8 a.m., demanding a meeting with representatives
of the school's foundation.
	   They held a noisy rally and unfurled posters which demanded,
among other things, that the price increase be canceled, reduced
prices for school uniforms and books, and the establishment of a
parents and teachers body.
	   ``If the government can revised its state budget downward, why
must the school substantially raise its fees?'' read one poster and
``Ricci II craves money,'' read another.
	   ``How can the school raise its fees by up to 50 percent at a
time when the country's economy is practically grinding to a halt,
when many parents have lost their jobs?'' asked Indratmoko, one of
the protesters.
	   At 10:30 a.m., the protesters were allowed to enter the school
hall under the escort of a police officer, who was there to
maintain security.
	   The protesters later held a free-speech forum, criticizing many
of the school management's policies which, according to them,
overburdened them. The free-speech forum stopped when the school
foundation's chairman, Dr. Hubertus, arrived at 1:10 p.m. to
discuss their complaints.
	   The parents became angry when, in response to their emotionally
charged questions at the beginning of the discussion, Hubertus
stated that he never dealt with questions voiced by patients of a
psychiatric hospital.
	   The parents hysterically claimed they were ``insane'' because of
the school's arbitrary policies.
	   The situation cooled down after one protester volunteered to
become moderator in the discussion, after which both sides agreed
to settle the dispute amicably.
	   The school management agreed to postpone the increase in tuition
and to allow the establishment of a parents and teachers body to
participate in any decision-making. (hhr)

	   More than 1,200 employees of private retail company PT
Multipolar Perkasa staged a protest in front of their head office
in Karawaci over the weekend, demanding the company clarify their
employment status.
	   The workers said the company, which manages Wal-Mart stores in
Karawaci here and Pluit in North Jakarta, must give them severance
pay in accordance with government regulations on the dismissal of
workers if it planned to permanently close the currently idle
stores.
	   ``If Multipolar decides to stop the operation of its stores, we
want the legitimate severance payment,'' the employees' spokesman,
Tunggul, said.
	   The workers also demanded Multipolar, a subsidiary of the Lippo
Group, to provide their May salaries soon and issue working
references to them if the firm planned to close the stores, the
spokesman said.
	   After an hour into the demonstration, the management invited
representatives of the protesters to discuss their demands. The
meeting's results have yet to be made available to the media.
	   The massive riots that rocked Jakarta and its surrounding areas
on May 14 and 15 forced the firm to temporarily close their two
huge stores, leaving at least 1,600 employees uncertain about their
job status.
	   The Wal-Mart outlet at Lippo Supermal in Karawaci was badly
damaged but the other store at Mega Mall Pluit was left unscathed
by the looting mobs.
	   On Wednesday, more than 500 of the employees visited the Jakarta
legal Aid Institute to seek legal advice.
	   Some of the workers have reportedly voluntarily left the company
due to its bad financial performance. (41/jun)

	   K&AMP;N Kenanga has given a ``buy up to RM10.00'' recommendation to
Unisem (M) Bhd's shares, which will soon be listed on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange main board.
	   The stockbroking company also decribed Unisem as a ``top class
operations in an expanding market''.
	   K&AMP;N Kenanga is one of the underwriters of Unisem's initial
public offer (IPO) exercise. The company had offered its shares
under an IPO price of RM5.10 per share.
	   K&AMP;N Kenanga said the recommendation to buy Unisem's shares are
based on the company's healthy balance sheet, which puts it in a
stronger position compared with many of its peers.
	   In addition, the stockbroking firm noted that Unisem prepaid all
of its bank facilities in 1996 and it estimates that at end-1997,
Unisem was in a net cash position of some RM30.5 million.
	   Unisem, a manufacturer of semiconductor devices, has also seen
world demand for its main product, the Small Outline Integrated
Circuit (SOIC), grow.
	   The demand is estimated to rise further by a compounded annual
growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8 per cent (in number of units) up to the
year 2000.
	   With this, its revenues have also grown steadily over the years
from a mere RM37.29 million in 1993 to RM158.44 million in 1997.
	   It has forecast a pre-tax profit of RM93 million in 1998 and
RM124 million in 1999, which translates into an earnings per share
of 65.0 sen and 86.7 sen respectively.
	   Unisem, which has a market capitalisation of RM1.43 billion and
with 143 million issued shares, has forecast net tangible asset
(NTA) per share of RM2.76 as at end-1998.
	   K&AMP;N Kenanga also said that Unisem operates in a healthy
environment in a high-growth industry and gets paid in US dollars
by its customers.
	   However, the company is only allowed to keep up to US$5 million
(US$1  &QC;  RM3.99) in dollar deposits in Malaysia, while the rest of
the revenue is converted into ringgit with the surplus cash
deposited into repos and time deposits.
	   K&AMP;N Kenanga also said that Unisem, which has pioneer status that
exempts its profits from operations from income tax for five years
beginning July 1 1993, is applying for an extension of its pioneer
status, as allowed under the local tax law. There is a possibility
that the company will receive the extension.
	   In addition, K&AMP;N Kenanga pointed out that the company has at
end-1997 RM2 million in tax losses, RM17 million in unclaimed
capital allowances and RM40 million in qualifying expenditure
(reinvestment allowances) that will enable it to offset against
income tax once its pioneer status ends.
	   K&AMP;N Kenanga said Unisem presents investors with a unique entry
into one of Malaysia's most successful sectors of the economy -
that of semiconductor assembly and testing, representing about 18.5
per cent of Malaysian exports in 1997.
	   The stockbroking firm believes Unisem should achieve a 1999
price earnings ratio of at least 13 times due to its high-growth
environment and healthy balance sheet.
	   It added that the KLSE Composite Index basket is trading at 13.3
times 1999 earnings, while offering an estimated cumulative
negative earnings growth of 7.5 per cent a year.
	   Unisem, established by ex-Carsem (a subsidiary of Malaysian
Pacific Industries) employees, began operations in late 1992.
	   It was awarded MS ISO 9002 certification in early 1993, and
currently operates from its plant in Perak with a workforce of
1,480. Of this, up to 50 are engineers and over 900 operators.
	   Its major shareholders are Bandar Rasah with a 24.9 per cent
stake and the Walden Group with a 14.9 per cent stake.

	   City hospitals have not received any new dengue patients
beginning last week, an official said Saturday.
	   City Health Office spokeswoman Maryani said the good news seemed
to contradict a World Health Organization prediction that the
country's dengue fever outbreak would peak in May and June.
	   ``This (no new dengue patients) happened due to uncertainty of
the seasons here this year and probably also from the tiny roles of
the recent campaign to eradicate mosquito habitats,'' she said as
quoted by Antara.
	   Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the carriers of the dengue virus.
	   The outbreak this year, she said, had killed 114 people out of
12,549 patients treated at the 63 hospitals throughout the city.
	   Last month alone, a total of 2,999 dengue patients were admitted
to city hospitals compared to 6,900 sufferers treated in the
previous month, she said. (bsr)

	   MR RUPERT Murdoch, the News Corp Ltd chairman and owner of Hong
Kong-based Star Television Ltd, visited the Measat Broadcast
Network Systems Sdn Bhd centre in Bukit Jalil yesterday but
insisted he was not on a shopping trip.
	   Murdoch, who was met by pressmen at the departure hall of the
Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah airport in Subang, said he was in the
country for a ``brief stopover''.
	   He said he met Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad and
his deputy and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, but did
not discuss business.
	   ``It was a private talk. Nothing about business ... just world
affairs.''
	   Asked if he had discussed the possibility of acquiring stakes in
Malaysian companies, Murdoch said: ``No, nothing to do with my
business. I am just passing by.''
	   Murdoch had arrived in Kuala Lumpur in the morning. Mr T. Ananda
Krishnan, a major shareholder of Measat, was at the airport to send
off the world media magnate to China.
	   Ananda Krishnan said Murdoch, who confessed that Malaysia is a
``wonderful place'' to do business, briefly toured the Measat
Broadcast centre.
	   When asked if the world media magnate was planning to invest in
Measat Broadcast, Ananda Krishnan said: ``He (Murdoch) came to
visit Astro station because Astro uses Star channel ... Astro has
some form of collaboration with them (Star channel).''
	   Measat Broadcast is the operator of Malaysia's first
direct-to-user satellite broadcast services, Astro. Ananda Krishna
has stakes in Measat Broadcast through Usaha Tegas Entertainment
Systems Sdn Bhd, a company owned by trusts associated with his
family.
	   Meanwhile, Ananda Krishnan said Murdoch had expressed confidence
in Malaysia's ability to recover from the current economic
problems.
	   ``(Murdoch) is very supportive of Malaysia. He said Malaysia is
a wonderful place to do business''.

	   Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB) has offered all of its
graduates the chance to participate in a two year scheme which they
said could help country farmers to increase the yield and quality
of their crops.
	   In a speech read out after a graduation ceremony on Saturday,
rector Soleh Solahuddin said the time was ripe for IPB alumni to

Top U.S. officials defend `Operation Casablanca'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with McCaffrey saying later he wanted a ``better'' way
to conduct future investigations; gives full Reno quote and adds
quote at end. &QL; 
 &UR; With UN-Drug Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The top U.S. drug policy official Monday
defended using U.S. undercover agents in a money-laundering sting
in Mexico but acknowledged ``there is room'' for better tactics in
the cross-border war on drugs.
	   Mexico has criticized the three-year ``Operation Casablanca'' as
a violation of its sovereignty. U.S. undercover agents appear to
have operated in Mexico without the government's approval of the
sting, which netted 160 indictments and the seizure of millions of
dollars and several tons of drugs.
	   Retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey defended the operation in a news
briefing with Attorney General Janet Reno and other U.S. officials
during the U.N. General Assembly special session on drugs.
	   Echoing many of the speakers Monday, McCaffrey said one country
cannot fight the drug problem alone.
	   ``We have to do this in partnership with our neighbors and with
absolute respect and deference for their own sovereign
institutions,'' said McCaffrey, director of the White House Office
of National Drug Control Policy.
	   He acknowledged, however, ``there is room here for us to look
through how we can even more effectively coordinate these
(operations) in the future.''
	   Later, he told reporters that while the United States was proud
of the job the U.S. agents did, ``we'll just have to find a way to
do this better in the future.''
	   Reno pledged that the U.S.-Mexican effort to fight drugs was
still on course.
	   ``In any investigation, there may be problems that arise, but we
always work through those for the ultimate goal of real impact on
drug trafficking and money laundering, which threaten the people of
both nations,'' she said.
	   In his speech to the General Assembly earlier Monday, Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo referred indirectly to the operation,
which has prompted Mexican officials to call for the extradition of
the U.S. agents to face trial.
	   He called for a ``balanced strategy ... so that no one can
become the judge of others; and no one feels entitled to violate
other countries' laws for the sake of enforcing its own.''
	   U.S. officials have said they needed to keep the operation
secret to ensure the safety of American agents.
	   ``It is not a matter of disrespect,'' Reno said in explaining
why Mexican _ and even top U.S. officials _ were not informed of
the sting. The goal, she said, was to conduct an investigation
``while at the same time protecting the lives of the agents
involved.''

	   Bogor Regent Eddie Yoso Martadipura has abruptly canceled the
appointment of his son-in-law Iskandar as the new head of the
town's planning agency, saying that the latter has not yet received
the governor's decree for the job.
	   Eddie was supposed to install Iskandar together with other
senior officers on Friday.
	   A day before the installation ceremony, dozens of local
businesspeople thronged into the council chamber, demanding the
cancellation of Iskandar's appointment as part of the reform
movement to end nepotistic practices.
	   According to the entrepreneurs, Iskandar was chosen for the
appointment by leapfrogging over the normal procedural
requirements.
	   The protesters also urged the councilors to probe the business
practices of Eddie's son, Dani, who they said was involved in a
series of megaprojects organized by the regency office.
	   The projects allegedly included the development of the Rp 1
billion new regency office complex at Cibinong, the Rp 1.3 billion
regent's official residence and the Rp 10 billion Islamic Center,
they were quoted by Antara as saying.
	   ``Almost all megaprojects here fall into the hands of Eddie's
son and relatives,'' said head of the Bogor chapter of the
Indonesian Employers Association (Apindo), Kaswarin.
	   The businesspeople also demanded that town council speaker Eso
Soekarso resign for his alleged collusion during his two five-year
terms with the Bogor regent. This reportedly made the council
unable to properly control the regency office's actions. (bsr)

	   SHAH ALAM, Sat. - Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar, who
marked his first anniversary in office today, described the past
year as one of the most challenging he has ever faced.
	   He said although he had expected added responsibilities and
problems when he took over the post, some of them had caught him by
surprise.
	   ``I knew that being a Menteri Besar meant bigger
responsibilities compared to being a Federal Minister, but due to
the economic difficulties and the extended drought, the past one
year has been more difficult than I had imagined.
	   ``However, I am very grateful to those who have been very
supportive of me, especially the public servants, Barisan Nasional
leaders, the Federal Government, private sector, the media and the
Sultan of Selangor.
	   ``Without their support, it would have been much tougher for
me,'' he told reporters after opening a discourse on culture titled
Cultural Reformation Towards the New Millenium at the Shah Alam
Municipal Council banquet hall.
	   About 500 people attended the one-day programme which was
jointly organised by the State Umno liaison committee and the State
Ummo Youth and Wanita wings.
	   He said the economic and water problems needed to be tackled in
a rational manner.
	   He reiterated that both problems were not anyone's fault and
finger- pointing was not the way to solve them.

	   Private gold mining company PT Newmont Minahasa Raya (PTMNR)
reported an increase in gold production to 58,000 ounces in the
first quarter of this year, 49 percent more than the 39,000 ounces
produced in the same period last year.
	   Company general manager Paul Lahti said the increase was due to
growing mining and processing operations and the improved
infrastructure in the Messa area of North Sulawesi.
	   ``The increase in production has also helped to offset the
negative impact of the depressed gold price market,'' Lahti said.
	   Lahti said the company intended to stick to its planned mining
and processing operations.
	   ``Hopefully, by virtue of trickle down economics, local
businesses will continue to benefit from our operation. Newmont
purchases many of its supplies and materials for daily operations
locally,'' Lahti said.
	   Lahti added that the company's commitment to developing business
and infrastructure in the local area, and initiatives to provide
basic foodstuffs to lower income residents would continue as
planned.
	   He said that a public market and terminal facility had just been
constructed. ``Construction of a community health center and a
school library is currently underway,'' he added.
	   Newmont Minahasa is 80 percent owned by Newmont Gold Company of
the United States. The remaining 20 percent is owned by local
company PT Tanjung Serapung.
	   PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara also reported that 40 percent of the
construction works for a gold and copper mining project in Jereweh
district, Sumbawa, West Nusa Tenggara, had been completed despite
the monetary crisis.
	   Construction of the Benete port, township and access road had
been completed and an electricity supply installed, the company
reported.
	   A meeting to discuss how to lessen the blow to the local economy
resulting from a decline in required labor in the next phase of the
project took place between the company and the West Nusa Tenggara
administration.
	   Four thousand six hundred workers are currently employed by PT
Fluor Daniel Indonesia, Newmont's construction contractor, in the
Batu Hijau area of the island.
	   PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara, established in 1986, is 45 percent
owned by Newmont Gold Company. Sumitomo Corp. of Japan holds a 35
percent stake and the remainder is owned by PT Pukuafu Indah, a
local company controlled by businessman Jusuf Merukh.
	   The construction phase on the project is expected to last for
approximately 36 months. The mine will have a production period of
between 22 and 30 years and a production capacity of 120,000 tons
of ore per day, 1,589 tons concentrate production per day, copper
production of 203,000 tons per year, gold production of 14.1 tons
per year and silver production of 45.6 tons per year. (gis)

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian strongman Gen. Sani Abacha died
Monday of a heart attack at age 54, ending the latest in a long
string of military dictatorships in his oil-rich but impoverished
country.
	   A uniformed officer stood before the State House in the capital,
Abuja, to make the announcement. Martial music filled the
state-controlled radio airwaves to officially mark his death.
Unofficially, his myriad critics and opponents poured into the
streets of Lagos to celebrate. Top officials convened an emergency
meeting.
	   Jubilant crowds in some Lagos neighborhoods defied the normally
heavily police presence to began cheering at the news of Abacha's
death.
	   ``This death gives us an opportunity to restart our lives,''
said opposition leader Soloman Lar. ``It is our hope that Nigeria
will not miss that chance.''
	   Despite the celebrations, uncertainty loomed as the question of
succession remained unanswered.
	   In life, Abacha offered little indication of who might take his
place, wielding absolute power in Africa's most populous nation
ever since canceling presidential elections in 1993 and seizing
power in a bloodless coup.
	   Less than two months ago, Abacha's deputy leader, Gen. Oladipyo
Diya was sentenced to death for allegedly plotting the overthrow of
the military regime.
	   Two likely successors, however, include Nigeria's chief of
defense, Staff Maj. Gen. Abdul Abubakar Salam, and Lt. Gen.
Jeremial Useni, the minister for the capital territory of Abuja.
	   Western diplomats said Salam, who presided over an emergency
meeting of junta leaders on Monday, was a leading candidate to lead
the country at least over the short term.
	   Without a clear line of succession, Nigeria's many opposition
groups could try to capitalize on a power void.
	   Word of Abacha's death came after soldiers sealed off his home
and office in Abuja. Only the top military brass were permitted to
enter the secluded leader's compound.
	   In keeping with Muslim practice, he was buried in his hometown
of Kano, near the border with Niger, before sundown on Monday,
Radio Lagos reported.
	   The military has long justified its seizing power by saying that
strong central rule is crucial in Nigeria, where rival ethnic
groups have often turned to violence in order to assert power over
one another.
	   Abacha was a pariah abroad for his repressive policies,
including the 1995 hanging of playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
other activists despite worldwide appeals for mercy. The men were
convicted on conspiracy-murder charges that critics called
trumped-up.
	   And he was a recluse at home, rarely venturing far afield,
always wearing dark glasses and never granting news media
interviews.
	   Although he pledged to hand the government over to an elected
civilian administration, in April Abacha became the only nominated
candidate for the presidency.
	   Opposition to his rule has been mounting in recent months with
the prospect that his junta might not honor its pledge to stand
down.

	   Remember when you were in primary school and asked ``What did
Indonesian heroes use to fight against the Dutch in 1945?'' The
answer: Many used bamboo spears.
	   At that time such simple weapons proved to be useful in fighting
for independence.
	   Students and pro-democracy activists employed different tools to
``overthrow'' Soeharto. Instead of fighting with bamboo spears,
swords, guns or tanks, they used banners, placards, the mass media
and the Internet.
	   A few years before they rallied on the streets and on campuses
yelling for total reform, intellectuals, professionals, students
and activists used the Internet as a tool to distribute messages,
carry out discussions and disseminate hard news and opinions.
	   The Internet has become a powerful tool and part of the
infrastructure of the democratic system. Most importantly, it
helped expose the Indonesian democracy struggle to the
international community.
	   There are several homepages and websites which provide articles,
news, other site links, pictures and features on the reform
movement. The web server might be located in Germany, Australia,
the United States, New Zealand or Indonesia, and the editor might
be Indonesian or a foreigner.
	   Corruption, collusion and nepotism, as well as other hot topics
in the country are widely discussed in Internet chat groups.
	   Several popular public figures, organizations and universities,
including sociologist Arief Budiman now in Australia, the
Indonesian Democratic Party and Trisakti University, also have
their own homepages.
	   While surfing through these sites, you can read academic
articles, news and analysis, opinions and letters of support. Words
that were impossible to print in the national press during the
Soeharto era are found here.
	   Some of these sites are relatively new, while others were set up
and registered as many as eight years ago.
	   A few of them, like Indonesia Baru and Xpos, have a magazine or
bulletin layout with editorials and letters from readers. Xpos
provides weekly news and a review of past events for those who
missed previous issues.
	   Gema Madani focuses on former minister Emil Salim, featuring his
background, opinions and thoughts. This site also provided
information on his vice presidential campaign in March.
	   Shocking pictures from the recent riots, more graphic than what
was published in the national press, are also available on the
homepages of IndoProtest -- the only one with advertisements --
LinkExchange Services and Reformasi Indonesia.
	   Before labor activist Muchtar Pakpahan was freed from prison
last month, Reformasi Indonesia provided a special space through
which you could show your support for him. You could sign a letter
prepared by the Council of Churches of the Netherlands and the
trade Union Confederations asking for his release, which was sent
to Soeharto.
	   If you prefer text instead of pictures, you might want to check
out Indo Chaos!!, which provides various articles, including those
on Chinese-Indonesian issues. It also provides ways to contact the
United Nations human rights department and the U.S. Congress for
those seeking human rights protection. Articles by Arief Budiman or
critic George Aditjondro can be found in this site.
	   Watch Indonesia, in English and German, is produced by
Indonesian, German and Portuguese nationals. It emphasizes human
rights issues, intercultural communication and exchange projects.
East Timor is one of the issues discussed here.
	   Another popular site is Indonesia - L, where you can find
archived news articles. During the week of May 25 through June 1
alone, there were 190 news articles, enough to keep you awake a
whole night. This site has operated for almost eight years, and has
thousands of articles. Its editor selects 20 articles out of more
than 300 incoming news articles per day to be presented on the
site.
	   Most sites are free of charge but some have annual subscription
fees. One such site is Indonesia Publication, which produces
Indonesia - L among other sites. Its one-year subscription fee
ranges between US$50 and $200.
	   What makes all of these sites different from mainstream
newspapers or magazines? Mainly the ``freedom to speak''.
Electronic communication is fundamentally characterized by a free
flow of information, feeling and thoughts. On the Internet, people
can speak about anything without censorship. But, does the Internet
provide the truth? That is another question. There is no guarantee
that what is found on the Internet is in reality news.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Maria Reiche, a German mathematician who spent
more than half a century studying and protecting Peru's enigmatic
Nazca Lines, died Monday of cancer. She was 95.
	   Reiche died at a military hospital in Lima. She had been
diagnosed with ovarian cancer on May 8.
	   Also known as ``the Lady of the Lines,'' Reiche was captivated
by the vastness and solitude of the Nazca plains, which cover a
35-mile (60-km) stretch of desert and are Peru's major tourist
attraction after Machu Picchu.
	   ``When I do die, I want to be buried in this fascinating place,
which I love so much,'' she said.
	   Threats to the lines have included vandalism, a government
project to ``reconstruct'' the drawings, acid rain from mining
operations in nearby mountains and even a plan to flood the plains
for agriculture.
	   Reiche fought them all alone.
	   ``This precious thing should be treated like a very fragile
manuscript that is guarded in a special room in a library,'' she
once said.
	   Her death left many Peruvians wondering about the fate of the
lines, which she protected by paying guards with money she earned
from the sale of her book about the drawings.
	   ``Maria Reiche's death saddens all Peruvians, particularly
archaeologists, because, with her, we had the certainty that this
ancient legacy of Peru would be preserved '' said Federico
Kauffmann-Doig, one of Peru's leading archaeologists. ``And now
that she is dead, all this work is in danger.''
	   After years of study, Reiche concluded that the designs
represented a giant calendar linked to the movements of the sun,
moon and constellations, which told ancient desert dwellers when to
plant and irrigate crops.

	   The Liquid Crystal Display, or LCD, is not a new technology. You
have it almost on every gadget that you wear today: Your
wristwatch, your pager, your cell phone, your Personal Digital
Assistant (PDA), and, certainly, your notebook computer. This
display technology has evolved slowly but remarkably.
	   Today, the best type of LCD screens uses the Thin Film
Transistor (TFT), active matrix technology. On the low end you have
LCD screens that use the Dual Scan Twisted Nematic (DSTN), or
passive matrix, which is typically found in today's budget
notebook. Somewhere in between is a newcomer, the Advanced Display
System, or ADS. A growing number of leading notebook makers are
already using the ADS technology, which offers high contrast and
brightness levels closer to those of the TFT LCD but is much
cheaper to implement.
	   Since a couple of years back, the LCD monitors have migrated
from the notebooks to the desktops. They are beginning to replace
the power hungry and emission-rich Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), the type
of monitors that most of us are still using today. Almost all of
the LCD monitors use TFT, and they all cost a fortune.
	   Personally, I would really love to have an LCD monitor to
replace my 20'' Sony 2038. Not because this gorgeous monitor of
mine has begun showing its age, but more because I am getting
concerned with the impact of the electromagnetic emission that it
has subjected me to. I stare at it for hours every day, and because
of my myopia my eyes are only 5 to 6 inches away from the
faceplate. An LCD monitor does not produce electromagnetic
emission, and therefore it would be safer to my eyes, and yours,
too.
	   Unfortunately, the price of an LCD monitor -- also known as
``flat panel monitor -- is typically still about three times higher
than a comparable CRT monitor. Remember that a 14'' LCD monitor is
usually capable of producing a display at 1024 by 768 resolution.
It means that there are 1024 dots, or pixels, from the left edge of
the screen to the right edge, and there are 768 dots from top to
bottom. For an LCD monitor of this size, a comparable CRT will be
the 17'' monitor, which is capable of producing the same level of
resolution.
	   Courtesy of Siemens Nixdorf (SNI), I was able to test drive a
13.8'' LCD monitor that they had introduced during last year's
CeBIT in Hannover, Germany. A gorgeous monitor, the MCF3501T is
capable of displaying 1024 by 768 pixels and 16.7 million of
colors. Because it uses the so-called Panel Link method of
transmitting display data from the system to the monitor, it also
comes with a proprietary graphics card.
	   Space saving
	   The depth of a typical CRT monitor is usually slightly larger
than the diagonal dimension. So, for a 17'' monitor, the depth of
the cabinet is usually more than 17''. A new technology enables
monitor makers to design the so-called ``short-depth'',
``slimline'', or even ``short-neck'' monitors. In this new monitor
design, the depth measures up to 3'' less than the diagonal
dimension of the CRT. Still, they can fill up cramped work cubicles
very easily.
	   An LCD monitor, on the other hand, requires a very minimal space
on our desk. Perching on its standard base, the MCF3501T occupies a
space as deep as the keyboard. If you like, you can buy the
optional pivotal arm and rotate the monitor 90 degrees to have a
vertical display as in the accompanying picture. The standard base
is heavy enough to keep the monitor steady, and it can swivel to
give you the perfect viewing angle. The hinge at the back of the
monitor also lets you tilt the monitor as necessary.
	   To power the monitor, SNI provides a power adapter similar to
the one you usually find in a notebook. I wonder why SNI did not
simply place the transformer in the base to reduce cable clutter.
Anyway, the power consumption is 30 watts at the max, which is
probably less than one-third of the power drawn by a typical CRT
monitor.
	   There is only one button on the monitor, and it controls
brightness. There is no need for other controls, as the signals
sent by the CPU are digital. We usually have more controls in a CRT
monitor because the signals it receives from the CPU are analog.
However, because of my limited vision, I do wish MCF3501T had a
higher contrast level. It would make it easier for me to read the
text on the screen. Normal eyes will have no problem reading the
text, though.
	   The colors are brilliant. CorelPhoto-Paint image is displayed
very beautifully. Cursor movement leaves no trails or shadows
behind. The brightness level is relatively uniform all over the
screen. SNI claims that you still can view the image at the angles
of 60 degrees horizontally and 30 degrees vertically.
	   An LCD monitor is completely flicker-free and unlike the CRT, an
LCD monitor doesn't have any electron gun that lights up the
phosphors on the face glass to create an image. Therefore, an LCD
monitor doesn't emit as much radiation as a typical CRT.
	   For architects, design engineers, graphics designers and
computer artists, a flat screen also means distortion free images.
Lines are perfectly straight, and CAD users love it. Besides,
displayed text is as sharp at the edges as it is in the center.
	   The most glaring downside of the LCD monitors is, as mentioned
before, their steep prices. Although the prices have come down
significantly, they are still unaffordable for most users. There's
a good reason for the high cost, though. Since each pixel in a TFT
monitor such as the MCF3501T has three transistors--one for red,
one for green and one for blue, the total number of transistors
that must be knitted closely to each other is more than 2.3
million. The LCD panel of MCF3501T, for example, requires nine
process stages in clean-room conditions. However, when quality
control finds that there are more than 20 defective transistors on
the panel, the entire thing should be trashed. This makes the
manufacturing costs of this type of monitor extremely high.
	   Incidentally, if you decide to join the exclusive club of
flat-screen monitor users, the first thing you should check is
whether the TFT panel has too many ``dead pixels''. You should
never buy a monitor of this caliber without thoroughly examining
its condition.

	   People once only dared whisper about the reputed staggering
wealth of Soeharto and his family.
	   But the silence has ended on the public secret, accompanied by a
clamor of accusations the fortune was ill-gotten through rampant
corruption, collusion and nepotism.
	   The three misdeeds -- conveniently clumped under their
Indonesian initials KKN in public parlance -- have caused huge
losses to the state. A group of people founded the Movement of
Concerned Citizens on State Assets (Gempita) last month to try to
salvage some of what rightfully belongs to a people now quaking in
the terrible economic crisis.
	   A member is Baharuddin Lopa, secretary-general of the National
Commission on Human Rights.
	   Lopa was born in Mandar, South Sulawesi, in 1935, and graduated
in law from Hasanuddin University in Ujungpandang in 1962. He
received his doctorate from Diponegoro University in Semarang,
Central Java.
	   He started his career as a prosecutor at the Ujungpandang
prosecutor's office in 1958. From 1982 to 1986, he was chief of the
South Sulawesi provincial prosecutor's office. Known for his tough
court demeanor, Lopa handled several corruption cases involving
billions of rupiah before he was transferred to the Ministry of
Justice. After serving as an expert staff at the ministry for two
years, he became director general of correctional affairs
(1988-1995).
	   Highly respected for his discipline and integrity, Lopa joined
the National Commission of Human Rights in 1993.
	   He talked with The Jakarta Post last week.
	   Question: Why did you set up Gempita?
	   Answer: It is to build moral strength in society and speed up
the collection of data on national assets which have been
misappropriated. We will collect data from the public and then
convey them to the Attorney General's Office.
	   We do not have any executive power, and Gempita is not binding.
Anyone can give the data directly to the Attorney General's Office.
	   What has the public response been to Gempita?
	   The public has made a quick response. Gempita was established on
Friday evening (May 29), and at dawn the following day I had
already received two phone calls about state assets which were
misappropriated. I asked them to put it in writing and provide the
supporting data to Gempita's office (Jl. Mega Kuningan Barat 1,
Jakarta 12950, Ph. 576-988, Fax. 576-0987).
	   I told my colleagues we have to be careful, we have to pay
attention to accuracy of the reports.
	   It is widely reported that Soeharto and his family have
misappropriated state assets. Is this why you set up Gempita?
	   Gempita does not deal with Soeharto only, but all state assets
which were stolen. Well, the reports (about Soeharto's wealth) are
one of the factors that made us establish Gempita. The focus of our
activities in Gempita will be based on the data we obtain from the
public.
	   Foreign reports said Soeharto and his family's wealth is worth
about US$40 billion.
	   We don't refer to the reports, but on the data from the public.
	   Opposition leader Amien Rais said Soeharto should return his
wealth to the state. He also called on the people to ``forgive''
him if he voluntarily donated 95 percent of his wealth.
	   In my opinion, whatever we do in Indonesia, we have to be on the
legal tract. So, whoever is involved (in corruption), he or she
must be handled in accordance with the law because Indonesia
respects the supremacy of law.
	   The solution (from Amien) is not in line with the law. If there
is an indication that one committed a crime, for example
corruption, the suspect must be tried and if found guilty, then all
of the wealth obtained from corruption must be confiscated for the
state.
	   If we settle things not in accordance with the law, this will
create legal uncertainty. This is not educative and dangerous. It
could encourage other people to commit corruption because they are
not prosecuted. It could become a bad precedent. Other presidents
(who are involved in corruption) will ask for the same.
	   Later on, if he (Soeharto) is proven guilty but you really take
pity on him and you don't want him to stay behind bars, there is
another way. After his accountability is completed and the wealth
obtained illegally has been confiscated for the state, the
President (B.J. Habibie) can give him the pardon. So it is like in
South Korea -- after Kim Dae-Jung became president, he pardoned the
(jailed) former presidents (Chun Doo-Hwan and Roh Tae-Woo).
	   And by doing so, there will be legal certainty for Soeharto. If
you release him right away after he gives the money -- without any
trial -- what is the legal basis? There is no legal certainty for
Soeharto. At anytime, he can be arrested again.
	   How about the call for a travel ban on Soeharto and his family?
	   To impose the travel ban, the government doesn't need the
evidence (of crimes). If the government sees indications that their
traveling abroad could give them the chance to hide their wealth or
cause problems relating to the efforts to save the state assets,
the government can impose the travel ban.
	   How about their human rights?
	   We have the principle of presumption of innocence. Before they
are found guilty and before there is a court decision which has
fixed legal power, we should assume that they are not guilty.
	   What should we do first if we want to settle Soeharto's case in
accordance with the law?
	   We have to base it on the Criminal Code Procedures and our legal
officers must be ready to take necessary actions. People will keep
an eye on them.
	   Experience shows that it is not easy to prove corruption.
	   We need to improve our corruption law. Under the current law, it
is the prosecutors who should prove the charges. It is necessary to
shift the burden of proof to the defendants, so that they will be
required to prove that they are not guilty.
	   But with the law that we already have, if everybody works hard
and honestly, the results will be quite sufficient.
	   How do you see the honesty of our legal officers?
	   Honesty is a must. The government must improve the quality of
human resources. We need tough officers.
	   Even though the law is perfect, if the officers are not ready
and they are not tough, there won't be any sufficient achievements.
Officials who are not qualified must be replaced. I don't have to
mention names.
	   You earlier said that you will convey the data about
misappropriated state assets to the Attorney General's Office. But
experience shows that the authorities do not follow up your
findings on certain cases, such as those on Marsinah (a labor
activist murdered in 1993) and the tragic incidents related to the
takeover of the Indonesian Democratic Party's headquarters from
Megawati Soekarnoputri in 1996.
	   Gempita does not have the authority to investigate the case, to
confiscate the wealth and to detain the corruptors. That's the
authority of the police and prosecutors. We only give them the
data, but I think this will help them.
	   If the government does not follow up on our reports ... don't
ask me. I can't give the answer, I am not within the system. You
must ask the attorney general or the President.
	   Now that the situation has changed, will you put pressure on the
government to follow up on your previous findings?
	   They probably did not follow up our findings and froze the cases
because of psychological burdens. Now that the burden has been
lifted, there is no reason to cover them up.
	   There has been a strong demand to probe Soeharto's wealth only
after he resigned. Can't we probe an incumbent president's wealth?
	   Of course we can. The law says so. Any suspect, whatever his or
her position, can be examined. But in the past, people were afraid.
	   Were you afraid?
	   Of course not. I investigated many corruption cases when I was a
prosecutor in Ujungpandang. But then I was transferred to Jakarta
and become director general of correctional affairs. I was given a
higher rank, I become a first echelon official, but I had less
power, I could not prosecute people.
	   You were a prosecutor for a long time. You must know how
difficult it is to handle a corruption case. What are the main
obstructions?
	   In my case, it was not that difficult because I did not discuss
beforehand with the central office (the Attorney General's Office).
I know that if I discussed it first there would be a lot of
problems.
	   Are you saying the Attorney General's Office did not have the
political will to combat corruption?
	   Maybe they have it now.
	   You were stripped of your post as a prosecutor in the 1980s. Do
you see any change in the current situation?
	   Things should be improved. It is important to have tough
officers. And there should not be too much interference (from the
Attorney General's Office). If there are good officers, let them
handle the cases by themselves thoroughly. Give them freedom to
work.
	   We need to improve both the law and the quality of legal
officers. If we have not been able to improve the law, at least the
quality of the people must be improved so that they can do their
jobs well.
	   How did you become a member of the Human Rights Commission?
	   When the committee was established (in 1993) Soeharto appointed
(former chief justice) Ali Said as the chairman and then Ali Said
made a list of the members. I was included in the list. He then
gave the list to Soeharto for approval. Soeharto did not have any
reason to reject my presence in the committee. Maybe he thought the
committee had no teeth and that I would not be able to make any
arrests.
	   How do you see the rampant practices of corruption, collusion
and nepotism here?
	   These have taken place for a long time. To avoid such practices,
there are two things to be done. First, one should not be in power
for quite a long time. Second, don't accumulate the power.
	   How long is the appropriate time to hold power?
	   For a president, two terms is the longest one.
	   What is your comment on Habibie?
	   Let him work first. He said he would make a new law on
elections. What's important is that you have pull the root,
Soeharto.
	   But people said Habibie is part of the root.
	   Well, it's difficult, there are too many parts, but what's
important is to let him work until the end of the election. He has
set the date and promised a fair election. He has to prove his
words.

	   The nation has just witnessed a critical turning point with the
downfall of Soeharto. While the throne has yet to cool, the arena
he left behind has turned full circle.
	   People are almost possessed with the power to express everything
they could only say in a whisper or to the closest confidants just
two weeks ago.
	   Less than a week after Soeharto resigned, the press dug its
claws in and printed sensational stories under bold headlines of
``Soeharto and his family's wealth'', forbidden territory a week
before.
	   We are now almost as democratic as the United States, or so it
appears. Our people are free to defame their (new) president. They
are free to probe and speculate about his alleged wealth and
history of nepotism. We are no longer sweet, polite, submissive
citizens.
	   Soeharto's biggest mistake, typical of the leader of an
authoritarian regime, was his vehement intransigence against the
law of nature: change.
	   He failed to take notice of how equally oppressive ideologies,
such as communism, have collapsed and been consigned to the trash
heap of history for their inflexibility and inability to respond to
change. He refused to learn from other dictators, such as Marcos,
Mobutu Sese Seko, or ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier who were banished from
their ivory towers through people power. He was complacent amid his
bootlicking subordinates and cronies, in the certain knowledge that
he was invincible.
	   He willfully chose to cultivate the hypocrisy of a patronage
culture well known as the ABS (Asal Bapak Senang, meaning ``as long
as sir is happy'') mentality among his people. He demanded total
loyalty and rewarded it accordingly, while opposition was
unpalatable and punished under the obtuse and dictatorial national
security laws. He astutely, if vulgarly, invented a twisted,
selective and self-serving interpretation of the Constitution and
the state's ideology, Pancasila, in such a way that any challenge
to his rule and ``divinity'' would be a threat to the fundamental
principles of the nation.
	   His penchant for Javanese philosophy was instilled in his life
principles, but his selective interpretation led Sri Sultan
Hamengkubuwono X to overtly criticize his perverted rendition of
the highly revered ancient wisdom.
	   So the loyalty he earned from his people was skin-deep. It was
motivated by materialism and, thus, frail. In his final moments,
many of his most ``faithful'' entourage, the very ones who
regularly extended adulation toward him, turned their backs on him
knowing his days were numbered. His predecessor Sukarno, on the
other hand, decades after his death still inspires loyalty and
respect in millions of Indonesians.
	   His legacy is a failing, feudal and tyrannical system which is
woefully plagued by corruption, collusion, cronyism and nepotism.
His 32-year rule has given birth to and raised the most backward
and inefficient bureaucratic patriarchy one can possibly imagine in
a so-called civilized society.
	   For about 30 years this system was so highly geared to work to
his advantage that up to a few weeks before he stepped down, no one
in the country ever expected that he could be displaced so quickly.
He was widely acknowledged as one of the most powerful leaders in
the world. Though people could sense that his end was imminent,
nobody was quite sure that it would happen anytime soon. They
thought it would take at least another five years, when his
leadership term ended and that even then he would live on through
the hands of others.
	   Things began deteriorating quickly and reached a point of no
return after May 11 when four Trisakti students were brutally
killed. The ball was rolling, the people ran with it and played it
well. And even ``invincible'' Soeharto could not stop it because
the momentum was just too great.
	   It was collective ignorance systematically cultivated by the
regime that prompted average Indonesians to misdirect their angst
toward the wrong targets. Our conscience was too long anesthetized
by opting to go with the flow and taking for granted all the
anomalies around us every single day for 32 years.
	   We quietly complained about it but were not aware that we had
been a willing part of the rotten system we defamed. The Holocaust
did not happen because of one person's evil but because of millions
of Germans' silence and indifference.
	   Our people have been fast asleep until recently when students,
free from any vested interests, pioneered for the second time since
May 20, 1908, what will be known as the re-resurrection of the
people.
	   We have truly been led into a treacherous abyss; the economic
crisis does not look like ending anytime soon and, if anything, it
seems to be getting worse. This is the abyss, the state of being in
which we live at this very moment and for weeks to come.
	   Time and again, in the course of less than two weeks, we have
witnessed how intellectually shallow and morally defective many of
our leaders are. Those who were well known as the staunchest
propagators of the status quo collectively changed their
orientation and, as could be expected from such people, followed
wherever the current might bring them.
	   Yesterday it was the New Order Haven, today it is the Reform
Beach. Tomorrow it will surely be a different paradise. These
political chameleons are, without the slightest embarrassment, busy
repositioning themselves so they can be a part of reform euphoria.
They expect to share a portion of the reform cake.
	   Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid has only recently talked about his
conscience when pressed to resign from his position as minister of
home affairs due to his active and direct involvement in the
engineered dismantling of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)
under Megawati's leadership when he was the chief of sociopolitical
affairs of the Armed Forces.
	   He claimed that his conscience led him to support the students'
request that Soeharto step down, risking a recall from his faction.
He did not explain though why his conscience came into play only in
the last moments of Soeharto's rule, when the strong current for
reform could no longer be contained.
	   Where was his conscience when he vigorously defamed Megawati's
supporters and accused the Democratic People's Party (PRD) of the
July 27, 1996 riot, while perhaps knowing that the government was
actually behind this rotten scenario? Could it have been instant
repentance? He was only a soldier carrying out his duty, so he
said.
	   And what is there left to say about Harmoko? There is an amusing
anecdote about how he could be in his current position as speaker
of the People's Consultative Assembly and the House of
Representatives. It was said that Soeharto was interviewing a few
of his potential candidates for key positions in the government. He
asked what one plus one makes to Fuad Bawazier who answered two.
Thinking how accurate he was, Soeharto assigned him to the finance
minister position.
	   He asked the same question to Bob Hasan, who answered that the
answer could be arranged. Thinking how flexible he was, Soeharto
assigned him to the trade and industry minister position. When
Harmoko got his turn, the answer was, ``That will be according to
your guidance, Bapak''.
	   The question remains: Will we repeat the same mistakes by
letting our country be ruled by political clowns lacking integrity?
Will we let them steal the victory of the reform movement from the
students and the people in general?
	   We have won the initial battle but total reform requires total
dismantling of the old system together with its cancerous agents.
It is a quest with no compromise. And our destination is still far
away along the rocky road and treacherous turns.
	   The writer is a consultant of Ernst and Young.
	   Window: And what is there left to say about Harmoko? There is an
amusing anecdote about how he could be in his current position as
speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly and the House of
Representatives

	   Waves of student demonstrations helped force Soeharto to resign,
but the demands for reinstatement of the people's sovereignty are
still far off the target.
	   B.J. Habibie's appointment as president does not reflect a
manifestation of the people's democracy at all because he was
Soeharto's choice.
	   This was done by virtue of the stipulations of Article 8 of the
1945 Constitution. Moreover, constitutional reasons were put
forward by the political elite in circles such as the military,
political parties and the functional group Golkar.
	   In other words, the Habibie government is only an extension of
the Soeharto government. Habibie's endeavors to meet part of the
reform demands like the release of several political detainees,
consent for establishing new labor unions and political parties,
are only a gesture which has failed to sever the link between the
Habibie and Soeharto governments.
	   Constitutional reasons presented by some legal experts tend to
mislead. The transfer of power from Soeharto to Habibie is indeed
based on Article 8 of the 1945 Constitution which reads: ``Whenever
the President is hampered in carrying out his duty, passes away or
is unable to perform his duty, the Vice President replaces the
President for the remainder of his term of office.''
	   Is this adequate? The answer is no. If this constitutional
reason is followed, the application of Article 8 of the 1945
Constitution shall be followed by the revocation of People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) Decree No. IV/MPR/1998 on the
appointment of the president and MPR Decree No. VI/MPR/1998 on the
appointment of the vice president.
	   All this must be done by the MPR through a special session. A
new MPR decree that appoints and inaugurates Habibie as the new
president must be issued.
	   Therefore, the argument that Habibie's appointment as president
is legally defective is not without basis. If the constitutional
rationality is to be used, it should be used consistently, and not
in parts just for the purpose of justification.
	   Can the constitutional reason be used in its entirety. The reply
is definitely no. Soeharto's 32-year rule was full of systematic
and sometimes brutal constitutional violations.
	   Therefore, it is highly groundless to speak in a constitutional
way in seeking a solution to the current problems of the nation and
the state.
	   Constitutional violations have been widespread since 1974 when a
number of newspapers and magazines were banned, then in 1975 when
the number of political parties was limited to three and a national
consensus was reached on the appointment of MPR members by the
president.
	   Also, the introduction of the ``floating mass'' system,
depolitization, the trade union monopoly and the ``control'' over
professional groups like farmers and fishermen.
	   Consider also the referendum on the change to the 1945
Constitution which clearly violated Article 37 of the 1945
Constitution. The list of violations is endless.
	   The short list above shows that the constitutional logic has
been exploited for a long time to perpetuate the power system, even
though the latter itself is full of violations of the spirit of the
Constitution.
	   It should be remembered that the Constitution is a living
document; it must be interpreted in accordance with the development
and demands of the time.
	   Ultimately, the people's voice is decisive, and the people's
voice is not in the elegant DPR/MPR building but in the houses,
food stalls, mosques, churches and ricefields.
	   It was the people's voice that was absorbed and trumpeted by the
student actions throughout the country. The same voice did not ring
a bell to the people's representatives because they are actually
representing the parties.
	   DPR/MPR regulations render them invalid to represent the people.
	   It is in this context that we should not surrender to the
constitutional reason because it forecloses total reform. That is
why we cannot entrust the reform to those who call themselves the
people's representatives.
	   The recent agreement between the President and the DPR/MPR
leadership to carry out a special session at the end of the year or
at the beginning of next year without a fixed schedule is the most
recent example.
	   This agreement is clearly antireform; it emasculates the demands
for reform. The agreement is a pretext to buy time and a political
deal with the clear objective to perpetuate power.
	   This is especially so because the laws on the general election,
political parties and the composition of the new MPR, DPR and the
provincial legislative councils and the new general election
schedule will be discussed in that special session.
	   There are concerns the elections will take place in 2002. Thus,
there is no denying there are an alliance of interests and a
marriage of convenience among the political elite to reject or to
slow down total reform, especially since a total reform will
eliminate the whole political elite now in power.
	   The people want total reform in the sense there is democracy,
the rule of law, human rights and social justice. The country must
be led by new leaders who represent the people's aspirations and
who are committed to all of the above.
	   It is in this context that we see the important meaning of a
transitional government that can be a presidium or a council
consisting of a number of prominent citizens. This presidium or
council will bring us to a democratic general election that will
give birth to a new, definitive government.
	   It is ironic to learn the government's reluctance to reject
total reform. Constitutional reasons are put forward to delay it.
However, if the argument is followed, the change of the laws on the
political parties and the functional group Golkar, the general
election and the composition of the MPR, DPR and provincial
legislatures can be made immediately in the form of a government
regulation in lieu of law.
	   In one month's time such a regulation can be made, and we can
prepare a general election.
	   Through MPR Decree No. V/MPR/1998, the president can decide that
in order to ``safeguard and maintain the unity of the nation and to
prevent and to overcome social upheavals ...'', and without
changing MPR Decree No. II/MPR/1998 that has scheduled the next
general election for 2002, we can hold a general election at the
end of this year or at the latest in one year's time.
	   Is the ``special authority'' not given to the president? It is a
challenge for the president if he really wants to carry out total
reform.
	   The economic and political crisis has gone on for too long. The
wheels of the economy have come to a halt and we are on the brink
of destruction with no equal in history. It is not impossible that
famine will strike. Time is running out.
	   The only way out from this nightmare scenario is to restore the
trust of the community and the investors in the government. That
can only take place by establishing a new government that is not
linked to the former government.

	   British sociologist Basil Bernstein (1958) introduced a theory
of linguistic deficiency, hypothesizing that access to social
privileges depends to a certain extent on one's linguistic ability
to communicate.
	   Socially disadvantaged people are characterized by a restricted
language code, while the socially privileged are associated with an
elaborated code. Although Bernstein's hypothesis was based on
research conducted on native English speakers, his theory has
relevance in the context of Indonesia.
	   The restricted language code is characterized by a lack of
vocabulary, over-repetition of certain words and a lack of
coherence between sentences. In other words, the language is
rhetorically weak. The elaborated language, on the other hand,
employs a rich vocabulary including various logical connectors
which make the discourse fully coherent.
	   Those fluent in the code have a wide vocabulary to draw upon in
the course of building up a discourse in a flexible and
communicative way.
	   Translated into the multilingual and multicultural context of
Indonesia, the restricted language code refers not only to the
command of language as defined above, but also to the state of
monolingualism, especially in minor or ethnic languages.
	   By the same token, the elaborate language can be defined in
terms of the number of languages known.
	   The monolingual, those who are literate in a minor language, get
less access to social and occupational privileges. Those who are
multilingual with a command of a minor language, the national
language and English, will gain higher positions in society and
benefit more from national development.
	   Almost all jobs now require that the applicant be competent in a
foreign language, usually English.
	   Children from poor homes, especially those in rural areas, who
do not develop fluency in the elaborated language code will not
benefit to the full from other schooling, the mass media and
national development, and will therefore stand less chance of
progressing in society.
	   Education in Indonesian should be designed to encourage literacy
in the elaborated language code, which is the formal, public, and
standard variety of the national language. Competence in English
should also be strongly encouraged.
	   It is estimated that over 60 percent of the population live in
rural areas and 27.2 million of the population still live below the
poverty line. These most disadvantaged people live in 20,663
villages scattered across Indonesia.
	   There are thought to be at least 5.72 million illiterate people
in the country, 3.31 million of whom are female. These statistics
are congruent with data on education of the older generations in
Indonesia.
	   The 1990 national census reported that 68. 4 percent of family
heads in rural areas were elementary school dropouts and only 28.8
percent had completed elementary education.
	   In urban areas, 54.4 percent of family heads failed to complete
elementary school while 34.4 percent said they had completed
elementary education.
	   Only 6 percent of family heads graduated from junior high school
or higher institutes of learning.
	   These statistics are alarming and will hinder efforts to develop
the nation into an industrial power.
	   Industrialization cannot be achieved overnight, but must take
place in gradual steps in time with developments in the literacy of
the people.
	   From European history we can see that the literacy rate was
relatively high when the Industrial Revolution began in Britain,
and that the first European countries to import the revolution from
Britain immediately invested some of their profits in basic
education.
	   Indonesia began a literacy campaign in the 1980s through the
community newspaper program. Minister of Information decrees No.
75A/1994 and No. 93/1996 reconfirmed the government's commitment to
literacy development.
	   Fifty newspapers throughout the archipelago were officially
assigned to run community newspaper programs with the objective of
bridging the information gap caused by the linguistic deficiency of
people in rural areas.
	   The program aims to reduce the linguistic deficit evident in
rural areas, which observers believe is correlated to the poorer
economic conditions which are also found in such areas. The
assumption is that improved literacy rates will enhance
participation in the national development program.
	   From my observation of four community newspapers in West Java --
Mitra Desa, Bandung Pos Kandaga, Mitra Dialog, and Mangle
Tepiswiring -- all such publications focus their reporting on rural
development issues which can be seen in the voluminous coverage
which they give to themes like home renovation, cooperatives, water
management, family education and health, family planning,
agricultural counseling, and environmental awareness programs.
	   The emphasis of news in these papers is centered heavily on the
local area where the readership resides.
	   Mitra Dialog, a sister publication of Pikiran Rakyat, is
considered to be the best community newspaper in Indonesia and in
Asia, according to UNESCO criteria. It is classified as a community
newspaper because it focuses on a specified territory, namely the
growing city of Cirebon and the surrounding region. It is an ideal
model for community newspapers in multicultural Indonesia.
	   Community newspapers are still developing in content and
management, but they have been successful in teaching people in
rural areas how to improve education, control air and water
pollution, look after livestock, and create a safer and more
efficient transportation system, which in turn improves the general
standard of living and helps to keep their economy sound.
	   Industrial development should progress hand in hand with
improvements in industrial literacy, because to further develop the
economy people must improve their ability to read and write in the
elaborated language code.
	   The community newspaper program has been an ideal medium through
which to develop literacy, however it has been difficult to
introduce on a nationwide basis because of economic and cultural
factors. The publications are non-profit making and have been
forced to cut pages because of the monetary crisis. It is likely
that many will not survive the lean times which are ahead.
	   Furthermore, listening and speaking skills are more developed
than reading and writing skills in Indonesian society. This gap has
been exacerbated by television, which generally shows programs
which are more visually stimulating but cognitively less
challenging than the printed word.
	   Television is a phenomenon of industrialized society, but to get
the most out of it, people need to be better educated and have
industrial literacy. Only then will they be able to interact
functionally in an industrial society.
	   The writer is a lecturer at Graduate School of the Teachers
Training Institute, Bandung.

Ruling party wins most seats in elections to Parliament chamber

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In an expected outcome, members of Egypt's
ruling National Democratic Party won a majority in mid-term
elections for the upper house of Parliament, according to results
Monday.
	   Of the 88 seats at stakes in the Shura Council, or Consultative
Council, 72 went to NDP members, including 22 that were won
unopposed, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   A re-vote will take place June 14 for the remaining 16 seats,
MENA quoted Interior Minister Habib El-Adly as saying. He did not
say why.
	   President Hosni Mubarak appoints one-third of the Shura
Council's 264 seats, with elections for half the others held every
three years.
	   Among the victorious NDP candidates was the council president
Mustafa Kamal Helmy.
	   Egypt's 13 opposition parties boycotted the elections, saying
they did not trust the polls to be fair. The opposition charged
widespread vote-rigging in the last elections in 1995.
	   The deputies are chosen by popular nationwide vote, but the
upper house has little power, holding only an advisory position to
the lower house, the People's Assembly. The lower house also is
dominated by the NDP.
	   MENA quoted el-Adly as saying that of the 14.3 million eligible
voters, 7.3 million, or 52.1 percent cast their votes during the
balloting Sunday.
	   Of the 628 candidates who entered the race, 19 were excluded as
unworthy by a judicial committee and 190 withdrew.

	   Soehardjo, former president Soeharto's brother-in-law, has quit
his position as director general of customs and excise to give way
to the smooth process of reform at his office.
	   Soehardjo said yesterday he had resigned as of Friday and had
sent his resignation to President B.J. Habibie and a copy to the
finance minister.
	   ``I resigned because I do not consider myself capable of
accelerating reform and modernization in the customs and excise
(office).
	   ``Besides, I want to give an opportunity to the young generation
at the directorate general, because they have more capability and
enthusiasm to speed up reform,'' Soehardjo told The Jakarta Post.
	   In addition, Soehardjo said he had requested an early
retirement, which he would otherwise not be entitled to until 2001.
	   ``Nevertheless, if the customs and excise wants my help, I will
be happy to do so for the smoothness of customs works,'' he said.
	   He denied the assumption that his resignation had anything to do
with the departure of Soeharto from the presidency.
	   ``There is no relation and there was no pressure. I did it based
on my own conscience.''
	   Soehardjo was employed by the customs and excise office in 1960,
just one year after finishing high school. He married Soeharto's
sister, Bris, in 1966, when Soeharto came to power.
	   Upon his resignation, Soehardjo was replaced by the secretary of
the directorate general, Ibrahim Karim, until Habibie elects new
director general.
	   Soehardjo suggested that the President choose an official from
the directorate general to assume his position so that all reform
programs related to customs and excise could be implemented well.
	   ``I think it would be better to select a person from the customs
and excise to be director general because this position needs
special knowledge, especially about international trade, customs
and excise businesses.
	   ``All people of the second echelon at the customs and excise
office are ready and capable to be director general,'' Soehardjo
said.
	   Soehardjo took the position as director general of customs and
excise in 1991, when the government assigned state-owned surveyor
firm PT Surveyor Indonesia to inspect Indonesia's imports.
	   Long-known as a corrupt institution, the customs office lost its
inspection rights in mid-1985 when then president Soeharto
entrusted Geneva-based Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) to
conduct preshipment inspections of imports.
	   Under Soehardjo, the customs office regained its inspection
rights in April last year, when the government implemented the 1995
customs law, which introduced a post-audit system of on-arrival
inspections.
	   Soehardjo said he resigned with relief as he had helped restore
the customs and excise office's rights and duties with the passage
of the customs and excise laws.
	   Soehardjo, however, warned that reform in the customs office
would be meaningless unless business circles also reformed.
	   ``In this time of globalization, and especially in time of
crisis on the part of our country, we all must improve transparency
and implement good business practices. You cannot practice 'hit and
run' business anymore.'' (rid)

	   High interest rates and political uncertainty will continue to
cast a shadow over the capital market in the immediate future,
analysts have said.
	   They said a qualifying comment that last week's debt agreement
allowing Indonesian debtors to reschedule their foreign debts and
an encouraging signal about the disbursement of the International
Monetary Fund's second tranche loan for the country should bring a
fresh wind to the local stock market.
	   But, they said any positive sentiment from the two fundamental
factors would be still overshadowed by local political affairs and
high interest rates, which still stand at over 50 percent per
annum.
	   Moreover, said head of research of Socgen Crosby Securities
Indonesia Goei Siauw Hong, the debt deal, to be effective in
August, would not be enough for many local companies.
	   He said that many local companies were already too weak even to
pay the interest on their foreign debts, which has more than
tripled in terms of rupiah due to the currency's sharp depreciation
against the U.S. dollar since July last year.
	   ``The problem is that most Indonesian borrowers have no
dollar-based income sources,'' another analyst said.
	   Hong said many local companies had not even serviced the
interest payments since January this year due to their ailing
operations and the sharp increase in debts.
	   The debt agreement, which revived the market sentiment for a
while in an euphoric response last week, gave Indonesian
debt-ridden companies eight years to pay off their liabilities and
a three-year grace period in which they need pay only interest.
	   ``Though the deal is good, it just cannot solve the entire
problem because the country's overseas debt is so huge that it is
almost impossible to repay it,'' he said.
	   Dealers said the beleaguered rupiah, which has plunged almost 80
percent in value since July last year, received no respite from the
debt agreement because the currency remained stuck below the 11,500
level against the U.S. dollar.
	   An analyst with Danareksa Sekuritas, Raden Pardede, said that
the country's battered financial market was expected to further
deteriorate due to deepening poverty, spiraling inflation, rising
unemployment and escalating political uncertainty.
	   ``Deepening poverty and food shortages will likely lead people
to stage protests, causing another outbreak of mass unrest in the
coming months,'' he said.
	   Stock analysts and dealers said the likelihood of the release of
the IMF loan package to bring Indonesia out of itseconomic plight
in the weeks ahead would not be able to improve the market
sentiment.
	   ``Even if the IMF releases its fund, its significance has been
undermined because the country is currently struggling with food
shortages,'' Raden said.
	   Indonesia was initially expected to receive US$1 billion in
funding on June 4 but its payment was postponed due to political
turmoil.
	   The IMF has so far disbursed about $4 billion from about $10
billion it pledged in a $43 billion loan package to cope with
Indonesia's worst-ever economic crisis.
	   Stockbrokers and analysts said the country's persistent
political uncertainty remain a major problem for foreign fund
managers to place their funds in the country's dire market.
	   They said that most foreign brokerage firms operating in the
local exchange continue to place large selling orders on the stocks
they held over the past few weeks.
	   They said that foreign investors continued to discard the stocks
especially those linked to former president Soeharto's family and
his associates, like Bimantara Citra, toll-road operator Citra
Marga Nusaphala Persada, noodle maker Indofood Sukses Makmur and
cement maker Indocement Tunggal Perkasa, due to mounting public
calls to investigate their wealth.
	   ``This stocks are likely to remain under selling pressure this
week,'' another broker said.
	   The JSX Composite Index fell 2.56 percent to 409.51 points last
week from 420.26 the previous week.
	   But the average daily turnover rose 25 percent to 304.59 million
shares changing hands last week from 243.49 million shares the
previous week.
	   The average daily transaction value also rose 26 percent Rp
332.87 billion ($30.26 million) last week from Rp 263.43 billion
the previous week.
	   A chief dealer with Bali Securities Hendra Sunarto said trading
activities in the local bourse would remain sluggish due to the
persistent political uncertainty.
	   He said that a slight increase in stock prices on the local
bourse late week was due to the market's euphoric response to the
debt accord between the Indonesian debtors and foreign creditors on
Thursday.
	   ``The mild rise in stock prices was supported by local
speculative buying. It did not reflect the return of foreign
investors' confidence,' he said.

	   The Ministry of Forestry and Plantations is mulling the
possibility of setting a minimum size for forest concession areas
operated by timber companies, a senior official said Friday.
	   Head of the ministry's research and development agency Toga
Silitonga said very small concession areas made it unfeasible to
manage forests in an environmentally sustainable manner.
	   ``Managing larger area of forests will be more profitable and
more economical. Timber companies have to own large areas which can
support their efforts in managing forests in a sustainable
manner,'' Toga said.
	   He said the minimum feasible area would depend on the type of
the wood and the concession location, saying that it would be
better if timber concessionaires managed more than 10,000 hectares.
	   A study on the issue is expected to be completed by the end of
this year. (gis)

	   The publicly-listed flexible packaging manufacturer PT Van der
Horst Indonesia (VDHI) plans to move into the Indonesian oil and
gas sector through a joint venture operation, a top company
official said.
	   VDHI president Hadi Sutanto said on Friday that the oil and gas
sector had the potential to yield a good return on investments.
	   He said the planned business unit, expected to begin operating
in the third quarter of this year, would provide maintenance
services in the oil and gas sector.
	   VDHI manufactures flexible packaging for food sector industries
but is 49 percent owned by Van der Horst Ltd., an engineering
company listed in Singapore.
	   Shares in VDH Singapore were among the most active on the
Singapore Stock Exchange two years ago after two powerful
Indonesian business figures entered the company.
	   Bambang Trihatmodjo, the second son of former president
Soeharto, and Johannes Kotjo, a financier renowned for his ability
to make profits through acquiring listed companies overseas, joined
VDH at the height of the boom years in Southeast Asia.
	   With their talented new management, VDH Singapore went on to win
a number of contracts for Indonesian mega-projects, including the
construction of an oil pipeline and power plants.
	   Hadi, however, stressed that VDHI was no longer linked to the
former first family because Bambang sold his stake in the Singapore
operation last year.
	   Soeharto abruptly relinquished power to his protege B.J. Habibie
last month following political unrest which claimed more than one
thousand lives.
	   Formerly it was almost impossible to win large business
contracts without a link to the Soeharto family, but their name has
now taken on pariah in the corporate boardrooms of the world.
	   VDHI used to be called PT Super Indah Makmur. It went public in
1994, then changed its name to VDHI in 1996 after it was acquired
by the Singapore operation. The company then diversified into the
infrastructure sector after winning contracts to build a toll road
and a US$50 million power plant in Central Java.
	   The toll road project was canceled by the government after the
monetary crisis hit the country in July and the company decided not
to begin construction of the power plant because of the difficulty
of raising funds, again due to the crisis, Hadi said.
	   VDHI reported a 1998 first quarter net profit of Rp 8.97 billion
(US$780,513), compared to Rp 1.8 billion for the whole of 1997.
	   However, operating profit was only Rp 408.18 million this year.
	   Hadi said that the increased net profit was largely caused by a
forex gain resulting from the postponement of a $2.5 million
investment in new machinery.
	   He added that the company's cost-pricing policy and quality
control contributed to its profitability.
	   ``Many packaging companies have become involved in a price war
and some have collapsed, but we have maintained our prices above
basic costs,'' he said. (rei)

	   PETITE Julia Peng looks more like the girl-next-door than a
`powerhouse' songstress but don't let her appearance deceive you.
She is not known as Asia-Pacific's Whitney Houston for nothing.
	   Julia's forte is her ability to hit a level of 22 octaves while
the average singer can only reach 20. However, the unassuming
26-year-old shrugs off such figures, feeling it's not exactly a
feat worth placing so much importance on.
	   ``What is more important is to be able to sing with feeling and
emotion,''
	   she says. ``After all, it is not always necessary to reach such
high notes.''
	   Julia's latest album, Seeing Through You, is a collection of no
less then five music styles - R&AMP;B, world music, skada, the usual
sentimental numbers and opera. She hopes to try all kinds of music
while still hanging on to her first love of R&AMP;B.
	   ``Although I love R&AMP;B, I can't be singing just that or the
audience is bound to get fed-up sooner or later. I need to have
variety.
	   ``A singer's vocals is like an instrument and can be used to
express different things. I want to try everything from a cappella
to Broadway.''
	   And in preparation for expanding her 'instrument', the singer
will be leaving for New York to study vocal training in July or
August.
	   Although Julie admits to having loved singing since she was
three, it was not really her first choice of career.
	   ``I'd always wanted to be a policewoman,'' she reveals. ``But
unfortunately, I failed the entry test for the police academy. Next
on my list was singing... and so here I am.''
	   She began singing in lounges after completing her high school
education and while doing the club circuit, she was discovered by
talent scouts and roped into the recording studio.
	   Although she has released three albums to date, Julia still
finds live performances more stimulating and challenging.
	   ``Singing live has more soul and energy and it doesn't matter
even if you miss a note or two,'' she recalls. ``What you need to
do is to control the audience's feelings.
	   ``As a singer, I am responsible in breaching the gap between
singer and audience.'' Cocking her head to one side and grinning,
Julia proceeds to let us in on her secret in setting the mood for
her audience.
	   ``First, I use my voice to get the audience's attention. Then, I
single out one who is not paying as much attention as the others.
To get him involved, I would ask him to sing along to a part of my
song. It usually works.''
	   In perfect control while on stage, Julia at first hit a problem
in the recording studio.
	   ``The first time I recorded a song, I felt that I sounded really
bad!''
	   she exclaims. ``I couldn't accept that I had sung so badly. This
is because in the studio, every note is amplified and one can't
afford to make the slightest mistake. ``Fortunately, it got better
as I went along and gained more experience.''
	   Well, her debut album itself sold over 150,000 copies in Taiwan
and she was named the Best New Artiste there, so she definitely
couldn't be as bad as she made her first attempt out to be.
	   Now, the lady's biggest dream is to hold a concert with a live
band in attendance. She would also like to take the band into the
recording studio with her! Her dream might soon be coming true as
her recording company has plans for her to invade the China market
as well. But not to worry, she won't forget her fans in Malaysia.
She will be back, she says.
	   Julia was in town recently to plug her latest album which was
released under BMG. With her was label-mate You Hong Ming.
	   Composer-singer You has been on the scene for five years and has
written over 200 songs, many of which became hits sung by Andy Lau,
Mindy Quah and Chiu Hai Zheng. But if you think his music is
beautiful, just wait until you hear him sing.
	   A Day; 10 Thousand Years is You's sixth album and is a
collection of the songs he wrote for other singers. However, there
are two new compositions, namely the title track and Love Me.
	   ``Love Me is a very feminine song and I had some trouble during
the recording,'' You admits. ``I had to find a way to present it
from a guy's point of view. After all, there are moments when men
too need to say `love me'.''
	   Indeed, he sings it wonderfully well too. But because most of
the songs in the album had been popularised by other singers, You
had to make sure he did not end up imitating their style.
	   As a result, he spent more time in the recording studio giving
each one a new life and a touch of himself. After listening to the
album, I am quite sure that You is as good a singer as he is a
composer and when you combine the two... well, you've got a winner.
	   You has plans to compose a number for Julia who was earlier
lamenting that she's never had the opportunity to sing one of his
compositions.
	   ``I want to get to know her better first,'' he says. ``That will
enable me to write something that is suitable for her. We want
quality and not quantity, right?''
	   You loves to travel and is away from home for a large part of
the year.
	   Travelling gives him fresh ideas for composing but laments that
writing lyrics is much more difficult.
	   ``You have to be really experienced to write moving lyrics,'' he
says. ``I think I'll stick to composing.'' Besides Julia, You is
also writing songs for other singers and he would especially like
to write for Jacky Cheung who he feels can really bring out the
essence of the song he sings.

	   ABOUT 20 foreign companies are said to be eyeing for a stake in
Janamanjung Sdn Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd's wholly-owned
power-producing subsidiary managing the 2,000MW plant in Manjung,
Perak.
	   And with Janamanjung expecting a sizeable cost overrun in
getting the plant ready by 2002, it may just have to turn to one or
more of the foreign suitors.
	   Tenaga executive chairman Datuk Dr Ahmad Tajuddin Ali said while
the company is still looking at ways to manage the project,
``Janamanjung is a possible candidate for foreign direct
investment''.
	   ``It is possible that the total cost of the project may increase
to close to RM7 billion. This would perhaps be too big for
Janamanjung to handle alone,'' he told Business Times.
	   Tenaga had initially expected the cost to be RM5 billion. The
coal-fired plant in Manjung is scheduled to start commercial
operations by the year 2002.
	   Sources said UK-based National Power Plc is one of the parties
interested in Janamanjung. National Power had earlier acquired a 15
per cent sake in Malakoff Bhd which have stakes in two other
independent power producers (IPP), Segari Energy Ventures Sdn Bhd
and Port Dickson Power Bhd.
	   However, the sources did not rule out the possibility of
power-related companies from Japan and Europe teaming up with
Janamanjung.
	   Alternatively, they said Janamanjung may also be absorbed into
its parent company, risking an exposure to the foreign exchange
rate if offshore financing is secured. Without Tenaga's backing,
Janamanjung may be exposed to higher financing costs.
	   Tajuddin said Janamanjung has attracted from about 20 companies,
mostly Asians and Europeans, but no decision has been made.
	   ``Many have shown their interest in Janamanjung, so this means
they see good returns in this project. There are many other factors
to be considered before we accept any offers.
	   ``The Janamanjung project is a priority project, carried out in
consultation with the Government. As such, the final decision will
not be from Tenaga alone,'' he said.
	   While the Government is interested in attracting foreign direct
investment, Tajuddin said the level and the extent of the foreign
participation has yet to be finalised.
	   Tenaga, is looking at all possibilities to ensure the project's
capital expenditure is well managed while maximising opportunities
and returns to the shareholders, the company and consumers.
	   Tenaga is expected to sign today a power purchase agrement (PPA)
with Janamanjung which will see Tenaga paying about 12 sen per KWh
in energy and capacity charges to Janamanjung.
	   Analysts said the PPA will give Janamanjung a pass-through in
fuel cost and may include a possible currency rate fluctuation
clause for the fuel purchases.
	   ``As it is a coal-fired plant, the raw materials will need to be
imported and this will expose the IPP to currency fluctuations;
otherwise it will be difficult for Janamanjung as a base-load
coal-fired plant to make profits,'' an analyst said.
	   The engineering, procurement, and construction contract, which
was believed to be awarded to an European consortium, is expected
to be finalised this month.
	   The project had also passed the Environment Impact Accessment
and construction is expected very soon.

	   The provincial office of the Ministry of Forestry and
Plantations in West Kalimantan is seeking the revocation of the
licenses of 21 palm oil and rubber plantation companies in the
province.
	   The office's head, Karsan Sukardi, said Friday that he would
call on the minister to terminate the licenses of the 21 plantation
companies because they had deserted large tracts of land.
	   He was quoted by the daily Kompas as saying that the forest area
provided to the 21 companies totaled 142,000 hectares.
	   Nine of the companies are located in the Pontianak district,
seven in Sambas, four in Ketapang and one in Sintang.
	   Data from the office showed that there were a total of 164 palm
oil plantation companies in the province, both from domestic and
foreign investments, managing some 2.3 million hectares of land.
	   A provincial legislator, Darwis Abubakar, also insisted the
government revoke the plantation companies' licenses since they
were only interested in cutting and selling the timber on their
acquired lots.
	   The state-owned news agency Antara reported Saturday that 131
plantation companies in Central Kalimantan, which had obtained
permits, also failed to realize their investment commitments.
	   Statistics from the provincial plantation office said that 175
plantation companies had received licenses to replant and manage a
total of 1.91 million hectares. (rei)

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - The three DAP leaders who were suspended
and removed from their posts last Wednesday today expressed regret
that party secretary-general Lim Kit Siang is still making serious
allegations and remarks against them in the Press.
	   National vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim, party treasurer Fung Ket
Wing and national publicity secretary Wee Choo Keong, while
maintaining their innocence, said they would only reply to the
accusations ``at the appropriate moment''.
	   Liew, who is also Member of Parliament for Seputeh, and Fung, a
former MP for Sandakan, were suspended while former Bukit Bintang
MP Wee was removed from his post.
	   ``We are compelled to restrain ourselves at this juncture to
prevent the party's image and reputation from being damaged.
	   ``We have more than sufficient points to reply to Kit Siang's
statements last Thursday and Friday.
	   ``We sincerely hope that our top leaders will immediately stop
making irresponsible and contradictory statements such as saying
the three of us were guilty of causing members' morale to be
affected, party disharmony, confusion among members and plunging
the Malacca committee into dissension and disunity,'' they said in
a joint Press statement.
	   The trio also reiterated their request for an independent and
impartial committee to be set up to investigate the charges against
them.
	   ``We are certain that further or contradictory statements in the
Press will affect the minds of the independent and impartial
committee members who have to investigate the allegations contained
in Kit Siang's statements.
	   ``In yesterday's Press statement, there was an obvious shift
from the earlier allegations to a loss of confidence in us.
	   ``In any event, we are now plunged into confusion by such
statements,''
	   they added.

	   HUA Tim Aik is asleep in his easy chair when I stop by his
workplace to have a chat with him. Sleeping on the job? No, I don't
think anyone can ever accuse him of that.
	   Hua, 76, just happened to be taking a hard-earned rest when I
drop in.
	   The old man is a believer in being independent financially.
	   When he retired after 40 years of back-breaking toil in the
construction industry, he took a short rest before he looked around
for something to do.
	   With the help of his wife, Ng Ah Moi, 63, Hua decided to set up
a nursery. That was six years ago. Now the couple are busy, not so
much with tending to their plants, but with a more lucrative trade
- making and selling garden accessories, in particular the
long-legged crane.
	   This bird, much sought after, especially by the Chinese, as
decorative items for the garden, is apparently also a symbol of
longevity.
	   A huge crane greets visitors at the entrance to the nursery.
Another stands smack in the middle of the nursery, down the hill.
	   At any time, visitors to the Too Kuen Nursery in Section 10,
Petaling Jaya, will find Hua busy at work sculpting the cranes.
	   Hua can make between five and six birds a day. Pieces of steel
are used to make the basic framework over which is plastered cement
to shape the body.
	   When the sculpture is done, Ng takes over, waxing it to a shine
before passing it back to Hua for painting and finishing touches.
	   Hua says the two large ones at the entrance and in the nursery
took him about four days to complete.
	   The real crane, which has a red spot on its forehead, he says,
is often found in jungles and is sought after for its medicinal
properties.
	   He takes me to his workshop and shows me the tools he uses to
make the birds. A few completed cranes stand in a circle on a
table.
	   Inside the store, many birds of a similar size are neatly
stacked, waiting to be collected. Keeping them company are a few
toadstools, in white and yellow. These are Hua's best-sellers. He
sells about 20 birds a month. Apart from casual buyers, Hua sells
most of them to ``middlemen''.
	   ``The toadstool is called dong gu and the Chinese like to buy
it,''
	   explains Ng.
	   I also spot a multi-tiered cement structure, shaped somewhat
like a pagoda, waiting to be painted. It is another piece of Hua's
craftsmanship but he sadly says such items are difficult to sell.
So he hardly makes them any more.
	   Hua also makes parrots and other birds ``but it is only the
cranes that are laku''.
	   Hua also makes table-top waterfalls and there are a few examples
of various sizes at the nursery. Two are strategically placed at
the entrance, complete with running water, fish etc.
	   One shelf is filled with porcelain statues of various designs.
	   ``I don't do those,'' he admits. ``They need to be fired in a
kiln. They come from China.''
	   Otherwise, even the garden tables and chairs which visitors
often find useful for a quick rest, are made by him using a cement
mix and painted to look like wood, for a natural look.
	   ``The cement component makes it hardy for outdoor use,''
explains Hua. He laments over the increasing price of cement but
hard work and his principle of being independent and ``sendiri
kerja and jangan kacau anak- anak'' has helped him and his wife
maintain a steady income.
	   THE couple, who live in Petaling Jaya Old Town, are usually at
the nursery by 9am, leaving only at 6pm.
	   Since most of their day is spent in the nursery, it is very much
a second home to them. Modifications have been done to the wooden
shed to keep out the rain.
	   Bags of soil and fertiliser occupy shelves and floor space in
the large office cum temporary shelter. The couple store necessary
food items in the nursery, among them packets of tea and a kettle.
	   For lunch, Ng cooks a simple meal at the nursery.
	   ``My husband likes porridge, so I usually make that for lunch,''
she says.
	   ``The rice cooker comes in very handy here.''
	   She shows me the rice cooker with a mixture of rice and
vegetables inside.
	   Ng, who used to do odd jobs previously to supplement the family
income, is a very cheerful woman who usually tends to potential
customers or visitors to the nursery as Hua is often busy with his
craft.
	   Only mildly proficient in Bahasa Malaysia, she tells me they
have nine children - seven boys and two girls.
	   With some effort in explaining the finer details, she says:
``One son is a carpenter, another is in Australia. He is a chef,
specialising in western food. Another son is a wireman. We also
have a foreman (in a motor firm) in the family, a tourist bus
driver, a teacher, a car salesman, a repairman cum computer
technician and a steel worker. One of our daughters is a
housewife.''
	   On another visit to the nursery, two of their grandchildren were
there as it was the school holidays. Hua Ai Tin, 12, and her
brother Hsiao Teck, 10, were making good use of a garden table and
chairs to finish their school work.
	   ``We come here often. We like to spend time with our
grandparents and help them if necessary,'' says Ai Tin.

	   ARUS Murni Corp Bhd fell into the red with a group pre-tax loss
of RM121.28 million for the financial year ended December 31 1997,
against a profit of RM924,000 in the previous year.
	   The poor performance was attributed to the significant losses
incurred by the group's wholly-owned subsidiary, Kumpulan Kewangan
Bersatu Bhd, due to a higher provision for non-performing loans
made by the company.
	   However, interest income for the year improved to RM249.82
million from RM53,000 the previous year.
	   Net loss for the year under review stood at RM67.18 million,
against a net income of RM55.78 million in 1996.
	   Meanwhile, after-tax loss for the year was at RM349.31 million
compared with a profit of RM6.64 million the last time around.
	   Loss per share for the year was at 235 sen against an earnings
of 117 sen in the previous year.

	   DECANI, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats saw devastation reminiscent
of the wars in Bosnia as they were escorted into battle-torn
western Kosovo province _ target of a Serb offensive that prompted
the EU and the United States on Monday to impose new sanctions on
Serbia.
	   Besides burned-out houses and deserted villages, whose forced
evacuation have provoked comparisons to ethnic cleansing, visitors
to the besieged zone saw evidence of fierce fighting between the
Serbs and ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   Along with continued clashes and shelling Monday, the first-hand
look at the devastation provides stark evidence of a fast-worsening
scenario that Western powers fear could turn into another, broader
Balkan war.
	   ``What we've seen is all sorrow, all grief... all those villages
burned and destroyed, all the people had left,'' said Dutch
ambassador Jan Sizoo, who was among the first group of foreign
diplomats to visit the Decani region on Sunday since Serb police
and army forces began a punishing offensive there in late May.
	   Journalists were turned back from another convoy that went into
the region Monday.
	   The destruction in the southern Serb province has increased
foreign pressure on Serbia to stop using its police and army
against militants battling for independence for Kosovo's 9-to-1
ethnic Albanian majority.
	   Last week's fighting triggered an exodus of 20,000 Kosovo
Albanians into Albania. Another 7,000 to 10,000 refugees fled to
the neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro and more than
50,000 people are believed displaced within Kosovo itself.
	   The European Union tightened sanctions against Belgrade on
Monday _ banning new investments in Serbia and freezing its assets
abroad _ and urged NATO to consider military intervention.
	   The U.S. government also decided Monday to freeze Yugoslav
assets in the United States and to ban investments in that country.
	   The decision came as State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said the United States has not ruled out military options in
reaction to the ethnic fighting in the Serbian province.
	   Rubin sought to clarify comments made by National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger earlier Monday in which he said the Clinton
administration was not considering sending troops to end the
fighting in Kosovo. A senior official also said NATO planning for
possible military action to protect the Kosovo Albanians was being
accelerated.

	   HARVARD: Bagpipe music filled the air early on Thursday morning
at the Harvard University campus and at the undergraduate and
graduate housing complexes. It was the wake-up call for 6,236
graduates of Harvard University requring them to make their way to
the Yard for the Commencement ceremony.
	   The ceremony marked their ``graduation'' from students at
Harvard to the alumni of the oldest University in the US with one
of the most recognisable ``brand names'' around the world.
	   The procession to the Yard began early with different routes
taken by advanced degree candidates, graduating classes of seniors
and alumni. The processions were accompanied by the sound of
familiar college songs played by the Harvard University Band. The
academic staff passed by the West front of the Uiversity Hall and
doffed their hats to the statue of John Harvard on his pedestal.
	   With pomp, tradition and lofty rhetoric at the 347th
Commencement Ceremony, Harvard bid its graduates ``well but not
farewell''. They will remain ``connected'' and ``linked'' to each
other from now on and with thousands who have walked Harvard's
hallowed halls and passed through its gates.
	   The open air Tercentenary Theatre, between Memorial, Church and
Widener Library, has witnessed thousands of students pass through
its gates. It was first used as an outdoor amphitheatre in 1936.
	   In keeping with the age old tradition, the University Marshal
adressed the Sheriff of the Middelsex County, ``Mr Sheriff, pray
give us order''. The Sheriff resplendent in a silk top hat, rose
and moved solemnly to the front of the platform - specially set up
for the cemermonies - struck it three times with his silver-topped
staff and proclaimed: ``The Meeting will be in Order''.
	   With a prayer for the day offered by the Chaplain, the ceremony
got underway. It is a ceremony that graduates will remember for a
long time.
	   How could they forget when the whole City of Cambridge stops to
salute them? They have worked hard for this moment. Traffic stops
and the graduates become a ``tourist attraction'' for camera
clicking visitors, locals, family and friends alike.
	   The once a year parade in full Harvard regalia is not to be
missed. The celebrations and day long activities in the City of
Cambridge revolve around the ``big'' day of new Harvard graduates.
	   The Tercentenary Theatre, in Harvard Yard, was ablaze last week
with the reds, blues, greens and golds of the flags of the
University. Three large crimson Harvard Veritas banners with the
ancient shield billowed magestically in the strong winds above the
staircase in front of the Widener Library.
	   In addition, the flags of the 13 undergraduate houses, the
Extension School and the 10 graduate schools of the University
added to the colour of the tradition steeped ceremony.
	   As a reminder of the ancient tradition, when the ceremonies were
conducted in Latin - the conferring of degrees was conducted in
Latin until 1896 - a College senior delivers a salutatory address
in Latin.
	   Harvard still uses the abbrevations for degrees in Latin rather
than in English, for example A.B. ``Artium Baccalaureus' A.M.
``Artium Magister'' and Ph.D ``Philosophiae Doctor''.
	   While much of the ancient tradition is retained, some changes
have been made over the years. In the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, for example, candidates for degrees were expected to be
tested academically at the Commencement itself. According to the
records, Bachelor of Arts candidates prepared theses or topics on
which they could be queried, and candidates for the Master of Arts
submitted questions that they were ready to defend.
	   Titles of the theses and questions were printed in advance to be
handed out at Commencement, and visitors are said to have taken the
opportunity to challenge candidates on their knowledge.
	   Today, ``thesis'' applies to the written results of research
submitted by candidates for the Bachelor of Arts degree with
honours in a field, or candidates for doctoral degrees. These are
examined and approved by members of the faculties.
	   Today, the University Marshal calls on the deans of the
different faculties, who then present their candidates for various
degrees to the President and governing boards. It begins with the
advanced degrees of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences while the
graduate schools are presented in the order of their date of
institution.
	   Students from Harvard Business School followed tradition and
waved dollar bills in addition to flags of various countries, those
from John F.
	   Kennedy School of Government tossed inflatable globes, those
from the Design School threw bricks, those from Law threw up hand
cuffs and those from Education had the ABC on their caps.
	   With the sea of caps and gowns of graduates that made up the
audiance at the morning ceremony, friends came family and well
wishers, who came out in their Sunday best and a fashion parade
which ranked with the best of the Derby Race, all of whom added to
the colour and sights.
	   While it was time to send off its graduates into the world,
Harvard also asked its alumni to open their wallets and checque
books to add to its coffers. A total of US$80 millon (US$1  &QC; 
RM3.99) was added to its existing US$13 billion endowment which
ranks it among the top of Fortune's 500.
	   To mark the end of the ceremonies at the Theater, several
neighbouring churches and institutions rang their bells for about
15 minutes as a salute to the graduates, in celebration of the City
of Cambridge and Harvard's 374th Commencement. This is the 10th
consecutive year that the bells have been rung. For years the bell
in the Memorial Church tower was the only bell to acknowledge the
festival rites of Commencement Day.
	   In a bow to early history, when bells of varying tones summoned
people from sleep for prayer, to work or to study, the joyful
salute began at about 11.15 am after the Sheriff of Middlesex
County declared ``The Meeting is Adjourned'' and the University
Band heralded the end of the ceremony.
	   But that was not the end. The day's events continued beyond
Harvard Yard, with each of the Harvard Schools organising their own
individual and more personal Commencement ceremonies.
	   With their degrees in hand the alumni, students and faculty move
``from the Age that is past, to the Age that is waiting before''.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad assured Malaysians that no one will be neglected or their
problems glossed over by the Government during these difficult
economic times.
	   He said everyone, from unemployed workers and traders to small
and big entrepreneurs, would be helped or have their burdens eased
as the situation was not of their own making.
	   The Prime Minister said this in his loyalty speech at the
investiture in conjunction with the 76th birthday of the Yang
di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Ja'afar at Istana Negara.
	   The King presented honours and awards to 41 recipients.
	   Dr Mahathir said the Government had taken numerous economic
measures, a testimony of which was that the country had not sought
the assistance of international agencies.
	   In this respect, the people's faith in the Government was
crucial as not all of those efforts could be disclosed.
	   He was grateful that various pressures, including bids to
undermine confidence in the Government, split the leadership,
bankrupt Malaysian companies and pit smaller businesses against
bigger ones, have not created chaos.
	   ``The attempt to put the blame on Bumiputera businessmen,
purportedly because the opportunities given to them through
privatisation was the reason for the economic difficulties, too,
has not been effective.''
	   He also warned that the economic problems could not end quickly.
	   ``We must be prepared to face this situation even if it drags on
for some time.
	   ``Our efforts must be grounded on our capabilities and
resilience.
	   ``While we do not discount the role of outsiders in economic
recovery, we cannot be totally dependent on them.
	   ``The Government believes it will be able to eventually resolve
our economic problems, God willing.
	   ``This faith is rooted on the strength of political and social
stability.''
	   Dr Mahathir alluded to the projection made at last year's
ceremony of continued strong growth with low inflation, saying this
had since changed.
	   He said even a rich country would face an economic downturn if
confronted with a 50 per cent currency depreciation, compounded by
plunging share prices.
	   ``Yet, the nation's economy has not become so bad that
international aid has to be sought. However, if we have to seek
assistance, not only would the economy worsen but its management
would be beyond the control of Malaysians as well.
	   ``If this happens, the country's independence will also be
affected.''
	   Dr Mahathir said there were those who felt it would be better to
hand over the management of the economy to international agencies.
	   However, he said, such a transfer of management would not
guarantee recovery. Most countries that received what had been
described as ``international aid'' had seen their economies
worsening, giving rise to political instability, higher
unemployment, lower purchasing power, corporate bankruptcies and
spiralling inflation.

	   NYLEX (Malaysia) Bhd's group sales and order book for the first
four months of the year were higher than the figures achieved in

	   Nevertheless, there was a slight decline in profits for the
first four months of the year compared with the previous year due
to the effects of the weaker ringgit against the greenback.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - The split in the DAP widened today as three
branches came out in support of the three senior party members who
were suspended and removed from their posts.
	   Three Federal Territory branches - Bukit Bintang Tengah, Jalan
Sungai Besi and Pudu - expressed regret that the suspension of its
``two prominent party leaders'' and removal of a third from his
post, was meted out without prior investigation into the
allegations.
	   In Penang, the State DAP said there should be room for
constructive criticism in the party. Chairman Teoh Teik Huat said
leaders and members must be able to exercise their right in
criticising the party.
	   At the same time, party chairman Dr Chen Man Hin called a Press
conference at the DAP headquarters in Petaling Jaya urging members
to remain united against destructive criticisms.
	   He told members that unity was topmost in the leadership's mind
and it was for that reason it had acted against the three.
	   At a Press conference in Malacca on Thursday, party
secretary-general Lim Kit Siang had announced the suspension of
national vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim and treasurer Fung Ket Wing, and
the removal of national publicity secretary Wee Choo Keong from his
post. This followed complaints from the Malacca and Perak DAP
committees.
	   In an open letter to Lim, the three FT branches said the action
contravened the basic rule of natural justice which the party
strongly upheld.
	   It was signed by See Keng Hock, Bowin Ng and Lim Yeong Wah, the
secretaries of the Jalan Sungai Besi, Pudu and Bukit Bintang Tengah
branches, repectively.
	   ``Since we are in the dark and there is public outcry over the
drastic action taken against our three national leaders, we demand
that Kit Siang has a dialogue with us so that we can know the
specific charges against them.
	   ``In simple terms, we want to know what they had actually said
that caused the disunity in Perak and Malacca and why no specific
charges were made against them before the drastic action.''
	   In Ipoh, it was announced that a three-member disciplinary
committee, chaired by Ahmad Nor, will meet on June 17 to conduct an
inquiry into complaints by the Perak DAP against the three.
	   Perak DAP secretary M. Kulasegaran said notices would be sent to
members who attended a party meeting at Tambun Inn on May 24 to
attend the inquiry.
	   The meeting of national party leaders, State committee members
and branch leaders was held after the ``Sympathy, Support and
Solidarity with Lim Guan Eng Round-Table Conference'' held at the
same venue.
	   The action against the three was for ``undermining party morale,
creating confusion, disharmony and disunity among members''.

	   OMEGA Securities Sdn Bhd's stockbroking licence has been revoked
by the Securities Commission (SC), in accordance with Section 27A
of the Securities Industry Act 1983.
	   The SC took action after the stockbroking firm, which was placed
on trading restriction by the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, failed
to arrive at a restructuring exercise in the form of a merger or
acquisition within a two-week period that ended on April 30, as
stipulated by the exchange.

	   LIKE everything else, the psychology of investors is such that
after an initial surprise or shock at any new development, they
will eventually come around to accept the new reality.
	   That is why we have sudden downturns in stock prices at the
initial stages if there are shocks which unexpectedly hit the
market, followed by sharp rebounds reflecting investors' perception
that they have over- reacted to the shocks and then eventually
another pullback in prices which is less severe than the initial
fall.
	   After a while, prices will move up but will not likely be as
sharp as the initial rebound and then will probably stabilise
within a certain range.
	   What has led to the more stable prices is that the intensity of
emotions such as fear and optimism has more or less worked itself
out, and the net effect is that the emotions of those who are
fearful and those who are optimistic that things will improve are
about equally matched.
	   Hence, we find a situation of prices stabilising until such a
time when a new shock breaks out and the market starts tumbling
again and the whole cycle is repeated.
	   Apart from the big shocks which occur now and then, there are
more mundane things such as drastic changes in trading volume which
investors find hard to accept at first, but human psychology is
such that they will see the new volumes as being a fact of life -
or at least trading life.
	   Way back in late 1992, just before the start of the super bull
run in 1993, the trading volumes on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
suddenly shot up to over 200 million units a day in one of those
exciting rallies which we have not seen for some time.
	   A trading volume of this scale was a new record, and many
investors thought it would be wonderful if future rallies could
continue to be accompanied by this kind of high volume.
	   This was a record volume but after many months of the super bull
run in the following year, the 200 million unit trading volume
became a routine affair and it became part of the investors'
psychology that if trading was less than this level, the market
could be heading for a correction.
	   But the 200 million unit volume was later considered even low
when trading volumes rose much higher to about a billion units at
the peak of the super bull run towards the end of 1993 and spilling
over to the first week of 1994.
	   When this massive volume was reached, investors' psychology
again shifted and adjusted upwards to the new level and it was
generally assumed that if volume dropped below 500 million units,
the general feeling was that the market was due for a correction.
	   What this reminds us is that in the stock market, almost
everything is relative and what is high today can be low tommorrow,
and what is low today can be seen as high in future when
circumstances change.
	   In the dynamics of the stock market where things constantly
change, the psychology of the investor has to continuously adjust
and keep abreast of the new realities.

Mixed reaction meets death of Nigeria's dictator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The death of Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled
Nigeria for five years, evoked mixed reaction Monday from many
Nigerians have been waiting for the military dictatorship to return
power to the people.
	   Opponents cheered, the military mourned, but some worried for
Nigeria's future.
	   ``This death gives us an opportunity to restart our lives,''
said opposition leader Soloman Lar. ``It is our hope that Nigeria
will not miss that chance.''
	   In the commercial hub, Lagos, many people honked car horns and
cheered in the streets when news of Abacha's death was broadcast
over state-controlled radio.
	   ``Today is another independence day for Nigeria,'' said Bisi
Ajayi, an unemployed university graduate. ``Suddenly we are free
again.''
	   His sentiments, shared by many others, were in stark contrast to
the official reaction. The radio announcement was followed by a
broadcast of solemn martial music.
	   Military and civilian members of his ruling junta paid tribute
to Abacha, claiming his death was a loss.
	   ``This is a very sad development for us as a nation,'' said
Lyorcha Ayu, the president of federal senate.
	   Terming his five years of rule as a ``national rescue mission,''
state radio cited Abacha's 11 military decorations and other career
achievements.
	   In the western city of Owerri, streets were virtually empty
after people rushed home upon learning of the news. Although no
additional military presence was evident, some people said they
feared Abacha's death could trigger violent protests.
	   ``I know not everybody liked him, but I don't like his death,''
said taxi driver Silas Nwogu. ``He had been running the country,
and he said he would hand over power, and we were waiting for that
to happen.''
	   In the Niger Delta city of Port Harcourt, oil executives said
Abacha's death would have little impact on their work.
	   ``We try not to get involved in politics,'' said Victor Dania,
the director of community affairs for Shell Oil's Nigerian joint
venture. ``There won't be an impact on our production.''
	   Shell has been caught up in political turmoil involving Abacha
in the past.

	   TENAGA Nasional Bhd is proposing three transmission and
distribution projects for Langkawi - estimated at RM150 million -
over the next seven years.
	   Tenaga's development proposal for the island says the three
projects are the 132kV and 33kV main intake station in Kuah, the
132kV line from Teluk Apau to Kuah and the 132kV line from Kuah to
Ulu Melaka.
	   TNB Engineers Sdn Bhd managing director Encik Tajudin Ariff said
when the projects are completed, the island will have a closed ring
electricity supply system.
	   This will ensure non-disruption of electricity supply if there
is a damage to the transmission line.
	   For added security, Langkawi will also be connected to the
National Grid.
	   The current maximum demand for Langkawi is 85MW to meet the
needs of 20,500 customers.
	   Maximum demand is expected to increase to 134MW by August 31
2000 and 195MW in 2005.
	   Currently, electricity is supplied to the island through a 68MW
gas turbine and three 132kV submarine cables, two with 100MVA
(megavolt amp)capacity and the other with 150MVA capacity.
	   Tenaga recently launched a 27km oil submarine cable project
across the ocean from Perlis to Langkawi costing RM130 million.
	   The project is undertaken by a consortium of companies
comprising Federal Power, Itochu and Fujikura. The consortium will
take 15 months to complete the project.
	   Tajudin said in the first three months, the consortium will
undertake a route survey in Langkawi, which will run concurrently
with the manufacturing of the cables and accessories in Japan.
	   ``The power cables are custom-made and when ready, they will be
transported using a special barge. It will take about five weeks
for the cables to reach Langkawi.
	   ``The power cables and fibre optic cables will be buried
simultaneously using a submerged hydroplow located behind the
barge,'' he said, explaining the power cable-laying work.
	   For this project, the oil-filled submarine cables will be used.
The oil will act as an electrical insulation and a cooling agent
for the cables.
	   Besides the submarine cables, the team will also attach a fiber
optic connection which will serve as a ``communications line'' for
the submarine cables.
	   These ``communications lines'' will ``inform'' Tenaga's
transmission division, through signals, if there are any problems.
	   Laying of the power cables, Tajudin explained, has to be carried
out carefully as the cables are laid nearly 2.5m below the seabed.
	   ``While the work is not difficult, the location needs to be
precise,'' he added.
	   In the same area, Tenaga has also laid two 132kV submarine
cables of 100MVA capacity. The cables are about 1km apart.
	   ``Due care is also taken to ensure that boats or ships that are
passing through the area do not damage these cables when they drop
their anchor.
	   The area is also marked by a buoy,'' Tajudin said adding that
most of the work iscarried out by Malaysians.

Fired lawyer accuses Woodward mother of submitting phony bill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Woodwards denying forgery

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dan Sharp, husband of the lawyer fired by Louise
Woodward, on Monday accused the mother of the British former au
pair of submitting a forged bill for accommodation to a fund for
her defense, Sky TV reported.
	   Susan Woodward denies the allegations, her British lawyer Paul
Barrow said Monday night.
	   Sharp, an attorney whose British-born wife, Elaine Whitfield
Sharp, was fired by Woodward last week, said a dlrs 15,400
(9,131.50 pound) bill purportedly for four months accommodation for
Sue Woodward at the Sharp home was phony.
	   ``It is a forgery, and I would note a poor one at that,'' Sharp
said, shown on Sky examining the bill at his home in Marblehead,
Mass., near Boston.
	   ``I don't believe we ever charged her (Sue Woodward) a dime for
anything, but we certainly never charged her dlrs 15,400 for
anything,'' added Sharp.
	   The bill showed charges for accommodating Mrs. Woodward last
year during her daughter's trial in the death of an 8-month-old
baby in the young Briton's care.
	   ``This is not a forgery,'' said Barrow, the lawyer for Mrs.
Woodward and her husband Gary. ``That statement of account was
handed to the Woodwards by the Whitfield Sharps and any allegations
of impropriety are absolutely denied by the Woodwards.''
	   Barrow added: ``As far as my clients are concerned that is the
end of the matter. Sue is more worried about her daughter than this
nonsense that the Whitfield Sharps are bringing out for reasons
best known to themselves.''

World Cup: Nigerian players not told of Abacha death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nigeria's World Cup soccer players were not
immediately told of the death of the country's dictator Monday
because team officials could not get confirmation of the news from
home, a spokesman said.
	   News of Gen. Sani Abacha's death broke while the squad was
holding a closed practice at its training ground in Ressons, a
village in the countryside north of Paris.
	   After the session, the players went to their guarded, secluded
hotel for dinner.
	   ``We seem not to have any official confirmation,'' Nigerian
Football Association spokesman Austin Mgbolu said in a telephone
interview.
	   ``We tried, but could not reach Nigeria. We are waiting for word
from the Nigerian ambassador'' to France, he added. ``The team
manager is trying to get through to Abuja.''
	   There had been speculation earlier this year that Abacha might
make a rare public appearance at France '98.
	   In Nigeria, family friends said Abacha died of a heart attack.
The official News Agency of Nigeria confirmed only that he died
Monday.
	   Abacha came to power in a 1993 coup and faced worldwide
condemnation for his hard-line regime.
	   Members of the West African nation's soccer team have waged a
battle with the government over World Cup pay, meeting several
times with the country's military rulers. The players reportedly
rejected an offer of dlrs 6,000 a person per match, demanding dlrs
8,000 each.
	   The country's political situation has affected the squad
repeatedly. As recently as Friday, the national soccer federation
threatened to pull out of a World Cup warmup match in Amsterdam
because of human rights protests in the Netherlands.
	   An advertisement in the Nigeria-Netherlands match program
featured pictures of 12 prominent Nigerian activists who have been
imprisoned or harassed by the country's rulers.
	   The 12 activists made up an ``alternative Nigerian team,''
organizers of the protest said. The advertisement was placed by a
group of Dutch human rights groups, trade unions and religious
bodies.
	   In addition, Nigeria did not participate in the last two
editions of the African Cup of Nations.
	   It was barred from this year's tournament in January after
boycotting the 1996 tournament in South Africa. The reason for
Nigeria's non-participation is thought to be anger over President
Nelson Mandela's call for sanctions against the military regime for
hanging nine dissidents.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - Fewer than five rhinoceros remain in the
Endau-Rompin area from the 20 to 25 animals five years ago,
Department of Wildlife and National Parks' surveys have revealed.
	   The loss of rhinoceros habitat, forest encroachment and poaching
have been cited as the main reasons for the sharp drop in their
numbers.
	   ``Unless urgent measures are taken, the remaining rhinoceros
would be extinct by the year 2000,'' said department veterinarian
and rhinoceros conservation officer Dr Zainal Zahari Zainuddin.
	   ``Eco-tourism activities and development within Endau-Rompin
must be done in a manner which is sensitive to the needs of the
rhinoceros.''
	   With the decline of the Endau-Rompin population, the total count
of rhinoceros in the peninsula is estimated to be between 50 and
60.
	   Besides Endau-Rompin, the three other major rhinoceros habitats
are Taman Negara (33 to 40 animals), Ulu Selama (six) and Belum
(10).
	   Stragglers (one to three) are said to move around several
States.
	   The Endau-Rompin situation will severely cripple Malaysia's plan
to conserve the Sumatran rhinoceros which the World Conservation
Union has assessed as the most critically endangered of the five
living rhinoceros species found in the world.
	   Altogether there are 250 to 400 Sumatran rhinoceros and they are
distributed in Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah. A few may
survive in Sarawak, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos but their existence
is unconfirmed and the viability of such populations is unlikely.
	   The first survey, undertaken in 1995, disclosed that there were
only five animals left.
	   To confirm the findings, the department took another inventory
the following year which recorded the same count.
	   The census noted rhinoceros tracks on the eastern and northern
parts of Endau-Rompin.
	   But a shift has taken place. Patrols by rhinoceros protection
units last year found no fresh rhinoceros tracks on the eastern and
northern parts of Endau-Rompin but discovered only three in the
western block of the forest.
	   ``Rapid development and ever-increasing visitor arrivals on the
eastern side of Endau-Rompin have pushed the rhinoceros to the
west. The shift is obvious,'' said Zainal.
	   Prime lowland areas in the peninsula, including parts of
Endau-Rompin, were mainly converted to oil palm plantations between
1974 and 1990.
	   ``In the case of Endau-Rompin, these sites had served as a
buffer for the core rhino habitat. But the change to agriculture
followed by infrastructure development had made the rhinoceros
areas vulnerable to disturbance and poaching,'' said department
head of wildlife management unit E. Sivananthan.
	   Between 1976 and 1977, the Pahang side of Endau-Rompin was
heavily logged, particularly the areas of Sungai Pukin and Sungai
Jemai. Towards the end of 1980 and the early 1990s, logging was
also apparent in Johor.
	   Seven years ago, 49,000ha of the core rhinoceros habitat in
Endau-Rompin was gazetted by the Johor Government as the
Endau-Rompin National Park.
	   The park is managed by Johor Parks Corporation under the Johor
Government and not the department.
	   Conservation sources said insufficient trained manpower to run
an important conservation site had resulted in ever-increasing
visitor numbers.
	   Stories of people venturing into the park in four-wheel-drive
vehicles are widely reported. In fact, four-wheel-drive expeditions
have been organised into Endau-Rompin.
	   The Pahang side of Endau Rompin has yet to be declared a
national park but some 40,000ha of the forest were gazetted as a
wildlife reserve by the State Government in 1986.
	   Still, the gazetting was done under the National Land Code and
enforcement powers were given to the district of Rompin.
	   That means the department has no control over movement of people
into the conservation area.
	   While the Sumatran rhinoceros in Endau-Rompin is protected by
the Federal Government, its habitat is looked after by two State
Governments.
	   ``For the rhino's sake and that of other wildlife, the two
approaches have to be integrated. Wildlife conservation is both
about safeguarding the animal and the ecosystem of which it is a
part,'' said Sivananthan.
	   Even though there is a national park advisory committee in Johor
to look into the co-ordination and integration of conservation
matters in Endau- Rompin, there are insufficient resources
including trained manpower on site.

	   VIAGRA is at hand! Also known as THE magic bullet, this highly
successful, pharmaceutical tongkat ali has made a huge
international splash since it went on the market over a month ago.
	   Half of humanity has gone gaga over these happy pills, earning
prescribing doctors the nicknames ``Dr Love'' and ``Dr Feelgood''
like never before, and creating such a craze that these things are
selling for big money on the black market.
	   The scene has been much the same here, where men have reportedly
swamped the local branch of US-based Pfizer Inc, Viagra's maker,
with anxious inquiries about when the pill would make it to
Malaysian shores.
	   People aren't talking about the India-Pakistan nuclear arms
race, schoolyard killings or when we can expect a cure for AIDS
anymore. No, it's all about Viagra now: how to get it, where to get
it, how much is enough and how much more would be better.
	   What gives here? I guess what took me by surprise was just how
huge the demand was for this anti-impotence wonder.
	   Popular culture is largely soaked in testosterone, and with all
this clamouring assurance of virility and machismo, to have guys
suddenly go weak at the knees at Viagra's appearance was an
eye-opener.
	   I'm not trying to be insensitive here. You have to admit that
the rush for Viagra is a curious phenomenon, unchecked even by a
few scattered deaths of early users. This is serious business. But
it's also difficult to be sympathetic when you hear stories such as
the one about the lout who, once on Viagra, was able to perform in
the bedroom with his girlfriend for the first time in four years,
and then promptly left her for someone else.
	   This poor woman stood by her man for four years - four years! -
unbothered by his little problem, and for her loyalty and
generosity of heart she gets dumped?
	   Okay, so it's just one case. I'm sure that for every such story,
there are 50 more that offer glowing testimonials about how Viagra
has ushered marriages and relationships into their renaissance
period.
	   But it's still disturbing to think that there is now a handy
pill that can give men what they crave for within the hour.
	   A lot of problems can be traced to the erection, or at least the
masculinity that it symbolises. To have more men swaggering around
the streets with so much self-assurance within easy reach is
disconcerting, to say the least.
	   I hear men talk about Viagra in tones of self-congratulatory
ease nowadays. They seem comforted by the knowledge that such a
pill even exists. And what are we women doing?
	   Guys, you'd be mistaken if you thought all of womanhood have
rejoiced alongside with you at Viagra's appearance.
	   Women I know are laughing about the mad scramble for these
pills. But women have to be prepared too, so for now, everybody is
thinking up fresh permutations of the ``Sorry honey, I have a
headache,'' excuse.

	   The lack of middle-sized companies in the Philippines explained
the country's sluggish march to economic development, a report by
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad)
said.
	   The study said the ''missing middle'' may be holding the key to
sustainable economic development in the Philippines, and that
government should take steps to protect small and medium
enterprises (SME).
	   Heavy dependence on large companies, the Unctad study pointed
out, proved to be disadvantageous to Indonesia whose economy used
to be one of the most dynamic in Asia.
	   ''Indonesia and the Philippines have relied on large firms and
now have a 'missing middle' that leaves their SME sectors
relatively underdeveloped and less-internationally competitive than
might be desired.'' ''The challenge of development in Indonesia and
the Philippines is the shortage of smaller local firms with the
ability to grow and act as clients for, or subcontractors to larger
domestic or foreign firms.'' ''In Indonesia and the Philippines,
over 65% of output is produced by large firms with more than 500
employees.'' On the other hand, smaller firms with fewer than 100
employees accounted for ''less than 10% of output in Indonesia and
some 13% in the Philippines.'' In more developed Asian countries
like Singapore and Taiwan, large firms produce only 59% and 39% of
output, respectively while smaller firms account for 15% and 39%.
	   Japan and South Korea, for their part, have included SMEs in
their respective development strategies.
	   Among the developing countries, Burma and Vietnam had the least
official support for SMEs Unctad also noted in its report that
current levels of foreign direct investments (FDI) in Asia by SMEs,
represented only 10% of the total.

World Cup: Heel bruise keeps South African captain out of training
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REPEATING to add soccer to slugline &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ A bruised heel kept South African captain
Lucas Radebe out of Bafana Bafana's first World Cup practice in
France, but coach Philippe Troussier believes the Leeds United
defender will play in Friday's opening match against France.
	   Radebe, who anchors the back line and also can play in the
midfield, got hurt near the end of Saturday's 1-1 draw with Iceland
in South Africa's final World Cup tune-up.
	   After a fast-paced practice Monday evening at Vichy's Omnisports
Complex watched by about 500 people, Troussier said Radebe needed
to rest after the long English season and his South African
commitments.
	   ``He just needs 48 hours,'' Troussier said. ``He's played in
every warmup game and he needs a break.''
	   Team doctor Victor Ramathesele said Radebe's injury had
responded well to treatment so far, but he was unable to guarantee
Radebe would be ready to take on the French in Marseilles on
Friday.
	   ``I'm fairly optimistic,'' Ramathesele said. ``He's certainly
better than he was on Saturday.''
	   During a half-field attacking drill Monday, third-string
goalkeeper Andre Arendse appeared to twist or bruise his left knee
and walked off grimacing.
	   Arendse, of Fulham in England, was the starter when South Africa
won the African Nations Cup in 1996, but was dropped after former
coach Clive Barker resigned in December. He is expected to back up
Hans Vonk and Brian Baloyi at the World Cup.
	   The crowd at the training field applauded as the players
practiced attacking patterns with wide passes and crosses that led
to hard shots on goal.
	   South African players expressed surprise at the enthusiastic
reception received in the central France town, where hundreds of
people welcomed their arrival Sunday night and a crowd of about 60
waited outside the team hotel for autographs Monday afternoon.
	   ``It's like a dream,'' said defender Willem Jackson, who has
played his pro soccer in South Africa. ``I thought maybe it was
going to be quiet, we wouldn't have support or people watching
us.''
	   It is South Africa's first World Cup appearance after being
banned for 28 years from international soccer until 1992 because of
apartheid.

	   ANYONE who has driven a Saab before would have realised at once
that it's no ordinary car. It has an identity of its own and the
performance is second to none - whatever the class.
	   Building on these fine traditions, the Swedish car manufacturer
has produced a mid-range luxury model, the Saab 9-5.
	   Saab started out as a plane manufacturer and still does it with
great success for the European market. It is evident then that some
of the latest developments in aeronautic engineering have gone into
the development of Saab cars, giving them an edge, whether it's in
the passenger cockpit or in engine technology.
	   The 9-5 series available for the moment in Malaysia is the
2.3-litre series.
	   Saab has used its turbocharging expertise to produce the
EcoPower engine, which uses light boost only, giving smooth power
and reasonable economy. It was first introduced in the 900 series
in 1993 and further developed for the 1997 Saab 9-5 series.
	   Fuel consumption is rated at up to 9kpl (26mpg) in mixed driving
for the auto transmission. According to the manufacturers, the Saab
9-5 doesn't follow the beaten track. It forges its own way ahead -
and it does so with aplomb.
	   You have to get behind the wheel to fully appreciate the finer
points of this car. Performance is unmatched in its class. The
EcoPower engine is a lightning-quick and tough turbo-charged power
source, with extrarodinary torque at the very bottom of the rev
range; yet at the same time, it is exceptionally clean.
	   The engine's maximum torque becomes available at just 1800 rpm,
which corresponds to 80-85kph in top gear, and it can be pushed to
the limit without yielding. It drives with the precision of a much
smaller car and has a Ferrari-like urge. The speedometer reads a
maximum speed of 240kph.
	   We are inclined to think this is no exaggeration. We managed to
get it up to 200kph, where permissible, without too much effort.
	   Our test car was equipped with a four-speed electronically
controlled automatic transmission with three programmes and direct
mechanical lock up in third/fourth gear.
	   It's a car you would most certainly prefer to drive rather than
be driven around in. Like the popular 900, the Saab 9-5 is roomy,
even for an executive class, with comfortable back seat, lots of
leg and headroom and a massive boot.
	   It's reputed to be one of the safest cars on the road, with
impressive crash-protection built into the design. This Saab has
one of the most supportive and comfortable seats.
	   ``There's an old saying among aviators that one flies `by the
seat of one's pants'. That applies also to driving a car,'' a
member of the Saab design team was reported to have said.
	   That old saying has helped Saab determine the degree of firmness
of the seats in the Saab 9-5. If they are too soft, the car's
movements are difficult to interpret, and if too hard, they soon
become uncomfortable.
	   The driver's seat has different adjustment parameters, including
lumbar support. Topping the driving environment are ventilated
front seats. I suspect it comes with a heater too. So my mate ran
her fingers through the switches and in no time I was on a hot seat
despite the fact that the air- con was running at a cool 18 Degrees
Celsius. Not that it's something we would appreciate in a tropical
climate like ours.
	   In classic Saab style, the 9-5 has a wrap-around instrument
panel which tones off into a gently rounded centre console.
Everything is within reach and easy to overview.
	   True to Saab tradition, the ignition key is positioned
conveniently between the seats. The audio system developed just for
the 9-5, provides concert hall entertainment.
	   The Saab 9-5 is quiet. Background noise in naturally less
subdued at motorway speeds - the car shouldn't be fully isolated or
the driver won't benefit from any feedback. Yet you can listen to
your favourite music without touching the volume control when you
join the highway - the system automatically turns up the volume as
speed rises. To switch to another station, the steering wheel has
conveniently positioned remote-control buttons.
	   Among the vast array of advanced safety features are: ABS
(anti-lock) brakes with electronic braking force distribution and
large disc brakes all round; tuned front suspension with MacPherson
struts featuring direct-action gas-filled dampers; multi-link rear
axle with individual suspension of the rear wheel which offers
excellent comfort and road grip; exceptionally rigid bodyshell for
good on-road behaviour and high crash safety; strong door pillars,
sill beams and cross-members which dissipate impact energy in a
side collision; night panel subdues non-essential instrument
illumination for safer night driving and; high pressure windscreen
washer with three twin-spray nozzles.
	   The Saab Safeseat concept consists of: active head restraints in
the front seats to reduce the risk of whiplash injuries; airbags up
front including two on the sides; sturdy side-impact beams and
impact-absorbing material inside the doors; anti-submarining
protection for all five seats; three-point inertia-reel belts for
all five seats; load shifting protection.
	   Auto Concessionaires Sdn Bhd is the local distributor of Porsche
and Saab vehicles.
	   The Saab 9-5 2.3-litre EcoPower is priced at RM269,000 and th8e
2-litre, also a turbocharged straight-four, is at RM221,000. A
3.0-litre V6 EcoPower rounds up the 9-5 series, but is not
available in Malaysia as yet.

	   Publicis SA and Hal Riney &AMP; Partners (HR &AMP; P) of the US have
agreed to combine to form a global advertising partnership. This
was announced locally by Antonio R. Mercado, chair of Publicis
Philippines Inc.
	   The new name of Hal Riney &AMP; Partners will be Publicis-Hal Riney
&AMP; Partners.
	   ``This is a very potent creative partnership,'' Mercado said,
``because both agencies are known for their intense creativity.''
	   The combination will allow existing clients of both firms to
benefit from a global network of advertising, while maintaining a
strong local presence in each country. Both agencies are present in
64 countries and more than 100 cities internationally.
	   Maurice Levy, president and CEO of Publicis, said, ``The
rapprochement with Hal Riney and Partners is exactly what Publicis
was looking for to reinforce its position in the US: an agency with
strong beliefs, highly creative, delivering outstanding solutions
to their clients, and enjoying substantial growth in recent
years.''
	   He said the work done by HR &AMP; P is consistent with that of
Publicis', ``with the outstanding plus of the personality of Hal
Riney.''
	   Levy said Publicis-Hal Riney &AMP; Partners will run independently
from Publicis' other US operations, including Publicis-Bloom, which
has achieved remarkable growth in the last year.
	   Publicis' creative work and innovative approach has contributed
to the success of legendary brands throughout the world, including
such blue-chip names as Nestle, Lancome, Coca-Cola, Renault,
L'Oreal Granier, Whirlpool, Heineken, Sara-Lee, Allied-Domecq,
Siemens, Carrefour, British Airways, United Biscuits,
Hewlett-Packard, and Club Med. With billings of about $4.7 billion,
Publicis achieved a growth rate of 20% in billings and 40% in
operating profit last year.
	   Publicis-Hal Riney &AMP; Partners has offices in San Francisco,
Chicago, New York, and Atlanta. Among its larger clients are Saturn
Corp., Sprint PCS, First Union Corp., Mirage Resorts Inc., and
America West Airlines.

	   The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) has denied negligence in the
monitoring of violations committed by brokerage firms. In a letter
to the Securities and Exchange commission (SEC), the local bourse
said it had been monitoring 20 complaints from investors since the
start of the year.
	   The PSE has received a lot of criticism from the SEC for not
being able to detect the trading violations allegedly committed by
EBC Securities Inc.
	   The Commission temporarily suspended the operations of the
brokerage firm until July pending its compliance with the rules of
the Revised Securities Act (RSA).
	   However, the PSE clarified that the four-man team sent by the
Commission to oversee the functions and activities of its
compliance and surveillance department (CSD) had focused on one
complaint that was never entertained.
	   ``We believe that 19 out of 20 is not a particularly bad batting
average for the CSD securities investigation division considering
it was only formally created in November 1997, plus the rules of
procedure for the entire CSD was drafted only in October 1997,''
the letter said.
	   PSE President Jose Luis Yulo Jr. said regular audits were only
conducted early this year as the Exchange embarked on an
information campaign in 1997 to get its member-brokers acquainted
with all the rules.
	   According to a reliable source, the SEC is again poised to
suspend the operation of another brokerage firm for multiple
violations of the RSA including the net capital rule, insider
trading, and the use of dummy accounts.
	   In the same letter, the PSE dismissed allegations they had not
been referring to the Commission all member-brokers that were found
to have violated the net capital rule of the RSA.
	   ``The net capital accounts of member-brokers are being submitted
simultaneously to the Commission and the Exchange, and both the
brokers and exchange department (BED) and our compliance audit
department (CAD) evaluate the monthly submissions made by
member-brokers,'' the letter said.
	   The PSE added: ``It happens sometimes that the CAD's evaluation
do not tally with SEC's evaluation of the net capital submissions
resulting in findings that are not really identical.''
	   The bourse explained that the inconsistent results were at times
``informally discussed'' between BED and CAD officers, which the
PSE considers a form of ``validation or reconciliation'' between
the findings of both parties.
	   The PSE also explained that it cannot touch brokerages violating
the net capital rule because the bourse has yet to adapt it as one
of its own rules.
	   ``The reason why the PSE could not as yet impose sanctions for
net capital deficiencies of member-brokers is that it has yet to
adopt the RSA/SEC rules as our own rules and that the PSE has not
yet come out with a table of sanctions for each violation of the
RSA/SEC rules,'' the letter explained.

	   KENINGAU, Sat. - Coffeeshop and restaurant owners should refrain
from increasing prices of food and drinks to gain more profit,
Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Joseph Kurup said.
	   He said there were many reports from consumers that drink prices
at some coffee shops had increased.
	   Kurup said some coffee shop owners had increased the price of
coffee without milk to 80 sen from the original 60 sen, while the
price of iced drinks has risen from RM1 to RM1.50.
	   ``Such an increase cannot be accepted as it is a burden on
consumers,'' he said when met after attending the Parti Bersatu
Rakyat Sabah annual conference at a hotel here today.
	   Kurup, who is Resource Development and Enterprise Minister, said
people in food businesses should help the Government curb inflation
by reducing the price of food items.
	   ``They should not view the economic downturn as an opportunity
to increase the price of food and drinks. After all, items like
coffee are locally produced and not imported,'' he said.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam is maximizing her time on the
LPGA tour.
	   Sorenstam is third on the 1998 money list despite playing in
only 10 of a possible 17 tournaments. After winning dlrs 90,000 in
the Michelob Light Classic in a sudden-death playoff against Donna
Andrews on Sunday, the reward for her first victory of the season
was two weeks off.
	   ``I've been playing a lot of tournaments the last few years and
last year I achieved more things than I ever thought I could,''
Sorenstam said. ``I decided this year I'm just going to try to
relax a little, enjoy my weeks off and maybe even have some more
weeks off.
	   ``I have a lot of interests outside the golf course.''
	   After taking a break, Sorenstam will play two straight weeks,
then take another week off.
	   ``I just try to play when I'm ready,'' Sorenstam said. ``If I'm
not ready, I don't come out.
	   ``The last few years I've been getting slower to motivate myself
to come out, but when I do come out I love it even more.''
	   Last year, Sorenstam played in 22 events. She won six and was
LPGA Player of the Year with record earnings of dlrs 1.236 million.
	   This year, she's behind Andrews and Liselotte Neumann with dlrs
387,765. Andrews has played in 13 tournaments, Neumann 11.
	   One tournament that'll remain on Sorenstam's must list is the
Michelob Light. She's won it three of the past four years.
	   Sorenstam said it's a course for the cerebral golfer, which
suits her game. She used her driver only five times in the final
round on the tight Forest Hills Country Club layout.
	   On the 18th hole, she used a 3-wood for her tee shot on both
playoff holes.
	   ``For some reason, I always play well when I use my brain,''
Sorenstam said.

	   PORT DICKSON, Sat. - Private water-craft users will not be
excluded from the Personal Water Craft Enactment expected to take
effect later this month.
	   Besides regulating seawater sports, the Enactment - passed by
the State Legislative Assembly last month to ensure the safety of
users and beach- goers - also includes similar activities on
rivers, reservoirs and lakes.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohamad Isa Abdul Samad said: ``Private
users at popular beaches must realise they are also governed by the
enactment,'' he said after opening a new market here today.
	   He said the construction of various new resorts and marinas in
the district had recently attracted many water sport enthusiasts
from the Klang Valley and neighbouring States.
	   Any user found flouting the regulations under the enactment
could face a maximum RM5,000 fine or six-months jail or both.
	   The Enactment stipulates among others that all water sports
facility users must be 16 years old and above while those below
this age must be accompanied by an adult. The use of a life jacket
is compulsory.
	   The user is prohibited from consuming alcohol or medicines
before using the facilities as this may cause a lack of
concentration and even black- outs.

	   From the angle that ribs make where they join the bottom of the
breast bone, just above the soft stomach area, you can determine if
you are prone to obesity or not.
	   Dr. Victor Baker calls this the ``Angle of Obesity.'' Since this
encompasses the abdominal area and touches the heart and lungs, the
angle of obesity gives us an insight to the condition of the organs
in this area. A narrow-angled (about 60 degrees) person has large
lungs and better stamina, which means that we can expect such a
person to have a large volume of efficient lung remaining even with
a pneumonia attack.
	   However, without sufficient exercise, much of the upper part of
the lungs will be unused. This poorly ventilated upper part of the
lung is the common site of tuberculosis (TB). It would, thus, seem
logical to treat TB with exercises using this part of the lung, as
well as treating the disease with the necessary medications.
	   Lung ventilation can be quite great in the narrow-angled person
because of the large range of movement possible in the lower ribs
and diaphragm. In the large-angled (around 130 degrees or more)
person, the movement of the chest is shallow.
	   Fat people are considered to be more susceptible to bronchitis
and other chest conditions; though not yet proven, the fatness is
blamed. It would seem more logical to look at the wide angle and
the small lung volume.
	   Heart disease is another problem usually related to fatness. In
the wide-angled person, the heart is likely to be relatively
smaller because of smaller chest cavity. It tends to lie
horizontally so that the main artery of the heart (the aorta) forms
a spiral, rather than the ``single plane''
	   curve of this artery in the narrow-angled. This spiral spins the
blood which has been pumped from the heart under great pressure (a
phenomenon which may affect the laying down of cholesterol and
other substances in the walls of the blood vessels), causing it to
impinge more on one area of the artery. Research may well establish
that this spiraling of the aorta plays a part in the incidence of
aortic aneurysm (ballooning on an artery), arteriosclerosis
(hardening of the arteries), and angina (reduced blood supply to
the heart itself).
	   Another organ near the angle of obesity is the liver. The liver
of a small-angled person is generally smaller because his abdominal
cavity is smaller. A smaller liver implies greater risk if
hepatitis is contracted or if cirrhosis develops.
	   Ulcers are said to be more common in the thin, anxious type of
person. The problem is how to measure worry. Facial expression and
an excess of nervous energy have traditionally given rise to people
being labeled as ``worry bugs.'' It has been found out that the
incidence of ulcers is directly related to the angle of obesity.
These people may look more worried because they have many facial
creases but there is no evidence to indicate that they worry more
than the fat person (with a wide angle of obesity) whose faces are
unlined.
	   In fact, when a fat person loses weight rapidly, skin creases
appear and the face looks less jovial even though the person may be
much happier because of the weight loss. The ``excess of nervous
energy'' may simply be an abundant supply of physical energy
possessed by the narrow-angled person who has greater stamina and
carries a lighter frame. The ulcer may develop due to: 1) a
relative excess of acid production and/or concentration in the
narrow-angled person's stomach; or 2) the valve at the bottom of
the stomach does not function efficiently since the curves of the
stomach and intestines are sharp (since the abdomen is cramped for
space).
	   These sharp curves can delay the acidified food in its passage
through the first part of the intestines (the duodenum), or cause
digestive juices from the stomach to impinge on the side wall of
the duodenum instead of being squirted along it.

	   THERE is some truth in the Malay proverb, Lebih Mudah Menjaga
Sekandang Lembu Dari Menjaga Seorang Anak Gadis, which implies that
it is much easier to handle a herd of cattle than to care for a
daughter.
	   The integrated farms of Ladang Bukit Kerisek in Pahang and
Ladang Bukit Bujang in Johor, which see cattle being bred in oil
palm plantations, have proven this.
	   No cages or additional food are needed for this effort. The
cattle are controlled with a RM3,000 electric fence system,
depending on the size of the grazing area. The electric fence will
give cattle a mild jolt if they stray out of their grazing area.
	   The cattle are divided into two groups but if the number is too
large, they may be divided into more groups.
	   These cattle are fed through a `rotational grazing' system that
takes between six and eight weeks. There is also a `holding yard'
where cattle are placed temporarily for a bi-monthly health checks.
	   And contrary to popular belief, cattle breeding and oil palm
cultivation do go hand-in-hand. Ladang Bukit Kerisek and Ladang
Bukit Bujang have successfully dispelled the notion that such an
integrated farming concept do not work.
	   ``People sais it couldn't work ... the cattle will eat the young
trees and make the ground compact as they trample on it,'' Pahang
State Farmers Organisation (Pasfa) general manager Abdul Rahman
Ismail said.
	   ``These are negative sentiments,'' he told journalists visiting
Ladang Bukit Kerisek recently.
	   Palm oil is, in fact, the best crop for integrated farming as
cattle cannot be bred in open field due to the excessive heat. The
oil palm trees provide suitable shade for these animals.
	   Pasfa, the owner of the 700 ha Ladang Bukit Kerisek, began
planting palm oil in 1990. Its integrated farming project was
initially placed under the supervision of the Malaysian
Agricultural and Research Institute (Mardi) in 1993 with 100 female
cows provided by the Pahang government.
	   Mardi also contributed three male cows which were mixed hybrids
of local cows from Kedah and Kelantan and French, Brazilian and
Indian species such as Hereford, Charoleis, Lemousine, Simentol,
Nellour and Brahman.
	   ``The idea to integrate cattle breeding and palm oil cultivation
was an old one but the potential was only clearly seen recently,''
he said.
	   Abdul Rahman said the integrated farming in Ladang Bukit Kerisek
is to maximise profit through efficient management. It is estimated
that such activity can give an additional income of between RM150
and RM200 per ha annually.
	   ``It is a good long-term investment as we could get more than 40
per cent of return every year,'' he said, adding that each cow only
needs about RM1.40 per day for food as the grass is free.
	   He said a 1.5 acre land is allocated for each cow and the farm
can save up to between RM36 and RM60 per ha on weeding cost.
	   ``We can get about RM500 for each cow that is old enough to be
sold,''
	   Abdul Rahman said, adding that only three workers are needed to
handle 1,000 heads of cattle.
	   He said Pasfa is also negotiating with the state government to
develop another 2,000 acres land to breed more cattle. Last year,
Ladang Bukit Kerisek produced 13,333 tonnes of beef (about 19
tonnes per ha). They expect to get 16,800 tonnes this year.
	   It also aims to become a catalyst to the country's meat industry
and produce about RM2 million worth of meat by the year 2000.
	   Abdul Rahman said, however, that palm oil cultivation will
continue to be its core business. The Pahang Government recently
approved a 3,600 acre land to be developed by Pasfa this year.
	   He said another 7,800 acres of palm oil plantation, which is
jointly managed with Pahang UMNO, will begin to see its profit this
year.
	   Pasfa was also awarded RM5 million by the state government as a
soft loan to develop 20,000 acres of unused land, he said.
	   Meanwhile, Ladang Bukit Bujang manager Hasbullah Karmain said
the farm made RM245,881 from the sale of cattle last December.
	   The 3,704ha palm oil plantation was awarded to the Perladangan
Peladang Johor Sdn Bhd by the state government in January 1992. The
farm also has its own factory to process the oil palm.
	   Before cattle, Ladang Bukit Bujang bred 418 sheeps. However, the
project was scrapped as there is low demand for sheepmeat.
Furthermore, the sheeps suffered from various diseases and were
attacks by wild dogs.
	   The farm lost about RM14,000 in the sheep project last year,.
	   Perladangan Peladang Johor continued with cattle breeding, aimed
at saving cost of weeding and to secure additional income for the

	   HAVE you watched children as they watch a game? They are a
picture of concentration and they abide by the rules. They cheer
for both sides of the team and they enjoy a good game.
	   When the situation is tense and a player makes a leap that could
result in a score, there is silence. Only after the point is scored
or missed would they all cheer.
	   But sometimes, one or two will be acting out the movements as
seen by the movement of the boy next to the one wearing a yellow
T-shirt in Failed Attempt.
	   The entry by Julian Pang Yau Chin of Penang shows a player
leaping up to get the ball. It is a tense moment and everyone is
watching. The ball has moved to the right. Perhaps just after this
there might have been cheers.
	   This game of volleyball is played under what looks like a
platform built on stilts. Julian has not given any details of the
picture. A strap tied between the two pools acts as the net. The
floor is wet. It looks more like a wharf where houses are built on
stilts. The angle taken helps one to see the whole game, court and
spectators. A good action shot.
	   Another game of volleyball comes from Omar Ismail of Ipoh. This
picture, taken in Pulau Pangkor, is also of a make-shift court on
the beach.
	   The poles are of bakau wood and from the looks of it, the net is
also a bakau pole tied across two poles. I believe some shirts are
also hanging across the pole, perhaps to act as a net.
	   The angle taken by Omar does not show much of the Alternative
Net as he calls it. Perhaps if he had moved more to the left or
right from where he was standing, we would get a clearer picture.
	   A few netball pictures were submitted. Most of them were
straight forward pictures. No action. Chong Wai Sun of Petaling
Jaya has captured a tense moment in Please Go In, just after the
player (GS) had shot the ball at the net. The ball is just at the
rim and the shooter is hoping it will get in. It is a good study of
concentration. Should the ball fail to enter, then the opponents
will have to take over and they must be at the ready.
	   The games for the last of the sports series are badminton, ping
pong and other indoor games.
	   The closing date is July 3. Please do not paste the film packet
on the back of the print as removing it may damage the picture. But
do write down your name and address clearly and don't forget the
coupon.

	   HONG Kong stock brokers predict directionless trading this week
as investors shellshocked by negative news stick to the sidelines,
dealers said.
	   Stagnant trading on Friday ``is a sign of things to come,'' said
James Osborne of ING Barings.
	   ``In the short term there is no real reason to move so they will
sit on the sidelines and do nothing,'' the dealer said.
	   Dealers said the underlying sentiment in the market remained
highly negative on fears the local economy is on the brink of
recession this year and Wall Street may be in for a sharp
correction.
	   The key Hang Seng index fell fell 365.09 points or 4.1 per cent
during the week to 8,569.47 on Friday.

	   THERE were no shortage of news relating to the stock market last
week.
	   Each day there was some foreign, political or economical news
that will affect the direction of the market.
	   Most of the news were unpleasant and yet looking back the fall
in share prices were not so bad except for the KLSE Composite Index
(KLCI) component stocks.
	   This had a drastic effect on the KLCI, which dropped slightly
more than 30 points in the five trading days.
	   The first lot of discouraging news was from the national carrier
Malaysian Airlines System Berhad which announced a RM225 million
pre-tax loss for the year ended March 31, 1998.
	   Next in line was the briefing held by Bank Negara Governor Tan
Sri Ahmad Mohd Don, who announced that Malaysia's gross domestic
product declined in the first quarter of 1998 by 1.8 per cent.
	   This has given rise to concern that we may be slipping into a
recession.
	   Fortunately, for us last Tuesday's newspaper had our Deputy
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar lbrahim declaring that the worst is
over for us, and despite the GDP having declined by 1.8 per cent in
the first quarter, the Government will be keeping to its forecast
of 2.5 per cent growth for the year.
	   Critics were also unhappy with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir's announcement in Tokyo, where he had said that the
Government may finance 60 per cent of the Asset Management
Company's (AMC) capital.
	   Malaysia is in a ``heads I win and tails you lose'' situation
because at the present moment it seems it can do nothing right.
	   The Government financing of 60 per cent of AMC capital has
brought about criticism that it will interfere with the working of
AMC.
	   If the AMC fails, the critics will clap their hands and say ``I
told you so, they could not get the money to finance it''.
	   The announcement of a trade surplus of RM3.6 billion for the
month of April by the Statistics Department did not have a positive
effect on our market, nor did the announcement of the set-up for
the AMC helped the market.
	   Perhaps market analysts need the weekend to look through them
before the positive effects can unfold.
	   On the technical front our failing Timing Device was
successfully arrested at - 254.6 points and since then has been
trending up.
	   The drastically reduced trending up pace last Friday is however,
worrying. It could mean that the reversal that we just saw is a
false move and we may need to move down to the next level of
support at - 400.0 points.
	   Our 0/0 Indicator continues to trend up, the good news is that
the trending up pace has increased, giving us hope, that it is
likely to continue at a greater pace this week.
	   Our market now needs to have a drastic increase in trading
volume to ensure a rally can take off. We also need to have the
KLCI moving above its 30MA.

	   Market Maker
	   The stock market reacted to foreign concerns last week, as
reflected in the index's drop by almost 3%. The possibility of the
weakness of the Japanese yen forcing a competitive devaluation in
other Asian currencies dampened market spirits all throughout the
trading week. Political transitions in the country as well as in
Indonesia continued to make investors anxious, prodding most to
watch the market from the sidelines.
	   Moreover, economic results, such as slower export growth as well
as double-digit inflation for the month of May (using the new
index) added to the dispirited environment.
	   I expect lackluster trading to continue this week. Although
there is the possibility of a technical rally given the fact that
the market index is around support levels, any rebound will likely
be short-lived considering the lack of positive news on both the
foreign and the domestic fronts. I anticipate funds to sell into
strength. Such outlook is supported by the threatened yen and
potential effects on China's currency, as well as warnings that
interest rates may rise beginning today, in light of higher oil
prices last week. It is estimated that this would add at least 0.22
percentage points to the inflation rate for the month of June
(using the old index).
	   Another economic concern is the slowdown in export growth.
Latest data revealed export growth to be losing steam. Worries that
a potential glut in electronic products worldwide will dampen
demand has been one of the reasons why funds remained unconvinced
that the Philippines would continue to post double-digit growth in
exports, despite the peso's weakness.
	   Although investors believe that the Philippines, along with
Singapore, remains one of the stronger economies - in terms of
growth - this year, few are willing to put down new cash. Such
attitude is reinforced by fund managers' concerns about how the new
administration will finance spending this year. Joseph Estrada's
ambitious privatization plan is not exactly the answer that
international investors were hoping for. Fiscal and structural
reforms (i.e. higher tax collection and lower spending) were mostly
what was expected from the new government.
	   Adding this all up does not paint an exciting picture for the
week to come.
	   While I do not discount the possibility of a rally, the lack of
any fundamentally good news will keep investors out and speculators
in.
	   However, there are values to be found. Since I have found it
extremely difficult to call the market's trend week-on-week, I
advise investors to concentrate on value-stocks. After the market's
nine-day drop, shopping for value will not fail serious investors
who are ready to use any weakness as an opportunity to hunt for
bargains this week.

	   SHARES on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) extended its
downward trend last week, with the key barometer breaching its
lowest level in five months at last Friday's close, amid concerns
of local and regional contracting economies.
	   Stocks were traded mostly easier last week due to selling of
blue chips by local and foreign players despite news of a positive
trade surplus of RM12.4 billion from January to April this year,
and the central bank assurance that interest rates will be
maintained at current levels.
	   The market also failed to respond positively to the details on
the country's asset management company (AMC) which was set up to
unwind non- performing loans (NPLs) announced last Thursday.
	   Analysts said the downward trend may persist into this week,
with the possibility of the key index breaking the 500-point level
on lack of fresh leads and positive local and foreign news to spur
the market.
	   Analysts also expected the market to be volatile in the
short-term while any upside is expected to be short lived.
	   The market also took a cautious stand on worries of the
weakening yen and the possibility of the ringgit falling below the
RM4.00 level against the greenback, analysts added.
	   The local bourse began the week broadly lower in tandem with
other regional bourses and on news of the country's contracting
gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of this year.
	   Shares rebounded on Tuesday after seven days of consecutive
falls to close marginally higher on limited buying interest after
Bank Negara announced it will continue to maintain interest rates
at current levels.
	   Wednesday saw the key barometer closing off its high, extending
Tuesday's technical rebound on selective buying interest on
bluechips by local and foreign funds.
	   Selling pressure continued on Thursday as players sold selected
bluechips on news of the funding details of the country's asset
management company (AMC), despite the country's RM12.4 billion
trade surplus from January to April.
	   On Friday, shares ended easier as the KLSE composite index
breached its lowest level in five months on the back of a weaker
ringgit and news that Moodys' Investors Service may cut the
country's forex ceiling for bonds and bank deposits as the
country's economy contracts.
	   Meanwhile, newly-listed second board lead products recycling
company, Metal Reclaimation Bhd ended the week at RM2.05, after
making its debut at RM2.01 on Thursday against its offer price of
RM1.80.
	   The KLCI had closed lower on Monday at 518.00 points, down 20.24
points from the previous Friday's close at 538.24.
	   The key barometer rose 2.61 points to close at 520.61 on
Tuesday, and extended its gains by another 5.75 points on Wednesday
to 526.36 points.
	   However, shares nosedived on Thursday to push the KLCI down 7.75
points to 518.61 points.
	   Shares fell again 13.56 points to 505.05 points last Friday.
	   Week-on-week, the benchmark KLCI shed 33.19 points or 6.17 per
cent to 505.05 points from the previous Friday's close of 538.24.
	   The all-main board Emas Index finished the week 5.96 points or
4.37 per cent lower at 130.55, while the second board index was
down 2.06 points or 1.85 per cent to 109.41.
	   Total turnover on the KLSE for entire last week amounted to
562.51 million shares valued at RM1.27 billion, which gave an
average daily volume of 112.50 million shares.
	   Meanwhile, index futures traded on the Kuala Lumpur Options and
Financial Futures Exchange (KLoffe), tracked the cash market and
saw it finishing easier at the end of last week on profit-taking
activities.
	   Spot June futures ended last Friday 10.3 points lower at 499.50
while nearby July futures closed 11.0 points lower to settle at
492.50.

	   TT RESOURCES Bhd said its proposed subscription of 99,000 new
ordinary shares of US$1 each for US$99,000 cash, representing 99
per cent of the enlarged share capital of Goldale International Ltd
will pave the way for the company to be a long-term player in the
regional food and beverage, leisure and entertainment markets.
	   Goldale is an investment holding company limited by shares and
incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with an authorised share
capital of US$50,000 (US$1 &QC;  RM3.99) divided into 50,000 shares of

	   Most people do not take the issue of environmental preservation
as seriously as they should. Though many may profess concern for
the environment, it is, sadly, more an effect of '90s hype than a
real personal stand.
	   But unlike an indifferent majority, a few dedicated
``crusaders'' spend extra time and effort to work for the ailing
planet. Environmental journalist Howie G. Severino believes that
his self-imposed goal of helping protect the environment does not
entail much sacrifice. ``It is something I love doing,'' he
declares.
	   Despite eight libel suits to his name for writing about the
malpractices of government officials leading to the corruption of
natural resources, he prefers not to romanticize the risks of
environmental reporting. ``It's pretty much the same as other
jobs,'' Howie says.
	   He adds that it is more of choice on his part than the result of
a grand and noble statement to the world. ``I enjoy it and I guess
this is more than enough reason for me to do it.''
	   Top Environmental Reporter Severino has long been engaged in
environmental work. He is dubbed as ``the country's leading
environmental reporter'' by The International Herald Tribune. He
has contributed several environmental articles to publications
abroad like the San Francisco Examiner and the Multinational
Monitor, and does a column for The Manila Times that focuses on
environmental issues.
	   He also regularly writes scripts for video features.
	   ``I have always been drawn to the subject of nature and
people,'' Severino muses. ``When we were still kids, my brother and
I went on trips with my dad (Rodolfo Severino, who is a diplomat
and secretary-general of the Asean). We would always have time to
camp out and sleep in tents. I think those trips have largely
influenced my work and my interests. I love to hike, dive, do
cycling. I relish the fact that I can combine my love for nature
with my work.''
	   Severino has done several internationally-distributed and
critically-acclaimed documentaries, aided by good friend and
renowned film visualizer Gerry Gerena, for the Unicef. One of these
docu-films, Hadlok, was reviewed by TIME magazine and is still
being shown in some countries since its release several years ago.
	   In 1992, Severino started formal environmental work on Mt.
Banahaw and came up with a documentary shown on local channel
ABS-CBN 2, discussing the environmental impact of pilgrimages made
to Banahaw. It was also around this time when he took his Master of
Arts degree in Environmental Policy from Sussex University in
Brighton, England where he did a thesis on Filipino migrants and
the apparent causes of their upland exodus.
	   Two years ago, Severino was awarded with the Benigno S. Aquino
Memorial Fellowship for Media by former Philippine President
Corazon Aquino and then US Ambassador to the Philippines John
Negroponte for his extensive contributions to environmental
preservation.
	   ``I can name five reasons that I think made me take that route
to environmental journalism,'' Severino declares. ``For one, I have
a genuine concern for the environment. Secondly, I believe there's
a lot to do.
	   Third, it's a life and death issue. Fourth, there aren't enough
people doing environmental journalism. And lastly, it's one good
reason to see and visit beautiful places in the country.''
	   Experienced Journalist But while engrossed in his passion for
the environment, Severino is not oblivious to social issues. His
previous jobs account for his wide understanding of politics,
society, and even indigenous Filipino lifestyles.
	   Severino has been a reporter for the now-defunct Manila
Chronicle, freelance journalist covering the Southeast Asian
region, and editor for a Sunday magazine. He has done production
work for international broadcast stations like the omnipresent CNN
and influential Turner Broadcasting Services.
	   Together with other young, ambitious journalists (including
Sheila Coronel, whose most recent book Porks and Other Perks has
made it to the current local non-fiction bestseller list along with
Ricky Lee's Trip To Quiapo and Jessica Zafra's Planet of the
Twisted), he co-founded the Philippine Center for Investigative
Journalism (PCIJ). Severino still acts as member of the board of
editors of PCIJ which has efficiently maintained a clean reputation
for intelligent and responsible reporting.
	   While he was video producer for Unicef, Severino also did
several documentaries that featured topics other than the
environment. These included films like: 1) the ethnically-colorful
Goiter in the Cordillera, which ``was finished only after six
months of non-continuous stay at one of the highly inaccessible
areas of the region;'' 2) Teachers, an interesting feature on the
mobile teacher program in Ifugao where ``teachers visit children in
remote areas to teach them;'' and 3) Tribal Teachers in Mindanao,
which showcased the intriguing and often unique lives of native
teachers in the idyllic regions of Mindanao.
	   ``In producing videos, it's fun to have what you write matched
with good pictures,'' Severino shares. ``A script needs a good
video assist to appear as clever as you thought it to be.''
	   And it is perhaps through this understanding of video production
work that he mixes well with the staff of Probe Productions Inc.,
the company behind the Philippines' most awarded television
newsmagazine show, The Probe Team, of which Severino is a reporter
and producer.
	   Newest Member of Probe ``What I like best about Probe is the 'no
star system,''' Severino says.
	   ``Team work is always practiced. We share responsibilities and
credit each other for the good outcome.''
	   Married to environmental lawyer Ipat Luna for five years now,
Severino is the newest producer and reporter for the GMA 7, 10:30
p.m., Friday night program. ``It's actually my first time to work
full-time for a broadcast media company and I'm thinking this won't
be a fleeting job. I share a mutually-beneficial relationship with
Probe, one where each party can claim success without being
detrimental to the other,'' Severino enthuses. ``I work really well
with the staff. I mean, I'm not quite used to working with an
entourage and being the center of attention whenever we arrive at a
coverage area, but I am getting more comfortable every time. As I
said, the Probe people are not into the celebrity thing. They're
into it for the high it creates, for the fulfillment it brings.''
Severino says he is ``quite lucky'' to be able to indulge in what
he enjoys and actually get paid for it in the process. ``It's
really fun. The work is tiring but it's fun,'' he smiles. ``I never
took up film in college. I had History as my major and my only
training was under Gerry (Gerena, who helped him film his
documentaries). But with Probe, it is never a bother.
	   People here help each other and it makes work so much easier.''
	   ``They asked me to join (Probe) several years ago,'' Severino
relates, ``but I was too caught up in many other concerns. I guess
that being with Probe is something really good. It helps me a lot
in being able to get more mileage. As a television mediaman,
appearing on broadcast regularly, I am able to reach more people,
get my point of view across more cultural and social barriers. In
the end, the benefits are not just for me, but for the environment
as well.''
	   photo captions: photos by Gerard Cordero 1. He has been chased
by goons of illegal loggers; caught in an earthquake disaster site
while there were still strong tremors; swamped with eight libel
suits from powerful government officials -- yet Severino prefers
not to romanticize the risks of environmental journalism. ``It's
pretty much the same as other jobs,'' he says.
	   2. Severino tells how it is to work for the Philippines' most
awarded telemagazine show: ``Fun.''
	   3. Quite slim, medium-built, and soft-spoken - ``the country's
leading environmental reporter'' according to The International
Herald Tribune.

	   A NEWSPAPER had described the close juxtaposition of father and
son - Lim Kit Siang and Guan Eng - in the DAP leadership hierarchy
as a ``gunpowder situation'', and this has now more or less
exploded.
	   The party's leadership having assumed a hereditary structure,
and the apparent determination to keep it that way, was no longer
talked about in whispers but rather written in great detail by
newspapers.
	   Thanks to the removal of Wee Choo Keong as national publicity
secretary and suspension of Liew Ah Kim as vice-chairman and Fung
Ket Wing as treasurer.
	   The three were said to have undermined party morale, caused
confusion, disharmony and disunity by their remarks at the Perak
and Malacca State committee meetings.
	   DAP chairman Dr Chen Man Hin said the three had campaigned among
party members, alleging nepotism. ``They felt that deputy
secretary-general Guan Eng was being promoted by Kit Siang (his
father who is the secretary- general).''
	   The party's central executive committee removed the three as it
has lost confidence in them, said Kit Siang at a Press conference
the following day.
	   Several DAP leaders brushed off the resulting tempest as a
``storm in a teacup'' and a minor hiccup in the rough and tumble of
politics.
	   A cautious DAP national vice-chairman Dr Tan Seng Giaw remarked
that it was a small matter, no different from that of any other
organisation and will not seriously affect the party.
	   A more outspoken but nonetheless equally careful deputy chairman
Karpal Singh also quickly said ``it was not much of a crisis''
although an unfortunate circumstance.
	   They dismissed talk that it reflected serious party problems or
an internal split growing wider.
	   Karpal said if at all there was a split, it was to the ``limited
extent''
	   of the three on one side and the leadership on the other. ``Very
far from a split down the middle, if at all it can be said there is
one.''
	   Yet, the problem isn't as minor as they would like it to be; at
the very least, it is fuel for DAP critics who have long accused
the party of not practising the democracy it preaches.
	   Other than charges of nepotism, the abrupt removal of the three
isn't easy to explain away although Karpal said it was strictly
according to the DAP's constitution.
	   He said as the three were elected to their posts by the CEC,
they could also be removed by the CEC, but to lose their CEC
membership would be a little more complicated. This is because they
were elected as CEC members by delegates.
	   He also said it was not the end of the matter, as the three had
been referred to the disciplinary committee and could present their
case there.
	   They were also heard by the CEC before the decision to remove
them was taken.
	   ``It's about party discipline. They should have raised their
problems through the proper channels,'' Karpal said.
	   Legal arguments though may not be convincing to those who don't
believe this to be a problem of ``loose cannon'' blasting off for
personal reasons, but who see it as a manifestation of the
no-dissent culture and a move towards entrenching the power
structure.
	   It was a symptom of the lack of social democracy and a political
ideology within the party, said Dr Kua Kia Soong who gave this as
his reason for resigning.
	   Then the Selangor deputy chairman, Kua left the party in 1995
and later published a book, criticising the DAP for its political
structure which encourages patronage, and for failing to provide a
social democratic alternative to the Barisan Nasional.
	   He said the current crisis and that which saw his departure
shared the same roots, which he terms loosely as a lack of social
democracy and the advent of ``career-ist'' tendencies.
	   The latter refers to the bitter tussle for seats during the
general election.
	   He said the latest crisis indicated a worsening of the problems,
as two years ago, he could not imagine these stalwarts being openly
critical.
	   Whether the three were asked to give their views or did so
without prompting at the Perak and Malacca branch meetings, they
had spoken of the ``preferential treatment'' to garner support for
Guan Eng, while Wee, who also lost his seat after being fined by
the court, didn't find similar campaigns for him.
	   Guan Eng was sentenced to 18 months' jail for printing false
news and inciting the public in 1995.
	   Their comparison of the two cases implied a scenario of
intensifying nepotism, and was apparently also the straw which
broke the camel's back.
	   Kit Siang, some claim, is increasingly unhappy with those who
made oblique and direct references about the DAP's power structure.
	   But as this is by no means the first crisis in the DAP,
observers suggest that the present thunder and lightning too, will
pass without leaving permanent damage.
	   They also don't believe that there will be much of an impact on
voters, given the lack of choice in Opposition parties.
	   As Kua said, people generally voted for the DAP ``not because
they love the DAP more'' but as a protest.
	   He thinks the protest factor would continue to influence voters
more than the attractiveness or otherwise of the DAP.
	   Nevertheless, it won't do the DAP much good to be accused of the
very thing it is protesting against in its ``Support Guan Eng''
campaigns - the gagging of critics and high-handed rule.

French driver takes lead in Acropolis Rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ French driver Didier Auriol outpaced
Britain's Richard Burns to take a commanding lead in the second day
of the 45th Acropolis Auto Rally on Monday.
	   Auriol, with Denis Giraudet as co-driver in a Toyota Corolla
WRC, took advantage of a problem Burns had in the special stages to
move from third to first place in total time of 2 hours, 52
minutes, 52 seconds.
	   Burns, in a Mitsubishi Carisma, dropped to fifth place after a
tree branch broke his windshield during the first of the five
scheduled special stages of a total of 128 kilometers (80 miles).
	   The British driver was only 11 seconds ahead of Auriol in the
opening day Sunday.
	   Another British team, Colin McRae with co-driver Nicky Grist in
a Subaru Impreza WRC, won two special stages to retain second place
in a time of 2:52.57.
	   Of the 103 cars which were flagged off at the foot of the Athens
Acropolis hill, 70 are still in the gruelling rally, considered to
be one of the toughest in the world.
	   Unlike previous races, this year's rally will end in the western
town of Delphi. The ancient Greeks considered Delphi to be the
center of the world. It was also the site of the oracle that
ancient Greeks consulted for prophesies of the future.
	   Two-time Acropolis Rally winner Juha Kankkunen of Finland in a
Ford Escort WRC improved his position by moving from fifth to third
place on the provisional standings.
	   The drivers will cover a total of 1,036 kilometers (647 miles)
through Greece's best and worst roads in the three-day rally.
	   The rally counts towards the world driving championship.
Mitsubishi, Subaru and Toyota of Japan, and Ford of Britain are
competing for the manufacturer's trophy.

	   MALAYSIAN-backed Australian Hospital Care Ltd (AHCL) said that
its full- year profit would be less than forecast in February
because of a continuing fall in patients with private health
insurance, Bernama reports.
	   The group also blames the slide of its share price on persistent
rumours that Peremba Group Sdn Bhd might be looking to sell its 33
per cent stake in AHCL despite vigorous denials by the Australian
group of any sellout by the Malaysian company.
	   According to the Financial Review in Melbourne, AHCL chief
executive Dr Mark Bryce had predicted in February that the
full-year profit would be more than 15 per cent higher than the
A$14.5 million for 1996-97.
	   But the newspaper reported Bryce as saying that the profit
downgrade was necessary because AHCL had been severely affected
over the past two months by the fall in number of patients with
private health cover and lower than usual patient volume in its

	   KITARO - Gaia Onhashira THIS album from the Japanese master of
New Age music takes its inspiration from an unusual festival
originating from the Suwa Basin that is based on a Shinto ritual.
	   It's about the people of Suwa going into the mountains and
cutting down a giant fir tree which they haul back to the town to
erect.
	   Prayers are said around it, to establish a rapport with the God
of the mountain.
	   The reverence for nature and its roots in Japanese religion are
elements very close to Kitaro's heart and is reflected in the
mystical nature of the music here.
	   Yamadashi starts out with a rustic atmosphere, created by sounds
of the wind and bird calls.
	   Some brooding orchestral chords creep in before electric guitars
state the musical themes which give way to hoarse emotive
vocalisations in Japanese and the kodo drums resound, to introduce
a festive and cheerful mood.
	   Misty features plaintive flutes playing sweet and low in a
restrained neo-classical style, while Gaia starts with some runs on
nylon string guitar to ominous drums resounding in the background,
before it reaches an orchestral climax.
	   Kitaro is one of the masters at combining the sounds of
technologically advanced instruments like synthesisers, sequencers,
and electric guitars, with the folk and primitive instruments to
come up with a very natural mix. Wood Fairy has all these elements
and makes for stirring listening.
	   While the album deals with serious themes, Kitaro's ear for
melody and riveting rhythms make this album accessible even to the
casual listener.
	   GEORGE MARTIN - In My Life MARTIN is a famed pro-ducer/arranger
who worked with the Beatles on all of their albums, until they
disbanded in 1970.
	   He entered the music industry in 1950, played the oboe
professionally before being appointed head of Parlaphone in the EMI
Group in 1955.
	   In 1962, he signed the Beatles on, and helped them in recording
arranging and scoring their albums.
	   He also worked with the biggest names in the business, from jazz
singer Cleo Laine, rock guitarist Jeff Beck and Stan Getz.
	   He was knighted in 1996, and decided to retire in 1997, with
this album as his swan song.
	   It's a collection of songs from the Beatles, with singers and
musicians handpicked by him.
	   Come Together features Robin Williams and Bobby McFerrin, in a
faithful remake of the original. While McFerrin's vocal abilities
are well known, Williams also shines here.
	   A Hard Day's Night, with a cool and swinging jazz arrangement,
has the unlikely choice of actress Goldie Hawn who proves to have a
soft and seductive voice on the tune.
	   One of the highlights of the album is guitarist Jeff Beck's
moving instrumental of A Day in The Life. Beck plays with great
feel and emotion on this psychedelic ballad.
	   Celine Dion adds her inimitable touch to Martin's favourite
McCartney tune, Here There &AMP; Everywhere, while Vanessa Mae plays a
classical version of Because.
	   For the whimsical tune I Am The Walrus, Martin invited the
idiosyncratic comedian, Jim Carrey who turns in a wild over-the-top
version of this odd song.
	   There's also a classical version of Here Comes The Sun, by
guitarist John Williams, and Japanese pop star Bonnie Pink performs
a restrained version of Blackbird.
	   Phil Collins tackles Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight and The
End, while Sean Connery intones In My Life in his suave, gravelly
tones.
	   It's an album well worth listening to. Martin has obviously a
great love for the material and while some of the songs are not
identical to the originals, they do not suffer for it.
	   TWENTIETH CENTURY BLUES: The songs of Noel Coward - Various
Artistes SONGWRITER, playwright, and actor, Coward (1899-1973)
reflected the mood and spirit of England in his well-crafted songs.
He was the decadent rebel in the 20s, the serious sophisticate in
the 30s, the stern patriot in the 40s and the hip cabaret artiste
in the 50s.
	   This album is part of the Red Hot Aids Charitable trust, which
has produced several other albums in its efforts to raise funds for
Aids research and its victims.
	   Coward himself was a homosexual, which in those days was much
less acceptable.
	   Lots of stars appear on this album, like Texas, Divine Comedy,
Pet Shop Boys, Shola Ama, Robbie Williams, Bryan Ferry, Marianne
Faithful, Space, Suede, Sting, London Pride, Vic Reeves, and Elton
John.
	   The music varies from hip hop to techno, to swing. His work may
not be familiar to the public but this is as good a time as any to
check it out.
	   JOHN ANDERSON - Super Hits COUNTRY singer Anderson has a
homespun image with a pleasant tenor voice, very mainstream
country. This is a `greatest hits' album which means the songs are
pretty good.
	   Straight Tequila Night and Seminole Wind are affecting ballads
while When It Comes To You is an engaging Mark Knopfler
composition.
	   Country fans will find this a good buy.
	   TITANIC DANCE - Various Artistes IT had to come, I guess - the
dance version of My Heart Will Go On. Well this collection features
that song as well as lots of other tracks remade with a techno
beat.
	   There's a bit of an Asian theme here, with Huang Fei Hong, Tian
Mi Mi, Kung Fu Fighting and Matsuri in the collection.
	   In addition a bonus CD comes free with alternate mixes of some
of the songs on the first album. So what you get is 140 plus
minutes of dance time. Phew! THE MOFFATS - Chapter 1: A New
Beginning THESE guys who are in their early teens, are siblings,
comprising of triplets and an elder brother. They are fresh-faced
kids, against drugs and smoking and wrote many of the songs on the
album.
	   They have been playing for several years, starting out as a
kiddie group on the country circuit in Canada and the US.
	   Now they are ready to take on the world and they already have an
international hit in the catchy I'll Be There For You, which has a
feel similar to the Hanson's hit, Dowop, and which kicks the album
off.
	   Miss You Like Crazy, a melodic pop ballad, is already scoring
good airplay.
	   The rest of the album is more or less in the same vein, although
perhaps not as inspired as the first two tracks. It's mostly
romantic pop music, easy on the ears, and should suit teenagers
real fine.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The death of Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled
Nigeria for five years, evoked mixed reaction Monday from many
Nigerians have been waiting for the military dictatorship to return
power to the people.
	   In Jerusalem, exiled playwright Wole Soyinka called Abacha's
death ``an opportunity for Nigerian civic society, an opportunity
for the Nigerian military, and an opportunity for the international
community.''
	   Soyinka, winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in literature and an
outspoken opponent of military rule, fled Nigeria in 1994. Abacha's
military regime charged him with treason, a crime punishable by
death.
	   Reacting to news of Abacha's death, the United States and
Britain urged a quick transition to democracy in Nigeria, a former
British colony.
	   ``We hope that following the death of Gen. Abacha, there will be
an opening for a stable transition to an early return to democracy,
with the election of an accountable civilian government which will
restore and respect human rights,'' Britain's Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called
for a ``genuine democratic process'' leading to a transfer of power
from military to civilian rule in Nigeria.
	   Even while Abacha was still in power, Nigerians were struggling
to restore democracy, Soyinka said in Jerusalem, where he was
lecturing at Hebrew University.
	   ``The people were sick of military dictatorship,'' he said. ``So
it's up to the military to recognize this _ and up to the
international community to say that we're sick and tired of the
degeneration of a potentially great society.''
	   In Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, many people honked car horns
and cheered in the streets.
	   ``This death gives us an opportunity to restart our lives,''
said opposition leader Soloman Lar. ``It is our hope that Nigeria
will not miss that chance.''
	   His sentiments, shared by many others, were in stark contrast to
the official reaction. The radio announcement was followed by a
broadcast of solemn martial music. Military and civilian members of
his ruling junta paid tribute to Abacha, claiming his death was a
loss.
	   ``This is a very sad development for us as a nation,'' said
Lyorcha Ayu, the president of federal senate.
	   In the western city of Owerri, streets were virtually empty
after people rushed home upon learning of the news. Although no
additional military presence was evident, some people said they
feared Abacha's death could trigger violent protests.
	   ``I know not everybody liked him, but I don't like his death,''
said taxi driver Silas Nwogu. ``He had been running the country,
and he said he would hand over power, and we were waiting for that
to happen.''
	   In the Niger Delta city of Port Harcourt, oil executives said
Abacha's death would have little impact on their work.
	   ``We try not to get involved in politics,'' said Victor Dania,
the director of community affairs for Shell Oil's Nigerian joint
venture. ``There won't be an impact on our production.''
	   The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. has come under severe fire
in recent years for its doing major oil business in Nigeria while
Abacha remained in power. Shell has always maintained that it has
been in Nigeria for years and its operations had nothing to do with
local politics.

Clinton urges international stand against drugs

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from other leaders, incorporating details
from UN-Drug Blame. &QL; 
 &UR; By SONYA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Armed with plans for a dlrs 2 billion
media campaign to help stanch the flow of narcotics across
international borders, President Bill Clinton asked world leaders
Monday to ``stand as one against this threat'' without blaming each
other for the problem.
	   In an opening address at the U.N. General Assembly special
session on drugs, Clinton told representatives of about 150
countries, including 35 heads of state and government, that it is
time to stop bickering over whether blame for international drug
trafficking lies with countries that demand drugs or those that
supply them.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who met privately with
Clinton before the session, called the drug scourge ``a tragic
reality'' and appealed to member nations to work seriously on
finding common ground on fighting drugs.
	   ``It is my hope that when historians study the work of humankind
in drug control they will write about the next few days as the
point at which this trend was reversed,'' Annan said. ``We must
never give in to the human toll illegal drugs are taking on our
societies.''
	   Also at the session were Presidents Jacques Chirac of France,
Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Rafael Caldera of Venezuela, Alberto
Fujimori of Peru, Hugo Banzer of Bolivia and Ernesto Samper of
Colombia.
	   Zedillo called for a ``balanced strategy'' to combat drug
trafficking ``so that no one can become the judge of others and no
one feels entitled to violate other countries' laws for the sake of
enforcing its own.'' This is a clear reference to the controversy
over ``Operation Casablanca,'' a major U.S. money-laundering sting
that led to the arrests last month of 42 people _ including about
two dozen Mexican bankers.
	   Clinton avoided any direct criticism of other countries'
efforts, saying, ``Pointing fingers is distracting. It does not
dismantle a single cartel, help a single addict, prevent a single
child from trying _ and perhaps dying _ from heroin. Besides, the
lines between countries that are supply countries, demand countries
and transit countries are increasingly blurred. Drugs are every
nation's problem.''
	   President Clinton's appeal to avoid finger-pointing, leaders of
the world's drug-producing nations showed no hesitation Monday in
blaming consumers for the global narcotics problem.
	   Their message: if rich countries such as the United States want
our help in fighting against drugs, show us the money.
	   ``The illicit drug trade is demand-driven,'' the prime minister
of the tiny Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis told the
opening session of the U.N. General Assembly special session on
drugs.
	   ``How can we truly expect small, poor countries such as mine to
defeat the wealthy drug lords if the rich countries, with their
wealth of resources, are unsuccessful in limiting the demand,''
said the prime minister, Denzil Douglas.
	   ``We need resources, and it must come from the international
community,'' Peru's Fujimori told reporters as he arrived for the
opening session. ``And I think this will consolidate the reduction
of production _ it might in the Peruvian case - the production of
cocoa leaves.''
	   Banzer of Bolivia said his government was committed to
eradicating illegal production of cocoa, which is used in the
production of cocaine. But Banzer said the program will cost dlrs
952 million over five years, including dlrs 700 to provide
alternative crops and markets for the 35,000 Bolivian families
whose livelihood comes from the illegal crop.
	   He appealed to the United States and other wealthy countries to
pick up 85 percent of the cost of the program, reminding them that
``each dollar we devote to combating drug trafficking has painful
social costs.''
	   Clinton said a dlrs 2 billion, five-year media campaign against
drugs would be launched in the United States, targeting young
people with a message that ``drugs destroy young lives, don't let
it destroy yours.''
	   Similar campaigns will be launched in Mexico, Venezuela and
Brazil, Clinton said.

	   MANY women, at sometime or other, have looked in the mirror and
seen the reflection of a dull, lacklustre complexion.
	   A clear luminous complexion is a symbol of beauty, yet it is
constantly under threat.
	   The sun's rays, the ageing process, fatigue and the stress of
modern living are just some factors that combine to cast a shadow
over skin.
	   Women today are more aware of the need to protect their skin so
as to preserve its beauty and radiance, ageing gracefully and
beautifully.
	   But beyond mere protection, appropriate cosmetic formulas can
now go further and have a genuine action on the clarity of the
complexion, provided they are pertinent, scientifically-tested,
developed by experts and based on in-depth knowledge of skin
metabolism.
	   Using innovative and highly specialised technologies, applied
for the first time to a cosmetic formulation developed to clarify
the skin, Christian Dior laboratories have responded with a super
formula - White Essentiel.
	   Adopting a new approach to AHAs, White Essentiel has a
combination of an AHA with a filmogenic macro-molecule that helps
stabilise it in the topmost layers of the skin. White Essentiel
works via direct action on the mechanisms of pigmentation.
	   Since its launch on May 1 in Malaysia, many local women have
reported success with glowing results after using White Essentiel
on a daily basis.
	   ``It just takes a few days of regular usage to show an
improvement in skin texture and clarity,'' says Eugenia Loh of
Christian Dior.
	   ``The ingredients in White Essentiel work indirectly on the
messages that trigger pigmentation.''
	   The success of this skin-care formula lies in Dior's commitment
towards finding the solution to creating the perfect, flawless,
clear complexion.
	   Targeting clarifying skin care as their key focus in their
research and development programme, research experts at Dior worked
on three fundamental questions that naturally arise: Why does
complexion become dull?
	   Why do dark spots appear?
	   How is it possible to go further in clarifying skin care?
	   With age, fatigue and stress, an unhealthy lifestyle and
repeated exposure of the sun's rays, the natural skin renewal
process, which occurs approximately every 28 days, is slower.
	   Repeated exposure to UV rays is a major factor in developing an
excessive number of free radicals that overstimulates tyrosinase
and triggers over production of melanin.
	   Massed in the cells, melanin then builds up in the skin,
becomingly increasingly difficult to eliminate and leading to the
formation of dark spots or freckles.
	   Dior laboratories have demonstrated in laboratory tests that the
application of a Vitamin C derivative to a sample of isolated skin
exposed to UV rays, reduces the level of thymine dimers
(photo-products of cell degeneration), showing a protective effect
of the vitamin against the damage of UV rays.
	   The global action of Vitamin C on tyrosinase is combined with
that of Licorice Extract and these two agents ensure a reinforced
action on excessive pigmentation.
	   The oxidising stress caused by free radicals is a factor in the
over- production of melanin but by enriching a clarifying formula
with a cell protection agent, it is possible to optimise its
effectiveness.
	   White Essentiel offers a dual skin-lightening performance and
represents an essential contribution to the progress of
cosmetology. For the first time, two clarifying technologies are
combined for increased effectiveness on skin clarity.
	   Because of their exfoliating action, AHAs are capable of
breaking the microscopic bonds, which link dead cells together.
Once the cells are separated from each other, they can be
eliminated more easily.
	   The addition of malic acid and a sweet almond protein help
stabilise the AHA in the top layer of skin and prevents it from
migrating down to the deeper layers. This ensures a surface
exfoliating action which is perfectly controlled, continuous and
ultra-gentle.
	   Skin is simulated and can renew itself more quickly; dead cells
clustered on the surface of the skin and charged with melanin are
eliminated.
	   Roughness is diminished, the complexion visibly smoothened and
brightened - all so gently. Thanks to a unique synergy of actions
in White Essentiel, the formation of melanin is limited from the
start. This results in an even clearer, more even flawless
complexion.
	   Smoothed, refined, renewed, the complexion becomes fresher,
brighter and more luminous. The dull film is gently smoothed away.
Dark spots and freckles appear less visible, the skin is more even,
its clarity spectacularly enhanced. Used day after day, White
Essentiel revives the radiance and translucent quality of the skin.
	   This formula is of a fresh delicate texture - an ultra fluid,
transparent and absolutely non-greasy essence. It is absorbed by
the skin in a few seconds.
	   The essential skin-brightening ritual for the face and neck, it
should be used all year round, morning and night, before any other
skin care product.
	   Presented in a pearly white bottle with curved, feminine lines,
White Essentiel's precious essence is dispensed by a dropper system
for ultra- precise dosage. Just two or three drops are enough for
the whole face.
	   The opaque finish of the bottle protects all the properties and
effectiveness of the formula's active ingredients.
	   It is priced at RM150 for the 30ml bottle (RM158 in Sabah,
Sarawak) and RM220 for the 50ml (RM231 in Sabah, Sarawak).

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian strongman Gen. Sani Abacha died
Monday of a heart attack at age 54, ending the latest in a long
string of military dictatorships in his oil-rich but impoverished
country.
	   A uniformed officer stood before the State House in the capital,
Abuja, to make the announcement. Martial music filled the
state-controlled radio airwaves to officially mark his death.
Unofficially, his myriad critics and opponents poured into the
streets of Lagos to celebrate. Top officials convened an emergency
meeting.
	   Jubilant crowds in some Lagos neighborhoods defied the normally
heavily police presence to began cheering at the news of Abacha's
death.
	   ``This death gives us an opportunity to restart our lives,''
said opposition leader Soloman Lar. ``It is our hope that Nigeria
will not miss that chance.''
	   Despite the celebrations, uncertainty loomed as the question of
succession remained unanswered.
	   In life, Abacha offered little indication of who might take his
place, wielding absolute power in Africa's most populous nation
ever since canceling presidential elections in 1993 and seizing
power in a bloodless coup.
	   Less than two months ago, Abacha's deputy leader, Gen. Oladipyo
Diya was sentenced to death for allegedly plotting the overthrow of
the military regime.
	   Two likely successors, however, include Nigeria's chief of
defense, Staff Maj. Gen. Abdul Abubakar Salam, and Lt. Gen.
Jeremial Useni, the minister for the capital territory of Abuja.
	   Western diplomats said Salam, who presided over an emergency
meeting of junta leaders on Monday, was a leading candidate to lead
the country at least over the short term.
	   Without a clear line of succession, Nigeria's many opposition
groups could try to capitalize on a power void.
	   Oil executives in the Niger Delta city of Port Harcourt said
Abacha's death would have little impact on drilling or production
operations.
	   Nigeria's oil industry _ one of the largest in the world _ was
left to decay under Abacha's rule, but continues to be the
country's largest source of export revenue.
	   ``We try not to get involved in politics,'' said Victor Dania,
the director of community affairs for Shell Oil's Nigerian joint
venture. ``There won't be an impact on our production.''

Woodward mother accused of submitting phony housing bill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Precedes LONDON &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout and CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN ESTRIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The husband of the lawyer fired by Louise Woodward
accused the British au pair's mother Monday of forging a housing
bill to get money from her daughter's legal defense fund.
	   Dan Sharp, whose British-born wife, Elaine Whitfield Sharp, was
fired by Ms. Woodward last week, described the dlrs 15,400 bill as
a sham. The invoice purportedly covered several months of lodging
for Sue Woodward at the Sharps' Marblehead home.
	   Sue and Gary Woodward stayed at the lawyer's house while their
daughter was on trial for the death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen.
After her release from prison last November, Ms. Woodward stayed at
the Sharps' home until about two months ago.
	   ``We didn't charge the Woodwards one penny,'' for their
accommodations, Dan Sharp told The Associated Press. ``This is a
phony bill and it is clear they were taking money from the trust
and lying to the trust.''
	   A lawyer for the Woodward family in England, Paul Barrow, denied
the allegations.
	   ``This is not a forgery,'' he said. ``That statement of account
was handed to the Woodwards by the Whitfield Sharps and any
allegations of impropriety are absolutely denied by the
Woodwards.''
	   Barrow added: ``As far as my clients are concerned that is the
end of the matter. Sue is more worried about her daughter than this
nonsense that the Whitfield Sharps are bringing out for reasons
best known to themselves.''
	   Ms. Whitfield Sharp declined to comment. But her husband gave
The Associated Press copies of an invoice and a handwritten note
that he said purports to show that dlrs 15,400 was paid to him and
his wife from the account of Gary Woodward.
	   Sharp, who is also an attorney, said they never received any
money.
	   The bill, which Sharp described as a poor forgery, details
charges for the use of telephone, food, heat and other household
expenses, such as housekeeping.
	   The bill was distributed to the media by the Rev. Ken Davey, a
vicar who runs the Woodward appeal fund in her home village of
Elton in Cheshire, England.
	   Davey has said the Woodward legal fund stood at dlrs 400,000
(245,000 pounds) in December, but fell to about dlrs 80,000 (50,000
pounds) after paying for Ms. Woodward's appeal.

Red Wings look to Konstantinov for strength
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ In the Detroit Red Wings' locker room, a rock
sits on the shelf of a player's stall. One word, in English and
Russian, is written on it: ``Believe.''
	   The message has little to do with the Red Wings' desire to
become the first team since the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1991-92 to
repeat as Stanley Cup champions.
	   But it might have everything to do with why they are back in the
finals this year against the Washington Capitals in a best-of-7
series starting Tuesday night.
	   The prospect of another championship isn't motivating the Red
Wings this time. Tragedy is.
	   A year ago, defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov and team masseur
Sergei Mnatsakanov sustained brain-stem injuries in a limousine
wreck. The accident came six days after the Red Wings won their
first Cup in 42 years by sweeping Philadelphia on June 7.
	   ``Everybody was having the greatest time and we all suddenly
found out how important life is,'' Red Wings center Kris Draper
said Monday.
	   ``Every time we see Vlady and Sergei here is a reminder how
fortunate we are. This is who we are playing for. That's been with
us all year. It's emotional every time we see them, and when they
are not here, we have their spirit helping us along the way.''
	   In tribute, the Red Wings players have worn a patch just below
their right shoulders with the initials of both men.
	   Konstantinov's uniform hangs in his locker, ready to be worn.
The rock is on his shelf.
	   ``I don't know if anyone has said it, but everybody has
dedicated this season to Vlady and Sergei, for sure,'' said Detroit
defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov, who received minor injuries in the
limo accident.
	   ``In tough times the team has, everybody looks in Vlady's stall
and finds some extra stuff to bring to the games,'' Fetisov added.
``It would nice to win and dedicate all this to Sergei and
Vladimir.''
	   The Red Wings also had to overcome the offseason trade of
playoff MVP Mike Vernon to San Jose and a 59-game holdout by center
Sergei Fedorov.
	   ``A lot of adversity throughout the last year has made us a
stronger group,'' enforcer Joe Kocur said. ``There are times a team
wins a championship and you ride high for a time and you rest on
your laurels. With the accident happening six days later it really
opened a lot of eyes up.''
	   The Red Wings are an overwhemling favorite to repeat. They
knocked off in six games Phoenix, St. Louis and Dallas, the
regular-season champ. And with one more Stanley Cup championship,
Detroit coach Scotty Bowman will tie Montreal's Toe Blake for the
most titles with eight.
	   There are some questions about the Capitals as they enter their
first Stanley Cup final in their 24-year history. They did not have
the toughest postseason schedule in beating Boston, Ottawa and
Buffalo.
	   Washington goaltender Olaf Kolzig has been outstanding, with a
1.73 goals-against average. The Capitals also have a 7-1 record on
the road, which should help with the opening two games in Detroit.
	   ``Everybody has said everything about us, that we're chokers and
whatever, and this is just another thing,'' defenseman Mark Tinondi
said. ``We're not going to apologize because we got here and Jersey
didn't and this now isn't supposed to be this great series. Until
you play the games, you never know.''

Beirut votes for religious harmony; Amal, Hezbollah split Shiites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official Beirut results, interior minister's
comments, scuffles &QL; 
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Muslims and Christians endorsed religious
harmony in Beirut and militant Shiite Muslims made major inroads in
south Lebanon in municipal elections held after a break of 35
years, partial results showed Monday.
	   Despite Beirut turning into a Sunni Muslim majority city over
the years, 12 Christians and 12 Muslims were elected to the
24-member city council, dispelling fears that Christians would be
driven out of the local politics by Muslim voters.
	   All but one of the winners are from a Christian-Muslim ticket
backed by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, a Sunni Muslim who had
campaigned for religious unity.
	   ``To say it plainly, the number of Christians (elected) in
Beirut remained as it was before,'' Interior Minister Michel Murr
told reporters in announcing some of the official results.
	   Hariri's campaign, joined by other moderate Sunnis, was aimed at
ensuring that the delicate sectarian balance is maintained in
Beirut, as it is in senior government posts in this country of 18
religious sects.
	   But the Beirut election was marred by a low turnout among the
400,000 eligible voters _ as low as 20 percent in Christian areas
and up to 40 percent in Muslim sectors.
	   In the south, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group's
candidates scored major gains, chipping away at the power base of
the pro-Syrian Amal faction of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
	   Preliminary results estimated Hezbollah won 18 municipalities, a
further signal that it has succeeded in transforming itself from a
guerrilla force fighting Israeli occupation forces into a populist
movement.
	   But overall victory remained with Amal. The prize win for Amal
was in the southern city of Tyre while Hezbollah took the market
town of Nabatiyeh.
	   No official results from other places in the south were
available but Berri estimated that Amal won 51 of 75 wholly Shiite
towns, tied with Hezbollah in five others and took control of 22
mixed Christian-Shiite towns.
	   Scuffles broke out in the southern provincial capital of Sidon
between supporters of rival candidates. There were no injuries but
a car was gutted, security officials said.
	   Municipal elections have not been held since 1963 because the
1975-90 sectarian civil war and the political tensions that led to
and followed the conflict.

Yeltsin meets Kohl in Germany ahead of Paris G-8 meeting

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his
ministers came to Germany, a key trading partner, on Monday seeking
counsel on their financial turmoil at home.
	   Yeltsin's talks with his good friend, Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
were expected to focus on international credit for Russia following
a collapse in Russia's financial markets last month.
	   ``New problems keep emerging which need to be solved quickly and
energetically, and the both of us, Helmut and I, will solve these
problems this way,'' Yeltsin said upon arrival at the Bonn-Cologne
military airport.
	   Germany also will try to persuade Moscow to support the European
Union's decision Monday to punish Serbia for attacks on its
separatist region of Kosovo.
	   But asked before dinner with German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel whether Russia would get behind the EU's economic sanctions,
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said: ``No, I don't think
so.''
	   The EU decided in Luxembourg to ban investment in Serbia and
freeze its assets abroad, measures Russia has been reluctant to
endorse.
	   Shortly after arriving in Bonn, Russian ministers signed two
agreements with their German counterparts covering deliveries of
uranium and nuclear technology from Germany to Russia, Kinkel said.
	   Yeltsin and Kohl then began their talks at a dinner at the
chancellor's residence. They were to hold a joint news conference
Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin also was to discuss a broad list of political,
financial, trade and social issues in the talks, which were planned
before the current fiscal crisis.
	   Yeltsin has stressed his country's need for foreign credit while
it negotiates loans from the International Monetary Fund.
	   But he and his top officials insist Russia has rebounded from
last month's financial market collapse following a drop in oil
prices. They say vigorous tax collection will ensure stability and
that they have made no ``official'' request for direct foreign aid.
	   ``The begging time for Russia is over,'' Yeltsin told Der
Spiegel, a German newsmagazine, in this week's issue. ``We're not
asking now like we once did: Give, whoever can give.''
	   Despite the disclaimers, investors have said they believe a
bailout package may be unveiled after Yeltsin departs Germany,
possibly when deputy finance ministers from the Group of Eight
economic powers meet in Paris on Tuesday.
	   German government spokesman Otto Hauser said Germany would
provide no direct aid to Russia, but would not rule out taking part
in a rescue package put together by the IMF.
	   Since the fall of communism, Germany has become Russia's most
important trade partner outside the former Soviet Union, and a key
source of aid and credit. Germany has been key to negotiating
Russia's acquiescence to the eastward expansion of the NATO
military alliance.
	   Yeltsin also is scheduled to meet Tuesday morning with
opposition chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder.
	   Yeltsin returns to Moscow on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The death of Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled
Nigeria for five years, evoked mixed reaction Monday from many
Nigerians have been waiting for the military dictatorship to return
power to the people.
	   In Jerusalem, exiled playwright Wole Soyinka called Abacha's
death ``an opportunity for Nigerian civic society, an opportunity
for the Nigerian military, and an opportunity for the international
community.''
	   Soyinka, winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in literature and an
outspoken opponent of military rule, fled Nigeria in 1994. Abacha's
military regime charged him with treason, a crime punishable by
death.
	   Reacting to news of Abacha's death, the United States and
Britain urged a quick transition to democracy in Nigeria, a former
British colony.
	   ``We hope that following the death of Gen. Abacha, there will be
an opening for a stable transition to an early return to democracy,
with the election of an accountable civilian government which will
restore and respect human rights,'' Britain's Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called
for a ``genuine democratic process'' leading to a transfer of power
from military to civilian rule in Nigeria.
	   At the United Nations in New York, a spokesman for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Annan praised the contribution
made by Nigeria under Abacha to ending the civil war in nearby
Liberia and to restoring the democratically elected government of
Sierra Leone.
	   ``At this crucial juncture, the Secretary-General looks forward
to a peaceful and democratic future for the Nigerian people,'' the
spokesman said.

Central Asians appeal for help, blame Afghanistan for regional drug
</HEADLINE>
problem &QL; 
 &UR; With UN-Drug Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Pres Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Central Asian leaders blamed Afghanistan's
Taliban movement Monday for the region's drug problem and appealed
to the international community to help finance measures to curb the
flow.
	   ``Tajikistan cannot single-handedly prevent the transit of drugs
through its territory at the present time,'' President Emomali
Rakhmonov told the opening day's session of the U.N. General
Assembly's special session on drugs.
	   Tajikistan is a major transit point for opium-based drugs
smuggled out of Afghanistan to the West.
	   The Tajik president called on the international community to
establish ``an anti-drug safety belt'' around Taliban-controlled
parts of Afghanistan.
	   Rakhmonov said other countries of Central Asia had their hands
full trying to curb smuggling across their border with his country,
``thus leaving our state alone to solve the problem of locating the
starting point of drug trafficking from Afghanistan.''
	   Afghanistan and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, accounted for
90 percent of the world's illicit opium production in 1997. The
United Nations estimates that most of the heroin sold on the
streets of Western Europe comes from Afghanistan.
	   The United Nations believes most of the crop is grown in
Taliban-controlled areas. The Taliban has agreed to work with the
United Nations to curb production and encourage farmers to grow
alternate crops.
	   In his speech to the General Assembly, deposed Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani accused the Taliban of encouraging opium poppey
production.
	   ``The Taliban, in total defiance to all international norms and
standards, openly devises a tax on the cultivation and export of
poppies,'' Rabbani said. ``Furthermore, to finance their infernal
war machine, the Taliban are using newly transported refineries
inside Afghanistan to transform raw opium into heroin.''
	   The Taliban army seized 85 percent of the country last year and
drove Rabbani from the capital Kabul. But the General Assembly
never withdrew the seat of the Rabbani government, meaning he is
still recognized as the Afghan president, even though his northern
alliance controls only 15 percent of the territory.
	   Last Friday, the Taliban's unofficial mission in New York
condemned Rabbani's presence ``in the strongest terms.''

Team strength takes pressure off Bondra
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Peter Bondra always felt he had to be the best
player on the ice for the Capitals _ until he got a little help
from his friends.
	   Washington has been able to surround him with others who can
also carry the offense. As a result, the Capitals are in the
Stanley Cup finals for the first time in their 24-year history.
	   They open the best-of-7 series against the defending champion
Detroit Red Wings on Tuesday night at Joe Louis Arena.
	   ``The big story this year was that not just one or two players
can win a game for us,'' Bondra said Monday. ``Now, we have players
like Brian Bellows and Joe Juneau who also can score.
	   ``It's always pressure on the goal-scorer. But not much. I know
I don't have to score every night.''
	   It wasn't always that way.
	   Bondra was playing in Czechoslovakia in 1989 when he heard that
a National Hockey League scout was coming to his town to watch
another player. He knew that might be his only chance, so Bondra
geared up for that game.
	   ``I wanted to show what kind of player I was,'' Bondra said. ``I
think I scored two goals. A few days later, the NHL scout was in
town again, and he came to my house.''
	   The Capitals took Bondra in the eighth round of the 1990 draft.
It proved a wise choice.
	   Bondra, a four-time All-Star, has led the Capitals in scoring
each of the last four seasons, scoring 52 goals in two of the last
three years.
	   During the playoffs, however, the Capitals have been able to
spread the scoring around. Sergei Gonchar has seven goals and 10
points; Bondra, Juneau and Richard Zednik each have six goals;
Bellows has four goals and 10 points; Adam Oates has five goals and
14 points; and Andrei Nikolishin has one goal and 12 points.
	   The difference hasn't gone unnoticed by the Red Wings, bidding
to become the first team since the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1992 to
repeat as champions.
	   ``Everything used to be on his shoulders,'' Detroit coach Scotty
Bowman said of Bondra. ``Now he has got a lot of support. Now, they
have a European line _ like we've had _ with Nikolishin, Zednik and
Bondra. They have some good strength down the middle.''
	   It shows, too. The Capitals went through the first three rounds
of the playoffs with a 12-5 record, putting the 30-year-old Bondra
one step away from a longtime goal.
	   ``Ever since I came over to the NHL, this has been my dream, to
play for the Stanley Cup, to get in the finals,'' Bondra said.
``It's still only a dream. But now we have a chance to make the
dream come true.''

First Bolivian to reach Everest given hero's welcome
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER McFARREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ The first Bolivian and American Indian to
reach Mount Everest returned home Monday to a hero's welcome in La
Paz, where he was greeted by acting President Jorge Quiroga.
	   Bernardo Guarachi, 43, reached the world's highest summit on May
25 at 5:55 a.m. It was his second attempt. It took him only three
days to go from base camp to the 8,848 meter (29,028-feet) -high
summit.
	   At the La Paz airport, hundreds of students and fans greeted the
Aymara Indian who was raised on the Bolivian Highlands in an adobe
hut, 4 kilometers (2 1/2 miles) above sea level.
	   ``I have reached the summit of the Everest in the name of
Bolivia,'' Guarachi said. ``With will and dedication, all Bolivians
can aspire to a better future, and I hope my example can show that
anything is possible when one sets one mind to it.''
	   In the Bolivian capital of La Paz, Quiroga received Guarachi and
his family at the Congress building and described him as Bolivia's
greatest athlete. La Paz Mayor German Monroy gave Guarachi the
city's highest award.
	   Guarachi said growing up at a high altitude help him as a
mountain climber. It takes weeks of living at high altitudes for
many other climbers to adjust to the thin air that causes
everything from headaches and shortage of breath, to pulmonary
edema.
	   ``I think I am a privileged climber because I was born in the
Andes,'' Guarachi said. ``Living at this altitude has strengthened
my physical condition to better withstand foul weather and a lack
of oxygen.''
	   His training included a three-year mountaineering program at the
high altitude climbing school (DAV) in Germany.
	   Since his first climb up a Bolivian Andean peak in 1974, he has
reached the summit of the 6,642-meter (21,791-feet)-high Illimani
170 times and the 7,000-meter (22,965-feet)-high Aconcagua, Latin
America's highest mountain, three times.
	   Guarachi said his most dramatic climb up Illimani, which
overlooks La Paz, was in early January 1985. He was hired by
Eastern Airline to find the wreckage of a plane that crashed on New
Years day, killing all 33 people aboard. Guarachi was first to
reach the crash site.
	   He said it took him 20 years to prepare to climb Everest, where
more than 115 people have died in the attempt. Statistics show only
1 in 7 are successful. Since Edmond Hillary and Sherpa Tensing
first scaled the world's highest mountain in 1953, only 485 others
have made it.
	   Guarachi climbed with a Singapore team. He was part of a
commercially organized expedition, led by Thomas Sjogren, 39, of
Stockholm.
	   In 1994, bad weather forced Guarachi back after he reached 8,180
meters (27,000 feet).	   ``Guarachi is a sportsman and a treasure as far as mountain
climbing goes,'' said Quiroga, who is also an avid mountain
climber.
	   The Bolivian Government, private companies, the Inter-American
Development Bank and the Andean Development Corporation supported
Guarachi's efforts.

Primate males live longer if they care for young, study shows
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Taking care of the kids may help prolong the
life of primate fathers, according to researchers who studied
monkeys, apes and humans.
	   In species in which mating partners share parental duties
equally, males and females seem to live about the same length of
time, said John Allman of the California Institute of Technology,
co-author of a study appearing Tuesday in Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
	   This doesn't mean, however, that a father can extend his life
with a sudden burst of child care, said the researcher.
	   ``These are patterns that evolved over a long period of time,''
said Allman. ``They are a part of the different social structures
in these primate groups.''
	   Allman and his colleagues examined how adult males and females
share parenting chores in humans and in nine species of other
primates. They then compared the male-female longevity patterns in
the species.
	   For humans, they used Swedish census data going back to 1780.
For the animals, they examined the life history of up to 1,500
animals in each species.
	   The pattern that emerged, said Allman, is that among primates
that closely shared the care of offspring, the male-female
lifespans also were nearly the same. But in species in which males
took almost no part in child-rearing, the females outlive the males
by a wide margin.
	   For instance, in chimpanzees, where the male has almost no role
in raising the young, there are about three times more females than
males in the adult population.
	   Among mountain gorillas, where fathers will protect and play
with their young, females have only a slight survival advantage.
	   Allman said that among humans, based on the 200 years of Swedish
data, the women tend to live 5 percent to 8 percent longer than the
men.
	   Among two primates, the owl monkey and titi monkey, fathers
carry their young from shortly after birth, except for brief
periods of nursing. Allman said that titi monkey males actually
tended to outlive the females and lifespan was about the same among
the genders of the owl monkeys.
	   Allman said that among some new world monkeys, such as the
marmoset, males appear to highly prize the young and up to four
males may share parenting duties.
	   ``There have been reports that some fathers will actually steal
the children of others,'' said Allman.

Paul McCartney leads mourners at memorial service for late wife
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from McCartney, others after service &QL; 
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul McCartney penned the Beatles hit ``Let it
Be'' in homage to his mother, who died of breast cancer when he was
just 14. On Monday, McCartney gathered family and friends to
remember his wife Linda, who died of the same disease in April _
and, again, he sought solace in the haunting ballad.
	   Hundreds of mourners sang ``Let it Be'' at a private service in
the historic church of St. Martins-in-the-Fields Monday night in
tribute to Mrs. McCartney, photographer, vegetarian, animal rights
campaigner, musician, wife _ and mom.
	   ``It was amazing, it was a beautiful hymn,'' comedian Tracey
Ullman said after the service.
	   Other celebrity guests included the other two surviving Beatles,
Ringo Starr and George Harrison, Sting, Elton John and film
producer David Puttnam.
	   In adjoining Trafalgar Square, animal rights activists set up a
giant pair of angel's wings for condolence messages and hung
banners proclaiming ``Linda: The Animals' Angel'' in several
languages. Vegetarian children laid flowers beside a large
photograph of Mrs. McCartney cuddling a tiny chick.
	   Some stood for up to seven hours in rain and biting wind to pay
tribute.
	   ``Linda McCartney made vegetarianism mainstream,'' said Janet
Payne of west London, who carried a poster showing Mrs. McCartney
and a variety of farm and woodland animals.
	   ``I felt I had to come,'' said Julio Guereca, a disc jockey from
Mexico City who was on vacation in London. ``I just admired her so
much.''
	   McCartney, 55, winked and flashed a V sign for peace at the
crowds as he arrived at St. Martins-in-the-Fields with Heather, 36,
his wife's daughter by her first marriage and the couple's children
Mary, 27, Stella, 26 and James, 21.
	   He briefly put an arm around his son's shoulders as they made
their way inside the imposing 18th century church, which was
illuminated with candles and swathed in white roses and Lily of the
Valley, Mrs. McCartney's favorite flowers.
	   The Brodsky Quartet played eight songs McCartney wrote for his
wife, including ``The Lovely Linda'' and ``Calico Skies.'' Actress
Joanna Lumley and photographer David Bailey read poems and
McCartney, ``The Who'' guitarist Pete Townshend and writer Carla
Lane gave tributes.
	   In his own moving tribute to ``the girlfriend'' he lost,
McCartney recalled his wife as a great lover. ``We had a lot of fun
making those babies,'' he said.
	   Speaking of her death, he said: ``I still can't believe it but I
have to because it's true.
	   ``After she died I was thinking of her and I thought of her like
a diamond, a big orange diamond and if you look at all the facets
of the diamond as with every facet you looked at she was greater.''
	   The facets, he said, were like the different roles she adopted
in life like her career as a photographer and as a musician.
	   McCartney revealed that when he went to pick up his knighthood
from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace last year, Linda was
to ill to attend. But that morning, she presented him with a silver
watch inscribed, ``To Paul, my knight in shining armor.''
	   ``Through our kids, our beautiful kids, her spirit lives on,''
he said.

Queen attends gala tribute to impressario
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II joined celebrities Monday night
for a gala show celebrating the 30-year career of the producer
behind such megahits as ``Cats,'' ``Phantom of the Opera'' and
``Les Miserables.''
	   Accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, the queen was
entertained by extracts from shows produced in London's West End
theater district by Sir Cameron Mackintosh which went on to conquer
the globe, making him one of Britain's most successful theatrical
producers.
	   The star-studded cast of ``Hey Mr. Producer!'' performing in
front of the queen, who was dressed in a pale green evening gown,
included Julie Andrews, Judi Dench and Elaine Page, who has starred
in several musicals.
	   ``Hey Mr. Producer!'' began with a flashback to the day, 43
years ago, when an 8-year-old Cameron attended his first show _
Julian Slade's Salad Days _ and was captivated for life by the
romance of the theater.
	   It proceeded through his career and featured songs which he
helped put on the stage, including ``Food, Glorious Food'' from
``Oliver!'' ``Memory'' from ``Cats'' and ``Send in the Clowns.''
	   ``It is so special that the queen also is in the audience,''
said Ivana Trump as the evening began. ``I saw her as she came in
and it was great. She looked grand. It was lovely.''

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The death of Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled
Nigeria for five years, evoked mixed reaction Monday from many
Nigerians have been waiting for the military dictatorship to return
power to the people.
	   In Jerusalem, exiled playwright Wole Soyinka called Abacha's
death ``an opportunity for Nigerian civic society, an opportunity
for the Nigerian military, and an opportunity for the international
community.''
	   Soyinka, winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in literature and an
outspoken opponent of military rule, fled Nigeria in 1994. Abacha's
military regime charged him with treason, a crime punishable by
death.
	   Reacting to news of Abacha's death, the United States and
Britain urged a quick transition to democracy in Nigeria, a former
British colony.
	   ``We hope that following the death of Gen. Abacha, there will be
an opening for a stable transition to an early return to democracy,
with the election of an accountable civilian government which will
restore and respect human rights,'' Britain's Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called
for a ``genuine democratic process'' leading to a transfer of power
from military to civilian rule in Nigeria.
	   At the United Nations in New York, a spokesman for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Annan praised the contribution
made by Nigeria under Abacha to ending the civil war in nearby
Liberia and to restoring the democratically elected government of
Sierra Leone.
	   ``At this crucial juncture, the Secretary-General looks forward
to a peaceful and democratic future for the Nigerian people,'' the
spokesman said.
	   Abacha also is remembered for his way of dealing with opponents.
Public condemnation followed the Nov. 10, 1995, hanging of
environmentalist and playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other
political activists, convicted in a closed military tribunal of
murdering political opponents.
	   Critics said the charges were false _ Abacha's revenge for
Saro-Wiwa's constant challenges to the military government and his
criticisms of the environmental damage wrought by the oil industry.
	   In London, the son of Saro-Wiwa said that Abacha was the worst
in a long line of human rights abusers in Nigeria.
	   ``The thinking has always been that every successive dictator is
worst than the previous one,'' Ken Wiwa said. ``So one hopes that
we don't get another dictator because he will have quite a record
to better Abacha's appalling record.''
	   Even while Abacha was still in power, Nigerians were struggling
to restore democracy, Soyinka said in Jerusalem, where he was
lecturing at Hebrew University.
	   ``The people were sick of military dictatorship,'' he said. ``So
it's up to the military to recognize this _ and up to the
international community to say that we're sick and tired of the
degeneration of a potentially great society.''
	   In Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, many people honked car horns
and cheered in the streets.
	   ``This death gives us an opportunity to restart our lives,''
said opposition leader Soloman Lar. ``It is our hope that Nigeria
will not miss that chance.''
	   His sentiments, shared by many others, were in stark contrast to
the official reaction. The radio announcement was followed by a
broadcast of solemn martial music. Military and civilian members of
his ruling junta paid tribute to Abacha, claiming his death was a
loss.
	   ``This is a very sad development for us as a nation,'' said
Lyorcha Ayu, the president of federal senate.
	   In the western city of Owerri, streets were virtually empty
after people rushed home upon learning of the news. Although no
additional military presence was evident, some people said they
feared Abacha's death could trigger violent protests.
	   ``I know not everybody liked him, but I don't like his death,''
said taxi driver Silas Nwogu. ``He had been running the country,
and he said he would hand over power, and we were waiting for that
to happen.''
	   In the Niger Delta city of Port Harcourt, oil executives said
Abacha's death would have little impact on their work.
	   ``We try not to get involved in politics,'' said Victor Dania,
the director of community affairs for Shell Oil's Nigerian joint
venture. ``There won't be an impact on our production.''
	   The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. has come under severe fire
in recent years for its doing major oil business in Nigeria while
Abacha remained in power. Shell has always maintained that it has
been in Nigeria for years and its operations had nothing to do with
local politics.

Commonwealth's Nigeria contact man urges new elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The death of Nigerian military
ruler Gen. Sani Abacha provides an opportunity for the troubled
country to return to democracy, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said
Tuesday.
	   McKinnon, who is vice-chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group on Nigeria (CMAG), said the international community
should now press for ``free and democratic'' elections in Nigeria
in October.
	   CMAG was set up to monitor Nigeria after it executed nine
activists, including Nobel prize-winning writer Ken Saro-Wiwa,
while Commonwealth heads of government were meeting in New Zealand
in 1995.
	   Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth, and Commonwealth
leaders promised to take punitive action if free elections were not
held in Nigeria by October this year.
	   McKinnon told National Radio there had been reports for some
time that Abacha was ailing, but they had been dismissed as
exaggerated.
	   ``Well, it's happened and that will throw everything into
disarray, but I guess it does give the Nigerians a real opportunity
to move towards some kind of a democratic regime if given a
chance,'' he said.
	   ``Nigeria was one of the leaders in democracy in Africa back in
the 1960s and there's no reason why they can't return to it. But
it's very much up to (those there) to do something about it,'' he
said. ``There are a lot of pretty good-thinking people in Nigeria,
and I just hope they take this opportunity to press their claims
for a return to democracy.''
	   The international community could maintain pressure on Nigeria
to hold elections this year, he said.

 &UR; Drug producers point the finger at US, drug consumers for the drug
problem &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with complaints about moves against
money-laundering &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite President Clinton's appeal to
avoid ``finger-pointing,'' leaders of the world's drug-producing
nations showed no hesitation Monday in blaming consumers for the
global narcotics problem.
	   Their message: if rich countries such as the United States want
our help in fighting against drugs, show us the money.
	   ``The illicit drug trade is demand-driven,'' the prime minister
of the tiny Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis told the
opening session of the U.N. General Assembly special session on
drugs.
	   ``How can we truly expect small, poor countries such as mine to
defeat the wealthy drug lords if the rich countries, with their
wealth of resources, are unsuccessful in limiting the demand,''
said the prime minister, Denzil Douglas.
	   In his opening speech to the three-day conference, President
Clinton urged world leaders to stand together and avoid
finger-pointing in attempting to devise new, coordinated strategies
in the fight against drugs.
	   ``Pointing fingers is distracting,'' Clinton said. ``It does not
dismantle a single cartel, help a single addict, prevent a single
child from trying _ and perhaps dying _ from heroin.''
	   Clinton said ``the lines between countries that are supply
countries, demand countries and transit countries are increasingly
blurred. Drugs are every nation's problem.''
	   But Latin American countries, who account for most of the
world's supply of cocaine, don't see it that way.
	   ``We need resources, and it must come from the international
community,'' Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori told reporters as
he arrived for the opening session. ``And I think this will
consolidate the reduction of production _ it might in the Peruvian
case - the production of cocoa leaves.''
	   Ambassador Patrick Lewis of the Caribbean island state of
Antigua and Barbuda complained that small countries are often the
targets of American finger-pointing.
	   ``On the one hand, we are told that we must again adjust our
economic policies,'' he said. ``On the other hand, when we choose
the financial services sector ... we are labelled as havens for
money launderers and corruption and steps are taken to ... limit
our competitive advantages.''
	   President Hugo Banzer of Bolivia said his government was
committed to eradicating illegal production of cocoa, which is used
in the production of cocaine.
	   But Banzer said the program will cost dlrs 952 million over five
years, including dlrs 700 to provide alternative crops and markets
for the 35,000 Bolivian families whose livelihood comes from the
illegal crop.
	   He appealed to the United States and other wealthy countries to
pick up 85 percent of the cost of the program, reminding them that
``each dollar we devote to combating drug trafficking has painful
social costs.''
	   But U.S. officials were noncommittal about whether Washington
would back up words with dollars. U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey
sidestepped the question of whether Washington would be willing to
increase new funding for UN proposed drug plans, including crop
substitution.
	   U.N. officials estimate the annual bill would come to dlrs 250
million for 10 years:
	   ``In the United States, we assert that we lose dlrs 110 billion
a year direct cost to our society from drug abuse by 6 percent of
our population,'' McCaffrey said. ``And we put on the table a dlrs
17 billion package to confront this issue. But in the long run we
don't believe money will continue to grow in the coming years of
the counter-drug effort.''

Appleby enlists in golf's youth movement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON SIRAK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POTOMAC, Maryland (AP) _ Throw another name on the fire. Stuart
Appleby is yet one more young golfer clamoring for recognition as
one of the world's better players.
	   The victory in the Kemper Open by the 27-year-old Australian
means that for the eighth time in 21 PGA Tour events this year the
winner was 28 years old or younger.
	   And perhaps more significant, all eight are multiple winners in
their careers. No one-hit wonders here. These golfers are going to
be around for a while.
	   ``Hopefully, this is something I can keep on for 20 years,''
Appleby said after he closed with a 72 at TPC at Avenel for a
10-under-par 274 and a one-stroke victory over Scott Hoch.
	   Along with the Honda Classic last year, Appleby has now won
twice on the PGA Tour and finished second two other times.
	   Of the young winners this year, only Lee Westwood _ an
Englishman who does not play regularly in the United States _ won
on the PGA Tour for the first time. But if his credentials need to
be checked for membership in the Young Lions Club, keep in mind
that his victory in Europe this weekend was his second in two
weeks.
	   The credentials of the other under-30 winners are more than
impressive.
	   Phil Mickelson (27) has 12 PGA Tour victories. Tiger Woods (22)
has seven, including the 1997 Masters. Among the six victories by
Ernie Els (28) are two U.S. Opens.
	   David Duval (26) has won five times and was a very strong second
this year in the Masters. Justin Leonard (25) has four victories,
including the 1997 British Open, the 1998 Players Championship and
was second in the 1997 PGA Championship.
	   Last year when he came into Kemper, Leonard was just another
face among the rising young players. He had already won once on the
PGA Tour, but a slew of guys have done that.
	   The victory at Kemper last year, however, seemed to lift Leonard
to a new level. He has emerged as one of the world's top players.
	   ``Justin used it as a kick start,'' Appleby said. ``Hopefully,
that stuff will happen to me.''
	   Of the seven players under 28 who have won a total of eight PGA
Tour events this year (Duval has two), three already have at least
one major championship. The pressure of getting a breakthrough
major is gone for Els, Woods and Leonard.
	   Mickelson in particular since he has a dozen other victories,
Duval, Westwood and Appleby still have that hurdle to clear.
	   ``I really hope this does do something in the major
department,'' Appleby said. ``Again, to get your play at a major
level is another step higher. You only have four chances (each
year), so the odds are a lot less than in a regular tournament.''
	   Like virtually every other good young player on tour, Appleby
recognized that he is feeding off the accomplishments of the
others.
	   ``Players are going to get better as times goes on,'' he said.
``I'm learning from each tournament where I'm under pressure.''
	   On Sunday, he displayed much of what he has learned. He held off
an experienced Hoch down the stretch while playing in difficult
wind.
	   Appleby played the final two holes with Hoch already in the
clubhouse, and knew he could afford no mistakes.
	   All he did was hit a perfect 7-iron to the 17th green and an
even better 3-iron from 214 yards (195 meters) off a side hill lie
to the final green.
	   ``You can't practice competitive stress,'' Appleby said. ``You
can imagine you are holing out a putt for a tournament and that
stuff is neat. But really, in the end, the real stuff is hard to
get and that's what you have to learn from each time.''
	   Count Stuart Appleby among a very talented group of young
golfers who are learning their lessons well.

Martinez makes his pitch for Latin record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ In America, 243 is hardly a number that stirs
baseball passions like 56, 61 or 755.
	   In Latin America, though, it's big. Very big.
	   Dennis Martinez of the Atlanta Braves has equaled Juan Marichal
as the winningest Latin-born pitcher in U.S. baseball history,
winning his 243rd game last week with a 12-hit shutout at
Milwaukee.
	   On Tuesday night, the 43-year-old Nicaraguan will go for No. 244
against the Boston Red Sox in an interleague game at Turner Field.
Nicaragua waits to unleash the sort of pride it felt on that night
in 1991 when he pitched a perfect game.
	   Viva, El Presidente!
	   ``We as a Spanish-speaking population see it a different way
than the American population,'' said Martinez, who is 243-189 in a
major league career that began in 1976 _ one year before Braves
teammate Andruw Jones was born. ``The people of Nicaragua feel the
most proud. Now they feel like, `Yeah, we are somebody. He put our
country on top now.'''
	   While Marichal led a wave of players from the Dominican Republic
to the majors leagues, Martinez is the only significant player to
emerge from Nicaragua. That makes him more determined to give the
Central American country a lasting spot in baseball history.
	   ``People will know where we're coming from, where we are,''
Martinez said. ``They can see us on the map and find out where
Nicaragua is. All that recognition will allow most people to know
where I come from. It's great.''
	   The significance of the record hasn't escaped Martinez's
teammates, especially those of Latin descent. When he finished the
record-tying victory against Milwaukee, Ozzie Guillen and Andres
Galarraga _ both natives of Venezuela _ were the first ones to
arrive at the mound with smiles and hugs.
	   ``There's probably not too many people making a lot out of what
he's doing right now, but for all the Latin players it means a
lot,'' Galarraga said. ``It's a lot of games, it's a lot of wins,
it's a lot of years. It's something really special for us.''
	   Marichal, who injured his head in a car wreck in April, has been
recuperating in the Dominican Republic. Elected to the Hall of Fame
in 1983, he had a 243-142 record and 2.89 ERA while pitching for 16
seasons, mostly with the San Francisco Giants. He worked in 471
games, winning 20 or more six times.
	   Martinez, pitching in his 21st season, needed 657 games to reach
243 wins. He has never won 20 games in a season and his career ERA
(3.68) is much higher than Marichal's, but the Nicaraguan has
managed double-figure wins 15 times _ the first in 1977, the most
recent in 1995.

All Blacks hedge on Lomu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ All Blacks selectors have been
unable to split Jonah Lomu and Auckland teammate Joeli Vidiri for
the first test team to play England on June 20.
	   Lomu missed the Super 12 final and Monday's All Blacks trial
with injury and must prove his fitness in Saturday's match between
England and New Zealand A.
	   Canterbury's Mark Mayerhofler continued his fairytale rise when
he was named to make his debut in the center for the first test at
Carisbrook in Dunedin.
	   Auckland halfback Ofisa Tonu'u and Otago Highlanders hooker
Anton Oliver will start in their first full tests.
	   Otago's Taine Randell, as expected, has been named captain
following the retirement of Sean Fitzpatrick, with Auckland lock
Robin Brooke named vice captain.
	   Several of the All Blacks reserves, plus Lomu, have been named
in the New Zealand A team to play England.
	   All Blacks:
	   Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Mark Mayerhofler, Jonah
Lomu/Joeli Vidiri, Walter Little, Andrew Mehrtens, Ofisa Tonu'u,
Taine Randell (captain), Josh Kronfeld, Ian Jones, Robin Brooke,
Michael Jones, Olo Brown, Anton Oliver, Craig Dowd. Reserves:
Lomu/Vidiri, Caleb Ralph, Carlos Spencer, Mark Robinson, Todd
Blackadder, Mark Carter, Blair Larsen, Carl Hoeft, Norm Hewitt. Two
reserves to be omitted.

Time for Jazz to face the music
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Some of them looked as if they were walking
around with a hangover. Their coach said he hadn't caught a single
wink of sleep.
	   Others on the Utah Jazz simply shrugged it off as one game _
their 99th in a season that will have at least 101.
	   While Michael Jordan gleefully spoke of making prognosticators
eat crow, the Jazz were a mixed bag of emotions Monday, one day
after their unprecedented 42-point loss to the Chicago Bulls in
Game 3 of the NBA Finals.
	   ``The sun came up,'' said John Stockton, one of the players who
tried to find a bright side and put Sunday night's 96-54 defeat
behind them. ``Today's another day and we just go back to the
drawing board and try to start playing well again. That one's
behind us.''
	   But for every Stockton, there was an anti-Stockton. Take, for
instance, Karl Malone.
	   When asked about Dennis Rodman's defense, he looked as if he was
reliving the fourth quarter of Game 3. When asked about Utah's
mental toughness, he looked as if he wanted to jump from the podium
and pull a Sprewell.
	   ``Every time we've gotten embarrassed like this, we've
responded,'' Malone said. ``We have two days to swallow this one.''
	   The loss gave the Bulls a 2-1 lead in the best-of-7 series
entering Game 4 on Wednesday night, but it was such a shellacking
that it had to leave the Jazz with a mountain of self-doubt.
	   Most shocking was the way Chicago crippled Utah's offensive
schemes.
	   The Jazz didn't score 20 points in any quarter, including just
nine in the fourth. Utah hasn't reached 90 points in any of the
three games, nor have the Jazz shot 50 percent _ something they did
39 times this season while leading the league in shooting
percentage for the fourth straight year.
	   ``The task they have to deal with today is how do they break
down our defense,'' Jordan said. ``They have to find a way to break
open their offense and get more people involved other than Karl
Malone and John Stockton. We have a good feel for them and haven't
let them dictate their offense.''
	   But don't expect Utah to abandon the endless variations of the
pick-and-roll upon which they usually thrive.
	   Just because it didn't work in Games 2 and 3 doesn't mean it
won't work in Game 4, when Utah will be trying to regain home-court
advantage and ensure a return to Salt Lake City.
	   ``We're a very predictable team. We've been that way for 13
years,'' Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. ``If I change anything, my
players will be lost _ and I will, too.''
	   Each team practiced Monday at the United Center, although the
Bulls did so without Dennis Rodman, who stayed home with an
unexcused absence. The NBA fined him dlrs 10,000 for skipping out
on the media.
	   Chicago shrugged off The Worm staying in his hole, considering
it another easily overlooked distraction in a season full of them.
	   After all, this is a team that is possibly finishing off a run
of six championships in eight seasons before it is broken up over
the summer. Each loss is greeted by panic in this city; each
victory brings a chorus of relieved sighs.
	   ``I'm pretty sure we've proven to people that they're not very
good predictors,'' Jordan said. ``It's fun to see people eat crow _
talking about how the seven-game series would take so much out of
us and their 10 days' rest would be kicking in about now.
	   ``Our mental toughness and heart is a lot stronger than the
predictors said. I've always said that, I've always believed it.
People are starting to see that,'' Jordan said.

Sloan in good mood after bashing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ He was testy following a five-point loss in Game
2, so you'd expect Utah coach Jerry Sloan to be a real bear the
morning after the most lopsided defeat in National Basketball
Association Finals history.
	   Not this time. Perhaps he was too tired to be grumpy.
	   ``I feel good. If you stayed awake and didn't go to sleep and
had to face all you people, wouldn't you feel great?'' Sloan told
reporters at a mandatory question-and-answer session Monday.
	   The Utah Jazz, 96-54 blowout losers to the Chicago Bulls in Game
3, were trying to shake it off as just another loss. No team had
scored fewer points since the introduction of the shot clock for
the 1954-55 season.
	   ``I think the players are fine. They all said hello when they
got on the bus,'' Sloan said. ``When I really have a problem is if
they don't speak to me.''
	   Forward Byron Russell was also in a playful mood.
	   Teammate Shandon Anderson was dead serious as he gave
interviews, so serious he didn't notice Russell sneak up to the
edge of the group.
	   With a grin on his face, Russell piped up.
	   ``What about last night? Did you go out, have a good time?''
Russell asked.
	   Anderson, not realizing who was talking to him, looked up as if
to answer. There was Russell, giggling at him. Anderson smiled and
couldn't help but laugh.
	   ``You know what? That's what we need,'' Anderson said. ``We need
to be loose. I think everybody plays uptight, that's why sometimes
we get put in situations where we make mistakes instead of just
going out there loose and having fun.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; EVEN IN BOSNIA: &LR;  A Bosnian TV crew is among the more than 1,300
media members covering the NBA Finals, where 43 countries are
represented.
	   Croatia native Toni Kukoc is a big star in Bosnia, but not as
big as another member of the Bulls, announcer Mizra Vilic said.
	   ``Michael Jordan is most popular. Toni is popular, too, but not
like Michael,'' he said.
	   Kukoc, a three-time European Player of the Year, is finishing
his fifth season with the Bulls. Jordan retired a few weeks after
Kukoc arrived in 1993, and Kukoc was so upset that he wasn't going
to realize his dream of playing with the world's greatest player
that he cried.
	   Now that he and Jordan have played on two championship teams
together and are going for a third, Kukoc says he's never regretted
his decision to come to the NBA and see how good he really is.
	   Instead of being the star he was in Europe, he's behind Jordan,
Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman as the team's top attractions.
	   ``I have no problems with that simply for the reason it's a team
sport and once your team is winning championships and playing in
the Finals, you are going to be well recognized as a player,''
Kukoc said Monday.
	   ``If you're on other teams and not winning or not getting into
the playoffs, then nobody is going to take you seriously.''
	    &UR; ---- &QC; 
	    &UR; NOT RUBBING IT IN: &LR;  Jazz guard Jeff Hornacek didn't agree with
suggestions the Bulls were piling it on in the fourth quarter of
Game 3 by shooting 3-pointers. Chicago won by 42 points.
	   Utah was down by 20 with a couple of minutes to go in the third
quarter when coach Jerry Sloan took Hornacek out along with John
Stockton and Karl Malone.
	   ``He saw if we didn't make a run in the third quarter we were
not going to make one, it was not going to be our night,'' Hornacek
said.
	   ``I don't think they were running it up at all. I'm sure if we
were up 20 our bench guys would try to score. Our bench guys would
want to get out and play, too.''
	   The Bulls regulars, most notably Michael Jordan, Ron Harper and
Scottie Pippen, were yukking it up as they sat out the final
minutes.
	   ``They had fun doing it and I'd laugh, too,'' Utah's Bryon
Russell said.
	   ``It's not a big deal whether you lose by one, 50, or 60. It's
still a loss.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose modestly Monday, padding Friday's
big gains and positioning some measures for a new run toward record
levels. The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 31 points to
9,069, about 140 points from May 13's record close of 9,211.84. The
broad market also extended Friday's rally, although the battered
technology group fell back into a rut after a two-session rebound.
There were no major economic reports to consider in Monday's
session, which was dominated by news of a dlrs 34 billion merger
between Norwest and Wells Fargo and the government's decision to
bring an antitrust complaint against Intel. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks drifted slightly lower in light
trading Monday, while traders waited to see whether President Boris
Yeltsin would bring home an aid package from his two-day visit to
Germany. The Russian Trading System closed down 1.1 percent, a far
cry from the wild swings caused by panic-selling late last month.
The ruble was unchanged at 6.18 to the dollar. Although the markets
have stabilized and the Russian government insists no formal aid
request has been made, traders still expect a bailout either from
Yeltsin's German trip or the meeting of Group of Seven deputy
finance ministers in Paris on Tuesday. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Entering the second week of a strike with no
settlement in sight, Air France pilots moved onto a collision
course with the World Cup on Monday, two days before the soccer
championship begins. Trouble also was brewing on the ground with a
strike call by Bordeaux bus drivers for Thursday _ when droves of
tourists are likely to arrive in the southern city for the soccer
match between Italy and Chile. In the skies, only one in four Air
France planes took off Monday, the eighth day of the strike, and
the same was expected Tuesday. (AIR FRANCE-STRIKE)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Federal Reserve Monday approved the merger
of the U.S. operations of two big Swiss banks, which are
negotiating with Holocaust survivors in an effort to settle claims
that the banks stole assets from dormant wartime accounts. The
central bank governors voted 5-0 to approve the melding of American
operations of Swiss Bank Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland, which
are merging to create the United Bank of Switzerland. With some
dlrs 706 billion in assets, it will be the second-biggest bank
worldwide. The biggest is Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
(US-SWISS BANKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Federal Trade Commission voted Monday
to bring an antitrust complaint against Intel Corp., alleging the
giant microprocessor chip manufacturer froze out and punished
competitors that needed help in developing new products. When three
companies tried to enforce their own patents on computer parts and
technology, Intel retaliated by withholding vital technical
information and threatening to cut off the supply of chips, the
agency charged in an 11-page complaint. Asked what remedy he had in
mind, Baer told reporters at a news conference that he wanted an
order preventing Intel from continuing the alleged practice. Intel
controls 90 percent of the world market for microprocessor chips,
which are the brains of a computer system. (US-INTEL-FTC)
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The EU governments agreed after several hours
of talks Monday to phase out high sea drift nets by Dec. 31, 2001,
to prevent the unnecessary death of thousands of species such as
seals, dolphins and whales. Two countries, France and Italy, voted
against the agreement that applies to boats registered in EU
countries. Ireland abstained. Britain's Agriculture Minister Jack
Cunningham called the negotiations ``on the whole amicable but
tough.'' The negotiations have been on the agenda since 1994, he
said. France, Italy and Ireland argued the ban would threaten the
livelihood of fishermen. (EU-DRIFT NETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Honda Motor Co. agreed Monday to pay dlrs 17.1
million and extend warranties to settle charges that it disabled
pollution monitoring equipment in 1.7 million cars and vans. The
consent agreement announced by the Justice Department is the
largest civil penalty ever for violation of the Clean Air Act. It
could cost Honda as much as dlrs 267 million if future free auto
repair work is included, officials said. In a separate action, the
Justice Department also announced that Ford Motor Co. had agreed to
a dlrs 7.8 million settlement in a case involving tampering with
emission controls on 60,000 Econoline vans in an effort to get
better gas mileage. Ford agreed to recall the vans to fix the
defect and pay a dlrs 2.5 million civil fine. (US-HONDA-POLLUTION)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Gen. Sani Abacha, the Nigerian dictator
who crushed dissent, defied world condemnation and repeatedly put
off handing power over to a civilian government, died Monday of a
heart attack, leaving leadership of Africa's most-populous nation
in limbo. Crowds in some areas of the capital, Lagos, broke into
cheers at news of the 54-year-old leader's death. Many saw an
opportunity for a return to democracy _ even though there was no
sign the military was prepared to yield power, nor that Nigeria's
many rival ethnic groups would cooperate in a peaceful change of
power. ``This death gives us an opportunity to restart our lives,''
opposition leader Soloman Lar said. ``It is our hope that Nigeria
will not miss that chance.'' Abacha, who came to power in a coup
after canceling presidential elections in 1993, had not indicated

	   DECANI, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats saw devastation reminiscent
of the wars in Bosnia as they were escorted into battle-torn
western Kosovo province _ target of a Serb offensive that prompted
the EU and the United States on Monday to impose new sanctions on
Serbia. Besides burned-out houses and deserted villages, whose
forced evacuation have provoked comparisons to ethnic cleansing,
visitors to the besieged zone saw evidence of fierce fighting
between the Serbs and ethnic Albanian guerrillas. Along with
continued clashes and shelling Monday, the first-hand look at the
devastation provided stark evidence of a fast-worsening scenario
that Western powers fear could turn into another, broader Balkan
war. The destruction in the southern Serb province has increased
foreign pressure on Serbia to stop using its police and army
against militants battling for independence for Kosovo's 9-to-1
ethnic Albanian majority. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia followed its bombing of
Eritrea's capital with a warning Monday: Ethiopia might have no
choice but to renew attack if Eritrea refuses to withdraw its
troops, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said. The two East African
nations are locked in a border dispute, with Ethiopia resisting its
smaller, southern neighbor's attempts to assert control over
territory it says is wrongly held by Ethiopia. In Asmara, Eritrea's
capital, a spokesman for President Isaias Afwerki said Ethiopia had
effectively declared war on Eritrea and was using the threat of
renewed air strikes to blockade air and seaports.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Draping the site in Israeli flags, Jewish
settlers took over a pair of buildings in Arab east Jerusalem on
Monday, brawling with Palestinians who tried to stop them. At least
two people were hurt in the melee, including Faisal Husseini, the
top Palestinian official in Jerusalem. He was hit in the head by a
rock. The conflict in the Silwan neighborhood was the latest in an
escalating series of confrontations in Jerusalem's eastern sector.
Each side accuses the other of trying to grab land in the bitterly
contested city. Moving in before dawn, the settlers took over five
apartments in two buildings, plus a plot of land. They trucked in
furniture, strung barbed wire, and hung Israeli flags. ``I see
things getting worse,'' said Husseini, who has called for mass
street protests by Palestinians to block such settlement activity.
``This provocation is pushing the situation to the edge of
disaster.'' (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton challenged
world leaders on Monday to work together attacking illegal drugs
and stop wasting time ``pointing fingers'' of blame at each other.
He also announced a dlrs 2 billion media campaign aimed at young
people. ``The debate between drug-supplying and drug-consuming
nations about whose responsibility the drug problem is has gone on
too long,'' Clinton said in the opening address at a United Nations
General Assembly special session on drugs. About 150 nations were
represented at the U.N. session. In his speech, Clinton announced a
dlrs 2 billion, five-year media campaign against drugs, targeting
young people with a message that ``drugs destroy young lives; don't
let it destroy yours.'' Similar campaigns will be launched in
Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil, Clinton said, adding that he
discussed the issue with Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso on Sunday. (UN-DRUG SUMMIT)

Red Cross urges aid ombudsman to improve aid agencies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Recipients of humanitarian aid should have an
ombudsman to whom they can complain when charitable relief efforts
go wrong, the British Red Cross said Monday.
	   Proposals for a two-year pilot project will be unveiled
Wednesday at a World Disasters Forum in London, in the hope that it
will make aid agencies more accountable to the people they serve.
	   Experiences of major international aid operations over recent
years have made agencies became more aware that the absence of
regulations governing their activities has frequently led to a lack
of coordination and duplication of effort on the ground, as well as
poor targeting of relief supplies, the organization said.
	   With up to 300 aid agencies flooding into the Great Lakes region
in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide in 1994 and the subsequent
refugee crisis, there was confusion over what supplies were needed,
which agencies were best placed to provide them and who was
responsible for what, the Red Cross said.
	   When the major aid agencies met for last year's World Disasters
Forum, they agreed that change was needed to increase their
accountability, and the British Red Cross has coordinated the
development of the ombudsman idea in response.
	   ``As the role and responsibilities of aid agencies become more
extensive, we have a duty to become more accountable to those
people we serve,'' the project's coordinator, John Mitchell, said.
``An ombudsman is the best mechanism to achieve this.''
	   The ombudsman would be responsible for improving the delivery of
aid and would investigate complaints from beneficiaries.
	   Grievances the ombudsman might deal with could include
complaints about remote areas or nomadic tribes being missed by aid
distributors or about inappropriate aid being supplied, he said.
	   Mitchell said he would hope to prevent mix-ups which in the past
have seen slimming food supplied to starving Ethiopians and cheese
sent to people in the Far East whose bodies were unable to tolerate
lactose.

 &UR; Austria mixes treatment with ``zero tolerance'' for traffickers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Austria's drug strategy is based on
offering addicts treatment instead of punishment while applying the
full force of the law to traffickers, the country's interior
minister said Monday.
	   ``Addiction and dependence are primarily medical problems which
require a medical as well as therapeutic approach,'' Interior
Minister Karl Schloegl told the opening session of the U.N. General
Assembly special session on drugs.
	   ``As an alternative to penalty, the concept of `therapy instead
of punishment' for drug addicts is part of the Austrian anti-drug
strategy,'' Schloegl said. ``The drug addict is provisionally given
the chance for treatment with the aim of full social integration.''
	   But the minister said when dealing with traffickers ``criminal
law is fully applied.''
	   ``The Austrian fight against transnational organized drug
trafficking is guided by the principle of `zero tolerance for
serious drug traffickers,''' he said.
	   Schloegl said Austria has relatively low level of drug-related
crime because of the country's economic prosperity and ``continuous
economic growth over the last five decades.''
	   ``A society that is marked by solidarity and prosperity provides
the best basis for a successful multisectoral policy against
drug-related crime and drug abuse,'' he said.
	   But the minister said Austria was not immune to the drug trade,
and the country was carefully watching the Balkans as an avenue for
smuggling drugs into the country and on to other markets in Western
Europe.
	   The Austrian capital Vienna is the headquarters for the U.N.
Drug Control Office which was established to intensify the U.N.
role in the campaign against narcotics.

Loyalist troops in Guinea-Bissau in stand off with renegade troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops in the West African
nation of Guinea-Bissau remained in a tense stand off with renegade
soldiers early Tuesday after two military installations were seized
following a coup attempt.
	   Heavily armed troops were attempting to dislodge the renegade
soldiers from military installations 10 miles (15 kilometers)
outside of the capital, Bissau, on the road to the airport, the
Portuguese state-run news agency Lusa reported.
	   An unknown number of rebels were holed up at the bases _ a
military barracks and an arms depot _ in the suburb of Bra after
fighting with loyalist troops Sunday, according to Lusa.
	   Troops also set up roadblocks on routes to the presidential
palace and other government buildings and military installations.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira said former armed forces chief
Brig. Ansumane Mane was leading the revolt and was backed by
members of political opposition parties.
	   In a statement read on public radio Monday, Vieira vowed to
``use all possible means'' to quash the revolt.
	   Mane was fired six months ago during an investigation into arms
trafficking to the separatist rebels of Casamanca, a Senegalese
province that borders Guinea-Bissau to the north. Mane officially
gave up office only on Saturday.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Bryan Hunt, contacted by telephone, said
automatic weapons, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars were used
in the skirmishes near the Russian Embassy in Bissau on Monday.
Automatic weapons and small-arms fire could also be heard.
	   A reporter for Guinea-Bissau national radio, interviewed by
Lisbon radio TSF, said he counted 30 bodies scattered around the
two bases.
	   Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, has 1 million people.
	   There are about 100 U.S. citizens in the country, including
government officials, business people, tourists and Peace Corps
workers.

What a start: brilliant Brazil against the team with the worst
</HEADLINE>
World Cup record &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Brazil is gunning for its fifth World Cup title.
Scotland is trying to get past the first round at the eighth
attempt.
	   Wednesday's opening game of the biggest World Cup ever brings
together the championship's most successful nation against the one
with the worst record in the finals.
	   It's that kind of World Cup.
	   The heavyweights of world soccer _ Brazil, Germany, Argentina,
Italy, Spain, France and England _ are all here and are confident
of getting to the quarterfinals.
	   Debutant nations like Jamaica, Japan and South Africa will
celebrate if they reach the second round.
	   With the eyes of the world watching on TV and thousands of fans
travelling by bus, car, plane and even a train ride under the sea,
host nation France has dressed itself up for the 32-team
extravaganza.
	   The organizers have had to ride allegations that the tickets
shareout was unfair and favored the French. They also are on alert
from the threat of terrorism from North Africa and hooliganism from
known soccer thugs from England, Germany, the Netherlands and
Italy.
	   FIFA now has a new president, Sepp Blatter having beaten off
UEFA's Lennart Johansson in the battle to succeed long-serving
Brazilian veteran Joao Havelange, who has been in charge for 24
years.
	   Blatter's aims are to maintain the development of soccer in
outposts in Africa and Asia rather than allow Europe and South
America to dominate.
	   The Africans appear to be making faster progress than the Asians
with Nigeria coming into the championship as Olympic champion and
Cameroon making a third appearance in a row.
	   Against this background of change in global terms, the
qualifiers also have to contend with new measures on the field,
with a FIFA directive that referees must expel players who tackle
from behind in a dangerous manner. Bookmakers are taking odds of
only 10-1 that four or more players could be expelled in one game.
	   While referees get ready for a busy World Cup, each of the
qualifiers have their goals and reasons to do well.
	   The Dutch are anxious to show they can play as a team rather
than a gathering of talented players going nowhere.
	   The Yugoslavs have an eight-year soccer exile to make up for
because of wars in Croatia and Bosnia while Colombia still mourns
the tragic shooting to death of defender Andres Escobar four years
ago after an own goal against the Americans put his team out.
	   The United States, appearing for the third time in a row, is
keen to show it is maintaining its development as a soccer force
while Croatia has a great chance to make a splash on its debut.
	   The celebrations start Wednesday night after Brazil meets
Scotland and Norway faces Morocco.
	   The tartan-clad fans of Scotland will be raising glass of single
malt whiskeys if they avoid defeat against the mighty Brazilians,
who are coached by the wily Mario Zagallo and have probably the
most talented squad ever put together.
	   Although 1994 World Cup star Romario is sidelined through
injury, Zagallo still has Ronaldo, Bebeto, Edmundo and Denilson to
call on for his strikeforce.
	   In the same Group A, Norway should overcome the Moroccans at
Montpellier and have the players to become a strong candidate for
the quarterfinal.
	   On day two Thursday, Italy faces Chile and Cameroon meets
Austria in Group B. The Italians, who only made the finals through
the playoffs after finishing runner up in their qualifying group,
look a strong contender again provided star striker Alessandro Del
Piero regains full fitness.
	   On Friday, Group C favorite France meets debutant South Africa
in Marseille and Denmark faces Saudi Arabia in Lens. Paraguay and
Bulgaria meet in Montpellier while the other Group D game is
Saturday when Spain faces Nigeria at Nantes.
	   Neighbors the Netherlands and Belgium confront each other at
Saint-Denis Saturday when the South Koreans, making their fourth
appearance in a row but never past the first round, faces Mexico at
Lyon.
	   The first series of games will be completed by June 15.
	   In Group F, the United States takes on European champion Germany
at the Parc des Princes in Paris and Yugoslavia faces Iran at
Saint-Etienne. England starts out against Tunisia at Marseille and
Colombia meets Romania in Lyon in Group G.
	   Argentina, a two-time champion returning to form, hopes for a
high-scoring victory over debutant Japan in Toulouse while two more
first timers, Croatia and Jamaica, meet at Lens.

World Cup: Star teen Japan's World Cup hope in 1998 and 2002

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ At 18, Shinji Ono is the kid on
Japan's World Cup squad. But the shy, quiet midfielder happens to
be Japanese soccer's biggest hope for the future.
	   Ono is sure to be a central player at the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney as well as at the 2002 World Cup that Japan will play
co-host with South Korea.
	   Coach Takeshi Okada has repeatedly dropped hints that Ono is
bound for great things even sooner, at this World Cup, where Japan
faces Argentina, Croatia and Jamaica in the first round.
	   ``He has fantastic talent,'' Okada said.
	   In hierarchical Japanese society, it can be trying to be the
youngest member of a team.
	   ``It's not that bad, but I feel it,'' Ono said after a recent
practice at this French lakeside resort that is Japan's base camp
during the tournament. ``I am especially careful about my
language.''
	   Status distinctions in Japan are rigidly reflected in speech,
meaning different words and sentence structure must be used to show
respect to elders.
	   But the J-League's top rookie, signed with the Urawa Red
Diamonds, makes it clear all that doesn't apply on the pitch.
	   Ono's dream is to sign with a foreign league club, perhaps in
Spain, Italy or England.
	   ``I've always thought the World Cup was out of reach, so I'm
happy this is a reality,'' he said. ``If there's any opportunity,
I'm going to give it 100 percent so I become famous all over the
world. I want to show play that my opponents and even my teammates
can't imagine.''
	   Ono possesses a dancelike finesse in dribbling that makes him
delightfully fun to watch. In recent practice, he made dazzling
penalty kicks, sending the ball over players' head with artful
precision.
	   The 1.75 meter, 74 kilogram (6-foot, 160-pound) Ono has also
shown remarkable leadership, confidence and charm for someone so
young, quick to draw laughs with his unpretentious jokes.
	   But Ono showed a bit of the little boy left in him when asked to
name the most important person in his life.
	   ``My mom,'' he said.

Dollar rises to 141 yen, Tokyo stocks mixed in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose to a new seven-year high
against the yen early Tuesday in Tokyo ahead of a key meeting of
the group of major industrialized nations. Tokyo stocks were mixed.
	   The dollar bought 141.04 yen in early trading, up 0.40 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo, a level not seen since June 19, 1991. In New
York overnight, it settled at 140.71 yen.
	   Japan's weak economy remained the fundamental reason for the
yen's continued weakness.
	   Deputy finance ministers from the Group of Seven nations are to
meet in Paris later Tuesday. The Group of Seven is composed of the
United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Japan.
	   Japan's Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Tuesday that he
can't rule out the possibility that the recent weakening of the yen
against the dollar will be discussed by G-7 officials.
	   ``I can't say that press reports saying that the meeting will
mainly discuss the Russia problem, and won't discuss foreign
exchange, are right,'' Matsunaga said at a regular news conference.
	   Matsunaga said that the G-7 nations are constantly discussing
trends in foreign exchange rates. He added that Japan's G-7
partners will cooperate with Japan, and Japan will take decisive
action to correct the weakening of the yen, if necessary.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 25.62 points, or 0.17 percent, to 15,320.33 at the start of
Tuesday's trading. On Monday, the average shed 28.72 points, or
0.19 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 0.44 points, or 0.04 percent, to 1,197.92.
The TOPIX closed down 3.58 points, or 0.30 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.145 percent, unchanged from Monday's
close. Its price was marginally lower at 112.45 yen, down from
Monday's 112.46 yen.

World Cup: No regrets over apartheid boycott for Doctor Khumalo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Doctor Khumalo looked the French
interviewer in the eye, then calmly explained why he could never
regret the apartheid boycott of South African soccer that denied
him a chance to play in previous World Cups.
	   ``I'm proud of what I am today,'' the 30-year-old midfielder
said. ``I'm proud of my country and what we've achieved in South
Africa.''
	   Pressed again, he tried to inform the questioner of a basic
South African truth.
	   ``I was part of the struggle. I don't regret that,'' said
Khumalo, who is black.
	   A gifted ballhandler, Khumalo almost missed what will likely be
his only chance to play in the global soccer showcase.
	   He had played in almost every match since the 28-year ban from
international soccer ended in 1992 and even scored the winning goal
on a penalty in the first game, against Cameroon.
	   Then his father, a former pro player in South Africa, was
murdered by robbers in the Soweto black township in 1996 and
Khumalo's game lost its spark. His insightful passes weren't as
sharp, and more importantly, he often seemed to be floating.
	   When former coach Clive Barker, a strong backer of Khumalo,
resigned in December after South Africa went winless at the
Confederation Cup tournament in Saudi Arabia, Khumalo was dropped
from the national side by interim coach Jomo Sono.
	   He missed the African Nations Cup tournament in February, then
rejoined the team after Philippe Troussier took over from Sono in
March. Now Khumalo is battling for a starting spot and just happy
to be in France.
	   ``I expect us to go to the second round,'' he said Monday night
after South Africa's first practice in France.
	   The boycott of South Africa was to protest apartheid and was one
of several international sanctions against the hated system of
white minority dominance. Khumalo was 8 years old when the Soweto
student riots erupted in 1976 and like any township youth, his life
was intertwined with the anti-apartheid struggle.
	   So when the foreign interviewer asked if the boycott hurt his
career, he felt obliged to give a history lesson.
	   ``It's because of the political issue that happened in South
Africa,'' he said. ``It kept us away from the world. Whatever
happened in past years, its gone.''

German railway restoring service through scene of rail disaster

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's national railway hoped to send the first
train Tuesday over a stretch of tracks closed since a high-speed
wreck killed almost 100 people last week.
	   Investigators were still sifting through loose dirt at the site
Monday in search of personal effects and additional human remains
from the June 3 crash of an InterCity Express on the
Hanover-Hamburg line.
	   Workers also have been laying new tracks, and railway officials
said they expected to send the first train through the northern
village of Eschede _ site of the disaster _ on Tuesday afternoon
unless accident investigators object.
	   Fifty-nine express trains were pulled out of service while
railway officials worked to determine what caused a wheel to break
on the ill-fated train, apparently causing the derailment and
gruesome pileup.
	   Officials on Monday doubled the number of inspectors and
ultrasound machines used for safety checks to restore full service
at the normal top speed of 280 kph (175 mph) as soon as possible.
	   German rail director Johannes Ludewig said inspectors have found
no wheel defects so far, but that the inspections would take up to
two weeks more.
	   The railway has been using slower, replacement trains and
emergency plans in the meantime, leading to considerable delays for
train passengers.
	   Officials have identified 73 of the 98 victims. Some remains
were so badly damaged that forensic experts say DNA analysis will
be necessary to identify them.
	   German President Roman Herzog will lead a memorial service for
the victims and their families on June 21 in Celle, the main town
outside of Eschede. Officials delayed the service, originally
scheduled for Friday, due to the slow job of recovering and
identifying the dead.

Junta in Nigeria picking new leader

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The remaining leaders of Nigeria's
military junta were in the process of choosing a new president
Tuesday after the unexpected death of Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Top officials from Nigeria's Provisional Ruling Council were
meeting late into the night Monday. Two likely successors include
Nigeria's chief of defense, Staff Maj. Gen. Abdul Abubakar Salam,
and Lt. Gen. Jeremial Useni, the minister for the capital territory
of Abuja.
	   Abacha, the Nigerian dictator who crushed dissent, defied world
condemnation and repeatedly put off ceding power to civilians in
Africa's most populous nation, died Monday of a heart attack.
	   Crowds in the commercial capital, Lagos, broke into cheers at
news of the 54-year-old leader's death Monday. Many saw an
opportunity for a return to democracy _ even though there was no
sign the military was prepared to yield power, nor that Nigeria's
many rival ethnic groups would cooperate in a peaceful change of
government.
	   ``This death gives us an opportunity to restart our lives,''
opposition leader Soloman Lar declared. ``It is our hope that
Nigeria will not miss that chance.''
	   Abacha, who came to power in a coup after canceling presidential
elections in 1993, never indicated who would take his place as
leader of Nigeria's 115 million people.
	   The West African nation is made up of numerous religious and
ethnic groups that have often turned to violence to assert power
over one another. Without a clear line of succession, the country's
many opposition groups could seek to capitalize on the power void.
	   Word of Abacha's death came after heavily armed soldiers sealed
off his home and office in Abuja. Only the country's top military
brass were permitted to enter the compound.
	   In keeping with Muslim practice, Abacha was buried in his
hometown of Kano, near the border with Niger, before sundown
Monday, Radio Lagos reported. Martial music filled the airwaves.
	   Nigeria's oil industry _ one of the largest in the world _ was
left to decay under Abacha's rule, but continues to be the
country's largest source of export revenue.
	   Oil executives in the Niger Delta city of Port Harcourt said
Abacha's death would have little affect on oil production.
	   ``We try not to get involved in politics,'' said Victor Dania,
the director of community affairs for Shell Oil's Nigerian joint
venture. ``There won't be an impact on our production.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called
for a ``genuine democratic process'' leading to a transfer of power
from military to civilian rule in Nigeria.
	   Critics faced certain arrest and, sometimes, execution if they
persisted in challenging Abacha and his military government _ or
challenged his handling of the nation's lucrative oil resources.
	   Abacha, born Sept. 20, 1943, in the northern state of Kano, was
a career soldier, enrolling as an army infantryman at 18 and
attending military training colleges in the United Kingdom and
United States in addition to Nigeria.
	   In 1993, Abacha himself seized power in a coup. He soon jailed
Moshood Abiola, a businessman who had won nullified presidential
elections that same year.
	   New elections that were to have given the country a civilian
government in 1996 never materialized, and Abacha announced he was
stretching his rule until the end of 1998.
	   But no act drew such public condemnation as the Nov. 10, 1995,
hanging of environmentalist and playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
other political activists convicted in a closed military tribunal
of murdering political opponents.
	   Critics said the charges were false _ Abacha's revenge for
Saro-Wiwa's constant challenges to the military government and his
criticisms of the environmental damage wrought by the oil industry.
	   In London, the son of Saro-Wiwa said that Abacha was the worst
in a long line of human rights abusers in Nigeria.
	   ``The thinking has always been that every successive dictator is
worst than the previous one,'' Ken Wiwa said. ``So one hopes that
we don't get another dictator because he will have quite a record
to better Abacha's appalling record.''

Brief, nasty campaign ends with soccer's No. 2 moving up to No. 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The first big victory of the World Cup goes to a
balding economist who loves the spotlight and isn't afraid to make
enemies.
	   Sepp Blatter, elected Monday as president of the international
soccer federation FIFA, capped a whirlwind 2 1-2 months by beating
Lennart Johansson, the president of the European soccer union UEFA,
who was unchallenged until the 62-year-old Swiss entered the race
March 31.
	   Their contest may have been brief, but it was expensive and
nasty, costing more than dlrs 1 million and filling the air with
mud.
	   It got very personal, and a bitter Johansson indicated afterward
that he was not going away happily or quietly.
	   ``I'm loyal to the president but I'm not going to obey
everything he says,'' Johansson said.
	   Blatter, general secretary of FIFA for more than 17 years, had
earlier acknowledged that he could not serve as No. 2 under
Johansson. After the vote, he said the campaign had been rough but
was now in the past.
	   ``There may have been a few fouls, but we never tackled from
behind,'' he said. ``Now we need to think of what is fair.''
	   The outcome of the vote was not a major surprise. Both Blatter
and Johansson had declared in recent days that they were confident
of victory, and Blatter carried the support of Joao Havelange, the
82-year-old Brazilian industrialist retiring after 24 years and six
presidential terms.
	   But the method of victory was stunning. On the first ballot,
Blatter led 111-80, 17 votes shy of the two-thirds needed to win.
But with the second ballot requiring only a simple majority,
Johansson responded like the manager of a fighter who has seen one
jab too many.
	   ``The game is over,'' he conceded. ``I wish Mr. Blatter luck.''
	   And thus one of the two most powerful jobs in international
sports, perhaps even more powerful than president of the
International Olympic Committee, was placed in the hands of a
fun-loving divorcee who learned business and economics in the IOC's
hometown of Lausanne, Switzerland.
	   Blatter appeared to win by holding onto his voting blocs in Asia
and the Americas and cutting deeply into Johansson's supposed
strongholds of Africa and Europe. Johansson's strategy had been to
round up the support of continent-wide soccer groups, but they
don't vote. In a globe-girdling campaign swing, Blatter schmoozed
the people who hold the ballots, the leaders of national
federations.
	   Johansson had promises of votes from African confederation
leader Issa Hayatou; Blatter courted votes by virtually promising
that the 2006 World Cup would be staged in Africa. Johansson had
the financial and political backing of UEFA, the biggest and most
powerful of the regional groups; Blatter attacked that power by
arguing that Johansson was a puppet of Antonio Matarese, the
ambitious head of the Italian soccer federation.
	   Johansson said he had expected about 100 associations to vote
for him and was surprised over the number of defections from his
camp.
	   ``I built my prognosis on talks with the people who voted,'' he
said.
	   If he already has all but awarded the 2006 Cup to Africa,
Blatter kept the door open for another World Cup in the United
States as soon as 2010, when the global rotation would return the
tournament to the Americas.
	   ``There are a lot of contenders. It would not be easy,'' he
said. ``Brazil and Argentina are waiting. But U.S. chances also are
good.''
	   With his background as Havelange's lieutenant, Blatter is not
expected to radically change FIFA policies toward growth and
commercialization, although he is expected to change the way they
are run. He said he wants to be a full-time president with direct
compensation, rather than the part-time role Havelange took, with
monthly meetings of a seven-member cabinet.
	   Like Havelange, he upsets some people, leading a post-World Cup
housecleaning in 1994 and earning the label of dictator from his
critics. But his public style is much more outgoing. He speaks five
languages, smiles quickly and loves to share center stage with
celebrities, the bigger the better.

Mixed reaction meets death of Nigeria's dictator

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian dictator Gen. Sani Abacha's death
is an ``incredible opportunity'' for the West African nation to
return to democracy, a leading dissident in exile said _ a hope
echoed by Western powers.
	   In Jerusalem, exiled playwright Wole Soyinka called Abacha's
death ``an opportunity for Nigerian civic society, an opportunity
for the Nigerian military, and an opportunity for the international
community.''
	   Soyinka, winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in literature and an
outspoken opponent of military rule, fled Nigeria in 1994. Abacha's
military regime charged him with treason, a crime punishable by
death.
	   The United States and Britain urged a quick transition to
democracy in Nigeria, a former British colony.
	   ``We hope that following the death of Gen. Abacha, there will be
an opening for a stable transition to an early return to democracy,
with the election of an accountable civilian government which will
restore and respect human rights,'' Britain's Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called
for a ``genuine democratic process'' leading to a transfer of power
from military to civilian rule.
	   At the United Nations in New York, a spokesman for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Annan praised the contribution
made by Nigeria under Abacha to ending the civil war in nearby
Liberia and to restoring the democratically elected government of
Sierra Leone.
	   ``At this crucial juncture, the Secretary-General looks forward
to a peaceful and democratic future for the Nigerian people,'' the
spokesman said.

European Central Bank's governing board to hold first meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The 17-member policy-making body of
the European Central Bank holds its first meeting Tuesday, but the
bank president said procedural issues would likely be the only
topics discussed.
	   ``It's too early'' to make any decisions on monetary policy,
bank president Wim Duisenberg said Monday on the sidelines of the
annual meeting of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel,
Switzerland.
	   ``Certainly there won't be any decision on monetary targeting
yet,'' Duisenberg said. ``That may not even be a discussion yet.''
	   Monetary targeting includes setting goals for money supply
growth or inflation that will guide the European Central Bank in
forming monetary policy.
	   The bank, based in Frankfurt, will set monetary policy for
European Union members adopting a planned single European currency.
Eleven countries have been selected to be among the inaugural
members when monetary union begins Jan. 1.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The remaining leaders of Nigeria's
military junta were in the process of choosing a new president
Tuesday after the unexpected death of Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Top officials from Nigeria's Provisional Ruling Council were
meeting late into the night Monday. Two likely successors include
Nigeria's chief of defense, Staff Maj. Gen. Abdul Abubakar Salam,
and Lt. Gen. Jeremial Useni, the minister for the capital territory
of Abuja.
	   Abacha, the Nigerian dictator who crushed dissent, defied world
condemnation and repeatedly put off ceding power to civilians in
Africa's most populous nation, died Monday of a heart attack.
	   Crowds in the commercial capital, Lagos, broke into cheers at
news of the 54-year-old leader's death Monday. Many saw an
opportunity for a return to democracy _ even though there was no
sign the military was prepared to yield power, nor that Nigeria's
many rival ethnic groups would cooperate in a peaceful change of
government.
	   ``This death gives us an opportunity to restart our lives,''
opposition leader Soloman Lar declared. ``It is our hope that
Nigeria will not miss that chance.''
	   Abacha, who came to power in a coup after canceling presidential
elections in 1993, never indicated who would take his place as
leader of Nigeria's 115 million people.
	   The West African nation is made up of numerous religious and
ethnic groups that have often turned to violence to assert power
over one another. Without a clear line of succession, the country's
many opposition groups could seek to capitalize on the power void.
	   Word of Abacha's death came after heavily armed soldiers sealed
off his home and office in Abuja. Only the country's top military
brass were permitted to enter the compound.
	   In keeping with Muslim practice, Abacha was buried in his
hometown of Kano, near the border with Niger, before sundown
Monday, Radio Lagos reported. Martial music filled the airwaves.
	   Nigeria's oil industry _ one of the largest in the world _ was
left to decay under Abacha's rule, but continues to be the
country's largest source of export revenue.
	   Oil executives in the Niger Delta city of Port Harcourt said
Abacha's death would have little affect on oil production.
	   ``We try not to get involved in politics,'' said Victor Dania,
the director of community affairs for Shell Oil's Nigerian joint
venture. ``There won't be an impact on our production.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called
for a ``genuine democratic process'' leading to a transfer of power
from military to civilian rule in Nigeria.
	   Critics faced certain arrest and, sometimes, execution if they
persisted in challenging Abacha and his military government _ or
challenged his handling of the nation's lucrative oil resources.
	   Abacha, born Sept. 20, 1943, in the northern state of Kano, was
a career soldier, enrolling as an army infantryman at 18 and
attending military training colleges in the United Kingdom and
United States in addition to Nigeria.
	   In 1993, Abacha himself seized power in a coup. He soon jailed
Moshood Abiola, a businessman who had won nullified presidential
elections that same year.
	   New elections that were to have given the country a civilian
government in 1996 never materialized, and Abacha announced he was
stretching his rule until the end of 1998.
	   But no act drew such public condemnation as the Nov. 10, 1995,
hanging of environmentalist and playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
other political activists convicted in a closed military tribunal
of murdering political opponents.
	   Critics said the charges were false _ Abacha's revenge for
Saro-Wiwa's constant challenges to the military government and his
criticisms of the environmental damage wrought by the oil industry.
	   In London, the son of Saro-Wiwa said that Abacha was the worst
in a long line of human rights abusers in Nigeria.
	   ``The thinking has always been that every successive dictator is
worst than the previous one,'' Ken Wiwa said. ``So one hopes that
we don't get another dictator because he will have quite a record
to better Abacha's appalling record.''

Nomo set for debut with Mets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Theories abound as to why Hideo Nomo is no
longer the pitcher that mystified National League hitters three
years ago.
	   He tips his pitches, goes one.
	   Hitters have figured out his quirky delivery is another.
	   There's also the lost-his-confidence hypothesis.
	   Nomo, who will make his first start for the New York Mets on
Tuesday night, has one of his own.
	   ``Simply put,'' he said, ``I've been getting hit.''
	   Nomo was in a Mets uniform at Shea Stadium for the first time on
Monday as New York opened a three-game series against the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays. And like his first appearance with the team in Boston
last Friday, Shea Stadium was buzzing with photographers, TV crews
and reporters anxious to hear from the newest Met.
	   Yes, Nomomania has arrived in the Big Apple.
	   The Mets introduced Nomo to a packed news conference about an
hour before Monday's game, and true to his reserved nature, Nomo
politely answered questions from both Japanese and local media
members without showing much emotion.
	   He said there was one major difference between his first major
league experience in Los Angeles and this one.
	   ``When I first came to Los Angeles, I was a step away from
fulfilling my dream of being a major leaguer,'' he said. ``Now,
after coming to New York, I'm an established as a major league
player and I'm expecting to go out there and do the best I can
every fifth day.''
	   After being rumored to be headed to the Seattle Mariners for
Randy Johnson, Nomo was dealt by the Los Angeles Dodgers last week
along with reliever Brad Clontz to the Mets for pitchers Dave
Mlicki and Greg McMichael.
	   Nomo, 29, has been rejoined in New York with his Dodgers
batterymate, Mike Piazza, who was traded May 22 to the Mets by
Florida, which had acquired him from the Dodgers a week earlier.
	   Piazza shook his head before Monday night's game when asked if
he could have envisioned the Dodgers' two most popular players now
being teammates in New York.
	   ``Who could have written this script?'' he said. ``Hopefully, it
will have a happy ending.''
	   The Mets are hoping they can straighten out Nomo, who was just
2-7 with a 5.05 ERA before being traded by the Dodgers. His numbers
have been in a steady decline since winning the NL Rookie of the
Year in 1995 when he went 13-6 with a 2.54 ERA.
	   In 1996, he was 16-11 (3.19 ERA) and last year he dropped to
14-12 (4.25). He underwent arthroscopic surgery on his pitching
elbow last fall and has struggled recently, losing his last four
decisions while allowing 18 earned runs in 26 2-3 innings.
	   There has been speculation that Nomo's inflated numbers were
more a result of his problems with the Dodgers' front office than
anything related to his pitching mechanics.
	   Mets manager Bobby Valentine said that in reviewing video of
Nomo's starts this season, there were some good ones and a few
brutal ones. What Valentine is more concerned with, however, is
Nomo's upcoming outings.
	   ``I'm going to deal with his record starting Tuesday night,''
Valentine said. ``That's the only one that concerns me.''
	   The Mets are also hoping that Nomo's reunion with pitcher Masato
Yoshii will ease his transition. The two were teammates in Japan
and have remained close friends. Nomo now has someone he can talk
baseball with and someone with whom he can share the good and bad
times.
	   ``I have to think that that will be a real bonus,'' Valentine
said of his two Japanese starters. ``To experience things together
has got to be a special situation whether it's good or not.''

Japan sees overall economy souring, but consumer spending up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Housing construction, employment and import figures
have worsened over the past month, but consumer spending shows
signs of a recovery, according to a closely watched government
report Tuesday.
	   The Economic Planning Agency assessed the overall economy as
``stagnant,'' unchanged in June from its report in May.
	   But the report slightly upgraded its view of personal
consumption because of hopes that spending will accelerate from
next month.
	   ``Consumption trends are showing signs of recovery,'' the
carefully worded report said. It added, however, that spending
remains weak due to poor employment conditions and other factors.
	   It also said housing construction and import statistics
worsened.
	   Japan's unemployment rate has steadily worsened, climbing to an
all-time high of 4.1 percent in April, its highest level in more
than four decades.
	   Japan's economy has been sluggish for most of the decade,
despite numerous government attempts to revive it via fiscal
stimulus and tax cuts.

Martin qualifies for U.S. Open by winning playoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOE KAY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Casey Martin overcame a balky cart and a
double bogey on the 36th hole _ one he feared would be his last _
before qualifying for the U.S. Open in a two-hole playoff Monday.
	   Martin sank a 25-foot (8-meter) birdie putt in the rain to
clinch the fifth and final qualifying spot at Clovernook Country
Club. He had failed his three previous attempts to make the Open,
which will be held at the Olympic Club in San Francisco starting
June 18.
	   ``I'm going to fly around the Open. I don't think I'll need a
cart. I'll be so pumped,'' he said, moments after winning the
five-player playoff.
	   Until his winding putt found the middle of the cup on the par-4,
420-yard second hole, Martin figured this would wind up as a day
he'd long regret.
	   Martin, who won a court order to ride a cart because of a
circulation problem with his right leg, took a while to adjust to a
newfangled one-person cart brought in for the event. It had a
different breaking system than a standard cart and quit on his
second hole when he accidentally kicked the power switch.
	   He had to walk two holes before the cart was revived.
	   ``I liked it. There are a few kinks that need to get worked
out,'' he said of the cart, which he'll use at the Open.
	   His ever-present limp grew more pronounced during the last few
holes of his afternoon round, when he was trying to hold his
position among the leaders. He became angry with himself after his
double bogey on the par-4, 469-yard (426-meter) final hole.
	   His tee shot went behind a tree, his approach came up short and
he two-putted, falling to 2-under-par 138. He slammed the door of
the restroom in the clubhouse and uttered a profanity when he
emerged, then went to sit in his car and cool off.
	   ``On the last hole, I just hit six bad shots, took a double and
was crushed,'' he said.
	   As he sat in his car, the rest of the field came in. Four spots
went to Sam Randolph, who shot 135, and Patrick Lee, Rocky Walcher
and Jason Gore, who came in at 137.
	   Martin got a second chance as four others finished at 138 _ Eric
Johnson, Chris Riley, Perry Moss and Ryan Howison.
	   Martin, Howison and Moss shot par on the first playoff hole to
stay in contention. Martin then sank one of his most
pressure-packed putts to win it in a steady rain.
	   ``I'm just kind of stunned,'' said Martin, who showed little
emotion when the putt fell. ``I was so disappointed after I
finished (the 36th hole) that I kind of wrote it off. I'm shocked
that I'm here.''
	   He thought that this qualifying attempt would end like the last
three: falling in the final round. The dramatic finish Monday left
him unsure how to react.
	   ``Know what? I grew up hitting Whiffle ball shots around my yard
thinking I was in the Open,'' he said. ``I guess it's going to come
true.''
	   Although course officials had prepared for an influx of
thousands of fans, a group of about 50 fans and reporters followed
him around the course. There was one near-mishap when his green and
gray cart hit a bump and nearly clipped a course official on one
hole.
	   Nearing the end of his afternoon round, a news helicopter
noisily circled for about two holes, drawing glares from golfers
and fans. Martin waved at it, hoping it would go away.
	   ``I was really disappointed that happened,'' he said. ``It
annoyed everyone on the golf course and did absolutely no good.''
	   He's become accustomed to attention since he sued the PGA for
the right to ride a cart. He knows that won't change at the Open,
where he plans to keep a low profile.
	   ``I'm going to be the center of attention and I wish it weren't
so,'' he said.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico City's residents still have a deep,
continuing distrust of the police, according to a survey published
Monday, almost six months after the city's first opposition mayor
took office promising to clean up the notoriously corrupt force.
	   Only 9 percent of residents believe the police are doing a good
job, according to a poll conducted by the daily Reforma. A year
ago, 6 percent of residents said they thought police were doing a
good job.
	   The poll, in which 795 adults were interviewed, had a margin of
error 3 percent, making the rise statistically negligible.
	   Only 23 percent of those interviewed said they had some
confidence in police, up from 21 percent a year ago.
	   Twenty-three percent said they were crime victims _ mostly of
robberies _ this year. Seventy-five percent said they did not
bother to report it, apparently feeling it would do no good.
	   The rate of unreported crimes, according to the survey, has
risen steadily since 1991.
	   ___
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ More than 3,000 Paraguayan farmers
marched in the capital of Asuncion on Monday, demanding the
government help with growing agricultural problems.
	   The farmers, who gathered at the Ministry of Agriculture in
downtown Asuncion, called for assistance with shortage of farming
land, lack of financial and credit support and technical help.
	   ``We're not able able to continue waiting,'' said Alberto Areco,
a march organizer. ``Our families are hungry, and the government
has not fulfilled its promises.''
	   Organized by the National Campesina Federation, the march
snarled traffic leading into the capital as well as important
routes into the interior of the country.
	   ___
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The U.S. Coast Guard repatriated
seven Cubans rescued last week from a 15-foot (4.5-meter) boat near
the Bahamas, officials said Monday.
	   They were taken to the port at Bahia de Cabanas, Cuba, Saturday
morning. An eighth migrant was granted political asylum and sent to
the U.S. Navy Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to begin applying for a
visa.
	   The eight Cubans were found adrift June 2 about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) southeast of Cay Lobos in the Bahamas. The boat's engine
had failed, the Coast Guard said.

Drug producers point the finger at US, drug consumers for the drug

problem &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with complaints about moves against
money-laundering &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite President Bill Clinton's appeal to
avoid ``finger-pointing,'' leaders of the world's drug-producing
nations showed no hesitation in blaming consumers for the global
narcotics problem.
	   Their message: if rich countries such as the United States want
our help in fighting against drugs, show us the money.
	   ``The illicit drug trade is demand-driven,'' the prime minister
of the tiny Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis told the
opening session of the U.N. General Assembly special session on
drugs.
	   ``How can we truly expect small, poor countries such as mine to
defeat the wealthy drug lords if the rich countries, with their
wealth of resources, are unsuccessful in limiting the demand,' siad
the prime minister, Denzil Douglas.
	   In his opening speech Monday to the three-day conference,
President Clinton urged world leaders to stand together and avoid
finger-pointing in attempting to devise new, coordinated strategies
in the fight against drugs.
	   ``Pointing fingers is distracting,'' Clinton said. ``It does not
dismantle a single cartel, help a single addict, prevent a single
child from trying _ and perhaps dying _ from heroin.''
	   Clinton said ``the lines between countries that are supply
countries, demand countries and transit countries are increasingly
blurred. Drugs are every nation's problem.''
	   But Latin American countries, who account for most of the
world's supply of cocaine, don't see it that way.
	   ``We need resources, and it must come from the international
community,'' Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori told reporters as
he arrived for the opening session. ``And I think this will
consolidate the reduction of production _ it might in the Peruvian
case - the production of cocoa leaves.''
	   Ambassador Patrick Lewis of the Caribbean island state of
Antigua and Barbuda complained that small countries are often the
targets of American finger-pointing.
	   ``On the one hand, we are told that we must again adjust our
economic policies,'' he said. ``On the other hand, when we choose
the financial services sector ... we are labelled as havens for
money launderers and corruption and steps are taken to ... limit
our competitive advantages.''
	   President Hugo Banzer of Bolivia said his government was
committed to eradicating illegal production of cocoa, which is used
in the production of cocaine.
	   But Banzer said the program will cost dlrs 952 million over five
years, including dlrs 700 to provide alternative crops and markets
for the 35,000 Bolivian families whose livelihood comes from the
illegal crop.
	   He appealed to the United States and other wealthy countries to
pick up 85 percent of the cost of the program, reminding them that
``each dollar we devote to combating drug trafficking has painful
social costs.''
	   But U.S. officials were noncommittal about whether Washington
would back up words with dollars. U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey
sidestepped the question of whether Washington would be willing to
increase new funding for UN proposed drug plans, including crop
substitution.
	   U.N. officials estimate the annual bill would come to dlrs 250
million for 10 years:
	   ``In the United States, we assert that we lose dlrs 110 billion
a year direct cost to our society from drug abuse by 6 percent of
our population,'' McCaffrey said. ``And we put on the table a dlrs
17 billion package to confront this issue. But in the long run we
don't believe money will continue to grow in the coming years of
the counter-drug effort.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar climbed to a new seven-year high
against the yen Tuesday morning in Tokyo ahead of a key meeting of
the group of major industrialized nations. Tokyo stocks edged
higher in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 141.04 yen in early trading, up 0.40 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo, a level not seen since June 19, 1991. In New
York overnight, it settled at 140.71 yen.
	   Japan's weak economy remained the fundamental reason for the
yen's continued weakness.
	   In its monthly report for June, Japan's Economic Planning Agency
reiterated that the economy continues to stagnate, but said that
consumer spending was showing signs of recovery.
	   Deputy finance ministers from the Group of Seven nations are to
meet in Paris later Tuesday. The Group of Seven is composed of the
United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Japan.
	   Japan's Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Tuesday that he
can't rule out the possibility that the recent weakening of the yen
against the dollar will be discussed by G-7 officials.
	   ``I can't say that press reports saying that the meeting will
mainly discuss the Russia problem, and won't discuss foreign
exchange, are right,'' Matsunaga said at a regular news conference.
	   Matsunaga said that the G-7 nations are constantly discussing
trends in foreign exchange rates. He added that Japan's G-7
partners will cooperate with Japan, and Japan will take decisive
action to correct the weakening of the yen, if necessary.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 56.59 points, or 0.37 percent, to 15,351.30 points in the
first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the average shed 28.72
points, or 0.19 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 0.87 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,198.36. The
TOPIX closed down 3.58 points, or 0.30 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.145 percent, unchanged from Monday's
close. Its price was marginally lower at 112.45 yen, down from
Monday's 112.46 yen.

Winter crops will be good as El Nino declines, forecaster says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The long-awaited departure of the El
Nino weather pattern will boost Australia's winter crops, including
wheat, the government's chief commodity forecaster said Tuesday.
	   But widespread rain in April and early May was too late to stop
the summer crop production forecast for the 12 months to June 1998
being cut to 3.9 million (metric) tons from about 4.1 million tons,
the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics said
in its June crop report.
	   However, Australian wheat production was forecast to increase to
19.3 million tons in the 12 months to June 30, 1999, up four
percent on the previous year and exceeding the bureau's earlier
18.4 million ton forecast.
	   ``Winter rainfall prospects are likely to improve with the
Bureau of Meteorology reporting that the recent El Nino event
declined rapidly in May and should no longer affect Australian
rainfall,'' said Stephen Beare, the bureau's acting executive
director.
	   ``As a result of the rainfall, winter crop plantings are
expected to increase in 1998-99 to just over 18 million hectares
(44 million acres).''
	   Production of winter crops, ranging from pulses to coarse
grains, should reach 29.7 million (metric) tons, a 600,000-ton
increase on the previous crop report estimate.
	   Coarse grains production forecasts are down nine percent to 6.9
million tons, as farmers move out of crops such as barley and oats
to higher-return canola, Beare said.
	   Land preparation and sowing was underway in most districts, but
follow-up rain was urgently needed in southeastern Australia.
	   Beare said nearly all early sown summer crops were now harvested
and the rest should be gathered by the end of June.
	   ``Prolonged dry conditions during the summer growing season
followed by rains during harvest adversely affected yields and
quality in some areas, particularly central Queensland (state),''
he said.
	   But the quality of New South Wales state summer crops looked
excellent, with record yields of 9.4 tons per hectare (2.47 acres)
already reported by the rice industry.
	   The bureau estimates that 2.9 million bales (666,000 tons) of
lint has been produced from the 1997-98 summer cotton crop, setting
a new record for Australian production.

Ethiopia threatens more military action, Eritrea urges talks

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ With Ethiopia threatening to attack
Eritrea again unless its neighbor withdraws from disputed
territory, the U.S. government made plans to evacuate at least
another 120 of its citizens Tuesday.
	   The American planes would also carry Germans, Egyptians and some
Ethiopians.
	   The Eritrean government on Monday called for direct talks
between the two Horn of Africa countries in the presence of
high-level mediators ``so as to ensure a speedy resolution of the
crisis.''
	   President Isaias Afwerki's spokesman said Ethiopia had
effectively declared war on Eritrea and was using the threat of
renewed air strikes to blockade air and seaports.
	   ``They won't compromise,'' Yemane Gebremeskel said. ``These are
not the actions of a nation that wants peace.''
	   In Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi accused
the Eritreans of ``a pattern of prevarication, a pattern of trying
to draw out the process and consolidate their hold on our
territory.
	   ``If that's the case _ and it appears to be the case _ then the
opportunities for resolving this problem peacefully could be fastly
disappearing,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Eritrea claims its forces are within internationally recognized
borders drawn by Italy in the late 19th century. Eritrea, an
Italian colony from 1885 to 1941, was annexed in 1962 by Ethiopia,
against whom it later fought a 30-year war for independence.
	   With per capita annual incomes of less than dlrs 300 a year,
Ethiopia and Eritrea are among the world's poorest countries.
	   African leaders deplored the Horn of Africa conflict at an
Organization of African Unity summit Monday in the western African
country of Burkina Faso.
	   An Italian envoy at the OAU meeting talked with the foreign
ministers of Ethiopia and Eritrea and asked for a halt to further
bombing raids.
	   ``There's reason to believe that this will be heeded,'' the
Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry said.
	   The envoy, undersecretary of state for foreign affairs Rino
Serri, was expected to visit Asmara and Addis Ababa imminently, it
said.
	   The United States and Rwanda have crafted a four-point peace
proposal that would require Eritrea withdraw to positions it
occupied prior to May 6, when border skirmishes broke out. Ethiopia
has accepted the plan, but Eritrea says it needs more work.
	   On Friday and Saturday, Ethiopian warplanes bombed a
military-civilian airport on the outskirts of Asmara. Anti-aircraft
artillery shot down two Ethiopian MiG-23s.
	   Ethiopia has said the bombing was in retaliation for an Eritrean
attack Friday on a school in Mekele, northeastern Ethiopia, which
killed 44 people, including 10 children.
	   But Eritrean Air Force Cmdr. Habtezion Hadgu vehemently denied
the charge, saying Ethiopia bombed the Asmara airport first. ``This
is tit for tat _ one to 100, that's the exchange rate. They hit us,
I hit them harder.''
	   Asmara-based diplomats confirmed the commander's version, saying
the airport attack occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (1100 GMT) Friday,
and 50 minutes later two Eritrean warplanes took off and headed
south.

Poll: Puerto Ricans split on statehood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAN PERRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Ricans are deeply split on
whether to become a full member of the United States, despite a
relentless lobby by their pro-statehood governor, a poll published
Monday showed.
	   The poll in The San Juan Star daily showed support for becoming
the 51st state at 40.9 percent, while 40.2 percent favored
retaining the unusual ``commonwealth'' status worked out in 1952.
	   Under commonwealth, Puerto Rico's 3.8 million residents are U.S.
citizens but don't pay federal taxes, don't vote for president and
are represented in Congress only by a non-voting delegate.
	   Critics deride that arrangement as a relic of colonial times.
But opponents of statehood note that Puerto Ricans feel themselves
a nation with their own culture and an overwhelming preference for
Spanish over English.
	   In a non-binding 1993 referendum on the Caribbean island's
political status, continued commonwealth edged out statehood by two
percentage points.
	   Of the 1,011 people interviewed by the Precision Research firm
two weeks ago, 7.6 percent preferred independence _ almost double
the level of support independence received in the referendum.
	   The poll _ which carried a 3 percent error margin _ was sobering
news for Gov. Pedro Rossello, whose drive to persuade the U.S.
Congress to allow statehood is being hampered by his people's
ambivalence.
	   The debate over Puerto Rico's status has intensified since the
U.S. House of Representatives three months ago approved a bill for
a binding plebiscite.
	   The bill appears stalled in the Senate, where it faces
Republican opposition.
	   But Rossello has hinted that he may hold a referendum anyway. He
argues that 1998 _ being the year that marks a century of U.S.
control over the island _ is the right time for a decision.
	   The Star poll also revealed widespread dissatisfaction with
``life in Puerto Rico'' _ which was ranked as ``bad'' by some 41
percent, ``fair'' by another 41 percent, and ``good'' by only about
19 percent. The island suffers from high rates of crime,
unemployment and inflation.

Australia unchanged for Scotland test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's record-breaking rugby team
survived intact for Saturday's first test against Scotland.
	   Wallaby coach Rod Macqueen said the players who thrashed England
by a record 76-0 last Saturday night had all recovered well and
were fit and ready for the Scots.
	   Rookie fly-half Stephen Larkham was outstanding in his first
match for his country in the position as Australia posted a record
score and record winning margin in all tests and inflicted
England's worst-ever defeat.
	   Macqueen said he expected a tougher match against the Scots, who
were beaten 51-26 by Fiji in their most recent test outing.
	   ``Of course I am happy with the way we went against England but
there are many areas of our game that we can improve,'' Macqueen
said. ``We were a bit sloppy across the field and our set pieces
weren't that great so we're working on those things this week and
hopefully they will improve.''
	   The first test against Scotland will mark the 50th tests for
Queenslanders David Wilson and reserve back Jason Little. The
second test will be played in Brisbane on June 20.
	   Australia: Matthew Burke, Ben Tune, Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan,
Joe Roff, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu, David
Wilson, Matt Cockbain, John Eales (captain), Tom Bowman, Andrew
Blades, Phil Kearns, Richard Harry. Reserves: Chris Whitaker,
Nathan Grey, Jason Little, Willie Ofahengaue, Owen Finegan, Dan
Crowley, Jeremy Paul.

	   DECANI, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Stray cattle roaming among spent
ammunition. Deserted houses riddled with grenade holes. Devastation
reminiscent of wartime Bosnia greeted diplomats allowed into
western Kosovo, target of a Serb offensive that prompted new
international sanctions.
	   The first look by outsiders since the latest Serb campaign
revealed charred ruins everywhere _ but few people, except for
armed Serb policemen. The area had been sealed for more than a week
during fighting that drove out tens of thousands of the province's
ethnic Albanian majority _ and heightened fears of a new, bigger
Balkan war.
	   ``What we've seen is all sorrow, all grief ... all those
villages burned and destroyed, all the people had left,'' Dutch
ambassador Jan Sizoo said Monday after visiting Decani on Sunday.
	   Sizoo was in the first group of foreign diplomats to see the
region since Serb police and soldiers began a punishing offensive
in late May, part of an intensifying campaign against militants
battling for independence for Kosovo's 90 percent ethnic Albanian
majority.
	   Journalists were turned back from another convoy that went in
Monday. More fighting was reported elsewhere in Kosovo.
	   In Streoce, the first village the diplomats saw, more than 20
houses were burned or shelled, and only a few policemen were
present.
	   Fresh coats of paint on shops on the outskirts of Decani could
not conceal graffiti praising the militant Kosovo Liberation Army.
A few Serb townspeople lingered about the police station.
	   Police showed the diplomats an array of weapons they said were
confiscated from militants.
	   On the road to Djakovica, the scene recalled some of the worst
damage in Bosnia and Croatia. Many houses were gutted by flames.
Cartridges of various caliber littered the area.
	   Cattle, untended, roamed the empty village of Prilep, four miles
south of Decani. Houses were peppered with bullet holes. Some had
gaping holes made by grenades.
	   There were clear signs of what the European Union assailed as
``widespread house-burning and indiscriminate artillery attacks on
whole villages'' _ as well as actions by the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   After seeing only ``part of what one could call a battlefield,''
Sizoo said: ``We've been told (by Serb authorities) that the blame
is on the terrorists who started first. But, this statement is very
difficult to defend _ for a conflict you always need two parties.''
	   Serb forces continued shelling the area around the Albanian
border Monday, according to the Kosovo Information Center, close to
the ethnic Albanian leadership. Its Serb counterpart, the pro-Serb
Media Center, said ethnic Albanian militants attacked two Serb
villages in the Drenica region.
	   The U.S. government, accusing Yugoslavia of wholesale violence
against the Kosovo Albanian population, decided Monday to freeze
Yugoslav assets in the United States and to ban investments in that
country.
	   The EU tightened sanctions Monday in reaction to the offensive _
banning new investments in Serbia and freezing its assets abroad _
and urged NATO to consider military intervention.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
United States has not ruled out military options.
	   A prominent Kosovo Albanian, Nekibe Kelmendi, welcomed the new
sanctions but said they were only a ``small step'' compared to the
situation on the ground.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders say more than 50 people have been killed
in the latest offensive and 200 men were missing and presumed
captured.

Clinton urges nations to stop bickering over drug problem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ President Bill Clinton challenged world
leaders on to work together attacking illegal drugs and stop
wasting time ``pointing fingers'' of blame at each other.
	   He also announced a dlrs 2 billion media campaign aimed at young
people.
	   ``The debate between drug-supplying and drug-consuming nations
about whose responsibility the drug problem is has gone on too
long,'' Clinton said Monday in the opening address at a U.N.
General Assembly special session on drugs in which he praised
Mexico for its cooperation in fighting the movement of drugs into
the United States.
	   ``Let's be frank,'' he said. ``This debate has not advanced the
fight against drugs. Pointing fingers is distracting. It does not
dismantle a single cartel, help a single addict, prevent a single
child from trying and perhaps dying from heroin.''
	   ``Let there be no doubt: This is ultimately a struggle for human
freedom.''
	   About 150 nations were represented at the U.N. session.
	   In his speech, Clinton announced a dlrs 2 billion, five-year
media campaign against drugs, targeting young people with a message
that ``drugs destroy young lives; don't let it destroy yours.''
Similar campaigns will be launched in Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil,
Clinton said, adding that he discussed the issue with Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Sunday.
	   Only dlrs 175 million of the dlrs 2 billion would be federal
funds; the rest would be contributed by corporations and
philanthropic organizations.
	   To emphasize the importance Clinton placed on the anti-drug
effort, he brought along Attorney General Janet Reno; his drug
policy adviser, Barry McCaffrey; Latin American envoy Mack McLarty;
and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala.
	   Clinton said the drug problem is too severe for any nation to
ignore.
	   ``No nation is so large and powerful that it can conquer drugs
alone. None is too small to make a difference. All share a
responsibility to take up the battle. Therefore, we will stand as
one against this threat to our security and our future.''
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who met privately with
Clinton before the session, called the drug scourge ``a tragic
reality'' and appealed to member nations to work seriously to find
common ground.
	   In his 11-minute speech, Clinton described U.S. successes in
reducing drug use and made a special point of thanking Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo for his country's cooperation in
combating the trafficking of drugs into the United States.
	   Clinton cited Zedillo's ``courageous resolve against drugs.''
The two presidents met later at a New York hotel and discussed the
diplomatic fallout from Operation Casablanca, a major U.S.
money-laundering sting that led to the arrests last month of 42
people _ including about two dozen Mexican bankers.
	   The Mexican government strongly protested that U.S. drug agents
had carried out the sting operation without prior approval or
notification to Mexico City. It has suggested asking for
extradition of some U.S. agents involved, although U.S. officials
said extradition was not raised in Monday's meeting.
	   After their 40-minute session at the Waldorf Astoria in midtown
Manhattan, Clinton and Zedillo issued a joint statement of their
intent to combat drug trafficking ``in conformity with the laws in
each country.'' There was no U.S. apology or guarantee of prior
notification in future operations.
	   Zedillo told Clinton that his government was investigating
whether Casablanca violated any Mexican laws but had not yet come
to any conclusions, said James Dobbins, senior director for
inter-American affairs at the National Security Council.
	   Dobbins said there was ``no negative tone'' in their talks.
	   Clinton did not mention the controversy in his U.N. speech, but
his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, told reporters aboard
Air Force One en route to New York that the administration will not
consider extraditing the agents.
	   ``I think that would be a very bad idea,'' Berger said.
	   In his address to the General Assembly, with Clinton sitting in
the audience, Zedillo made a thinly veiled reference to the
Casablanca controversy. He called for a ``balanced strategy'' to
combat drug trafficking ``so that no one can become the judge of
others and no one feels entitled to violate other countries' laws
for the sake of enforcing its own.''
	   Critics of the session held a news conference nearby to
criticize the United Nations for ``more of the same old failed
policies.''
	   ``The U.N. drug summit is perhaps the biggest pep rally ever in
the failed global war on drugs,'' said Ethan Nadelmann, director of
the private Lindesmith Center, a drug policy research institute.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Little airlines across Europe are taking off on
dozens of new routes, luring passengers with colorful sales pitches
and cheap fares.
	   One advertisement shows Greek businessman Stelios Haji-Ioannou,
the boss of easyJet, lamenting that he's ``tired of being ripped
off'' every time he flies home to Athens.
	   Haji-Ioannou's response: Two daily flights from London that take
off in July with tickets starting at 69 pounds (dlrs 112) one way _
one-third less than similar flights on British Airways or the Greek
flag carrier, Olympic Airways.
	   Low-cost rival Debonair is running ads featuring a promise by
its boss, former Continental Airlines executive Franco Mancassola,
not to squash passengers into tiny seats. In all his years of
running airlines, Mancassola boasts, he has never sold a seat to a
sardine.
	   And a low-cost Irish carrier, Ryanair, recently launched new
London-to-Dublin flights with fares as low as 30 pounds (dlrs 49)
one-way.
	   ``This fare is not a gimmick. It's here to stay,'' says
Ryanair's marketing director, Tim Jeans.
	   The big airlines are taking note, and it's not the clever ad
copy that has them worried.
	   The small, no-frills carriers are cutting into their business on
routes that for decades were run in cartel fashion. But that was
before the European Union began a deregulation of its aviation
industry that was completed a year ago.
	   With new carriers starting up services all around Europe,
analysts have been wondering if the newly deregulated skies will
run into the same problems that followed U.S. deregulation two
decades ago _ numerous airline bankruptcies.
	   An ominous shadow was cast on the low-cost sector of the
industry in May when one of Europe's biggest and most profitable
airlines, British Airways, stepped into the market. BA launched its
own low-cost carrier, called Go, based at London's uncrowded
Stansted Airport.
	   Accusing BA of illegally subsidizing Go in a bid to wreck the
competition, easyJet is fighting back in court.
	   ``The suspicion we have is that British Airways is doing this to
put the other low-cost carriers out of business,'' easyJet
spokesman James Rothnie said. ``That's historically what they do.
They either buy you out or stamp you out.''
	   Go executives did not respond to interview requests. But after a
judge stuck down easyJet's bid to stop Go from flying, chief
executive Barbara Cassani predicted that if the case went to trial,
it would show that ``Go is entirely lawful.''
	   The cheap carriers are modeled after Dallas-based Southwest
Airlines, which reshaped air travel in America. But while Southwest
turned heads in the U.S. industry by serving only complimentary
peanuts and drinks, many of the low-cost European carriers make
passengers pay for even a cup of coffee if they want one.
	   Southwest's low fares forced the big players in the domestic
U.S. market to shave costs by cutting meals on many flights and to
operate small carriers to fly passengers into their hubs from
secondary cities.
	   The trend in European aviation is likewise forcing the big
players to find different ways to respond.
	   Sabena, the Belgian flag carrier, found itself confronted with
low-cost competition at its Brussels hub from Virgin Express, run
by British entrepreneur Richard Branson.
	   Rather than get into a damaging fare war, Sabena forged a
partnership with Virgin Express. Sabena canceled a number of its
services from Brussels to three cities, London, Barcelona and Rome,
and let Virgin Express take over the routes with its own airplanes
and crew.
	   Both carriers sell tickets on the same jets, however, with
Sabena marketing all of the high-priced business class fares and
Virgin Express selling some of the cheaper seats in the back of the
airplane.
	   ``It was a win-win situation,'' said Etienne De Nil, Sabena's
general manager for the United Kingdom and Ireland. ``Instead of
fighting with each other, we said, `Let's cooperate.'''
	   The deregulation of Europe's skies came at a time when air
travel was booming and many airlines around the world were racking
up record profits.
	   Perhaps thanks to the timing, nobody has gone broke _ yet _ and
the expansion seems to be continuing with no letup in sight. But
the pressure will be on when times turn tough in what has always
been a highly cyclical business.
	   ``As long as British Airways are there, it is inevitable that
some of the low-cost carriers will go out of business,'' said
Rothnie, the easyJet spokesman.

Drug epidemic even reaches tiny Palau in middle of the Pacific
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The worldwide drug epidemic has even
spread to remote Palau, the U.N.'s newest and smallest member state
located in the Western Pacific far from the world's drug centers.
	   ``In our paradise, we experience the scourge and horror of
illegal drugs, particularly among the young people,'' said
President Kuniwo Nakamura in a message read by his U.N. ambassador,
Hersey Kyota, to the U.N. General Assembly special session on
drugs.
	   ``Our problem is real and escalating and may be equally
compatible to the larger and more populated societies,'' Nakamura
said.
	   Nakamura said the major threat to Palau's 16,000 people _ who
live on a string of about 200 small islands 960 kilometers (600
miles) east of the Philippines _ comes from methamphetamine
crystals.
	   Amphetamines, abused by an estimated 30 million people
worldwide, are the ``drug of choice'' in much of East Asia, where
it is known as ``ice'' or ``shabu.''
	   ``The range of people who use `ice' has expanded to ages as low
as 13 and 14 years old,'' the president said in his message.
	   In an observation more commonly associated with inner cities of
the United States, the president said in his message that drug
abuse in high schools had led to ``higher rates of absenteeism,
dramatic lowering of grades, less concentration in the classroom''
and ``loss of interest in sports activities.''
	   Nakamura said Palau, which became the 185th U.N. member state in
December 1994, is facing a drug threat despite a growing economy,
pristine environment, cheap and abundant seafoods, low crime rates
and a tradition of strong family ties.
	   His message: if drug abuse can happen in remote Palau, it can
happen anywhere.
	   ``Drugs and the damage they cause society are not limited to
places around the world that suffer economically or do not have
high levels of education or opportunity,'' he said.
	   ``Illegal drug use around the world _ as it is in the paradise
of Palau _ a major and growing economic and human tragedy,'' he
added.

Samper says Colombia has done more than any country to fight drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Colombian President Ernesto Samper told
world leaders at a drug summit that no country had done more to
fight the drug trade than his.
	   Colombia too is a victim, and has been unfairly criticized by
the international community, Samper told the U.N. General Assembly
special session on drugs.
	   ``Because of drugs, we have been condemned and victimized by
unilateral measures that, as with all intervention measures that
offend our sovereignty, must be buried forever,'' he said Monday.
	   He noted that he too had ``paid dearly, both morally and
personally,'' for the effects of the drug trade.
	   Washington revoked Samper's tourist visa two years ago,
convinced that his campaign received dlrs 6 million in
contributions from the Cali drug cartel for his 1994 presidential
campaign.
	   Samper travelled to New York for the U.N. session on a
diplomatic visa, as he has done in the past.
	   In his speech, Samper said Colombia spends more than dlrs 1
billion a year fighting drugs _ equal to 21 percent of what it
would cost to provide education for all Colombian children.
	   Colombia, the world's leading producer of cocaine, also
restarted extraditing Colombian nationals charged overseas with
drug crimes, which had been illegal, he said.
	   The government has approved asset forfeiture laws for assets
bought with drug money, he said.
	   ``No country has, like mine, done so much and under such lonely
circumstances to combat drug trafficking,'' he told world leaders.
	   He called for a multilateral approach to tackle the problem
``from the moment the seed of an illegal crop is planted until it
is sold and then consumed as a prepared drug anywhere in the
world.''
	   And he asked ``for international opinion to accept, once and for
all, that since drug trafficking is a market _ with supply and
demand.''
	   To help cut the market, he suggested the creation of an
international fund to pay for crop substitution programs,
interdiction and prevention.

Virginia company sells cheap phone calls to Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY138 &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN CIENSKI &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RICHMOND, Virginia (AP) _ Want to make a call from Yakutsk _
Russia's Siberian diamond and gold capital _ to Moscow? Route the
call through the United States, then back to Russia, and you could
save a lot of rubles.
	   A small Virginia company, Applied Information Technologies, has
found a niche by supplying cheaper and clearer phone connections to
Russians, even if those calls have to travel thousands of extra
kilometers (miles).
	   Russia's primary phone company, Rostelcom, charges about dlrs
2.50 a minute for a call from Yakutsk to Moscow during peak hours.
AIT can do the same for dlrs 1.30, said Kim Kerns, owner of the
husband-and-wife operation based in the Richmond suburb of
Midlothian.
	   Discount or ``callback'' telephone systems allow callers
overseas to save a bundle by using an American phone line, skirting
the much higher prices charged by government-owned phone companies
in other countries.
	   To use a callback service, a subscriber dials an American phone
number provided by the service, lets it ring once and hangs up.
Since no one picks up on the other end, the caller is not charged.
The service's computer then calls the user back and gives a dial
tone, allowing the subscriber to make the call back overseas, but
billed as a call originating from the United States.
	   The callback computer wizardry is done by specialized
telecommunications companies that sell phone numbers to smaller
resellers such as the Kerns, who in turn market them around the
world.
	   ``What you're ... trying to do is circumvent the telephone
monopolies and everything that goes along with that, including high
rates and virtually nonexistent service,'' Trevor Gunnd said.
	   Gunnd is deputy director of Business Information Service for the
Newly Independent States, a branch of the U.S. Commerce Department
that tries to help companies like AIT do business in the former
Soviet Union.
	   ``Obviously callback is inconvenient but people use it to save
money,'' said Stacy Oh, director of marketing for Encino,
California-based Cross Communications Inc., an international
callback provider.
	   The callback industry started in the early 1990s and is worth
about dlrs 1.4 billion this year, said Cathleen Woodall, director
of marketing for M.J. Scheele and Associates, a San Francisco-based
telecommunications consulting company. The services have become
popular among expatriates living in countries like Japan that have
steep long-distance phone rates.
	   Ms. Woodall said there are about 170 callback providers, most
based in the United States.
	   Fifty-seven countries ban callback services, including the
Bahamas, India, China and Venezuela, according to a survey
conducted by the International Telecommunications Union in Geneva.
The services are legal in the United States.
	   While some countries try to block callback companies, others
embrace the new technology.
	   ``There are countries like Russia that support and encourage the
use of callback because it allows business to flourish and their
infrastructure is bad and they know it,'' Kerns said.
	   Kerns has about 140 customers, most in Russia and Ukraine, and
he has sales agents in Moscow and Yakutsk with about 500 additional
clients. He also has customers scattered around other countries
including India, Pakistan and Brazil. He would not say how much his
company earns.
	   Kerns has never been to Russia. He uses the Internet to find
salespeople and advertise his service. He requires most of his
customers to pay up front so people a world away don't stick him
with unpaid bills.
	   His agent in Yakutsk found him by trolling the World Wide Web
for a company offering cheap phone service. The agent runs a travel
business and his customers were complaining that they needed a
reliable and inexpensive way to call their home offices in St.
Petersburg on the other side of Russia.
	   Small callback resale businesses like Kerns' face a tough
future, Ms. Woodall said. Foreign phone companies are lowering
their rates in response to competition, cutting the callback
providers' profits.
	   ``We are definitely seeing a dropoff in callback service because
the margins are being squeezed so extremely,'' she said. ``I'd say
growth is going to be kind of flat. Staying the same for the next
year and maybe dropping of a little the year after that.''
	   Kerns has noticed that it's more difficult to make money.

Times are changing in once-firmly socialist Syria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo DAM101 of May 27 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Billboards with big, red English
lettering along the main streets of Damascus herald the arrival of
something new: the U.S. fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken has
come to Syria.
	   The KFC restaurant, opened in mid-May, joins a growing number of
Western companies like Germany's Adidas and Italy's United Colors
of Benetton brought by franchise or license under Syria's 12-year
effort to modernize its economy.
	   Reforms have been encouraged by the West, especially Europe,
under the theory that giving Syrians and other Arabs more of an
economic stake in the Middle East would encourage peace in the
region.
	   But change comes slowly in Syria's staid socialist system, and
the economy has not been growing fast enough to improve living
standards or create jobs for thousands of young Syrians entering
the work force.
	   All this is creating rare public grumbling in Syria, where Hafez
Assad has ruled with an iron hand for nearly three decades.
	   Even state-run newspapers like Tishrin have complained that
government workers are forced to seek second jobs to supplement
salaries of 2,000 to 5,000 Syrian pounds (dlrs 40 to 100) a month.
	   And businessmen like Rateb al-Shallah, president of the Syrian
Chambers of Commerce, have become outspoken in calling for more
economic liberalization.
	   Al-Shallah told a recent chamber meeting that the government
must take ``a daring and necessary decision'' to reform the banking
system, establish a stock exchange and ease import restrictions so
the country can compete internationally.
	   Syria already has come a long way from the 1960s, when the
government nationalized all large industries, including banks and
public utilities.
	   Since 1986, it has allowed private investment in agriculture and
industry. Then, in May 1991, Parliament passed what has become
Syria's economic mantra, Law No. 10.
	   It aims at attracting investment _ from foreigners as well as
Syrians with billions of dollars squirreled abroad _ by giving tax
holidays of up to nine years, customs exemptions on machinery and
the right to repatriate profits.
	   So far, 1,292 new agricultural, industrial and transport
projects worth 312 billion Syrian pounds, or about dlrs 8 billion,
have been approved, says Mohammed Sarakbi, head of Syria's
Investment Office.
	   Sarakbi says the country is happy with its ``pluralistic
economy'' of public and private enterprises and does not envision
major new reforms soon.
	   ``Syria follows reforms in gradual steps,'' he said. ``The
government takes a step, then studies the results. It doesn't want
to do anything like what happened in Southeast Asia, where the
tigers turned into cats and rabbits.''
	   According to economic statistics, Syria can't afford to wait.
	   After oil discoveries and Law No. 10 spurred strong growth in
the early 1990s, expansion of Syria's dlrs 16 billion economy
slowed to 3.5 percent or less in recent years.
	   That's barely enough to keep up with the 3.3 percent population
growth, among the world's highest. More than half of Syria's 16
million people are under age 16, and some 200,000 young people
enter the work force each year.
	   Faced with low pay and an unemployment rate of some 15 percent,
an estimated one million Syrians have gone to neighboring Lebanon
for work. Thousands more are in the Gulf.
	   Foreign investment has fallen after the initial burst. The
economy didn't get the expected boost from the Middle East peace
process, which all but collapsed in 1996 after the election of a
hard-line Israeli government.
	   Western diplomats say foreign investors are discouraged by
widespread corruption, and young entrepreneurs complain they can't
get financing because state-run banks still give preference to
state-run companies.
	   Even successful businessmen say inadequate financing is
hindering development.
	   ``Law No. 10 was the first step in the direction of a market
economy. What we need is to complete it,'' said industrialist Saeb
Nahas, who urges that private banks replace government institutions
with their ``civil service mentality.''
	   Nahas' companies show how liberalizing the economy can benefit
Syria. One is a dlrs 17 million pharmaceutical plant that has some
300 workers producing medicine under license from Glaxo Wellcome of
Britain, Organon of Holland and Upjohn of the United States.
	   Another company has turned Syria from an importer to an exporter
of industrial chemicals, and a third makes ice cream bars.
	   Business consultant Nabil Sukkar says growing regional pressures
mean ``the time is right for another push on economic reform'' in
Syria.
	   Entrepreneurial Lebanon is seeking more open trade with its
neighbor, the Arab League has a 10-year plan for a free-trade zone,
and the European Union is negotiating a partnership agreement with
Syria to be phased in by 2010.
	   ``All of these will require a restructuring of the economy if we
want to take advantage of these alliances,'' Sukkar said.

Top U.S. officials defend money-laundering sting in Mexico

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The top U.S. drug policy official defended
using U.S. undercover agents in a money-laundering sting in Mexico
but acknowledged ``there is room'' for better tactics in the
cross-border war on drugs.
	   Mexico has criticized the three-year operation as a violation of
its sovereignty. American undercover agents appear to have operated
in Mexico without securing government approval for the sting, which
U.S. officials said involved 167 arrests and led to the seizure of
dlrs 96 million and several tons of drugs.
	   Retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey on Monday defended the operation in
a news briefing with Attorney General Janet Reno and other U.S.
officials during a U.N. General Assembly special session on drugs.
	   McCaffrey said one country cannot fight the drug problem alone.
	   ``We have to do this in partnership with our neighbors and with
absolute respect and deference for their own sovereign
institutions,'' said McCaffrey, director of the White House Office
of National Drug Control Policy.
	   He acknowledged, however, that ``there is room here for us to
look through how we can even more effectively coordinate these
(operations) in the future.''
	   Later, he told reporters that while the United States was proud
of the job the U.S. agents did, ``we'll just have to find a way to
do this better in the future.''
	   Reno said that the U.S.-Mexican effort to fight drugs was still
on course.
	   In a speech to the General Assembly earlier Monday, Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo referred indirectly to the operation,
which has prompted Mexican officials to call for the extradition of
the U.S. agents to face trial.
	   He called for a ``balanced strategy ... so that no one can
become the judge of others; and no one feels entitled to violate
other countries' laws for the sake of enforcing its own.''
	   U.S. officials have said they needed to keep the operation
secret to ensure the safety of American agents.
	   ``It is not a matter of disrespect,'' Reno said in explaining
why Mexican _ and even top U.S. officials _ were not informed of
the sting. The goal, she said, was to conduct an investigation
``while at the same time protecting the lives of the agents
involved.''
	   Also Monday, Colombian President Ernesto Samper told world
leaders at the drug summit that his country, the world's leading
producer of cocaine, has been unfairly criticized by the
international community.
	   Samper said Colombia spends more than dlrs 1 billion a year
fighting drugs _ equal to 21 percent of what it would cost to
provide education for all Colombian children.

U.S., North Korea agree to open armistice talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The U.S.-led United Nations Command
and North Korea agreed Tuesday to revive a military channel of
communication for the first time in seven years, a move that could
lead to an easing of tensions on the Korean peninsula.
	   The agreement will allow general-level officers of both sides to
meet at the border village of Panmunjom to discuss
``armistice-related issues,'' the U.N. Command said in a brief
statement.
	   ``The overall purpose of the general officer talks is to reduce
tensions on the Korean peninsula,'' the U.N. statement said. The
first meeting has yet to be scheduled, it added.
	   The general officer talks will replace the Korean Military
Armistice Commission, which supervised the 1953 armistice that
ended the Korean War. The commission has been inactive since 1991,
when North Korea withdrew from it.
	   The North's withdrawal came after a South Korean general was
named as the U.N. Command's chief representative on the commission.
Three years later, the North's communist government announced it no
longer recognized the armistice.
	   The North considers the South a U.S. puppet and does not
recognize it.
	   The latest agreement came after South Korea agreed to let an
American general represent the United Nations. That was a
reflection of President Kim Dae-jung's attempts to promote
reconciliation with the North through political and other
exchanges.
	   The two Koreas are still technically at war because the Korean
War ended without a peace treaty. Their border is the world's most
heavily armed with 2 million battle-ready troops deployed on both
sides.

	   The 54-year-old Abacha died a heart attack on Monday and his
body was shipped to his northern hometown of Kano, near the border
with Niger.
	   In life, Abacha gave little indication of plans for a successor
and even had his former deputy jailed and sentenced to death in
connection with an alleged coup plot.
	   The ruling military junta, apparently looking to avoid political
unrest in the wake of a perceived power vacuum quickly convened to
select Abacha's replacement.

Scots; Premier League dominates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Germany's World Cup players observed a
minute's silence before a warmup game Monday for the victims of
last week's train disaster at Eschede.
	   Playing a professional but mostly junior selection of players
from second-division clubs Nice and Cannes, Germany used a starting
lineup that is not likely to take the field against the United
States in Paris June 15 and only managed a 2-1 victory.
	   Olaf Marschall and Oliver Bierhoff fired the Germans into a 2-0
lead before the defense was caught embarrassingly flat-footed a few
times and David Andreani replied for the home team.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Bookmakers are offering odds of only 10-1 that
four or more players might be sent off in one World Cup game.
	   The new tough rules on the tackle from behind have made it
almost certain that there will be far more red cards at this World
Cup than before.
	   Bookmakers Corals have cut the odds on four or more expulsions
in one game from 25-1 to 10-1.
	   The British-based bookmakers rate an England vs. Scotland final
a 750-1 shot and are offering 250-1 that Denmark's goalkeeper,
Peter Schmeichel, will score with a header.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Palestine was among six soccer authorities added to
the FIFA rolls Monday, bringing total membership to 206.
	   Others approved were Eritrea, Turks and Caicos Islands, U.S.
Virgin Islands, American Samoa and Mongolia.
	   The Palestine Football Association has been a provisional member
of FIFA since 1995 but now has added powers, including voting in
federation elections.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Flags from Italy, Brazil and Germany
cover campaign posters for municipal elections. Restaurants are
scrambling to buy TVs. Street peddlers are hawking a range of
France '98 accessories.
	   No, this isn't Paris. This is Beirut.
	   Although Lebanon is not participating, World Cup fever is in
full force here.
	   The tournament has always been a hit in this soccer-mad nation.
During the civil war from 1975 to 1990, militiamen were known to
stop shooting and residents would crank up electrical generators to
watch matches.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Beware the tartan terror.
	   French customs officials didn't like the look of the Scottish
fans who arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport before Wednesday's
World Cup opener against Brazil.
	   They told the Scots to remove their ginger wigs and tartan caps
and wash off the face-paint before they would let the fans through
customs.
	   ``It is absolutely ridiculous,'' said 36-year-old Andy Finley,
who was wearing a tailor-made Black Watch tartan suit complete with
waistcoat and top hat.
	   ``It took me hours to paint this flag on my face and the next
thing I'm told to wash it off or they won't let me in the country
because I don't look like my picture in my passport.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Even if England don't win the World Cup, the
English league likely will have a big say in who takes home the
trophy.
	   Of the 704 players at the World Cup, 75 play in England, more
than anywhere else. Spain and Italy have 70, Germany has 54 and
France and Japan have 30.
	   Half of the 32 qualifiers have players who compete in the
English Premier League although that doesn't include hot favorite
Brazil.

LAGOS, Nigeria: Abacha's replacement.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Abacha, the Nigerian dictator who crushed dissent, defied world
condemnation and repeatedly put off ceding power to civilians in
Africa's most populous nation, came to power in a coup after
canceling presidential elections in 1993.
	   Crowds in the commercial capital, Lagos, broke into cheers at
news of the leader's death Monday. Many saw an opportunity for a
return to democracy _ even though the military showed no sign that
it was prepared to yield power, nor that Nigeria's many rival
ethnic groups would cooperate in a peaceful change of government.
	   ``This death gives us an opportunity to restart our lives,''
opposition leader Soloman Lar declared. ``It is our hope that
Nigeria will not miss that chance.''
	   Top officials from Nigeria's Provisional Ruling Council met late
into the night Tuesday before issuing a statement announcing the
appointment of Abubakar, 55.
	   The career serviceman was born in the northern Nigerian town of
Minna and later attended the Kaduna Technical Institute in 1963
before enlisting in the air force. He transferred to the army in
1975 and received military training in the United States. In 1981
he served with Nigerian troops assigned to a United Nations
peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
	   He was appointed chief of defense staff in 1993 by Abacha.
	   The West African nation of 115 million people is made up of
numerous religious and ethnic groups that have often turned to
violence to assert power over one another. Without a clear line of
succession, the country's many opposition groups could seek to
capitalize on the power void.
	   Word of Abacha's death came after heavily armed soldiers sealed
off his home and office in Abuja. Only the country's top military
brass were permitted to enter the compound.
	   In keeping with Muslim practice, Abacha was buried in his
hometown of Kano, near the border with Niger, before sundown
Monday, Radio Lagos reported. Martial music filled the airwaves.
	   Nigeria's oil industry _ one of the largest in the world _ was
left to decay under Abacha's rule, but continues to be the
country's largest source of export revenue.
	   Oil executives in the Niger Delta city of Port Harcourt said
Abacha's death would have little affect on oil production.
	   ``We try not to get involved in politics,'' said Victor Dania,
the director of community affairs for Shell Oil's Nigerian joint
venture. ``There won't be an impact on our production.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called
for a ``genuine democratic process'' leading to a transfer of power
from military to civilian rule in Nigeria.
	   Critics faced certain arrest and, sometimes, execution if they
persisted in challenging Abacha and his military government _ or
challenged his handling of the nation's lucrative oil resources.
	   Abacha, born Sept. 20, 1943, in the northern state of Kano, was
a career soldier, enrolling as an army infantryman at 18 and
attending military training colleges in the United Kingdom and
United States in addition to Nigeria.
	   In 1993, Abacha himself seized power in a coup. He soon jailed
Moshood Abiola, a businessman who had won nullified presidential
elections that same year.
	   New elections that were to have given the country a civilian
government in 1996 never materialized, and Abacha announced he was
stretching his rule until the end of 1998.
	   But no act drew such public condemnation as the Nov. 10, 1995,
hanging of environmentalist and playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
other political activists convicted in a closed military tribunal
of murdering political opponents.
	   Critics said the charges were false _ Abacha's revenge for
Saro-Wiwa's constant challenges to the military government and his
criticisms of the environmental damage wrought by the oil industry.
	   In London, the son of Saro-Wiwa said that Abacha was the worst
in a long line of human rights abusers in Nigeria.
	   ``The thinking has always been that every successive dictator is
worst than the previous one,'' Ken Wiwa said. ``So one hopes that
we don't get another dictator because he will have quite a record
to better Abacha's appalling record.''

Dollar rises to 141 yen, Tokyo stocks higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday currency, stock and bond prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar touched a new seven-year high
against the yen Tuesday morning in Tokyo ahead of a key meeting of
the G-7 major industrialized nations. Tokyo stocks edged higher in
light trading.
	   The dollar bought 140.63 yen at midday, down 0.01 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and just below its New York level overnight of
140.71 yen. During Tokyo trading, the dollar rose as high as 141.11
yen, a level not seen since June 1991.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 164.13 points, or 1.06 percent, to 15,458.84 at the close of
morning trading. On Monday, the average shed 28.72 points, or 0.19
percent.
	   The U.S. currency topped 141 yen amid widening sentiment that
Tuesday's meeting in Paris of deputy finance ministers of the Group
of Seven largest economies won't announce joint intervention to
stem the yen's decline.
	   Meanwhile, the main cause of the yen's fall _ Japan's ailing
domestic economy _ remains unchanged. On Tuesday, a Japanese
government report warned that key sectors of the economy such as
employment and production would likely worsen in June.
	   With no economic turnaround in sight, Japan's central bank has
had to leave interest rates at historic lows in an attempt to
reinflate growth.
	   But lower interest rates mean lower returns for Japanese bonds
and other investments, increasing selling pressure on the yen as
investors shift money overseas in search of better returns.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, stock prices rose amid optimism the
strengthening dollar will boost profits at the country's vaunted
exporters.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 4.13 points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,202.49. The
TOPIX closed down 3.58 points, or 0.30 percent, the day before.
	   For every yen the dollar gains in value, Toyota Motor Corp. sees
its earnings jump 10 billion yen (dlrs 71 million) and Sony Corp.
earns another 6 billion yen (dlrs 43 million), Japan's NHK
television said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.180 percent from Monday's close of 1.145
percent, driving its price down to 112.19 yen from Monday's 112.46
yen.

Rodman acting up again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ His overnight trip to Las Vegas after Game 1
wasn't nearly as outrageous as his Mormon bashing last year.
	   It's been tame stuff for the poster boy for bad behavior. He
needed a really good antic, something that screamed Dennis Rodman.
And he came through Monday, missing practice and the mandatory
National Basketball Association Finals media session.
	   Rodman, who was fined dlrs 10,000 by the NBA and probably will
be fined by the Chicago Bulls, was seen Monday night with Hulk
Hogan attending a wrestling match in Auburn Hills, Mich. He
declined to talk to a reporter at the match, staying in a luxury
box at The Palace.
	   He was with World Championship Wrestling president Eric Bischoff
and wrestlers Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart and a 7-foot-4 (2.25-meter),
510-pound (230-kilogram) grappler billed as the ``The Giant,'' who
defended Rodman's absence from the Bulls.
	   ``The beautiful thing about Dennis is that he's the epitome of a
free spirit,'' said The Giant, whose real name is Paul Wight II.
``If the Bulls try to control him from doing things like this, it
would be like cutting off Sampson's hair.''
	   The event was aired on TNT network.
	   ``I talked to Dennis and he did not speak,'' coach Phil Jackson
said. ``He said to my assistant trainer he didn't think he could
make it down here in time for the press conference. I asked him,
`Dennis, what should I say to the press?' and he hung up on me.''
	   Only the tattooed and multihued one could top the Chicago Bulls'
complete humiliation of the Utah Jazz in Game 3. So what if the
Bulls held the Jazz to 54 points, the lowest point total since the
inception of the shot clock in 1954? Who cares if Utah looks beat
and a sixth title is within Chicago's reach? So what if John
Stockton and Karl Malone are getting testy?
	   None of that matters, not when Rodman is wigging out again.
	   ``It's very frustrating at this time,'' Scottie Pippen said.
``But you don't want to carry that into the next time, you don't
want to carry that into the next practice. You want the team
chemistry to stay as strong as possible. Especially the situation
we're in, we don't want Dennis taking the focus away from the
team.''
	   Accepting someone's quirks is one thing, but Rodman brings a
whole new meaning to the word eccentric. There's his multicolored
hair, now dyed in a fetching, green-and-black camouflage design.
There's his landscape of tattoos and pierced body parts.
	   But more than anything, there's his behavior, which he seems to
bring to new lows in the playoffs. Last year, it was Mormon
bashing. This year, it's time management.
	   He waltzes in a half-hour late for home games. He disappears to
the locker room early in each half _ supposedly to keep his muscles
warm _ forcing Jackson to send a trainer to fetch him so he can
make a grand entrance. A two-day birthday bender left him too
pooped to practice in the second round.
	   And now this.
	   ``We couldn't have a society that acted like Dennis,'' Jackson
said. ``There would be nobody having lanes in the freeway, you
couldn't queue up anywhere and get in line. You'd have to be
disorderly. Dennis is not a normal person in our society, but he's
great in what he does here.''

Three changes in Queensland starting side
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Newcastle utility Robbie O'Davis,
North Sydney's Ben Ikin and Gold Coast hooker Jamie Goddard were
promoted to Queensland's starting side Tuesday for the June 19
State of Origin rugby league decider in Sydney.
	   The tip that Sydney City's Adrian Lam would play hooker failed
to eventuate when the Queenslander selectors announced their 17-man
squad.
	   Ikin, who has been impressive off the bench in the first two
games of the series, which is locked at 1-1, has grabbed a starting
center spot.
	   Darren Smith shifts to lock while O'Davis has bumped Sydney
City's Matt Sing to the bench.
	   Goddard, whose National Rugby League club is struggling, has
ousted Canterbury hooker Jason Hetherington for the No.9 job for
which selectors also considered brothers Kerrod and Steve Walters
along with Lam.
	   Queensland chairman of selectors Les Geeves said Goddard offered
a slightly different package of options to Hetherington who had
played both games with an injured knee.
	   The selectors dropped Lang from the bench while Brisbane utility
reserve Tonie Carroll, who scored the matchwinning try in game one
in Sydney, was not considered after suffering a hamstring injury.
	   Queensland:
	   Darren Lockyer, Robbie O'Davis, Steve Renouf, Ben Ikin, Wendell
Sailor, Kevin Walters, Allan Langer (captain), Darren Smith, Jason
Smith, Gorden Tallis, Gary Larson, Jamie Goddard, Shane Webcke.
Reserves: Matt Sing, Steve Price, Peter Ryan, Brad Thorn.

Earthquake rattles northern South Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ An earthquake with a magnitude of 4.3
shook the sparsely populated northern part of South Australia state
on Tuesday. There were no reports of injuries or damage.
	   The quake was at a remote location 37 miles (60 km) southeast of
Oodnadatta in the state's north, Australian Geological Survey
Organization scientist Kevin McCue said.
	   That would be about 530 miles (850 km) northwest of Adelaide.
	   ``There are some mining communities there and although we've
received no reports anyone felt it, there's bound to be someone who
did,'' McCue said.
	   McCue said an earthquake measuring 4.3 would have caused serious
damage had it occurred under a major city or town.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Here are the lyrics to ``Let it Be,'' sung by
mourners Monday at a memorial service for Linda McCartney.
	    &UR; Let it Be
	   When I find myself in times of trouble mother Mary comes to me,
	   Speaking words of wisdom, let it be,
	   And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me,
	   Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
	   Chorus: Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,
	   Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
	   And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree,
	   There will be an answer, let it be.
	   For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they
will see,
	   There will be an answer, let it be.
	   Ch: Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
	   There will be an answer, let it be.
	   And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines
on me,
	   Shine until tomorrow, let it be.
	   I wake up to the sound of music, mother Mary comes to me,
	   Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
	   Ch: Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
	   Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

North Korea says Japanese wives give up plans to visit Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A group of Japanese wives married to North Koreans
has canceled plans for a visit home because of ``obstacles'' on the
Japanese side, North Korean radio said Tuesday.
	   ``Japanese women in North Korea retracted their applications to
visit Japan on their own,'' official Korean Central Radio quoted a
North Korean Red Cross spokesman as saying. The broadcast was
monitored in Tokyo by the Radiopress agency.
	   Among the obstacles cited, the broadcast quoted the spokesman as
criticizing the Japanese side for suggesting that women who have
given up Japanese nationality be excluded from the visits.
	   Also, Japanese media handled the previous visits by the women
with ``impolite'' news coverage, the Red Cross spokesman said.
	   ``Japan has constructively tried to discuss the issue'' of those
who have given up Japanese nationality, a Foreign Ministry
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said without
elaboration.
	   About 1,800 Japanese women, many of them married to North Korean
men, left Japan around 1960 and had not been allowed by North Korea
to go abroad until last year.
	   North Korea and Japan held years of tough negotiations before
the North in November finally allowed 15 Japanese wives to visit
their homeland.
	   A second group of 12 women also made a brief visit to Japan in
February for reunions with family members. The visits were
coordinated between the two countries Red Cross organizations.
	   Plans were reportedly under way for a visit by a third group.
	   Kanezo Muraoka, Japan's top government spokesman, told a news
conference Tuesday that the North's announcement was
``regrettable'' as the program had been conducted from a
humanitarian standpoint.
	   The visits had been seen a step forward in normalizing relations
between North Korea and Japan, which have no diplomatic ties.
	   Prospects for normalization talks have also suffered on Japanese
suspicions that Pyongyang has withheld information about alleged
kidnappings of Japanese nationals by the reclusive, Stalinist
state.
	   On Friday, North Korea said an investigation had found no
evidence that 10 Japanese believed missing there are in its
territory.
	   Japan believes that North Korean agents abducted the Japanese,
including a 13-year-old girl, over the past two decades to use them
as language teachers for their spies.
	   North Korea has dismissed the alleged abductions as ``faked-up
cases.''
	   Their status is a key pending issue between Japan and North
Korea.
	   Japan, which ruled the entire Korean Peninsula as a colony from
1910 until 1945, never established diplomatic relations with North
Korea after the peninsula was split into the communist North and
capitalist South after World War II.

Braves rally in ninth to stun Red Sox 7-6; Indians shut out
</HEADLINE>
Pirates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The Atlanta Braves rallied for six runs in the
ninth inning to stun the Boston Red Sox 7-6 Monday night, winning
on Andruw Jones' one-out, run-scoring single.
	   Trailing 6-1, the Braves started their rally off closer Tom
Gordon, who gave up RBI singles to Keith Lockhart and Chipper
Jones. John Wasdin (3-3) then relieved and gave up a two-run double
to Andres Galarraga and a bloop single by Ryan Klesko that drove in
the tying run.
	   After Javy Lopez bunted pinch-runner Gerald Williams to second,
Andruw Jones singled to left on an 0-2 pitch, and a sliding
Williams beating Troy O'Leary's high throw to the plate.
 &UR; Astros 9, Tigers 5 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Carl Everett hit a two-run double to cap a five-run
ninth inning that lifted the Astros over the Tigers.
	   Everett also homered for Houston, which is 3-1 in interleague
play this season.
	   The Astros scored all their ninth-inning runs off reliever Todd
Jones (0-2), who blew a save opportunity for only the third time in
his last 35 chances. Doug Henry (4-2) pitched two innings for the
win.
 &UR; Indians 8, Pirates 0 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Jim Thome hit a three-run homer and drove in four
runs, and Bartolo Colon pitched a four-hitter for his second
shutout and fourth complete game.
	   In Pittsburgh's first regular-season game at Jacobs Field, the
Indians showed the Pirates they can do more than play AL hardball.
	   Kenny Lofton started the third-inning rally with a perfect bunt
that glanced off third base, and Thome ended it with a 431-foot
shot off Chris Peters (1-4) into the second deck in right to break
a scoreless tie.
 &UR; Royals 8, Brewers 7 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Jose Offerman homered and hit his
league-leading seventh triple as the Royals beat Milwaukee in an
interleague game that hardly felt like one.
	   The Brewers, who switched from the AL to the NL last November,
have been visiting Kansas City since 1970, and it was the 361st
meeting between the two teams.
	   Offerman, who also singled, had two RBIs and scored three runs
and Hal Morris and Jeff King had two RBIs each as the Royals
snapped a four-game home losing skid.
 &UR; Mets 3, Devil Rays 0 &QC; 
	   In New York, Rick Reed took a perfect game into the seventh
inning and finished with a three-hitter, and Mike Piazza homered to
lead the Mets over Tampa Bay.
	   The shutout was the first for Reed (7-3) since 1992 with Kansas
City and gave him a 1.21 ERA in his last eight starts. He struck
out a career-high 10 in posting his third career shutout and
winning for the sixth time in seven starts.
	   Reed, a former replacement player once ignored by his Mets
teammates for almost an entire season after he crossed the picket
line during the 1994-95 strike, retired the first 20 batters before
Wade Boggs doubled with two outs in the seventh.
 &UR; Cubs 8, Twins 1 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Sammy Sosa tied a team record by homering in his
fifth consecutive game and Jose Hernandez added a two-run shot as
the Chicago Cubs won their 10th straight.
	   The winning streak is the longest since 1970 for the Cubs, who
are 14 games over .500 (38-24) for the first time since finishing
the 1989 regular season 92-69. They remained tied with Houston atop
the NL Central, the latest in a season the Cubs have been in first
place this decade.
	   Sosa's homer, a solo shot in the third, was his 20th of the
season and gave him 11 in his last 10 games. The other Cubs to
homer in five straight games were Hack Wilson in 1928 and Ryne
Sandberg in 1989.
 &UR; White Sox 8, Cardinals 6 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Mark McGwire hit his major league-leading 29th
homer, but Jeff Abbott's three-run triple led the White Sox over
St. Louis.
	   McGwire, who 13 homers in his last 17 games, raised his
NL-leading RBI total to 73 with his two-run shot in the fourth.
	   His presence in the interleague game helped Chicago's sagging
home attendance. The crowd of 23,087 marked only the third time the
team has drawn more than 23,000 fans to Comiskey Park in 26 home
dates.
 &UR; Orioles 14, Phillies 8 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Rafael Palmeiro went 3-for-5 with four RBIs,
including a two-run homer, as Baltimore outslugged the Phillies.
	   Brady Anderson also drove in four runs for the Orioles, who set
season highs with 14 runs and 18 hits.
	   Palmeiro, who has 10 RBIs in his last eight games, hit his
two-run homer in Baltimore's four-run sixth off loser Darrin
Winston (2-2).

Wholesales prices drop in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In another sign of deflation in the Japanese
economy, Japan's central bank said Tuesday wholesales prices fell
1.7 percent in May from the same month last year.
	   That follows a 2.7-percent drop by the Bank of Japan's monthly
index of wholesale prices in April.
	   In breaking down this month's figure, the bank said prices of
goods produced domestically fell 2.3 percent from last year.
	   Meanwhile, the effects of a weakening yen made themselves felt
on the price of imports. The Bank of Japan said import prices rose
1.2 percent as a stronger dollar boosted the cost of oil and other
imports.
	   Deflation can be devastating because falling prices mean
companies don't earn enough to pay for production, throwing the
economy into a vicious cycle of factory shutdowns, declining
consumption and still lower prices.
