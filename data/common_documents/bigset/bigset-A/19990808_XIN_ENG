<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes U.S. Claim on No-fly Zones Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday refuted the U.S
claim that the U.S.-British warplanes have carried out raids
against Iraqi targets in the no-fly zones in response to Iraqi
provocations, calling them "sheer lies."
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, Iraqi Air
Defense Commander Shaheen Yassin Mohammed said the claimed 108 air
raids by U.S.-British warplanes against Iraqi targets since last
December were not for monitoring the no-fly zones but for
aggression against Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He added that the aggression is an obvious violation of the
international legitimacy, the U.N. Charter and relevant Security
Council resolutions which state that Iraq's political
independence and territorial integrity must be respected.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said that no international resolution or law provides
for the imposition of no-fly zones in Iraq, adding that the
restricted zones were imposed unilaterally by the U.S. and Britain
to prevent Iraqi planes from flying in its southern and northern
airspace.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S. and
Britain following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in
the south against any possible attacks by Iraqi government
troops.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the actual number of sorties made by
U.S.-British warplanes coming from Saudi, Kuwaiti and Turkish
bases over the two no-fly zones since last December has reached
10,977.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian and
military targets in the no-fly zones, causing severe civilian
casualties and property damages.
</P>
<P>
The general said that the U.S. has compressed the number
to less than one percent in an attempt to lessen the dangers
of those raids and to avert the world's attention from the
brutal crimes committed against civilians, civil facilities and
residential areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that 138 civilian and military sites have been targeted
by the enemy planes since last December, and civilian facilities
were targetted intentionally and not mistakenly.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that Iraqi air defences have the full right
to fire back at the enemy planes that violate Iraqi airspace
because they are defending Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.

<HEADLINE> Russian Forces, Caucasus Gunmen Exchange Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian helicopter gunships
launched missile attacks Saturday on positions held by armed men
around a village in Russia's troubled North Caucasus region of
Daghestan, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian ground forces were also exchanging fire with the armed
infiltrators -- several hundred men who surrounded two or three
villages after crossing into the remote mountainous region from
the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of casualties on either side.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin ordered
Defense and Interior Ministry forces to "normalize the situation"
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
"Bandits are bandits," he said in televised comments during a
visit to the Volga city of Ulyanovsk.
</P>
<P>
"One needs to tackle them appropriately. We have the forces and
means," Stepashin said. "I don't see any other way."
</P>
<P>
"Russia will not repeat its mistakes in the North Caucasus," he
stressed. "No more Russian soldiers will die there."
</P>
<P>
Russia has taken an increasingly robust stance on the rising
number of incidents on its troubled southern flank, using
helicopter gunships to launch preventive strikes against suspected
guerrilla bases inside Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Daghestan and the entire northern Caucasus region have remained
in turmoil despite the August 1996 ceasefire that ended the
Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring republics have seen a wave of hostage-taking from
crime gangs based in Chechnya, and chronic poverty has compounded
the inherent political instability in republics like Daghestan,
which has a fragile mix of more than 30 separate ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Interior Ministry, 1,094 people have
been abducted since January 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Writes to UN Chief on Conflicts With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Saturday wrote to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
urging the world community to pressure Afghanistan's Taliban
to abide by international laws, regulations and norms.
</P>
<P>
The letter was delivered on the eve of the first anniversary of
the killing of Iranian diplomats and reporter by Taliban militants
when they took over Mazar-i-Sharif, a stronghold of the opposition
forces in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
On August 8, 1998, eight Iranian diplomats and a reporter of
the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) were captured and
eventually slain after Taliban troops seized the Iranian consulate
in the city.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been a supporter of the opposition forces against the
Taliban, the religious students' movement that has the backing of
Pakistan and has taken control of most of the country in the civil
war.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Kharrazi said he wants to draw Annan's attention
"to the disrespect for the international law by the
Taliban ... and their inhuman activities," the IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Infuriated by the killings, Tehran massed nearly 200,000 troops
along its border with Afghanistan to press for the return of the
bodies of the victims, an apology, identification and punishment
of the killers.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said the United Nations Security Council resolutions
provided necessary political and legal grounds for identifying and
bringing to trial those responsible for the crime.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's six neighbors - Iran, Pakistan, China,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan - and Russia and the
United States, commonly known as the "six plus two" group in this
respect, have been trying to help bring the conflicts to a
peaceful end.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said the decisions made by "six plus two" in both
their New York meeting last year and Tashkent (Uzbekistan)
meeting in July stressed that the Taliban should be obliged to
heed the desires of the international community to identify, try
and punish those responsible.
</P>
<P>
But he said that so far the pleas and efforts in this regard
"have fallen on deaf ears." He asked the U.N. chief to do more
over this issue.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Honors Kosovo Airport Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin on
Saturday gave awards to Russian soldiers who made a surprise dash
to the Pristina airport in Kosovo ahead of NATO forces on June 12.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, in the central Russian city of Ulyanovsk, told
members of the 31st Brigade of airborne troops that they were
being honored for fulfilling their duty and displaying courage and
heroism, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The troops are based in Ulyanovsk, 500 miles east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin said that while the brigade had suffered losses
during its history, it had suffered "no loss of honor, conscience
and dignity."
</P>
<P>
On June 12, about 200 Russian paratroopers surprised NATO
officials by making a lightning dash from Bosnia, where they had
been stationed as peacekeeping troops, to Pristina, where they
took over the Slatina airport.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Russian President Boris Yeltsin himself
had given the orders to send the troops to Pristina, a move that
prompted a standoff between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was later worked out between U.S., Finnish and
Russian officials that provided a blueprint for Russian
participation in peacekeeping operations in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Russia has nearly completed its deployment of some 3,600 troops
in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Nightmare Still Haunting Kenyans One Year After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIRIBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A year after the horrible bombing
of the U. S. embassy in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, people are
still haunted by the nightmare and struggling to come to terms
with the cruel reality.
</P>
<P>
"Why choose Kenya? What is Kenya guilty of?" Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi asked in his speech at the rally to commemorate
the first anniversary of the blast, which indiscriminately killed
254, mostly Kenyans, and injured more than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
"The perpetrators of this ugly attack intended to massacre
their perceived enemies," Moi told the gathering of diplomatic
corps, Kenyan and American victims and other people.
</P>
<P>
"The aftermath of the bomb blast was a trail of blood, death,
and the tears of crippled and blind people and numerous orphans
born in freedom but who had to see their parents perish at the
hands of international terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people on the site of the battered former U.S.
embassy, which is designed to be converted into a memorial park,
listened to the speech in silence. Victims of the blast and
diplomats wore white and violet ribbons on their chest, which
symbolizes peace and unity.
</P>
<P>
Prayers by clergymen of Christianity, Hinduism, Muslim, Jewish
faith called for peace, healing, courage and forgiveness. A minute
of silence was observed to show respect for the dead. Wreaths were
laid before a red podium. Candles were lit. Solemn music echoed
around the tragic bombing site.
</P>
<P>
After the rally the people who lost their beloved hugged each
other and cried as they recalled the dark moment.
</P>
<P>
A woman cried out and her two children, a three-year-old and a
five-year- old wept along with her.
</P>
<P>
One middle-aged man who clutched a framed picture of a woman
told Xinhua that his wife died in the blast. He choked and eyes
became wet.
</P>
<P>
Michael Marine, Charge d'Affaires of the U.S. embassy in
Nairobi, said in his speech that the bonds between the United
States and Kenya and the two peoples were "stronger than ever".
</P>
<P>
However, Japheth Maingi, a survivor of the bombing, told Xinhua
that one year after the blast his family has not got any
compensation from the U. S. government.
</P>
<P>
"Not a single shilling," he said. "I have paid 10,000 shillings
( about 156 U.S. dollars)  for medical fees to treat the bone
fracture in my knee."
</P>
<P>
Maingi also told Xinhua that his brother Robert died in the
terrorist explosion, when he was working on the seventh floor of
the Co-operative House.
</P>
<P>
The blast destroyed millions of dollars worth of property and
killed many bread-winners in a relatively poor country, dealing a
heavy blow to the country's already flagging economy.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan major newspaper Daily Nation carried an article on
August 6, saying that some Kenyans affected by the bombing
believe that the compensation offered by the U.S. government may
not be beyond mere symbolism.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Hopes for Initiative to End Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Ismail Osman expressed his country's hope here on Saturday
that a single proposal could be worked out through coordination to
end the civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, Osman expressed appreciation of
the proposals separately submitted by Egypt, Libya and the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) on ending the
civil war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed the hope that these proposals could be
merged into a single one.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sudanese government is expecting the Libyan envoy
in Khartoum to inform the Libyan leadership of Sudan's
appreciation of the Libyan proposal which calls for securing
proper climate for productive talks between the government and the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Libya suggested early this month that the rival parties in
Sudan negotiate to find a peaceful solution to their disputes. It
also calls for cease-fire and setting up a preparatory committee
to work on the proposed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Osman denied Western reports that the Sudanese government used
chemical weapons against the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation
Army led by John Garang.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister renewed his country's call for the
establishment of a neutral body to investigate into such claims.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been waging a war to seek autonomy for the
country's south, which is largely populated by Christians,
from the Muslim-dominated central government.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.9 million people have been killed in the war since
it started in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Khartoum also called on the United Nations to send a
fact-finding mission to Sudan to conduct an investigation of a
chemical factory in Khartoum, which was destroyed in an air
bombing in August 1998 by the United States under the claim that
it was a chemical weapon factory.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Mediation Delayed by Congo War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Mediation to end conflict in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been delayed as rival
rebel factions in the country fought a gun battle at the rebel
stronghold of Kisangani Saturday, preventing a Zambian peace
delegation from flying into the jungle city.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said soldiers loyal to rebel leader
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba battled troops loyal to rebel Emile Ilunga
at an airport in the northeastern city on the Congo River.
</P>
<P>
The fighting lasted around 10 minutes before Ilunga's troops
were arrested and there were no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the battle, Zambian Minister of State House Eric
Silwamba delayed his arrival in the city, according to rebel
troops.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba arrived in DRC this week in an attempt to persuade the
divided rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD) to sign up to a
peace agreement signed in Zambian capital Lusaka last month.
</P>
<P>
The deal aims to end a year-long conflict in the DRC. All the
governments involved in the conflict signed the cease-fire
document.
</P>
<P>
But the CRD, which now holds much of the eastern half of the
country, refused to sign because of a leadership struggle between
Dia Wamba and Ilunga, who in May ousted Dia Wamba as the group's
official head.
</P>
<P>
Ilunga's troops are based in Goma on the Rwandan border, while
Dia Wamba is based in Kisangani, a Ugandan stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian mission has shuttled between the two locations, as
well as visiting the Rwanda and Uganda capitals.
</P>
<P>
However, leader of the Movement for the Liberation for Congo
(MLC), Jean- Pierre Bemba has signed the cease-fire agreement in
Lusaka last Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Cheetahs are on the brink of
extinction in Iran mainly due to environmental degradation,
lack of access to food, and poaching, a major Iranian ecologist
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Asgar Mohammadi-Fazel, the head for co-ordinating a national
strategy on ecological diversity, sounded the warning at a
gathering of directors of provincial environmental protection
departments.
</P>
<P>
"Mis-guided cultural beliefs in the carnivorous nature of the
animal has led to a hunting spree in Asia and other parts of the
world," he said while specifying the poaching factor in the
reduction of the rare animal.
</P>
<P>
Cheetah, the world's fastest land animal, has been observed
running at a velocity of more than 105 kilometers per hour while
in pursuit of prey.
</P>
<P>
Being at the head of the ecological pyramid, cheetah's presence
in any region is effective for the health of the environment,
Mohammadi-Fazel said, quoted by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
With the cooperation of the United Nations and several other
organizations, he said, important projects are being carried out
to ensure that the rare animal might have a chance to survive.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Starts to Build New Embassy in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday
started to build a new embassy in Tanzania one year after the twin
bombings in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
A ground-breaking ceremony for the construction of the new
embassy was held in an open space in north Dar es Salaam, where
U.S. ambassador Rev. Charles Stith used a shovel to turn dirt.
</P>
<P>
Wearing a construction helmet, Stith said the ceremony marks a
new chapter in the history of U.S. presence in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The new United States Embassy that will go up this site will
be a testament to our tenacity in the face of terrorism...and a
symbol of our commitment to our relationship with the people of
Tanzania," Stith said.
</P>
<P>
Stith was accompanied by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
for the Office of Foreign Buildings, Patsy Thomasson, and
Permanent Secretary in Tanzania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Co-operation, Elly Mtango.
</P>
<P>
Thomasson told Xinhua Saturday that construction of the new
embassy, an edifice, will take three years with a cost close to 50
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a sculpture "Hope out of Sorrow" was unveiled at the
National Assembly to mark the first anniversary of the bombing of
U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Twelve people were killed and more than 70 others injured in
the terrorist bombing here on August 7, 1998. A simultaneous
attack on U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya killed more than 200
people and 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
The sculpture, an armless woman made of clay and cement, was
designed by Swedish artist Clara Sornas, who is also the curator
of the Zanzibar Slave Memorial Museum.
</P>
<P>
The sculpture stands in front of a fractured glass screen taken
from the bombed U.S. embassy site. Surrounding the piece of work
are several wrecked bicycles, motorcycles and other items taken
from the same place.

<HEADLINE> S. African Reserve Bank Not to Undergo Great </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Labor Minister Tito
Mboweni, who will become South African Reserve Bank (SARB)
governor, said Saturday that there will be "no earth-shattering
changes" at the bank.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni was addressing the media in Johannesburg only hours
before his inauguration as the supreme of South Africa's premier
financial institution. He takes over the rein from Chris Stals
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that while there could be currency speculation with the
 changeover of the SARB governorship, he was not over-concerned
about speculators.
</P>
<P>
"There is a market place out there and people are entitled to
do certain things. But sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose.
I don't want to see people withdraw money from the bank on
Tuesday. I want them to deposit it and get interest. I also want
to see money coming into the country."
</P>
<P>
Mboweni said he now wanted to focus on his immediate
responsibility at the SARB and do all he could to ensure a stable
financial environment in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The governor-designate outlined policies on several monetary
issues.
</P>
<P>
Inflation targeting, understood to be favored by Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel and cabinet colleagues, would have to be
"core managed", he said, adding that it was not cut and dried as
it could impact on wages and trade.
</P>
<P>
Exchange rate targeting, he said, had been "discredited, and
was a waste of time".
</P>
<P>
Mboweni said he was also in favor of "integrated regulation" of
 financial institutions as he noted that banks and insurance
companies were now offering far more additional services.
</P>
<P>
Artificially low interest rates were however out, as "the cost
has to be paid for down the line," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni will be having talks Monday with various representative
of African and overseas Central Banks, who with President Thabo
Mbeki, were attending his inauguration banquet Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Among the topics to be discussed will be the plight of the
heavily indebted poor countries, the role of banks in emerging
markets, and the reduction of volatility in capital markets.

<HEADLINE> Sockeye Fishery Closed in British Columbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Canadian western province of
British Columbia has closed sockeye fishery along Fraser River due
to a drastic shortfall in returning fish.
</P>
<P>
The move, which means losses of millions of dollars, is dealing
another blow at British Columbia's troubled salmon industry, media
reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The closure came after the country's Pacific Salmon Commission
recommended action Friday, with sockeye returns expected at 40
percent of usual predictions.
</P>
<P>
Only three million sockeye will return to the river to spawn
this year, compared with earlier estimates of 8.2 million,
according to Wayne Saito, chairman of the commission's Fraser
River panel.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall is linked to the after-effect of the El Nino
phenominon. Higher ocean water temperature, decreased food
supplies and the move northward of predatory fish have harmed the
development of this year's sockeye runs, reports said.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the Fraser sockeye fishery has been
closed. In 1995, local authorities decided to curtail the fish run
when only four million sockeye returned.

<HEADLINE> Weather on Eclipse Day to Be Partially Good in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The weather condition on the
eclipse day on August 11 will be partially good in the northern
belt of France within which the sun will be completely covered by
the moon.
</P>
<P>
The northwest part of France will have a clear day, while the
northeast part of the country will remain cloudy, said the French
meteorological service, Meteo-France, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meteo-France said that while in the northeast part of France
the condition of observation is expected to be no good, people can
see the rare celestial phenomenon in a perfect sunshine condition
in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
In the belt of eclipse, the day seems to be cloudy and a little
rainy first, but will start clearing up along the coast of English
Channel, in Bretagne, in Normandy, in Picardie and
Nord-Pas-de-Calais in the northwest in the morning, said
Meteo-France.
</P>
<P>
The complete eclipse will occur in the early afternoon for
about two minutes.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of tourists are expected to be flooding
into the belt on August 11 to witness the marriage between the Sun
and the Moon.
</P>
<P>
French traffic police will be on full alert during the day to
avoid accidents of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
The government has asked motorcyclists not to speed on the road
during the eclipse and not to ride the motors while wearing the
special sunglasses to be distributed free by the government on the
roads to protect the eyes of drivers and passengers.
</P>
<P>
The airports across France will provide enough security
precautions to the passengers on the planes arriving at the time
of the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
Psychoanalysts will also be mobilized on that day to take care
of their patients, who could be scared by the phenomenon.

MOSCOW -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin on Saturday
ordered the armed forces chief of staff and the Interior Ministry
forces chief to normalize the situation in the Dagestan republic,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The order came amid reports that about 500 armed Chechen
militants infiltrated into Dagestan early Saturday and trenched
near the villages of Ansalta and Rakhata in the mountainous
Botlikhsky district.
</P>
<P>
The armed Chechen group is believed to include Arabs and
people from Central Asia, Tass quoted the Dagestani interior
ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is moving its forces to the Botlikhsky district
and ascertaining intents of the Chechen guerrillas, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Recent weeks have witnessed a number of skirmishes along the
borders between Dagestan and the neighboring republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people were killed in shoot-outs between heavily
armed gangs and Russian security forces near the border on Monday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials said earlier that the attackers were based
in Chechnya and get into Russia through the mountains.
</P>
<P>
Since then, as many as 150 fighters have occupied a Dagestani
village near the border. (Russia-Dagestan-Situation)

LAGOS -- S. Leone's former rebel leader Foday Sankoh has said
in Togo's capital Lome that he had ordered a group of former junta
soldiers to free the hostages held by rebel faction loyal to
Johnny Koromah.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried," he said. "The position of the high command
is that this has no effect on the peace accord," said the leader
of the Revolutionary United Front(RUF) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 30 U.N. employees, aid workers, west African intervention
force soldiers and journalists are currently held in the Okra
Hills, some 65 km outside Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The RUF leader said the kidnapping was an "isolated" incident
that did not signal a broader split in the rebels' alliance with
Sierra Leone's former military junta and noted that he had ordered
the soldiers to release their captives.
</P>
<P>
He also accused officials of United Nations and West African
Peacekeeping Force, ECOMOG, of carelessly provoking the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said they had failed to contact senior rebel officials
before sending the delegation into rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
The kidnap took place when an international delegation met with
junta soldiers, who had said they would free about 150 women and
children captured during the war.
</P>
<P>
The junta soldiers freed several captives Thursday, which
included two U. N. officials, a Reuters reporter and a clergy man,
requiring them to convey their demand for food, medicine among
others. (SLeone-Rebel-Hostages)

NEW DELHI -- Indian Congress President Sonia Gandhi Saturday
launched her party's election campaign in Jharsuguda, Orissa,
promising to provide a stable government for the full five-year
term, Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
She said the BJP government had "compromised" India's security
and the nation's image had "plummeted" in the world.
</P>
<P>
She urged the people to bring to an end the series of weak
governments at the center.
</P>
<P>
She said she had entered politics not because of lust for power
but because of her concern for the poor, down-trodden and backward
people and the country's image abroad.
</P>
<P>
She said the performance of the BJP-led government during the
last 16 months showed that such parties grabbed power just to "
satiate" their own self interest.
</P>

Prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is scheduled to launch the

<HEADLINE> UK Compensates Nazi Victims During World War 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON August 7 (Xinhua) Britain has agreed to the first
compensation payments to Nazi victims who had assets seized during
the second world war, officials announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The British government confiscated bank accounts and valuables
from citizens of countries allied with Nazi Germany during the
war. The scheme was designed to prevent money going back to
Germany to finance the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
Among assets taken were millions of pounds belonging to Jews
and other victims of the Holocaust across Europe during the war.
</P>
<P>
More than 130,000 pounds will be paid out to 10 claimants under
a scheme which was launched last December to compensate those
whose possessions and money were confiscated as "enemy property"
under the trading with the enemy act 1939.
</P>
<P>
A worldwide search is now under way to find more people who
tried to escape Nazi persecution, and had property confiscated by
the British authorities.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the first payments, Trade and Industry Secretary
Stephen Byers urged other victims to come forward. Only 250 claims
have been made since details of 30,000 pieces of property were put
on the internet.

<P>
Landlocked in the Jordan Valley between Israel and Jordan, the

BAGHDAD -- Iraq on Saturday refuted the U.S claim that the
U.S.-British warplanes have carried out raids against Iraqi
targets in the no-fly zones in response to Iraqi provocations,
calling them "sheer lies."
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, Iraqi Air
Defense Commander Shaheen Yassin Mohammed said the claimed 108 air
raids by U.S.-British warplanes against Iraqi targets since last
December were not for monitoring the no-fly zones but for
aggression against Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Police Collect Large Quantities of Looted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Albanian police have collected a
significant number of weapons in the town of Gramsh, 60 kilometers
southeast of Tirana, The Albanian Telegraphic Agency (ATA)
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The collected weapons included 6,500 automatic rifles, 51,000
land mines and grenades, and 18 million bullets. They were part of
the arms looted by local residents during the turmoil throughout
Albania in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Albanian police began to gather weapons in Gramsh about one
year ago under a United Nations-Sponsored pilot program called
"Handing Weapons for Development".
</P>
<P>
Under this program, the U.N. invested some 500,000 U.S. dollars
to help develop several projects on road construction,
establishment of telephone network, and rural development in
Gramsh in exchange of weapons from hands of local residents.
</P>
<P>
In early 1997, many angry Albanians stormed the military depots
around the country and took away many weapons after the
money-collecting pyramid scheme scandal burst, turning the country
to the edge of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Armed crimes recently were frequently reported in Albania. The
Albanian government currently is taking some measures to improve
the security around the country, including collecting looted
weapons.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Writes Inscription for Locomotive Plant Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin has written
an inscription to mark the 100th anniversary of the Dalian
Locomotive Plant.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's inscription reads "More efforts should be made to
develop China's locomotive industry so as to meet domestic needs
and export more."
</P>
<P>
The plant, founded in 1899, has developed 30 types of
locomotives and has manufactured nearly 5,000 locomotives since
New China was founded in 1949. These accounted for 40 percent of
the country's total locomotive output.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the plant began to export locomotives and has by now
exported more than 80 locomotives, which account for 80 percent of
the country's diesel locomotive exports.

<HEADLINE> Iran Uses "Buy-back" Scheme to Develop Oil, Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran has succeeded in adopting
"buy-back" scheme to develop its oil and gas fields, and break
sanctions imposed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Tehran's pragmatist energy policy is succeeding, further
neutralizing American efforts to undermine Iran's economy," said
an official with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC).
</P>
<P>
Hojjatollah Ghanimifard, NIOC director for international
affairs, was quoted by local press as saying that Iran is
currently accepting tenders for the implementation of the phases
4-8 of the giant South Pars gas field in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The project attracted many foreign companies and the deadline
for the tender is set on September 1, he said.
</P>
<P>
This world's largest gas field lies 100 kilometers off Iran's
southern coast and has a reserve of about 8 trillion cubic meters
of gas. The whole project includes 10 drilling sites, two offshore
platforms and two lines of gas pipes of 105 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The "buy-back" scheme, also known as "service contract,"
promises contractors certain shares of oil and gas to compensate
their initial investments in exploration and development.
</P>
<P>
It is regarded by Iran as one of the best methods to conclude
energy deals, especially when the country is short of hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
The scheme's first application was with France' Total in
developing Sirri A and E oil fields in the Persian Gulf. With
Total's investment of 600 million U.S. dollars, the field came on
stream last autumn with a daily production capacity of more than
50,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Ghanimifard said many foreign companies showed interest in
exploration. If a foreign company wins a tender, makes an
investment and succeeds in finding oil or gas, then project
development will be put on another tender, he explained.
</P>
<P>
"The company involved can get the new development phase if its
conditions are equal with those of the best bidder," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Iran has nominated Hussein Kazempour
Ardabili, top advisor to the oil minister, as its candidate for
the post of the next secretary-general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Ardabili is also Iran's governor at OPEC and an advisor to
Iran's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, has nominated its governor at
OPEC Soleiman al-Herbish as its candidate.
</P>
<P>
A final decision is expected at the next OPEC oil ministers'
meeting in September.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Court Maintains Verdict on MP Seats Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Supreme Court on
Sunday rejected the parliament speaker's application seeking time
to study the court's verdict to refer the matter relating to the
floor crossing of two opposition law-makers to the Election
Commission (EC).
</P>
<P>
The court directed the speaker on July 29 to refer to the EC
within seven days the dispute as to whether the two
parliamentarians who have joined the government should vacate
their seats in line with the Constitution, dismissing an appeal
filed by the secretary of the Parliament Secretariat against the
High Court which directed the speaker to refer the dispute to the
EC within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
The speaker, who sought time before the Appellate Division of
the Supreme Court to study the court's decision and prayed for a
certified copy of the court's judgment, has already referred the
matter to the EC following the rejection of his time prayer by the
Supreme Court, the BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The court rejected the speaker's prayer Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On a writ petition filed by Khandker Delwar Hossain, chief whip
of the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), and
Deputy leader of the opposition A.Q.M. Badruddoza Chowdhury, a
High Court Division Bench in August 1998 directed the speaker to
refer the matter of dispute over two BNP MPs' floor-crossing to
the EC within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
BNP members of parliament Alauddin Ahmed and Hasibur Rahman
Swapan took oath as ministers in the Awami League cabinet last
year.
</P>
<P>
Khandker Delwar Hossain and Badruddoza Chowdhury wrote letters
to the speaker to refer the matter of the two BNP lawmakers'
floor-crossing to the EC under article 70 of the country's
constitution.

<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of
the national committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), met here today with a China
Synergy Program for Outstanding Youth delegation at Beijing's
Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Wang told them that 1999 is an important year in Chinese
history because it will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
founding of new China and the return of Macao to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The country has witnessed great changes in the half century,
particularly in the two decades of reform and opening, he said,
with the standard of living improving a great deal and the overall
strength of the country increasing.
</P>
<P>
The cohesiveness of all the ethnic groups in China is a major
force in these achievements, he said, and compatriots from Hong
Kong and Macao and other overseas Chinese have made their
contributions and he believes that China will become even stronger
and more prosperous in the next century with their support.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was headed by Chang Hsin-kang, and had Zou Zhe
Kai, Leo Tung-Hai Lee, and S.K. Chan as advisors. It consisted of

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Speaks About Three Emphases On Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, the chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), told a recent meeting that all CPPCC
departments need to implement the spirit of the "three emphases"
on education.
</P>
<P>
Li told the meeting, which was on CPPCC departments carrying
out the important decision of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party, to focus on theoretical studies, political
awareness, and healthy conduct.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental reason the Chinese Communist Party won one
victory after another during both wartime and peaceful period was
that the Party often listened to and accepted the opinions and
supervision of the people and was courageous enough to carry out
critricism and self-criticism and to continue to overcome
shortcomings, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned, however, that some Party officials have not been
doing very well in these respects these days and have forgotten
the Party's fine tradition and work style. He asked officials at
all levels to take the lead in the education campaign to improve
work performance and to solve some major problems by relying on
the people.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Fresh Strikes Against Gunmen in Daghestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces on Sunday
delivered fresh artillery and missile strikes on the positions of
several hundred gunmen who seized several villages in the
mountainous Botlikhsky district of Daghestan, which borders the
breakaway Chechnya republic.
</P>
<P>
Helicopter gunships and long-rang artillery were used in the
offensive against the gunmen that infiltrated into the villages
Saturday morning, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report of casualties so far since federal
helicopter gunships and artillery pieces pounded the rebel
positions late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff Anatoly
Kvashnin, now in Daghestan, confirmed the strikes against the
gunmen, who are believed to be Islamic militants numbering 300 to
600 and under the command of Chechen field commanders Shamil
Basayev and Emir al-Hattab.
</P>
<P>
"We proceed from the need to avoid civilian casualties in our
strategy," Kvashnin said. "We will settle the gunmen problem but
no civilians will be harmed."
</P>
<P>
The gunmen are armed with two armored personnel carriers, an
anti-tank recoilless gun, air-defense systems and a huge amount of
firearms, Tass quoted a source in the Daghestani Interior Ministry
as saying.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly sneaked into the villages, disarmed the local
police and held the male population hostage while allowing women
and children to flee the area.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin has arrived in Makhachkala,
capital city of the Daghestan republic, to oversee the military
operation against the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
"Neither servicemen nor civilians must be harmed in settling
the situation in the Botlikhsky district," Stepashin said.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Member Denounces Falun Gong Cult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Liu Shuwen, a female deputy-head
of a Falun Gong training center in Beijing, says that Li Hongzhi,
the founder of Falun Gong, deceived innocent people with his
fallacies and urged them to oppose the government.
</P>
<P>
Liu, 61, was a senior engineer at a factory in aerospace
industry when she retired and began to practice Falun Gong in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Liu was appointed deputy-head of the training center at the end
of 1998. She said that the illegal gatherings at the Beijing TV
station and at Zhongnanhai, the site of the central government, by
Falun Gong cult members were, in fact, orchestrated by Li Hongzhi
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
She recalled that a meeting was convened by the Beijing Falun
Gong training center on the morning of April 24 at which two
senior officials of the Falun Dafa Research Society, the
governing body of Falun Gong, asked all Falun Gong practitioners
to go to Zhongnanhai.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the cult's trick is never to say directly that a
person must do something but all practitioners have to do what is
asked of them and are asked to strive for an 'enlightenment'
advocated by Li Hongzhi or they won't be perfect in their practice.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi often sent orders to practitioners in the form of
sutras and if anyone went against his will he would issue a sutra
to force the person to correct this, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
When she saw through the true nature and the pernicious effects
of Falun Gong, Liu vowed to leave Falun Gong and was determined to
persuade other practitioners to do the same.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Rejects Resumption of Talks With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Sunday rejected resumption of dialogue with
Pakistan unless it stops "sponsoring terrorism" in Jammu and
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
In a 40-minute speech at a rally held here to launch the BJP's
election campaign, he said India cannot be pressurized to "hold
talks at gun point."
</P>
<P>
If Pakistan was sincere about talks, he said, it would have to
create conditions conducive for a dialogue. "You cannot indulge in
a dialogue just to show others. It has to be meaningful."
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that there has been a step-up in "terrorist
violence" in Jammu and Kashmir, adding that his country has the
strength and might to counter such designs.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee also blamed the opposition, especially the Congress,
for forcing the mid-term elections on the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that political instability not only hindered
development and progress but also affected national security and
the law and order situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The general elections in India are scheduled to be held in
September-October.
</P>
<P>
"The country faced five Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament)
elections in the last 10 years though the term of the house is for
five years. This should stop," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his government has been able to control
inflation, maintain the price line and boost the foreign exchange
reserves.
</P>
<P>
"The several measures introduced in the Budget have started
paying dividends," he said, adding that the opposition parties
should debate on these issues and programs.

<HEADLINE> China Is A Strategic Partner, Brown Says (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nation Development
Program (UNDP) considers China a tremendous strategic partner and
hopes to expand cooperation, Mark Brown, its administrator, said
here today.
</P>
<P>
UNDP considers China a partner in its assistance and in China's
leadership on development issues, Brown told a group of Chinese
journalists this morning.
</P>
<P>
Brown came to China August 5 at the invitation of Shi
Guangsheng, the Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, and he met with President Jiang Zemin and other
officials on August 6.
</P>
<P>
Brown said that this visit, which comes just a month after
assuming office, has two purposes: to secure the support of the
president and the government of China for UN development
cooperation in the world and to discuss the best way of using UNDP
resources in China.
</P>
<P>
He said he was encouraged by Jiang's words that Jiang would
strongly advocate strengthening UN development cooperation in the
world. Brown added that the UNDP will shift to advisory work
rather than just project cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He described the cooperation with China as successful, and in
the past 20 years the UNDP has put some 500 million U.S. dollars
in some 500 projects in China, many of which were for poverty
relief, integrated community action in environmental protection
and job issues, and public health services.

<HEADLINE> 1,500 Rally in Sydney Over Airport Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,500 protesters in
Australia's Sydney city Sunday called on the federal government to
show real guts by rejecting the plan for a second Sydney airport
at Badgerys Creek.
</P>
<P>
The rally, part of a series of ongoing anti-Badgerys protests,
came as the federal government faces renewed pressure to dump its
airport plan at Tuesday's cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Western Sydney Alliance arranged a series of anti-Badgerys
protests, opposing the 9-billion-Australian dollar (5.94 billion
U.S. dollar) second airport proposal.
</P>
<P>
Alliance chairman Allan Ezzy said the government's Badgerys
Creek proposal was not economically, socially or environmentally
viable.
</P>
<P>
He said that many more people had tried to enter Sunday's rally
but were turned away for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
He said the residents were calling on politicians to listen to
their concerns.
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly not a case of NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard), as
the protesters here are big enough and educated enough to realize
that this isn't just about western Sydney, but it's a about
finding a sustainable solution to Sydney's airport needs."
</P>
<P>
Last month, Australian Transport Minister John Anderson said a
decision should be made by the end of the year on the airport
issue, which has plagued successive Labor and coalition
governments.

KATHMANDU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth South Asian
Federation (SAF) Games organizers decided after much vacillation
to offer the regional sports events to the capital city of Nepal,
the Kathmandu Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Games organizers had earlier trumpeted to move boxing and
some of the preliminary football matches to Pokhara, a city which
neighbors Kathmandu. But now they have decided to host all twelve
games in Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The secretary at the Eighth SAF Games Technical Committee, Lok
Bahadur Shahi, said that boxing requires a suitable indoor
location and Kathmandu is preferred over Pokhara for security
reasons as the game was due to be played at an open stand at
Pokhara stadium.
</P>
<P>
Shahi also said that all the football matches will also be
staged at Dashrath stadium in Kathmandu due to unsuitable weather
conditions during that period in Pokhara.
</P>
<P>
The ten-day event from September 25 to October 4 is expected to
draw some two thousand participants including athletes, officials
and media persons from the region.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Ruling Coalition Urged to Upgrade Preparations for Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Sunday called upon the ruling
Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front) in the states to upgrade
their preparations to ensure a huge win for the coalition in the
coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, as BN chairman, wants a
sweeping victory for the BN in the elections, he said after a
function in Klang, some 30 km southwest of here, according to
Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Let us together prove our capability to secure overwhelming
victory as what he is hoping for," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that Mahathir was still not satisfied with
preparations in the states as he did not want the BN to be only
satisfied with a narrow win in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The coming general elections, though not announced, are widely
expected to be held in September.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah was confident that the people would continue to
support the BN based on the performance of the coalition in the
past, besides the wish of the people who want a stable government
led by the BN.
</P>
<P>
He said the people in the country were fortunate as they live
in prosperity, peace and security even though they were from
different ethnic, religious and cultural background.
</P>
<P>
Such a situation could be created because the BN founding
fathers had believed that racial unity and goodwill were essential
for Malaysia's progress and future, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They have displayed exemplary leadership, sensitive to the
problems faced by the people, working together to assist the
people, to safeguard their interest," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the BN represented the various ethnic groups and
adopted a politics of consensus which was ideal for Malaysia whose
success had impressed many other countries.

HANOI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has detected 7,625
drug-related cases with 15,710 people involved over the past seven
months, showing increases of 53.2 percent and 52.6 percent
respectively over the same period last year, Vietnam News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 44 kg of heroin, 284 kg of opium and 297
kg of marijuana were seized.

<P>
According to Vietnam's Committee for Nationalities and
Mountainous Areas, the government has increased inspections of
poppy growing areas and encouraged local people to eradicate and
replace poppy plants with other food and industrial crops for
socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Almost 9,000 drug addicts were treated in detoxification
centers nationwide and 3,400 others in communities.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse prevention has been strengthened under commitments
signed between pupils, school masters, parents and local police.
Drug abuse issues have also been added to school curricula.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that heroin and other drugs are transported to
Vietnam mainly through borders with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
To boost the fight against drug-related crimes, Vietnam's
police have this year coordinated with Interpol and foreign forces

<HEADLINE> Retiring S. African Central Banker Gives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Retiring South African
Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals gave his commandments of central
banking Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Handing over the central bank reigns to former labor minister
Tito Mboweni at midnight Saturday, Stals listed his commandments
at a gala banquet in Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
He said the need for the central bank's independence must be
recognized and appreciated by the public and by governments. But,
after all was said and done, a central bank could only be as
independent as the government of the day wanted it to be.
</P>
<P>
"From my experience, I have learned that without regular
contact and close cooperation with the minister of finance, the
life of a central banker can become very lonely."
</P>
<P>
He said in many countries of the world, the central bank's
powers should be reduced to increase the effectiveness of monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
"Joined with the potent power to create money, the power to
make loans and spend money has the potential to create a
superpower, whose actions can easily lead to financial
destruction."
</P>
<P>
He said, by successfully restricting growth in the total
domestic assets of the central bank, monetary policy would ensure
growth in the total foreign assets of the country.
</P>
<P>
A central banker was often very unpopular in his country, and
if the governor did become popular in his own country, it might be
the time for him to retire.
</P>
<P>
"Monetary policy is about financial discipline, about
restricting expenditure, about forcing the country to live within
its means. Measures to achieve these objectives can never be
popular. You cannot ask the turkeys of the world to vote for
Christmas. You also cannot ask of money what the level of interest
rates should be."
</P>
<P>
Stals said: "When I was criticized for the policies of the
bank, I always asked who the critic was and where he worked. That
normally made me apathetic.
</P>
<P>
"A country may be able to keep politicians out of interest
rates, but you can never take interest rates out of politics.
When politicians therefore make statements about interest rates,
central bankers should infer that they are talking to their
voters, and not to the central bank."
</P>
<P>
There was no such thing as central banking by rules, he said,
adding discretion remained indispensable in the daily
implementation of monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
"Economics, after all, is not an exact science. In the world
of macro- economic policy, two plus two may sometimes add up to
five. As a central banker, never, however, try to make it six."
</P>
<P>
The outgoing governor pointed out that a central banker must
learn to ignore any praise bestowed on him, particularly through
or by the media.
</P>
<P>
"This will justify his right also to resent the unfair
criticism that will be launched at him from the same sources."
</P>
<P>
In the present world of a rapidly changing global financial
environment, a central banker must be a student for ever, he said.
</P>

"Always remember the old Chinese saying that a man must study
as if he will live forever, but live as if he will die tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Stals said these ten commandments represented for him a final
conclusion of his experience as a central banker over many years.
</P>
<P>
He was leaving the bank "in great peace of mind" because he was
 confident that Mboweni and his bank team had the ability,
determination and the will to steer South Africa successfully into
"this brave new world".
</P>
<P>
Stals paid tribute to the South African bankers who he said did
not always agree with the bank's hard-line approach, but always
remained loyal to it.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked people he worked with over many years as a
central banker, including government people, as well as the
previous presidents who appointed him deputy governor, senior
deputy governor and later governor.

<HEADLINE> INLA Declares War Is Over: Paper Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua)-- The Irish National Liberation Army
(INLA) has become the first paramilitary group in Northern Ireland
to declare its war is over, according to a newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
The INLA, which came to prominence in 1979 when it killed
Conservative MP Airey Neave in a car bomb, has told its political
wing, the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP), it has no
reason to continue its armed campaign, The Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a senior party member as saying, "The INLA
have assured us that as far as they are concerned the war is over
and they see no further basis for armed struggle."
</P>
<P>
The group is also reported to have rejected attempts by
republican groups the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA to join them
in a bombing campaign in mainland Britain.
</P>
<P>
However, the INLA is believed instead to be promoting the idea
of a non-aggression pact with the province's largest republican
group, the IRA, and mainstream loyalist paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
The INLA declared a ceasefire on August 22 last year after a
bloody campaign of violence which saw several feuds within the
organization.
</P>
<P>
But before its ceasefire was called, its members carried out
the murder of one of the province's most feared loyalist
paramilitary leaders, Billy Wright, in the Maze Prison in December
1997.
</P>
<P>
There has been a cautious response to the report from unionist
politicians. Ulster Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson said he would be
adopting "a wait and see approach."
</P>
<P>
"If the INLA are calling a complete end to their campaign of
violence, then it follows like day follows night that they will
have to decommission," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Capital to Host Hi-tech Center for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) is preparing to set up a Technology
Center for Africa at its headquarters in Ethiopian capital Addis
Ababa, business weekly Capital reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The technology center, designed to create a bridge between the
African continent and the rest of the world, will be situated at
the 120-million- dollar U.N. Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the technology center will be a major step
toward the realization of the African Information Society
Initiative, a structural framework for developing Africa's
information and communication infrastructure, ECA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The information society initiative was adopted in Addis Ababa
in 1996 by African ministers in charge of economic development and
planning.
</P>
<P>
According to a brochure issued by the ECA, the technology
center, due to be officially launched in October 1999, will
consist of two distinctive components, the Technology Exhibition
Center and the Training Center.
</P>
<P>
The former will demonstrate information and communication
technology applications, and will display services and products
including hardware and software computer products, computer-based
training, video and audio conference and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
The latter, while providing workshops, seminars and scholarship
on information and communication technology for the different
parties involved in the African development process, will mainly
target technical managers, policy makers, and planers including
delegates of African countries attending conferences at the Addis
Ababa-based U.N. Conference Center.

<HEADLINE> China Sweeps Gold and Silver in Table Tennis Worlds  By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China scored a clean
sweep of the gold and silver medals at the world table tennis
championships on Sunday as two penholders made the men's singles final
as an all-Chinese affair.
</P>
<P>
Ma Lin and Liu Guoliang, who both play in penhold grip, beat
handshakers Jan-Ove Waldner and Werner Schlager in the semifinals,
rejuvenating what once had been branded as outdated as the wooden
tennis racket, the scissor-style high jump and bowling underarm in
cricket.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, China has secured a gold-silver sweep in the women's
singles, women's doubles, men's doubles and mixed doubles, with Wang
Nan emerging winner both in the women's singles and doubles.
</P>
<P>
Dual Olympic champion Liu Guoliang, who combined with Kong Linghui
to win the men's doubles trophy on Saturday, handed a 21-10, 21-18,
18-21, 21-16 defeat to Schlager, a quarter-final winner over two-time
World Cup champion Zoran Primorac of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Ma Lin, who has taken the mixed doubles title with Zhang Yingying,
came from two sets down and 10-15 behind in the third set to outlast
Waldner 18-21, 14-21, 21-19, 21-19, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Swede, the only player in the world to have won a
"Grand Slam" of Olympic, world championship and World Cup titles, used
his deceptive serves and follow-up topspin strokes to clinch the first
two sets easily.
</P>
<P>
Ma came back strongly, unleashing a string of devastating forehand
attacks to win three sets in a row, while Walnder looked nervous and
missed quite a few easy kills.
</P>
<P>
"My secret to win? Nothing! I just didn't want to lose," the
19-year-old Ma said.
</P>
<P>
"I broke Waldner's nerves when I came back from 10-15 down to win
the third set. In the last two sets, I was so nervous that my arms
felt stiff, but Waldner was more nervous than I."
</P>
<P>
Yao Zhenxu, vice chairman of the Chinese Table Tennis Association,
said Ma's steel nerves played a crucial role in his win over Waldner,
the man who brong down China's 1995 world champion Kong Linghui and
still holds many Chinese in awe.
</P>
<P>
"In technical terms, Walnder is much better than Ma, but Ma is
mentally stronger than Waldner although the Swede usually displays
excellent poise and balance," Yao said.
</P>
<P>
"Two Chinese in final means a lot to Chinese table tennis. We have
been waiting for this moment for very long time," Yao added.
</P>
<P>
Since Chinese Jiang Jialiang grabbed his second world title in
1989, Europeans had dominated the men's singles event until 1995, when
Kong Linghui cashed in on home-court advantage to win the most
valuable title in table tennis. China lost the event in the 1997
championships as Waldner and Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus shut the
Chinese out of the final.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts to improve skills and find new talents has never
stopped. That's why we are so strong," Yao said.
</P>
<P>
Ma and Liu has proven, with their wins over top Europeans, that
Chinese penhold style is still a lethal weapon.
</P>
<P>
The two styles play as their names suggest. A handshaker grips
the bat as of if he is shaking someone's hand and can easily make
forehand and backhand strokes.
</P>
<P>
A traditional penholder uses only one side of the bat for both
strokes and grips the bat as if holding a pen. This style is well
suited for flat forehands and defensive dropshots but is short on
backhand power.
</P>
<P>
Unlike traditional penholders, both Liu and Ma stick rubber onto
both sides of the bat and plays top spin with backhand.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say now that penhold is superior to handshake, but I can
say for sure that penhold is never a sporting bygone," Yao Zhenxu
said.

WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Second-seeded Alexei Shirov of
Spain failed to convert his opening game win and tied with No. 50
seed Gilbert Milos of Brazil in the third round of the World Chess
Championship in Las Vegas on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Needing only a draw to advance, Shirov played passively at the
beginning of the game Saturday, while Milos advanced on Shirov's
central pawns and was about to win a bishop when Shirov resigned.
</P>
<P>
All other six players who won their first games of round three
on Friday, advanced to the next round in the seven-round 3-million
dollars monthlong tournament.
</P>
<P>
And sixth-seeded Vassily Ivanchuk of the Ukraine was the only
one of the six to win the second game of his mini-matches by
dispatching Russia's Sergei Shipov, the 22nd seed.

of Britain, Bulgarians Veselin Topalov and Kiril Georgiev, Vadim
Zvjaginsev of Russia.
</P>
<P>

tournament, who beat Jordi Magem Badals of Spain.

<HEADLINE> Scheme Launched to Offer On-Line Government Services (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scheme will allow filing of simple tax returns or payment
of tax through the Internet at any time.
</P>
<P>
The existing 1.23 million drivers and 500,000 vehicle owners
can renew their driving and vehicle licenses respectively through
the on-line services.
</P>
<P>
The other seven government departments are: Immigration, Labor,
Rating and Valuation, Industry and Social Welfare Departments,
Registration and Electoral Office as well as Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Using their electronic services, to cite a few, job-seekers can
look for job vacancies while employers can submit job vacancies
and search for suitable candidates. Those eligible can register as
voters, and individuals can book appointments for identity card
registration.
</P>
<P>
Members of the public will be able to apply on-line for
volunteer scheme registration and senior citizen cards. Businesses
can seek advice on investment and business licensing requirements.
Tourists can access information about Hong Kong. Users can pay tax,
rates, government rent and water charges electronically.
</P>
<P>
The ESD Scheme will also be operated at a cross-departmental
level in a seamless manner. At present, citizens have to notify
individual departments of any change in their personal particulars,
such as addresses, separately.
</P>
<P>
ESD is a key initiative under the "Digital 21" Information
Technology Strategy which aims at enhancing and promoting Hong
Kong's information infrastructure and services, making it a
leading digital city in the globally connected world of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Siu noted that the introduction of ESD would pave the way for
the development of electronic commerce in Hong Kong with the
government's promotional efforts.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a public key infrastructure, supported by
certification authorities, and a clear legal framework for
electronic transactions will further boost public confidence and
provide a secure environment conducive to electronic commerce
locally.

<HEADLINE> Scheme Launched to Offer On-Line Government Services in HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- No one can resist a scheme
that will bring to them a substantial saving in time, labor and
traveling expenses in obtaining government services as compared
with the conventional means of visiting government offices and
queuing for counter service during office hours.
</P>
<P>
The Electronic Service Delivery (ESD) Scheme, to be launched in
the latter half of next year, will offer these advantages.
</P>
<P>
"Under the ESD Scheme, the public will be able to enjoy
efficient, better quality and round-the-clock service seven days a
week provided by the Government on-line through personal computers
at home or computers installed at District Offices, public
libraries, community halls and centers throughout Hong Kong, or
other electronic means," said Alan Siu, principal assistant
secretary of the Information Technology and Broadcasting Bureau (
ITBB).
</P>
<P>
A total of 37 services will be delivered electronically by nine
government departments along with Hong Kong Tourist Association (
HKTA) in Phase I of the scheme.
</P>
<P>
This involves an allocation of capital and staff costs totaling
150.8 million HK dollars (about 19.3 million U.S. dollars) by the
Finance Committee of the Legislative Council, Siu said.
</P>
<P>
"Six consortia comprising local and overseas companies have
tendered for the supply of the ESD Scheme. We are now scrutinizing
the tenders on the basis of their technical expertise and
financial implication," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We will award the contract around the end of September or
early October this year. The successful bidder has to complete the
project within 12 months."
</P>
<P>
To widen the scope of the scheme, Siu said, the contractor can
extend its services to the private sector at a later stage after
the introduction of the scheme.
</P>
<P>
"ITBB will monitor the operation of the scheme and review the
progress within three years of its implementation. The extent of
provision of conventional counter service will be assessed," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Inland Revenue and Transport Departments are expected to top
the list of nine government departments in carrying the largest
volume of electronic transactions with the public.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir Visits Palestinian Self-rule Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani arrived Sunday at Gaza Airport for an official
visit to the Palestinian territories, the first of its kind by a
Gulf leader.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted upon arrival by Chairman of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat, senior Palestinian
officials and some accredited envoys of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Sheikh Hamad are scheduled to hold talks on issues
of mutual concern, particularly the Middle East peace process and
bilateral economic cooperation as well as Qatar's financial
support to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Local news media said that the Qatari emir may donate his
private plane to the PNA to boost its airliners which are few in
number.
</P>
<P>
Qatar opened a representation office in Gaza in November 1995
and it has granted 5 million U.S. dollars to the Palestinian
authorities since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Also, Qatar has initiated one flight a week between Gaza and
Doha after the inauguration of the Gaza Airport at the end of last
year.

<HEADLINE> HK Exhibition Captures Scent of Qing Dynasty Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition featuring a
selection of Chinese women paintings in the 19th century is staged
at the Historical Pictures Gallery of the Hong Kong Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Leisure Pursuits: Paintings of Qing Dynasty Women,"
the exhibition gives viewers a glance of domestic life at the time.
It also provides the viewers with an opportunity to admire a
variety of women images in different styles created by Chinese and
Western artists.
</P>
<P>
From the 23 paintings on display, viewers may learn that the
Chinese artists still followed the traditional style of lady
paintings, according to a staff member of the museum.
</P>
<P>
Most of the ladies were painted with stylized facial features
and were always depicted as gentle, sedate and quiet. In the mean
time, slenderness was the Chinese aesthetic standard of woman, the
staff member said.
</P>
<P>
The painting "The Empress of China" by the Chinese artist
Tingqua is one of the examples in which the woman is presented as
slim figures dressed in loosen clothes, and facial expression is
minimal yet calm.
</P>
<P>
The staff member said that in contrast, the Western artists
devoted much effort on capturing the movement, individual
personality and expression of emotion in their paintings.
</P>
<P>
Like the "Dame Chinoise" drawn by the French artist Deveria A.
and lithographed by Lemercier, it displays how the Europeans
reconstructed their own Chinese beauty with sensuous female
figures and how they projected their own ideal images of Qing
women in the paintings, he added.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will run until the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Urged To Set up Breast-feeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Federal and state governments of
Nigeria have been urged to establish centers in their various
departments and offices where nursing mothers in their employment
can breast-feed their children during working hours.
</P>
<P>
Medical Director of the Federal Medical Center Hussein
Aladesawe made the call Saturday at the opening ceremony of
Breast-feeding Week organized by the center in Owo, Nigeria's
southeastern Ondo State.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government should actively participate in the
campaign for total breast-feeding of all children from birth till
six months as there are complaints of inadequate breast-feeding of
Nigerian children in the early stage.
</P>
<P>
Since it is difficult for the government to grant women
maternity leave beyond the normal three months, the centers would
have, among other things, a qualified nurse who would ensure that
these babies are well fed for the initial six months, the Guardian
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Since children are the future leaders of the nation and the
hope for our continuity, it is mandatory for us to ensure that
their development is not allowed to suffer or be tampered with in
any way", Aladesawe was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that once a child is taking adequate breast milk, such
a child does not need water or any other food or medicaments.
</P>
<P>
He explained that breast milk contains adequate food
complements, stressing that "an unhealthy child will normally
develop into an unhealthy adult."
</P>
<P>
He commended the Federal Ministry of Health and the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for their financial and moral
support given to the management of the center toward organizing
celebrations for the World Breast-feeding Week.
</P>
<P>
He assured the UNICEF that whatever assistance given to the
center would be used in propagation of Breast-feeding in Owo Local
Government Area in particular and the state in general.

<HEADLINE> 4 African Leaders Discuss Congo Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa is in Pretoria, South Africa, attending a one-day
mini-summit on the conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
an official said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The summit, convened by South African President Thabo Mbeki, is
also attended by Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Pasteur Bizimungu
of Rwanda, presidential press secretary Geoffrey Nkurlu said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that the leaders will discuss about the
fragile cease-fire endangered by the alleged bombing on the
Congolese rebels in northern Congo.
</P>
<P>
One major rebel group, the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD),
has not signed the cease-fire agreement reached in Zambian capital
Lusaka on July 10 by the six countries directly involved in the
Congolese conflict.
</P>
<P>
Another rebel group led by Jean-Pierre Bemba who signed the
cease-fire accord last Sunday has threatened to fight on if the
RCD would not sign the cease-fire pact.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa who is leading a three-man delegation left
Tanzanian capital on Saturday morning and is expected to return
Sunday or Monday, said Nkurlu.

GAZA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Three members of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas), including Ismaiyel Abu-Shanab, one of
the senior members of the movement, have been arrested, said
well-informed sources of the Palestinian police authority.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the police launched a roundup last
weekend after the shooting incident in which two Jewish settlers
in Hebron were injured. The military wing of Hamas had claimed
responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had called upon the
Palestinian National Authority after the incident to intensify its
measures to crack down on terrorism attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel had closed down the town of Hebron where 400 Jewish
settlers reside as soon as the shooting incident took place, but
ended the closure Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, a radical Palestinian group, opposes peacemaking between
the Arabs and Israel.

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch New Publicity Campaign to Fight Youth Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A new round of government
publicity against youth crime will be launched in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region this month, a spokesman for the
Fight Crime Committee said.
</P>
<P>
To sustain the publicity efforts of last year's Fight Youth
Crime Campaign, the campaign this year will again focus on parent-
child relationship, and promote mutual understanding between the
two generations, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Parents are urged to provide more support and guidance for
their children, especially when their children have emotional
problems. And children, on the other hand, should put themselves
in their parents' shoes and try to understand the feelings of
their parents," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that some 33,140 crimes were detected in HK
in 1998, with 40,422 people arrested for various criminal offenses.
Of those arrested, 5,834 were juvenile offenders, aged between
seven and 15, and 6,613 were young persons, accounting for 32
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
On this year's publicity campaign, the spokesman said the
messages on prevention of juvenile crime will be delivered to
members of the public through a range of channels. These include
two 30-second promotional films on television, or Television
Announcements in the Public Interest, radio messages, magazine
advertisements and posters.
</P>
<P>
The films are reinforced by advertisements targeted at children.
While advertisements will be placed in magazines well received by
youngsters, the promotional films will also be screened in cinemas.
Besides, posters echoing the theme will be displayed along the
tracks of the Mass Transit Railway. A number of buses and trams
will be painted with the fight youth crime messages.

CAIRO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran intends to add 250,000 new mobile phone lines to
its telecom network before the end of the Iranian year next March.
</P>
<P>
"The number of lines will be increased from 430,000 to more
than 680,000," said Director of Iran's State Telephone Company,
Abdollah Mir-Taheri.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that more than 3 million mobile numbers
will be operational within the next five years. Since Iran has a
population of more than 60 million, that will mean one mobile
phone for more than 20 people.
</P>
<P>
Iran's mobile phone network, which uses GSM standard
technology, covers almost all of the nation's major cities and
towns.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran is to hold it first exclusive exhibition in
Almaty, Kazakhstan next week to promote the sale of Iranian goods
in the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will put on show pharmaceuticals, foodstuff,
vegetable oil, ironwork of doors and windows, taps, valves and
faucets, asbestos, accumulators, oysters and picture frames,
electric switches and sockets, wire and cables, paints, minibuses,
factory-woven carpets, stone slabs for building purposes, tiles,
ovens, plastic and household appliances, chinaware, and steel
utensils.
</P>
<P>
Annual trade volume between Iran and Kazakhstan is now valued
at 100 million U.S. dollars, in which Kazakhstan's exports amount
to 60 million and those of Iran, 40 million.
</P>
<P>
KHARTOUM -- Sudan is in need of about 2 billion U.S. dollars
for the construction of new dams and the expansion of existing
ones.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has drawn up a comprehensive national strategy for the
development of water resources which covers the Atbara River, the
Blue Nile and the Nile River, said Sudanese Minister of Irrigation
and Water Resources Kamal Ali Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Plans have been made to build two more dams along the Atbara
River and on the Nile River to generate electricity and to promote
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government is currently seeking for necessary
funding from international markets and financial organizations for
the implementation of these projects.
</P>
<P>
KHARTOUM -- The overall growth rate of Sudan's economy during
the past year stood at 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector made remarkable increase in the area
under cultivation for 40 million feddans (16.8 million hectars) as
compared to 18 million feddans (7.56 million hectars) two years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
A recent report on the performance of Sudan's economy
attributed the growth to a policy based on cutting taxes on
company profits, lowering of the production and sales taxes in
order to boost local industries and promoting the competitiveness
of the Sudanese goods in face of imported commodities, the Arab
economic daily Alam Al Yom reported Sunday.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Islamic extremists who crossed
into Russia's Daghestan from the breakaway Chechnya republic
Saturday continue to hold positions around the mountain villages
of Ansalta and Rokhota in Dagestan's Botlikh district, the
Interfax news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An officer of the Dagestani Interior Ministry's Border
Department said the situation did not change and was relatively
tranquil Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, with fire arms and anti-tank and antiaircraft
weapons, are being countered by the local police, special units,
and units of the Russian Interior Ministry's 102nd interior
brigade and of the Defense Ministry's 136th motorized infantry
brigade, supported by helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The Dagestani law-enforcement bodies will hold a large-scale
operation against the Muslim gunmen later Sunday, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to launch such an operation was taken Saturday
night by the headquarters of the Dagestani law-enforcement bodies
led by Interior Minister Adilgerei Magomedtagirov, and Commander
of the Russian Interior Troops Vladimir Ovchinnikov.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commander-in-Chief of Russia's Interior Troops
Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov has also flown to the Botlikhsky district,

interior ministry's press service.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and Chief
of the Russian General Staff Anatoly Kvashnin are also coming to
Daghestan later Sunday to oversee the fight against the Islamic
infiltrators, believed to be headed by Chechen rebel field
commanders Shamil Basayev and Emir al-Hattab.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin will fly from Kazan, Tatarstan, to the Dagestani
capital of Makhachkala in a mission agreed upon by telephone with
President Boris Yeltsin, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Tass reported that virtually all villagers of Ansalta and
Rakhata, around which the gunmen entrenched themselves, have fled
their homes. Some of the refugees, mainly women and children,
arrived in the Daghestan capital Makhschkala Saturday night, Tass
reported.

<HEADLINE> Barak Asks Albright to Postpone Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak last week asked U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
to postpone her planned Middle East trip due to the impasse in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, local media reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports by The Jerusalem Post and Haaretz
newspapers, Barak wished that the dispute between Israel and the
Palestinians over the timing of the implementation of the Wye
agreement can be resolved locally before Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz newspaper said that Barak's call on Thursday to
Albright was also aimed at focusing Albright's trip, originally
scheduled for 14-18 this month, on pushing forward the
Israeli-Syrian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
And Washington is reportedly considering postponing the trip
until the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, no advance teams for Albright's visit are in Israel
yet.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post quoted a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in
Tel Aviv as saying that Albright is still planning to visit the
region this month, only "the dates haven't been finalized."
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) signed the
Wye interim accords in the United States last October, which
requires Israel to hand over to the Palestinians 13.1 percent of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Netanyahu, Barak's hard-line predecessor, carried out
the first phase of the three-stage withdrawal, but then suspended
the accord, accusing the Palestinians of failing to fulfill their
security commitments.
</P>
<P>
After taking office last month, Barak pledged to implement the
second stage of the withdrawal, but proposed to combine the third
phase withdrawal with the final status talks.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Kill 7 Ugandan Soldiers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Goma faction of the split
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) of the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), reportedly killed seven Ugandan soldiers in eastern
Congo in intensified clashes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which pits RCD rebels backed by Rwanda and based
in Goma against Ugandan troops backing a rival rebel faction,
occurred in the northern city of Kisangani, the Monitor daily
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There were reports indicating some seven Ugandan soldiers might
have been killed and many other causalities on the other side, a
top security source was quoted as saying Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan contingent, led by Ugandan Chief of Staff James
Kazini, shelled the bases of their rivals with heavy weapons, the
RCD Vice President Jean-Pierre Ondekane said.
</P>
<P>
An information officer with the rebel group said that Ugandan
officers passing in front of the house of a rebel officer opened
fire without warning, provoking a response from the Congolese
guard.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, did not give explanations of the exchange
of gunfire from the Ugandan side.
</P>
<P>
The RCD, the main rebel group opposing Congolese President
Laurent Kabila, split on May 19, when its president Wamba dia
Wamba was replaced by Emile IIIunga.
</P>
<P>
Uganda backs Wamba dia Wamba, whose base is in Kisangani, while
Rwanda has thrown its support behind IIIunga, who has his
headquarters in Goma.
</P>
<P>
Wamba demanded he has the right to sign on behalf of the RCD a
cease- fire accord reached in Zambian capital Lusaka on July 10,
while IIIunga and the RCD-Goma faction denied him the authority
and refused to endorse the pact themselves until the question has
been settled.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Has First Black Central Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Former labor minister Tito
Mboweni has been inaugurated as new governor of the South African
Reserve Bank, becoming the first black central banker in South
African history.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni, 40, took over the Reserve Bank reigns from Chris Stals
on the stroke of midnight Saturday at a gala banquet in Midrand,
north of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki called Mboweni's
inauguration "an important day in our history." He also praised
Stals, saying that he facilitated transmission.
</P>
<P>
The president said that when former president Nelson Mandela
asked Stals to stay on for another five years in 1994, Stals had
no hesitation in doing so.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki noted that Stals similarly had no hesitation in
supporting Mboweni, who was transferred to the central bank as
governor-in-waiting from his labor portfolio a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni told the banquet that his appointment did not "herald
the start of a cheap money era in the bank."
</P>
<P>
He also said the South African Reserve Bank was not an Icarus
that would fly too close to the sun.
</P>
<P>
"Emerging markets globally have suffered financial turmoil
which plunged many into deep recession. South Africa, though
resilient, has not emerged from this turmoil unscathed. At only
half-a-percent, the rate of growth in gross domestic product last
year fell woefully short of the levels needed in a country where
poverty and joblessness remain widespread.
</P>
<P>
"Against this background, it is hardly surprising that people
sometimes express the hope that the Reserve Bank will take action
to stimulate economic growth by printing money. Some think that as
a former cabinet minister my appointment heralds the start of a
cheap money era in the bank. Quite simply, they are wrong.
</P>
<P>
"Our view has been, and will continue to be, that it is not our
role to provide an artificial stimulus for the economy. The role
of the bank is to create a climate of financial stability in which
economic growth and wealth creation will be sustainable; an
environment in which an economic boom will not be followed by an
inevitable bust."
</P>
<P>
On monetary policy frameworks, Mboweni commented: "Some central
banks have adopted currency boards to fix their exchange rates,
while others follow exchange rate targeting or inflation
targeting. We have to design our approach bearing in mind our
experiences and history, but also taking into account what is
international best practice which has delivered financial
stability and acceptable levels of inflation."
</P>
<P>
Stals expressed confidence in Mboweni.
</P>
<P>
"Looking ahead, I can only express my regrets that I were not
10 years younger. Exciting times lie ahead for the central bankers
of the world as the process of the integration of financial
markets around the globe will continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, I leave the South African Reserve Bank in great peace
of mind because I am confident that Tito Mboweni and the team with
him in the Bank have the ability, the determination and the will
to steer South Africa successfully into this brave new world,"
Stals added.

<HEADLINE> Insiders Criticize Falun Gong Sect (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- With the official ban on Falun
Gong on July 22, officials with the sect have discarded the Falun
Gong and came to recognize the true nature and motives of this
illegal organization.
</P>
<P>
Duan Rongxin, a former head of the Falun Gong general training
center in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei province,
exposed the sect as an anti-governmental organization under
absolute control of Li Hongzhi, founder of the Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
"Li Hongzhi has advocated truthfulness, benevolence and
tolerance among his followers, actually he was only using these
banners to disguise his ulterior political motives," said Duan,
who has broken away from the Falun Gong sect and discarded the
Falun Gong practice since the government ban on the sect.
</P>
<P>
Duan, a 39-year-old official with a real estate company, was
appointed by Li Hongzhi in 1994 as the head of the general
training center in Shijiazhuang, and was responsible for operation
of four subordinate centers in the province.
</P>
<P>
Duan said the seemingly loosely controlled Falun Gong sect is
actually a highly-organized sect under absolute control of the
supreme leader Li Hongzhi, who sends his orders through the
Research Society of Falun Dafa to the general training centers,
thereby to subordinate branches.
</P>
<P>
"Any Falun Gong official who did not follow Li Hongzhi's orders
was immediately dismissed and widely condemned inside the
organization," Duan said.

postpone her visit to the Middle East due to the impasse in the

LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Nigerian newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express:
</P>
<P>
-- Oyo State Governor Alhaji Lam Adesina raised an alarm in

of faceless Nigerians" to destabilize the government of President
Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Li Hongzhi had incited his followers to the opposite side of
the government in a step-by-step manner, Duan continued to say, Li
took advantage of the followers' wish to achieve success in
practicing Falun Gong and instigated the anti-governmental
sentiments by fabricating rumors.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the great harms that Falun Gong could do, Duan told
Xinhua: "As an insider of the Falun Gong sect, I hope all victims
of Falun Gong could realize their errors, firmly discard the
practice of Falun Gong, give up those illusions fabricated by Li
Hongzhi, and return to the reality as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Another Falun Gong official Wang Zuowu exposed the sect as an
illegal organization with political motives which was designed to
stir up social unrest.
</P>
<P>
Wang was the former head of the general training center in
Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi province. "The Falun Gong
is a highly-organized sect in spite of its claim of being an
organization of Falun Gong practitioner on a voluntary basis,"
Wang said, "the leadership of the Taiyuan general training center,
for example, has gone through restructuring and reinforcement
three times since 1996 under orders from the Research Society of
Falun Dafa."
</P>
<P>
Wang himself was also criticized once for not devoting himself
into the Falun Gong and replaced by a deputy head.
</P>
<P>
As for the liaison of the Falun Gong organization, Wang said
the General training centers are under the direct control of the
Research Society of Falun Dafa and postal services were first used
for handing out brochures from Li Hongzhi and the emergence of
Internet further facilitated the liaison work.

<HEADLINE> Positive Signs Rise in S. Leone Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- S. Leone's former military junta
chief Major General Johnny Koromah said Saturday that he had
ordered his supporters to free the about 30 hostages held in the
hills some 60 kilometers east of the country's capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Koromah said in a British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) interview
Saturday that "I told them to make sure they release them today
without any precondition. They've accepted that they are going to
release them including the Children" , who were abducted earlier.
</P>
<P>
The BBC said Koromah, the leader of the Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council, was now in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The leader said he had told the rebels taking the hostages
that, contrary to their belief, he was not being held prisoner by
the Foday Sankoh-led Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel group.
</P>
<P>
His release had been one of the hostage takers's key demands.
</P>
<P>
"I am not a prisoner at all. I am a free man," Koromah said in
the radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary United Front has also denied holding Koromah
Saturday, saying that it has been working closely with the Armed
forces Revolutionary Council, an old ally of it.
</P>
<P>
Koromah said he would try to meet Sankoh to prove to his own
rebels that he was a free man, and hopefully trigger the hostages'
release.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh said in Freetown Saturday that the kidnapping was an
"isolated" incident that did not signal a broader split in the
rebels' alliance.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the U.N. and the west Africa peace-keeping
force ECOMOG officials of carelessly provoking the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said they had failed to contact senior rebel officials
before sending the delegation into rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapping took place Wednesday when an international group
 including U.N officials, ECOMOG soldiers, Sierra Leonean
officials, and journalists met with soldiers loyal to Koromah to
receive about 150 women and children captured during the war.
</P>
<P>
The junta soldiers freed several captives Thursday, including
two U.N. officials, a Reuters reporter and an clergy man,
requiring them to convey their demands for food, medicine, and the
release of their leader among others.
</P>
<P>
Koromah, a former military officer, launched a coup and fought
himself to the Head of State in 1997 and allied itself with the
Sankoh's rebels, which has been fighting successive governments
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
But 10 month latter, he was flushed out by the Nigeria-led
ECOMOG and the unseated President Tejan Kabbah was reinstated.
</P>
<P>
Despite Sankoh's constant calling of Koromah as the "number two
man" in the rebel alliance, it is widely believed that Koromah and
his men might feel sidelined by a July 7 peace agreement signed in
Togolese capital Lome by Sankoh and Sierra Leonean President
Kabbah.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Accuses Iran of Retaining Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
on Sunday accused Iran of retaining thousands of Iraqi prisoners
of war (POWs) and refusing to register some of them at the Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
Saddam uttered the accusation in a nationally televised speech
marking the 11th anniversary of the end of the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran
war.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq released all Iranian POWs a short time after ceasefire,
except one POW who was later set free. Iran, up to now, has
retained thousands of Iraqi POWs," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Saddam also accused Iran of torturing, mistreating and
murdering Iraqi POWs.
</P>
<P>
"Our heroes of POWs have received and are still receiving
various kinds of torture and pressure, many a time they have been
murdered inside the captivity cages," he said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has been an outstanding obstacle that stands
in the way of normalizing ties between the two former foes which
fought a bitter eight-year war in which nearly 1 million people
were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Saddam also slammed the U.S. and its allies for
adopting destructive approach toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Some have dogfought against Baghdad with hatred and envy and
have employed forces, some of which are backward, for
destruction, while others have used their accumulation of malice
and narrow, greedy interests to portray to the backward that
their destructive approach is right," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saddam lashed out at the materialism adopted "by the west under
the leadership of U.S.A. in the Middle East region and perhaps in
other places."

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Destroy Drug Farms by Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
considering using chemicals to clear the bhang plantations in
Mount Kenya in central part of this east African country.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jackobam, head of the Kenya Anti-Narcotics Unit, said
here Saturday that his unit is working with Kenya Wildlife
Service, the Defense Department and the relevant ministries to
conduct aerial surveys in the forest and launch the program.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Nation newspaper quoted Jackobam as saying that
although the exercise would be expensive, the unit had enough
resources to wipe out the plant in two months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop on drug and drug-related offenses
organized by the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association,
Jackobam said that lack of information and cooperation from
civilians had hampered effective operation of his unit and
appealed to all Kenyans, together with the police, to deal with
the issues of drugs.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants that his unit planned to set up
additional stations in the country, particularly in the Mount
Kenya region and the Moi Airport in Eldoret in western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the police in Kenya's Eastern Province discovered
more than 1, 500 acres of land are under bhang plantation in Mount
Kenya forest as police are intensifying operation to rid the
forest of drug farms.
</P>
<P>
According to the Criminal Investigations Department, the Kenyan
police recently seized 44 tons of bhang and arrested 27 suspects
of illegal drug peddling in separate cases.

<HEADLINE> Africa Can Learn from Uganda in HIV/AIDS Control: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has said the HIV/AIDS epidemic can be overcome in Africa
judging by the success achieved in HIV/AIDS control programs in
Uganda, Zimbabwe's Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO regional office for Africa in Harare, the
Ugandan experience "gives hope and relief that, at last, the
HIV/AIDS epidemic that is causing so much havoc, distress and
misery among families and communities on our continent can be
controlled and successfully kept in check and altogether avoided."
</P>
<P>
The regional office said a Ugandan report revealed that the
decline in HIV infection was particularly noticeable among young
persons of both sexes whose ages ranged from 15 to 19 years.
</P>
<P>
The decline was even more significant in teenage girls and
young women of between 15 and 19 years. For example, in 1992, 17
percent of sexually active teenage girls were found to be HIV
positive. This rate fell to seven percent in 1995 and currently
stood at six percent as at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan report indicated that similar declines had also
been recorded in persons attending clinics for the care of
sexually transmitted diseases (STD). In this group, nearly 50
percent were HIV positive in 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, only 29 percent of those seen at the clinics in 1998
were found to have HIV infection in combination with their other
STDs.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this development in Harare last week, WHO
regional director for Africa Ebrahim Samba said, "The success
being achieved in Uganda should serve as an encouragement and
stimulus to all the national authorities on our continent to
intensify their commitment to and support for the HIV/AIDS
prevention and care programs which exist in every country under
the supervision and coordination of the national AIDS control
programs."
</P>
<P>
Samba said that a number of lessons could be learnt from the
success of the Uganda HIV/AIDS control program.
</P>
<P>
"The first lesson is that successful HIV/AIDS control programs
begin with national commitment at the highest level, with
openness, shared confidentiality and favorable laws and policies
to encourage people to be open about the disease, seek help and to
protect them from discrimination and victimization," said the WHO
official.
</P>
<P>
The second lesson is that aggressive and sustained HIV/AIDS
information and education programs paid dividends, Samba said.
</P>
<P>
"Information and education programs should be targeted at the
general public, high risk groups, but particularly at the young
people, in primary and secondary schools, street kids, farm hands
and all others," he added.
</P>
<P>
The third lesson is that HIV/AIDS prevention was and should be
the concern of all persons and all sectors of the society, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Above all," Samba noted, "the Ugandan experience demonstrates
that we can turn the tide against the HIV/AIDS scourge,
particularly among the young people, thereby making it possible
for us to save our future."

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S.Youth "Root Seeking Tour" Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony to mark the beginning
of the '99 Chinese-American Youth "Root Seeking Tour" was held
here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 Chinese American kids from the state of
California of the United States will tour such historic cities as
Beijing, shanghai and Xi'an and participate in the activities of
cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Beijing, the kids will tour the Great Wall
and the Palace Museum, and attend the ceremony of raising the
Chinese national flag at the Tian'anmen Square in the heart of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Root Seeking Tour is sponsored by the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Office of the State Council with the help of two U.S.
Chinese language schools to mark the 50th anniversary of the
founding of New China and the forthcoming Macao's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The tour is also designed to improve the kids' understanding of
Chinese history, geography and culture, and their ability to use
Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Weichao, deputy director of the State Council office,
said that this tour not only will help these kids to learn more
about their ancestors and today's China, but also will further the
mutual understanding between the people of China and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"Though you kids have learned something about your ancestors,
China is still unfamiliar to you," Zhang said, adding that "you'll
found that everyone here is your compatriot."
</P>
<P>
The leader of the tour Chiu ling said that traveling is as
helpful as reading, and she hoped the kids will find the national
sentiment, realize their responsibilities and find their roots
here through the tour.
</P>
<P>
Wu You and Huang Maoguo, the representatives of the kids, said
that they value this opportunity very much and will plant the root
of China into their hearts.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jialu, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, attended the ceremony.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai stock market
resumed the rally since May 19 after weeks of correction,
triggered by a series of favorable government policies and
increasing trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics from the Shanghai Stock Exchange showed
the composite index closed at 1,646.59 Friday, a rise of 2.82
percent over the previous week. Of the 452 Class-A shares on the

Qingdao Beer became the most traded stock with more than 90
percent of the shares changing hands during the week, while Huazi
Industry led all stocks in price gains.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the main reason behind the market rally

measures to support the market, which include a circular from the
China Securities Regulatory Commission calling for better forms of
initial public offering of stocks, and a central bank announcement
to allow securities brokerages to enter the inter-bank money
market and bond buyback market for more financing.

overseas investors, lost 3.98 percent to 45.64 points in the week.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and Israel have set up a
friendship association to foster relationship between the two
countries, Zambian Sunday Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The association is spearheaded by the Zambians who have studied
in Israel and the Israelis at the Center for International
Cooperation in the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Lusaka Mayor Patricia Nawa as saying Saturday
at the launch of the Shalom Club here that the formation of the
association will help cement the friendship which already exists
between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
"The formation of this club is a very important ingredient
between the Zambian government and the State of Israel," said the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
She said the establishment of the Shalom Club was also
important because it would help the returning students to
integrate their skills into national development programs for the
benefit of the Zambian community.
</P>
<P>
The association will also help facilitate and organize local
courses in various disciplines by inviting Israeli experts to come
and lecture.
</P>
<P>
"The initiative of organizing and facilitating local courses
will go a long way as this will increase the number of trainees
while at the same time reducing the costs of travel, lodging and
tuition," Nawa said.
</P>
<P>
She said it was important to promote technical, cultural and
economic cooperation between the two countries through training as
this was vital for a country like Zambia.

LUSAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A one-million-U.S.-dollar project
to transform and extend the business district in Lusaka is to be
launched soon and several foreign engineering consultancy firms
are ready to carry out its feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
The new Lusaka integrated development plan, which is aimed at
improving the physical, social, economical and institutional
welfare of Lusaka residents and attract investors, will be
financed by the World Bank through the zambian Ministry of Local
Government and Housing.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Sunday Mail newspaper quoted Director of the Lusaka
City Council Timothy Hakuyu as saying that the council's
projection for the next millennium was to transform and extend the
capital's central business district through a plot ration concept.
</P>
<P>
The program involves upgrading roads, land services, medical
facilities and housing. It will also help in attracting
investment and in the creation of more jobs.
</P>
<P>
It will cover a 10-year period with emphasis on the efficient
and equitable incorporation of existing settlement patterns into
the council's physical structure.
</P>
<P>
Hakuyu said the plan also encourages the expansion of the
district through construction of more multi-storey buildings.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Lusaka's master plan of structural development
has not been revised since 1978 due to financial limitations.

NEW DELHI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The country's annual inflation
rate continued its free fall and dropped to a record low of 1.19
percent for the week ended July 24, the Reserve Bank of India said

percent (provisional) from 1.62 percent (provisional) the week

The sharp fall in inflation is mainly on account of a higher
base last year due to higher prices of food articles, especially
vegetables.

<HEADLINE> Venus Williams Topples Davenport at TIG Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- For one day, Lindsay Davenport
was second-best in California and to Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
Williams temporarily put an end to Davenport's recent
dominance in her home state and stopped a personal five-match
losing streak against her with a 6-4, 7-5 victory in the
semifinals of the 520,000 U.S. dollars TIG Tennis Classic in San
Diego, California.
</P>
<P>
"It's annoying to keep losing to the same player over and over
again for no particular reason," Williams said. "I knew at some
point that had to change."
</P>
<P>
Davenport, the top seed and defending champion, suffered only
her second loss in her last 20 minutes in California, having swept
all three summer hardcourt events in her home state last year.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take anything from how Williams played today,
" Davenport said. "I was a little off and she was better."
</P>
<P>
Seeded fourth, Williams will seek a WTA Tour-leading fifth
title of the year on Sunday. She will face the winner of Saturday'
s second semifinal between second seed Martina Hingis of
Switzerland and seventh seed Amanda Coetzer of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Less than a week after the two met in the final of the Bank of
the West Classic, Davenport and Williams engaged in an ugly battle
that featured a combined eight service breaks, five by Williams.
</P>
<P>
The reigning Wimbledon champion, Davenport fell to 35-6 this
season and lost for only the fourth time in 24 hardcourt matches
this season. She will try to win her second straight U.S. Open
later this summer.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the 1997 champion, defeated Belgium's Dominique Van
Roost, 6-2, 6-4, on Thursday to secure a semifinal berth. Coetzer
advanced to the semifinals on Friday with a victory over unseeded
American Amy Frazier.

TIANJIN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- North China's Tianjin
Municipality has become a hot attraction to overseas tourists, and
their arrivals increased a year-on-year five percent to 128,000

<P>
OTTAWA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia beat
Andre Agassi on Saturday in 63 minutes to reach the final of the 2.
45 million-dollar Canadian Open in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Russian, who won the Australian Open in
January and held the world number one ranking for six weeks
earlier this year, routed second-seeded American 6-1, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov's precision was in stark contract to Agassi's error-
prone play, especially in the opening set, which Kafelnikov
finished off in 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, winner of this title in 1992, 1994 and 1995, pulled
himself together somewhat in the second set, but it was too late
to stop Kafelnikov, who stretched his career edge over Agassi to 4-
2.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, who could jump as many as two places from his
current number four in the world, will next face Sweden's Thomas
Johansson, who rallied from a one-set deficit to overcome ninth
seed Nicolas Kiefer of Germany 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 in the other semi-
final.

<P>
Gun Nagamati, an adviser to the company, was quoted on Sunday
by Bangkok Post as saying that representatives from the company
will travel to Laos on Tuesday to hold talks with the Lao
government and agencies concerned about the suspension of the
project.
</P>
<P>
According to Gun, a study by the firm found the current
situation was not good for investment in the railway project, as
demand for train services was 40 percent below earlier estimates.
</P>
<P>
The firm and its foreign partners have agreed to put the
project on hold, Gun said.
</P>
<P>
"The railway project is not self supporting. It has to rely
heavily on other projects such as industrial estate, tourism and
hotel projects," Gun said.
</P>
<P>
"With the figures from our study, financial institutes may not
grant loans if we go ahead with the project," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Transportation Company was granted a concession by the
Lao government last year to build a 14 km railway line from
Vientiane across the Mekong river on the Thai-Lao friendship
bridge to the northeastern gateway province of Nong Khai in

<HEADLINE> Venezuela: No Evidence of Airliner Hijacked by Colombian Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government said
Saturday it has no concrete evidence to say that the Colombian
guerrillas hijacked the Venezuelan airliner that disappeared last
week.
</P>
<P>
The twin-motor Beechcraft light plane, owned by the Avior
Venezuelan airline with the YV 466 C license plate, lost contact
with the control tower when it was flying with 16 persons abroad
between the city of Barinas and the Guasdalito border community in
the southwest of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan press reported that the Colombian army broadcast
on Friday night a dialogue between Jorge Briceno, chief of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and his brother
German, which suggests the plane was diverted to that country.
</P>
<P>
It is presumed that the aircraft would be in the Colombian
department of Arauca near the border with Venezuela, and that the
passengers could have been taken Friday to a demilitarized jungle
zone in southeast of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Avior Vice President Jorge Anez said Friday in an interview
with the Venezuelan TV network, Globovision, that his firm will go
on searching for the plane and that he expects to have official
news in 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
An Avior aircraft was hijacked in 1998 on the same Barinas
route and used in clandestine flights by drug cartels.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Starts Hand-over Proceedings on Suspected War Criminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Croatia has begun the legal
proceedings which will lead to the hand-over of a former senior
Croatian officer wanted by the International War Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia, Justice Minister Zvonimir Separovic
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Separovic, quoted by the Croatian State Television, said that
the hand-over of Vinko Martinovic and other war suspects was a
complicated legal issue since the charges against them raised by
the country's judicial authorities and the criminal tribunal were
not totally the same.
</P>
<P>
Martinovic, a Bosnian Croat, was one of the two top war
criminal suspects sought by the tribunal in The Hague set up by
the United Nations after the five-year Bosnian war in the early
1990s. Martinovic was charged with ethnic cleansing during the war,
and the tribunal late last year demanded Croatia hand over him.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation with the tribunal is a precondition set by the West
for Croatia to gain membership of the European Union and NATO.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Sue Argentina For Trade Restriction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazil confirmed Saturday that
it will sue Argentina before the World Trade Organization (WTO),
after the failure of the Mercosur foreign and economy ministers to
settle their trade disagreements.
</P>
<P>
"The talks will move now to the WTO," Brazilian Foreign
Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia returned Friday from Montevideo where he attended a
two-day emergency meeting of the foreign and economy ministers
from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Common Market Council of Ministers members ended
the meeting without any concrete results, but agreed to let the
discrepancies to be discussed by the recently created Follow-up
Commission and the Macroeconomic Coordination Commission.
</P>
<P>
Trade relations between the countries have deteriorated since
January's devaluation of Brazil's currency.
</P>
<P>
To defend its industries against a flood of cheap imports,
Argentina recently slapped restrictions on several Brazilian goods,
and demanded that Brasilia indemnify its partners for the damage
caused by the devaluation of its currency.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan admitted that the
safeguard imposed by Argentina to the Brazilian textiles has a
legal base in the WTO agreements, but explained that Brazil does
not agree with the measure and also has legal bases to demand its
elimination.
</P>
<P>
These discrepancies among the Mercosur countries are considered
as the most serious since the creation of the regional trade
grouping. They weaken the main South American trade bloc when it
is preparing to negotiate free trade agreements with the European
Union (EU) and the other countries of America.
</P>
<P>
Trade within Mercosur countries reached 15 billion dollars in
1998. But Argentina's exports, almost all of which go to Brazil,
fell 27 percent in the first five months this year.

Seville world championships later this month despite winning the
200 meters at the Night of Hechtel athletics meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Perec, 200 and 400 winner in Atlanta, clocked 23.45 seconds in
only her third race in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
"I'm making slow progress but I don't want to run 200 meters at
the world championships if I run 23.5," said Perec. She said she
had still not qualified for the 400m and could not do so before
Tuesday's deadline for Seville qualifying.
</P>
<P>
"So the world championships, I will have to drop them, I'll
just have to run races and try to get back at a decent level
before the end of the season and see for next year," she said.
</P>
<P>
Perec, who has recovered from viral mononucleosis that hit her
in 1997, recorded 23.65 in Lahti, Finland, and 23.57 in Malmo,
Sweden, this week.

<HEADLINE> Logging Ban Stimulates China's Timber Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The logging ban since last year
in parts of China has prompted a big rise of timber imports to
China, but timber importers are now facing an oversupply on the
Chinese market and lower prices, the China Daily Business Weekly
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year, five million cubic
meters of timer were imported, compared with 6 million cubic
meters last year. The amount of imports was a result of
overestimate of a projected timber shortage, the report quoted
Zhang Shiwei, deputy director of the National Timber Trade Market,
the biggest such market in China, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government implemented a logging ban in its
natural (non-cultured) forests last year in upper reaches of the
Yangtze and Yellow rivers. Many industry insiders predicted
domestic timber production would be reduced by 12-15 million cubic
meters or by one-fourth of the annual market supply.
</P>
<P>
They also expected market demand this year to continue to grow
as the nation works to stimulate the economy by investing heavily
in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
However, the domestic production of timber for commercial uses
has only dropped by about 2 million cubic meters, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
That was because forests in northeastern forests, which
account for the biggest share of market supply, can still be
logged. And to avoid a timber shortage, the government has reduced
tariffs on timber imports and has cut wood product tariffs to zero.
It allowed many more firms to import timber than before the
logging ban.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, imports of timber have soared and imported
timber varieties have also multiplied. Imports came mainly from
southeast Asia, Russia, Europe, Africa and the south Pacific.
</P>
<P>
As stockpiles grow, timber buyers are getting picky and the
prices of timber are sliding. On average, prices have fallen by 5
percent to 10 percent, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Prices of precious timber varieties, whose use and sales are
limited, in particular, have plunged by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Timber imports will mainly focus on precious varieties and
those with large diameters," said Kou Wenzheng, director general
of the forestry resources administration department of the State
Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
He said domestic demand will be met mainly by relying on
cultured forests, by increasing timber-use efficiency and by
developing wood supplements.

OTTAWA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's Thomas Johansson advanced
to the final of the Candadian Open in Montreal on Saturday by
beating Germany's Nicolas Kiefer 4-6, 6-1, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Johansson, seeded 11th, will play the winner of the second
semifinal between second-seeded Andre Agassi of the United States
and second-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia.
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals, Johansson came in fresh following an early
match the day before, while Kiefer was still recovering from a
late-night, three-set victory over top-seeded Patrick Rafter of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Kiefer held service to open the second set, but then lost nine
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
The German's first serve deserted him and he was no match for
Johansson, a dogged baseline player in the Swedish tradition, in
the long rallies on his second serve.

<HEADLINE> China's Grain Exports Plunge 41 Percent in 1st Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China's grain exports fell by 41
percent in the first six months of this year, the China Daily
Business Weekly reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the January-June period, exports of agricultural
products hit 6.17 billion U.S. dollars, down 2.5 percent from the
same period a year ago. The imports amounted to 3.83 billion U.S.
dollars, up 3.6 percent, with a trade surplus of 2.34 billion U.S.
dollars, the report quoted the figures from the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Among agricultural products, grain exports hit 2.33 million
tons, down 41 percent, while its imports reached 2.94 million tons,
down 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country sold 1.03 million tons of rice abroad, down 15.5
percent on a year-on-year basis. It imported 87,000 tons of rice,
down 34 percent. Corn exports reached 1.01 million tons, down 58
percent; and corn imports hit 20,000 tons, down 73 percent from
the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's information center, China became a
net exporter of rice this year. But, in terms of agricultural
products as a whole, it is a net importer of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
China's imports of agricultural products were mainly wheat and
soybeans used to supplement domestic supplies of high quality
corps during the first six months, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"China will keep on importing high quality grains from abroad
to supplement domestic supplies. The move can also help strengthen
the sense of competitiveness of Chinese farmers and grain-
producing enterprises," the report quoted the ministry's experts
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's center said that during the first six months of
this year, rapeseed imports were 587,000 tons, showing a year-on-
year increase of 420,000 tons, thus aggravating an oversupply of
the crop on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The information center said that during the first six months
this year exports of Chinese agricultural products to its
traditional markets in Europe and Asia decreased by 21 percent
and 1.1 percent from the same period last year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
But, agricultural exports to the African market gained an eye-
catching increase of 78 percent from last year, the center said.

<HEADLINE> UN Mission in E. Timor Might Pull Out if Security Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The UN Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) might pull out if security conditions deteriorate in the
run-up to the autonomy ballot scheduled for August 30, its leader
said Saturday in Dili, capital of East Timor, reports reaching
here Sunday from Dili said.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas,
UNAMET Chief Ian Martin said further talks to coordinate security
measures in the tense region would be held next week in Jakarta,
capita of Indonesia, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, Indonesia, and Portugal -- East Timor's
former colonial ruler -- will take part in the talks, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"I told Alatas that if... East Timor is in a dangerous
situation, then the UN mission will have a plan to evacuate its
staff," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
The warning came a day after voter registration for the ballot
in most areas in East Timor ended. UN officials said voter rolls
could top 450,000, exceeding their most optimistic projections.
</P>
<P>
The plebiscite will allow East Timor's 800,000 inhabitants to
choose whether they want to become a self-governing entity within
Indonesia. If the proposal is rejected, Indonesia has said, it
would grant full independence to East Timor which was integrated
into Indonesia in 1976 and become the country's 27th province.
</P>
<P>
However, sporadic violence colored the run-up to the ballot
with the last incident revealed on Friday by UNAMET spokesman
Yusuhiro Ueki. He said a UNAMET official was slightly wounded by a
chunk of concrete when some 20 pro-integration militias attacked a
house in Ainaro regency on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday at 2:30 p.m. a registration post at the state
Batugade high school was attacked by at least 50 militiamen. Two
other registration posts in the vicinity immediately closed.
</P>
<P>
Alatas, who was accompanied by six ministers including Defense
Minister Wiranto and Coordinating Minister for Political and
Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung, arrived in Dili Saturday for a
one-day visit to discuss various issues on the autonomy ballot.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said Saturday in Dili that the presence of the UNAMET to
help conduct a poll on the territory's political future did not
mean Indonesia's diplomacy in international fora had become
stagnant.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, Indonesia had been trying to find a solution
to the question of East Timor since 1983 through dialogue with
Portugal under the supervision of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Alatas expressed the hope that there would be no further delays
in the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
The vote on whether the people of East Timor will remain part
of Indonesia with wide-ranging autonomy or be a separate state was
originally scheduled for August 8 but was later delayed for two
weeks following a spate of violence and attacks on UNAMET
personnel. Lastly it was delayed again until August 30.

<HEADLINE> Pastrana: Inte'l Commission Indispensable for Colombia Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana said Saturday it was indispensable to create an
international verification commission to monitor the talks between
the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC), the biggest guerrilla group in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks at the ceremony commemorating
the 180th anniversary of the Boyaca Battle, a symbol of freedom of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
He said that peace without guaranties was no peace at all and
that negotiations without them were only a sterile and
irresponsible exercise.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana insisted that only when such a verifying mechanism is
established should the government and the FARC be able to start
the negotiation process that has been postponed on two occasions,
which has caused much concern to the Colombians.
</P>
<P>
High Commissioner for Peace Victor G. Ricardo and Raul Reyes,
one of the FARC spokesmen, will hold a two-day meeting starting
next Monday in San Vicente del Caguan to elaborate the creation of
the commission.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana, who completed one year of his mandate on the same day,
reviewed in his speech in homage to the heroes who died in
fightings his efforts made against all adversities in seeking
peace in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope in achieving peace in his country though he
admitted "the road to peace" is strewn with thorns.

<HEADLINE> First Argentines Visiting Malvinas Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The first group of
Argentines, most of them journalists, left Saturday for the
Malvinas Islands after travel by Argentines to the islands was
permitted last month.
</P>
<P>
The group left the Chilean capital of Santiago aboard Chilean
airline Lanchile Flight 991 and will arrive at Mount Pleasant
airport in the Malvinas within several hours, reports reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
The flight was the first after the Chilean government agreed to
resume flights from the continent to the disputed archipelago,
which had been suspended since last March by Chile in retaliation
for the detention of its lifetime Senator Augusto Pinochet in
London. Chile is the only South American country which agrees to
open flights to the Malvinas.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Foreign minister Guido di Tella and his British
counterpart, Robin Cook, signed an agreement on July 14 permitting
Argentines to travel to those islands, for which the two countries
fought a war in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Argentines were permitted to travel to the islands only on
humanity grounds, such as relatives of soldiers killed in the war
and those with double nationality.

LHASA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The State-owned advertising
companies in China's financial and commemrical center, Shangahi,
are lagging far behind their private and overseas-funded
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, State-owned advertising firms
saw their combined revenues drop 34 million yuan, or about 3
percent, from the same period last year, according to the city's

Overseas-funded advertising firms on the other hand saw
revenues rise 9 percent and private firms saw revenues go up 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
The city has about 2,300 advertising firms, employing over 30,
000 people. Combined income from the advertising sector stood at
about 4 billion yuan.
</P>

Analysts agree that the State sector's sluggish performance is

<HEADLINE> On-line Ads Destined for Rosy Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Fueled by an increasing number of
the Internet users, on-line advertising is expected to have a
glorious future in China, reported today's China Daily's weekend
edition, Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
"Although on-line advertising appeared in China only four years
ago, it has great market potential," said Li Fangwu, director of
the information center of the China Advertising Association (CAA).
</P>
<P>
CAA reports indicate China's Internet advertising was valued at
20 million yuan (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Li said this can be mainly attributed to the increasing
popularity of the Internet on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Sources from China National Network Information Center (CNNIC)
indicate that by the end of 1998, there were 2.1 million Internet
surfers in China, twice the figure in 1997.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, the figure has increased to four
million.
</P>
<P>
"The advent of on-line advertising has enriched the variety of
advertising forms along with television, radio, newspapers,
magazines," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 1980s, most customers preferred to
advertise in major central governmental newspapers because of
their large circulation and identifiable reader groups.
</P>
<P>
"However, as the market gradually matured, many businessmen
choose to advertise in places where they felt they would have a
greater market potential for their products," said Li.
</P>
<P>
He said that compared with other forms of advertising such as
TV ads and newspaper ads, Internet advertising has many advantages
and huge possibilities.
</P>
<P>
On-line advertising is more effective, he said, with well-
designed three-dimensional pictures and bountiful relevant
information.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Internet advertising can provide precise feedback
for advertising enterprises, because computers may be used to
easily record a web surfer's search patterns.
</P>
<P>
"However, compared with developed countries, on-line
advertising in China is still in its infancy," Li said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, sales of global on-line advertising were two billion U.
S. dollars, 100 percent more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In many developed countries, such as the United States,
Internet advertising is earning more than three billion U.S.
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to clearly define Internet advertising in China
because many enterprises are using the Internet to introduce
themselves and their products. Controversy remains whether this
should be regarded as advertising.
</P>
<P>
At present, Internet ads in China are mainly banners and icons.
</P>
<P>
Problems affecting the industry include a lack of unified
standards for billing for Internet advertising, he added.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts believe it would be a good idea to form
authoritative advertising companies specializing in offering
customers Internet advertising services.
</P>
<P>
"Given the rapid development of China's Internet and the
sustainable economy, market potential is huge and overwhelming,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from within the circle predict that by the end of 1999,
China will have more than five million Internet surfers, and the
figure is expected to surpass ten million by 2000.

</P>
<P>
They said that they heard a high noise of the brakes and a bang
of collision.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Central, Western Economies Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China's central and western
regions, known as resource suppliers to the country's fast-paced
eastern economic boomtowns, have accelerated reforms to readjust
their development strategy and draw more investment for
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
The regions, covering 86 percent of the country's territory and
boasting 58 percent of the population, have abundant energy and
raw material resources, as well as cheap labor. But their
economies have lagged far behind that of the eastern region.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has been encouraging tighter mutually-
beneficial cooperation between the eastern and the western areas,
which has already provided chances for more cross-province mergers
combining the advantages of both areas.
</P>
<P>
Hu Angang, a noted economist with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that it is high time for the fast-growing eastern
area to take on the role of invigorating the economy in the
central and eastern areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the mid-western region has laid solid foundations
for the development of the tobacco, alcoholic, electronics,
machinery, energy and chemical industries, and the region is also
a big market.
</P>
<P>
"Multinationals can not afford to overlook the big market in
China's western region," said P.Y. Lai, president of Motorola (
China) Electronics Ltd, when he visited Chengdu, capital of
Sichuan Province, last month.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications giant plans to consolidate its position
in the western part of China by investing 100 million U.S. dollars
to set up an electrical parts and components plant in the Chengdu
High and New Technology Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
The region has benefited greatly from the country's new wave of
infrastructure construction, with 62 percent of China's increased
infrastructure budget allocated for the region last year,
according to sources at the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
However, State financing alone is far from enough to ease the
thirst for funds needed to speed up infrastructure construction.
As a result, the central government has helped the region to work
out a list of priority projects, ranging from communications
facilities, agriculture and water conservation to the energy and
environmental protection industries to attract investment from the
eastern areas as well as overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The region's Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan provinces, the Guangxi
Zhuang and Tibet autonomous regions, and Chongqing Municipality
used 20.9 billion yuan of such investment last year, up 65 percent
on the year-to-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The vitalized economy has stimulated the development of State-
owned enterprises. In the first five months of this year, large
and medium-sized enterprises in Guangxi began making profits,
after being in the red for three years.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Nicaraguans Evacuated for Fear of Volcano Eruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Six villagers were injured and
more than 2,000 others evacuated when Nicaragua's Cerro Negro
volcano rumbled their villages last weekend, the local press
reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Two strong tremors occurred early morning Friday and Saturday,
destroying 14 houses and damaging 50 others in Port Momotombo and
Miralagos Comarca town.
</P>
<P>
Peasants who live near Momotombo told Managua radio stations
that they heard rumbling from the volcano before the quakes, which
they thought was a new episode of activities of the Cerro Negro
volcano, 108 kilometers from Managua.
</P>
<P>
However, experts at the Nicaraguan Territorial Studies
Institute denied that there was any new activity in the volcano
and said that equipment located on the volcano slopes did not
register anything abnormal.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture and Forestry Ministry sources warned that some 10,
000 hectares planted with sesame, soybeans, peanuts and corn could
be damaged and 8,500 heads of cattle affected if the volcano spews
tons of volcano ash.

<P>
HOHHOT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The effort to increase exports in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is yielding results,
with exports rising 11 percent to 420 million U.S. dollars during
the first six months of this year, according to local official
sources.
</P>
<P>
Much of the increase came from increased barter trade, which

</P>
<P>
The region's foreign trade turnover was 665 million U.S.
dollars, a year-on-year increase of over 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
To give a lift to exports, the regional government has offered
tax rebates to exporters, given private enterprises export
licenses, and encouraged more enterprises to engage in border
trade.
</P>
<P>
Export controls have also been decentralized for greater
efficiency, and pillar industries, whose exports account for
almost half the region's total, have been given priority by the
regional government.
</P>
<P>
A strategy to tap into new markets was also adopted, and
exports to new markets in North America grew as much as 56 percent,
and those to Latin America by 88 percent during the January-June
period.

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry Flourishes in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Livestock raising is flourishing
in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as a total of
26.1 million head of livestock have been raised this year, an
increase of 1.09 million over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Regional officials said this record output was a hard-won
success, given the damage to pasture land and the spreading of
epidemic diseases among the livestock as a result of last year's
catastrophic flooding.
</P>
<P>
This sector received a strong boost when the regional
government adopted the strategy of focusing on raising
thoroughbred animals, which now account for more than 70 percent
of the total.
</P>
<P>
Improving infrastructure in the grassland also laid a solid
foundation for developing animal husbandry, and usable grassland
for livestock farming is nearing ten million hectares at present,
and continues to increase at an annual rate of two million
hectares.

<HEADLINE> Dominican Calls for Sympathy for Disgraced High Jumper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The human aspect should
be taken into account when dealing with the doping incident, Jose
Joaquin Puello, president of the 14th Pan Am Games Organization
Committee said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference which was meant to showcase Santo Domingo
of the Dominican Republic, the city to host the next Pan American
Games in four years, Puello went out of his way to comment on the
doping incident invovling a Dominican athlete who had won the
women's high jump gold medal before testing positive at the
Winnipeg Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old high jumper Juana Rosario Arrendel was stripped
of the Pan Am gold medal four days ago after she tested positive
for steroid.
</P>
<P>
"Athletes are not machines. They are human beings, and every
human makes mistake, " Puello said.
</P>
<P>
"The importance is not to avoid making mistakes, but to
acknowledge that you made mistakes."
</P>
<P>
Puello went on emotionally appealing the world athletics
governing body, International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF),
to be merciful when considering sanctioning Arrendel, who was
called by him as "an athlete who yet to reach her summit".
</P>
<P>
"Juana should be allowed to continue her athletic life, " he
said." She is a great athlete, a great woman, completely clean in
every aspect of her life."
</P>
<P>
The media also has an important role to play, he said, they
should protect her instead of crucifying her.
</P>
<P>
Arrendel took what was called "Ben substance" to post a
personal best jump of 1.93 meters to grab the country's sole gold
medal since the beginning of the Games.
</P>
<P>
"It is painful to see such a young athlete make such a big
mistake," Dr. Eduardo de Rose, chairman of the PASO Medican
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the substance Ben Johnson has taken. It's exetremely
important for us to know where she got it."
</P>
<P>
Stonozolol, which was found in Arrendel's urine sample, is an
anabolic steroid to increase power in speed, especially in the
competitions of high jump and 100-meter race.

<HEADLINE> Next Pan Am Games to Be Slimmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The 14th Pan Am Games,
which will take place in four years in Santo Domingo, the
Dominican Republic, will be slimmer.
</P>
<P>
"We have to do some of reduction. We have to reduce the amount
of sports, " Jose Joaquin Puello, president of the Santo Domingo
Games Organization Committee said at a news conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He made sure that every sport that has been included in the
Summer Olympics will be staged in Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
"But we're also considering some of the most popular sports in
the South America," he said."The total will be no more than 28-30
sports."
</P>
<P>
But the final word belonged to the Pan American Sports
Organization (PASO), the governing body of the American regional
sports.
</P>
<P>
The organization committee are enthusiastic that the official
responsibility of hosting the next Pan Am Games will be handed to
them in Sunday night's closing ceremonies, Puello said. But it's
also a "great challenge of the new millennium, because we are a
small country".
</P>
<P>
The "excellent athletes village" and "excellent sports venues",
however, will be for sure, Puello promised, saying the budget of
the Games will be 105 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
And there will be no problem in lodging, because the country
is a well-known tourism paradise, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the Winnipeg Games approaches its finale, the Pan Am Games
officials began to do a little bit of soul searching to look at
both sides of what had been called as "the best ever organized
Games" by the PASO president Mario Vazquez Rana.
</P>
<P>
Some suggest the Games are too big, too long and they might be
too expensive.
</P>
<P>
And that's also exactly what the president of the 13th Pan Am
Games, Don MacKenzie says he's going to recommend.
</P>
<P>
"When we meet in Mexico City on September 16 for our
debriefing, I'm going to recommend that the size of the Games be
reduced from 42 sports to maybe 28 or 30," said the man who
brought the 13th Games to Winnipeg.

<HEADLINE> Women Sports Make Big Strides at Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, weightlifter Wanda Rijo would not have been in
the Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
Not because she wasn't strong enough, or talented enough, but
because she's a woman, and women's weightlifting was the
equivalent of men's synchronized swimming -- it didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
Last night, Rijo lifted 220 kilograms of steel above her head,
alongside the men who have been doing it for years, to award the
Dominican Republic its first gold in the Games.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1995 Pan Am Games in Argentina, women's participation
in the Games has skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
In Mar Del Plata, only 29 women's teams were entered, compared
with 68 men's team.
</P>
<P>
This year, 47 women's teams competed, while the men's
contingent has only grown by one team -- the roller hockey event.
</P>
<P>
On any given day at these Games, spectators have been able to
watch women competing in tough sports such as water polo, team
handball and basketball.
</P>
<P>
But fans also enjoyed more stereo typically feminine pursuits
such as synchronized swimming and rhythmic gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the fans have been watching in droves.
</P>
<P>
The women's softball tournament has attracted more fans than
the men's tournament and crowds for women's water polo were equal
to those watching the men compete.
</P>
<P>
Women's volleyball, basketball and team handball have also been
big draws.
</P>
<P>
Softball made its Olympic debut to great fanfare in Atlanta and
next year, women will compete, along with the men, in water polo
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
But popular culture still has a hard time recognizing women as
serious athletes.
</P>
<P>
Strong, aggressive women are considered "unfeminine" in some
cultures.
</P>
<P>
But at least, as far as the 13th Pan Am Games are concerned,
the situation is improving.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Develop Gigantic Grape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Grape experts in east China's
Zhejiang Province have developed a kind of grape as large as a
table-tennis ball.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Wenbin, head of the Wujiang Grape Research Institute in
Jinhua City of Zhejiang Province, claimed that each grape weighs
between 22 g and 25 g on average and a bunch of them weighs over 2.
5 kg.
</P>
<P>
He said the new variety of grape was developed from a kind of
grape introduced from Japan to northeast China's Liaoning Province
by grafting a dozen times over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Jiang Wenbin applied to the Guinness Book of Records
Office in Shanghai to register a grape that he had grown as the
biggest in the world. The grape weighed 36 g and its diameter was
3.85 cm. His claim was recognized later.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Italians on Summer Vacation, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 7 (Xinhua) -- As the peak of the holiday season
approaches, a survey has found that fewer Italians are going on
vacation this summer, and many have still not made up their minds.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by the Italian national hotel
association Federalberghi, found that 23 million Italians will be
staying at home this year compared to 20 million last summer.
</P>
<P>
It said 6 percent are still undecided, in spite of the upcoming
August 15 national holiday, when many Italian cities will grind to
a virtual halt.
</P>
<P>
Milan will be one of the most deserted spots during the holiday
weekend, with only 38 percent of inhabitants opting to stay home,
according to the newspaper of Osservatorio di Milano.
</P>
<P>
However, tight finances, especially in the south, will keep
more than 58 percent of city dwellers at home across the country.
</P>
<P>
Federalberghi's president, Alberto Sangregorio, said the latest
figures were worrying, and noted that the summer had also seen a
drop in the number of German tourists, Italy's largest group of
foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
According to the Osservatorio di Milano, fewer Italians are
taking traditional month - long summer holidays and many more are
opting instead to take a 10-day break some time between June and
September.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vows to Hunt Down Embassy Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States vowed on
Saturday at the anniversary of its embassy bombings that it would
continue to hunt down and capture the masterminds behind the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
"Today we vow that America will not be intimidated. We will not
retreat from the world. We will not rest until every one of those
responsible for the embassy bombings has been brought to justice,"
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said at a gathering that
marked the the anniversary of the bombings.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were blown up by car bombs
on August 7, 1998, killing 226 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read by National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
at the ceremony, President Bill Clinton said the victims
represented "everything that is right about our country and the
world."
</P>
<P>
The State Department recently warned all 265 embassies and
consulates around the world to pay particular attention to
security in the run-up to the anniversary out of fear of possible
copycat strikes, and warned all citizens worldwide to stay
vigilant about their personal security.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday announced 120 million U.S. dollars in grants intended to
put higher education within young people's reach.
</P>
<P>
"Now is not the time to turn our backs on our children's
future," Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we've come, we know, still, there is much to do --
for too many children, especially in economically distressed
communities, aren't getting the chance to reach their highest
potential," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he will ask the Republican-controlled Congress to
double the financial commitment to the program "so that we can
reach more of our children than ever."
</P>
<P>
He said he wants to build on current efforts to encourage
national teaching standards and to increase scholarship funds for
tuition tax credits.
</P>
<P>
Because of these efforts, Clinton said, more young people have
the chance to make the most of their abilities and take their
places in the high-tech world of the 21st century.
