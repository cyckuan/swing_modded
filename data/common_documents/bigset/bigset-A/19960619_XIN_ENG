<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Talk with Democratic Party Members on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leaders today held talks
with democratic party officials on issues of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the democratic parties, who have made an inspection
of the provinces and cities along the Beijing-Kowloon Railway,
offered advice and suggestions on the construction of the railway,
the development of central China and the revolutionary base areas,
and further development of the special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
They also offered suggestions on narrowing the gap of disparity
between Eastern and Western China and quickening the pace of
development of agriculture by displaying the advantages of the
localities.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
(CPC) Central Committee, spoke at the meeting, welcoming the
suggestions and firm support to the Communist Party and the
central government.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China has drafted its Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) and the long-term objectives to the year of 2010. To
achieve the goal is a historical task of the ruling party and
parties participating in government and political affairs.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that all democratic parties will play an
active role in social stability and make greater contributions to
the country's reform and construction and reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, said at the meeting that it was helpful
for the leaders of democratic parties to inspect the construction
of the country's major projects.
</P>
<P>
It was of great significance for them to participate in the
building of the government and political affairs, said Li who is
also member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of
the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting were Li Peng and Zhu Rongji, members

<HEADLINE> One Policeman Killed, Another Wounded in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- One policeman was killed and
another seriously wounded when unknown gunmen attacked a police
patrol car Monday in Kosovska Mitrovica, a town in Serbia's
southern province of Kosovo and Metohija.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency quoted sources from Kosovska Mitrovica court
as saying today that the unidentified attackers had shot the
police car with four bullets.
</P>
<P>
32-year-old policeman Predrag Djordjevic was killed instantly
and Zoran Vukojevic, 30, was wounded when the patrol car came
under attack. Vukojevic was immediately transferred to the
Pristina surgical clinic and his life is still in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
Traces found on the spot indicate that at least two attackers
had opened fire from an automatic 7.62-mm weapon and a 7.9-mm
weapon, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second attack on police patrols in Kosovo and
Metohija in the past three days. On Sunday evening, policeman
Goran Mitrovic was wounded in an attack from automatic weapon near
Pristina, capital of the province, and he is still at the local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
In Kosovo and Metohija, where 90 percent of the 2 million
population is ethnic Albanians, a strong secessionist movement has
been active for the past few decades, aiming to secede it from
Yugoslavia to join neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
The police is the most frequent target of extremist attacks,
but civilian casualties have also been reported, Tanjug said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Crack Down on Criminal, Economic Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's government, parliament
and supreme court have signed an accord on cooperation in planning
an effective crackdown on criminal and economic offenders,
according to today's newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
The three bodies of state authorities decided on Monday to work
out the crackdown plan within one or two months.
</P>
<P>
Legal, economic and social levers will be resorted to in an
effort to fight organized crime such as drug trafficking and car
theft.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Zhan Videnov, who signed the accord together
with Parliament Speaker Blagovest Sendov and Supreme Court
President Ivan Grigorov, said the government always believes that
economic criminals are the worst offenders of all.
</P>
<P>
Videnov urged the interior ministry, legislature and law
enforcement departments to concert their efforts in the crackdown
campaign.
</P>
<P>
In early June, Interior Minister Nikolai Dobrev appealed to the
parliament to reinstate death penalty to curb rampant felony
offenses.
</P>
<P>
He argued that 88 innocent people fell victim to crimes in the
first quarter of this year, including five policemen who were
killed while trying to stop criminals.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,300 people were killed by criminals in the past five
years during which period a total of one million crimes were
committed, according to interior ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
On the rise in the past few years were crimes such as bomb
blasts, assassinations, kidnappings, rapes and armed robberies.

<P>
CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Economy Nawal
el-Tatawi stressed here today the necessity of increasing the
Egyptian exports to Japan to reduce Egypt's deficit in its trade

</P>
<P>
In an opening address at a seminar on Egypt's industrial

<HEADLINE> Two More Black Churches Burned in U.S. </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Two rural black churches just
four miles apart were destroyed by fire at about the same time,
the latest in a series of blazes that have plagued Southern black
churches over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Arson was suspected in the Monday night fires at the empty
churches in the small town of Kossuth in Mississippi, the
Associated Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fires at Mount Pleasant and Central Grove Baptist Church
came the same day as flames destroyed a rural black church in
Rocky Point, North Carolina, and heavily damaged a former
sanctuary of a mostly white congregation in Georgia. All four
fires were being investigated as arson.
</P>
<P>
In Kossuth, Alcorn County Sheriff Jimmy Taylor ordered patrols
for every other rural black church in the county.
</P>
<P>
Taylor described the fires as "extremely suspicious" because of
the timing and proximity of the churches.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and FBI
were joining in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Mount Pleasant was the larger of the two churches. It housed a
109-year-old congregation of about 125 members.

<HEADLINE> US Carrier to Remain Permanently in East Asia Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States is planning
to keep its Japan-based aircraft carrier permanently in East Asia
waters and cancel its annual training deployment to Middle East
ports.
</P>
<P>
The plan, coming after a U.S.-Japan summit last April in Tokyo
on security ties of the two countries, shows yet another sign that
the U.S. is determined to increase its naval presence in the East
Asia against the so-called "volatile" situation in the region, the
Washington Times today quoted military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UUS Independence, berthed in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, has
made an annual "show the flag" and training voyage to Middle East
waters since 1991, leaving out of the East Asian region for weeks
each year.
</P>
<P>
However, this year's cruise to the Middle East has been
canceled and there are no plans to resume it in the coming years,
the Washington Times quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said East Asia was "strategically volatile at
present that it could not risk having the carrier out of the area
in case a crisis erupted."
</P>
<P>
Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported Sunday that the U.S. Navy
command in Yokosuka had said the change was to have the carrier
increase the navy's presence in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese Navy command spokesman told Kyodo Sunday that the
new policy "allows the UUS Independence to contribute additional
U.S. naval presence in this important part of the world and react
more quickly to situations before they become a crisis."

<HEADLINE> ECE Ponders Convention to Challenge Environmental Secrecy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Members of the UN Economic
Commission for Europe (ECE) and non-governmental organizations
started here this week to negotiate a new convention intended to
increase public access to environmental information and
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of access to information is one of the fundamental
obstacles to solving Europe's many environmental problems," said
Jeremy Wates of the European Environmental Bureau, a coalition of
environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) which are
fully participating in drafting the convention along with
government representatives.
</P>
<P>
"Polluters like to operate under a veil of secrecy. Once the
veil is lifted, they are forced to clean up their act. This is why
the new convention is so important," Wates told a news conference
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing Chernobyl accident as an example, he noted that human
lives could be put at risk due to the failure of public
authorities to inform the public about environmental risks. "In
such cases, it is vital that all information should be provided
immediately so that precautions can be taken," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Apart from public information, the convention is also intended
to promote public participation in environmental decision-making
with a view to improve the quality of decisions taken, and
increase the level of support for those decisions.
</P>
<P>
According to Wates, the convention could also include
provisions to allow citizens to have the right to file a law suit
against polluters and also against authorities if they do not
perform their law-enforcing duties.
</P>
<P>
It is envisaged that the convention would be open for signature
in 1998 and could apply to the ECE's 55 member states which
include the whole of Europe, the United States, Canada and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Forms New Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Benjamin Netanyahu today presented his new coalition government
list to the Knesset (parliament), and pledged to negotiate peace
with neighboring Arab countries without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The government, which is scheduled to convene Wednesday for the
first time, does not include David Levy, who was widely expected
to become foreign minister, and the right-wing hardliner Ariel
Sharon, a former defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who had worked hard to form a coalition in the last
two weeks, takes three portfolios of religious, housing and
foreign affairs, beside the premiership.
</P>
<P>
In his speech before presenting the government list, Netanyahu
called on Arab neighbors to hold direct talks with his government,
saying he hopes to lead the Middle East toward an area of peace.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel would improve its relations with
Egypt, Jordan and other Arab countries, and also would develop
its relations with the U.S. and the European countries.
</P>
<P>
He urged Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi, Saudi Arabian King Fahd and other Arab leaders to
hold talks with Israel without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
"We will not dictate our approaches to you, and you will not
dictate yours to me," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
The new premier also called on the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) to talk with his government "on the basis of
preserving security."
</P>
<P>
"We will develop a true partnership of peace and good
neighborly relations and cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu vowed that he would make no compromise on
security in any negotiations, and would give the Israeli security
forces a free hand in striking against terrorists, including
inside the Palestinian self-rule areas when necessary.
</P>
<P>
He went further to say that the Jewish settlements will be
encouraged in Galilee, the West Bank and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Prime Minister Shimon Peres also spoke at today's
session of the Knesset, noting that international agreements must
be observed and the Israeli army should redeploy from the West
Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset is holding a debate on the new government list and
its policy guidelines at this hour, and is scheduled to vote and
approve the new coalition government later today.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, KEDO Sign Transportation, Communications protocols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led Korean Peninsula
Energy Development Organization (KEDO) and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) have reached an agreement on protocols
for transportation and communication related to building two
light-water reactors in DPRK, a spokesman for the KEDO said today.
</P>
<P>
The accord was the result of the talks between DPRK and KEDO
which began on April 16 in New York, consortium spokesman Jason
Shaplen told reporters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The deal was part of a nuclear framework agreement between
Washington and Pyongyang on freezing DPRK's current nuclear
development program in exchange for two light-water reactors
provided by the United States. The light-water reactors are
considered to be less suitable for producing plutonium for nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
In May, KEDO, which represents the U.S., Japanese and South
Korean governments, and DPRK reached agreement on the text of a
protocol on the juridical status, privileges, immunities and
consular protection for KEDO in DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Shaplen disclosed that the protocols on the transportation and
communications of KEDO in DPRK had been initialed and would be
signed "in the near future."
</P>
<P>
The agreement on protocols is believed to a sign of the smooth
implementation of the nuclear framework agreement signed in 1994
after nearly three years of difficult negotiations between the
U.S. and DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Missing Refugee Ship Returns to Monrovia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A freighter carrying some 450
Liberian and other African refugees returned to Monrovia, Liberia
today after adrifting at sea for three weeks looking for a country
to accept them, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The Zolotitsa, which had earlier been reported missing for
several days, anchored at noon at the Monrovian port. Officials
from the Red Cross and other aid agencies were assisting the
exhausted passengers aboard.
</P>
<P>
Relatives and friends of the passengers rushed to the port on
hearing their return, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Without permission from port authorities, the
Russian-registered Zolotitsa left Liberia on May 26 to escape
fighting in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The ship was refused entry by several neighboring countries
when it tried to dock at ports of those nations earlier this
month, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian authorities had repeatedly refused to give
permission to the refugees to disembark and forced the vessel to
leave its territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Ghana has said it didn't want to become a dumping ground for
Liberian refugees. The 6 and 1/2 year war in the Western African
country has already driven hundreds of thousands of Liberians into
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The ship received 25,000 liters of drinking water, some fuel
and food during its last stay in Lome, Togo, on June 3.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said here today that Egypt is ready for the Arab Summit to be held
here on June 21-23.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the largest gathering of Arab leaders since the
1991 Gulf war, is expected to draw 21 of the Arab League's 22
members. Iraq has not been invited to participate.
</P>
<P>
Apparently in an attempt to dispel the concern that some
countries would not send their heads of state to the summit,
Moussa said that the level of Arab leaders' participation is "good
and reassuring." But he said that the number and level of
participants will be finally decided Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that a final statement, which includes
the decisions of Arab leaders, will be issued at the end of the
Cairo summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit is not intended to examine bilateral issues but
aimed at closing Arab ranks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit also aims to forge a unified Arab stance to support
the Middle East peace process based on the principle of swapping
land for peace, according to Arab officials.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the foreign ministers of the Arab countries
attending the summit will meet to finalize the summit's agenda.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's rubber production
reached 11,000 tons in the first five months this year, up 37.5
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Cambodian Rubber Department Teng Lao attributed
the increase to labor reforms and ideal weather conditions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the "Cambodia Daily" today said the rubber revenues
are not increasing at the same rate because of illegal exports to
Vietnam and theft of latex by local residents.
</P>
<P>
About five million U.S. dollars of the government's 1995 rubber
revenues were reinvested in the sector while another one million
earmarked for tax.
</P>
<P>
In order to further improve rubber production, the newspaper
said, at least three of all the six state-run rubber plantations
will be sold to companies from France, Malaysia and
Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Urge Ban on Killing of Small Whales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Animal charities are demanding a
halt to hunting small whales, dolphins and porpoises as well as
the trade in their meat, as the International Whaling Commission
held its annual meeting in Britain, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists pointed out that thousands of small whales,
dolphins and porpoises are being killed because of lax rules and
flagrant breaches of international agreements, according to The
Times.
</P>
<P>
Allan Thornton, chairman of the London-based Environmental
Investigation Agency, said that the worldwide ban on commercial
whaling, which covers the 12 large species, should be extended to
68 smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
Protectionists also called on the commission to introduce
tougher controls on fisheries, including a crackdown on illegal
Irish driftnetting which, it is claimed, can kill up to 50
Atlantic white-sided dolphins in a single trawl.
</P>
<P>
Driftnets, large versions of which were banned by the United
Nations in 1992, continue to claim the lives of thousands of small
whales, dolphins and porpoises around the world.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of international treaties, some fishing fleets,
including those operating in the Mediterranean and the Pacific,
are still using giant nets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of harbor porpoises continue to be killed
in British and Irish waters, caught in gill nets set to catch hake
on the Celtic Shelf, southwest of the British Isles.
</P>
<P>
Conservationists are also alarmed that successful agreements in
the eastern Pacific, designed to reduce the deaths of dolphins
from tuna boats, may be relaxed.

ALMA ATA, Kazakhstan, June 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Samsung
Company today signed an agreement to purchase 40 percent of the
shares of a Kazakh state-owned copper company.
</P>
<P>
Samsung is to invest one billion U.S. dollars within a period

</P>

The South Korean company will also pay 300 million dollars in
debt for the Kazakh company.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister Garri Shtoik signed the agreement
on behalf of his government.
</P>
<P>
In late 1994, Kazakhstan decided to allow foreigners to invest
in large-scale state enterprises and participate in the operation
and administration of loss-making state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
So far, upwards of 50 state enterprises have been partly bought
by foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Dublin to Keep Links with Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government decided today
not to sever its relationship with Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), following last Saturday's
Manchester bombing, according to a BBC TV report today.
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour special cabinet meeting on relations with Sinn
Fein after the suspected IRA bombing in Manchester, it was agreed
that some lines of communication had to remain open in the
interests of peace.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government said in a statement that "the door is to
be left open" to allow Sinn Fein time to press the IRA to restore
its broken 17-month ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
But it still wants a straight answer from Sinn Fein on whether
or not it supports the IRA campaign of violence. The Irish
government is reportedly fells Sinn Fein is the most realistic
means of securing peace.
</P>
<P>
A car bomb exploded in the city center of the northern English
city of Manchester last Saturday, injuring a total of over 200
people and four of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton was quoted on Sunday as saying
that "we are having to review very seriously and fundamentally our
relationship with Sinn Fein and the Republican Movement as a whole
in the light of what has happened".

<HEADLINE> UNHCR: 6.7 Million Refugees in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Tuesday reported that there were
6.7 million refugees, 1.9 million Internally displaced persons in
Africa as of January 1995, among nearly 12 million people of
concern to it on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the people of concern to UNHCR number over 27
million.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the UN refugee agency provided material assistance to
some 17.6 million people worldwide, 8.9 million of them in Africa
-- the biggest group of aid recipients.
</P>
<P>
Africa committed itself to opening its doors to refugees on
June 20,1974. Zaire is now the largest asylum country of refugees
in Africa as home of some 1.5 million refugees as of May, 1.08
million of them Rwandans. It is followed by Guinea, hosting
650,000 refugees and Tanzania, 626,000.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda is the African country producing most refugees -- some
1.7 million by May, followed by Liberia, 750,000 and Somalia,
446,000.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNHCR report, most of refugees in Africa are
those people who fled ethnic hostility or internal conflicts to
neighbouring countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, UNHCR completed the repatriation of 1.7 million
Mozambican refugees from six countries, the largest it has ever
undertaken in Africa.
</P>
<P>
While the refugee problems of Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia, Sierra
Leone and Sudan remains major concerns to it, UNHCR is now helping
refugees from Togo, Mali, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia return
home.
</P>
<P>
It is also planning to begin in this year the repatriation of
some 324,000 Angolan refugees in 36 countries, 200,000 of which in
Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Strengthens Crackdown on Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss cabinet on Monday
approved a draft law to strengthen the crackdown on money
laundering, requiring all financial managers to report suspicious
transactions, local press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would expand the current regulations, which
oblige only banks to report, to all money managers including life
insurers, stock brokers and business lawyers. They are required to
report their suspicions to an ad hoc information centre to be
established by the federal police authorities, which will then take
up investigation.
</P>
<P>
The law would also allow suspicious assets to be frozen pending
an investigation.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger said the new move would
enhance the image of Switzerland as an international financial
centre because it has adopted an international practice to combat
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
However, officials with the Swiss National Bank argued that the
new legislation is too strict. It could undermine the secret
banking tradition of Switzerland and thus undermining its
attraction.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Reiterates Call for Revival of Arab Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz reiterated here today his country's call for a "revival of
the Arab unity to the maximum," underlining that an inter-Arab
situation of "division and rivalry" should not continue.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his travel to Cairo to attend Arab foreign
ministers meetings Wednesday, Boueiz said that a continuity of
the hardline logic of Israel's Likud Party would inevitably lead
the Middle East peace process to a "clear and definite collapse."
</P>
<P>
The meetings of Arab foreign ministers are aimed at preparing
for an Arab summit, which is to be held in the Egyptian capital
Friday with an expected participation by heads of state or their
representatives from all Arab countries except Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in his office, Bouiz pointed
out that the Likud Party's logic was based on four "Noes,"
that is to say, no return of the Golan Heights, no negotiations
on the status of Jerusalem, no return of the West Bank, and no
establishment of the Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"If this logic continues, the peace process will certainly
face a clear and definite collapse," the Lebanese foreign
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to revive a unity of the Arab rank to
the maximum after the split caused by the (1990-91) Gulf
War," the Lebanese minister said, "and it is necessary for
Israel's friends and supporters to know that their support is
not just and fair, and will...inflict damage upon someone's
interests"
</P>
<P>
He believed that the Arab summit would send a "clear
message" that a continuity of harmony in the region depends
on a continuity of the peace process, and a stop of the
peace process and a change of the principles of the 1991
Madrid peace conference would cause "an Arab spasm."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz emphasized that the Arab summit is "basically" held to
discuss the Arab cause generally in light of the election of
Binyamin Netanyahu, leader of the hardline Likud Party, as next
Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"The attempts by some Arab countries to get their own
problems and their problems with other Arab countries included
in the summit will obstruct the summit and separate it from
its essential and basical topics," the Lebanese foreign minister
added.

<HEADLINE> Husseini Criticizes Natanyahu for Attempting to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Faisal Husseini, Palestinian
official in charge of the Jerusalem affairs, said that by making
statements about the closing of the Orient House in Jerusalem,
Israeli Prime Minister-elect Benyamin Natanyahu is simply trying
to turn the wheel of peace backward.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in today's Tunisian daily Al Chorouq,
Husseini pointed out that the aim of the closing is not the act in
itself but to suspend activities which are taking place in the
Orient House, PLO's representative office in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said such an act is "unacceptable" because Orient House is
the banner of the Oslo agreements, and also is the symbol of a
sustained peace process between the Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Netanyahu's intransigence might lead to economic
losses to Israel whether by the closure of the routes it had
opened with some Arab states, or on account of international
community's reactions to Israel should Netanyahu maintain his
strong positions.
</P>
<P>
Husseini underlined that Natanyahu has to respect the peace
agreements signed between Israel and Palestinians. Otherwise, he
said, the Palestinians will deal with the Israeli armed forces by
the legitimate rules of warfare imposed by an occupation army
against the rightful owners of the land.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming Arab summit in Cairo, Husseini
said that the Palestinians are expecting a clear political
attitude on the issue of Jerusalem and the Palestine cause in
general. He expressed hope that the two points would be given top
priority on the summit agenda so that the Arab message to
Natanyahu and others would be both clear and strong.

<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 39 million condoms were
distributed in Zimbabwe in 1995 to reduce the incidence of Sexually
Transmitted Diseases (STDS), says the National Aids Coordination
Program (NACP).
</P>
<P>
This is a considerable increase from 25.6 million condoms
distributed the previous year, said the NACP in its latest annual
report released on Tuesday. Zimbabwse has a population of about 10.5
million people.
</P>
<P>
''The control of Sexually Transmitted Diseases is a major
intervention for the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV virus
that causes the incurable AIDS,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
''Although more than 39 million pieces of condoms were distributed
throughout the year, sexually transmitted diseases remained a serious
public health problem,'' says the report.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, more than a million people are believed to be
infected with the HIV virus, an estimated 300 are said to be dying
every week due to IDS-related diseases.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said today that Israel will face four very difficult years
under (Benyamin) Netanyahu government, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Labor caucus in the Knesset, Peres said that peace
process is not merely subject of a talk, but a process of taking
controversial and very complex decisions. It cannot be carried
out with a couple of speeches and phrases, he added.
</P>
<P>
Later in his speech before the Knesset following prime
minister-elect Netanyahu's address, Peres made a similar point. He
said that the Oslo agreement is an international pact, which must
be observed.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that redeployment from Hebron is on the top of the
agenda at this point as the new government is taking over.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is not embarrassed as he walks together with
PLO leader Yasser Arafat, and pointing to Netanyahu, he declared
that "you will too."
</P>
<P>
Peres, aged 72, also called on all members of the Labor
Party to refrain from mutual recriminations for the election
defeat and work together to achieve unity in the party. He
pledged to contribute to it all he can.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Teachers' Strike Enters Third Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The teachers' strike in
Swaziland entered its third day today after the government and
teacher and civil servant bodies failed to reach agreement in
wage negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Acting Prime Minister Sishayi Nxumalo today told the press in
Mbabane that he had told the Swaziland National Association of
Teachers and the Swaziland Association of Civil Servants the
government could not increase its 9.9 percent wage offer, the
radio of South African Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
To accede to their 18 percent demand would cost the government
an additional 12.5 million u.s. Dollars, Nxumalo said.
</P>
<P>
This could cause large-scale retrenchments of civil servants
if the government adhered to International Monetary Fund (IMF)
recommendations that civil service expenditure not exceed 40
percent of the total budget, said Nxumalo.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF would impose ''harsh structural adjustment''
measures if the government exceeded the 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the alternative was for the government to abandon
important development projects to accommodate teacher and civil
servant wage demands, which it was not prepared to do.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Swaziland National Association of Students
members were expected to gather in the country's four regions
today to discuss disruption to their education caused by the
strike.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants were due to meet tomorrow to discuss joining
the teachers' strike if no wage agreement was reached. enditem

JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Namibia has set up a team to
review the national AIDS program in order to promote the
implementation of the program.

ABU DHABI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- President of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al Nahyan today expressed
welcome to any Arab gatherting aimed at reviving and enhancing
Arab solidarity and consolidating a just and comprehensive peace
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The president made these remarks in his meeting here with Jordanian
Premier and Foreign Minister Abdul Karim al Kabariti, who paid a
brief visit to Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Zayed called for an Arab reconciliation so as to close
Arab ranks to the best interests of the Arab nation. He expressed

dissension, and tackle Arab problems in a true fraternal spirit
and in a serious and effective manner.

<P>
The UAE president also hoped that the Cairo Arab summit would

<HEADLINE> World Grains Production Increases in 1996, IGC Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (xinhua) -- Increased planted acreage and
average Yields will likely lead to production increases in 1996
for grains and oilseeds, according to a special report issued by
IGC (International Grains Council) Grains Conference here today.
</P>
<P>
This coupled with some decrease in consumption would keep
current tight stocks levels stable through next spring, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
However, it pointed out that the propensity for extreme weather
conditions so far in 1996 suggests smaller crops than expected are
a real probability. In this case, significant rationing and higher
prices are in store through mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
World production of wheat in 1996 is forecast at 572 MMT
compared to the 1995 world production of 536 MMT. There is a
greater likelihood for the 1996 estimate to decline rather than
increase due to expected weather related problems in North America
and former Soviet Union spring wheat areas.
</P>
<P>
World production of coarse grains is higher due to expected
increase in America and China corn and former Soviet Union barley.
In 1996 world coarses grain production is forecast at 847 MMT
compared with the estimated production of 785 MMT in 1995,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
World soybean production is forecast to increase slightly in
1996 to 125 MMT from 122 MMT in 1995. While an increase is
expected from South America next season, weather related losses in
northern China and America will keep this years production small,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Lebed to Reorganize Russian Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- General Alexander Lebed, placed
third in the first round of the presidential elections, has
received expanded owners as the new secretary of the Russian
Security Council from President Boris Yeltsin and announced his
intention to reorganize the council's apparatus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference this afternoon, Lebed stressed
that the council's apparatus will ensure control over decisions
regarding personnel issues, and over the structure, functions and
financing of the state and government departments whose heads will
be members of the powerful council.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, 46, was appointed secretary of the Security Council and
the president's national security assistant by Yeltsin this
morning. By this step the Russian president intends to win over
support of Lebed's voters in his favour in the second round of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Lebed said all appointments to the leading positions and
changes in the functions and structure of these departments will
be coordinated with him as the Security Council's secretary.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council's secretary will submit nominees for
representatives of all of the departments included in the council
to the Russian president for approval, Lebed said, adding that
these people will work in the council's apparatus on a permanent
basis but will at the same time retain their positions and powers
within the departments where they work.
</P>
<P>
In his words, all of them will be part of a group of advisers
or a special council under the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The situation analysis center under the council's apparatus
will be resubordinated to this group of advisers, Lebed said,
noting that all analytical groups that are now part of different
commissions, departments and divisions of th council will be
abolished.
</P>
<P>
The new Security Council secretary told reporters that a
unified information and analysis center will be created instead of
them.
</P>
<P>
By all these moves, Lebed clearly intends to enlarge his power
at the post of the Russian Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports here said that Yeltsin would soon approve new
provisions for the Security Council, which would let its secretary
directly influence the military reform and the struggle against
crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Lebed's double appointment, Colonel-General
Eduard Vorobyov, member of the State Duma (lower house of Russian
parliament) Defense Committee, today hailed as wise Yeltsin's
decision to make Lebed responsible for combating crime and
corruption and reforming the armed forces, as these are problems
crucial for Russia.
</P>
<P>
If he shows well in the dual capacity of Security Council
secretary and presidential aide, Lebed's chances to win the 2000
presidential elections will be very high, Vorobyov noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset (parliament)
this evening ratified the list of the new government led by Prime
Minister-elect Benyamin Netanyahu with a vote of 62 for and 50
against.
</P>
<P>
The vote was taken at the Knesset after a three-hour debate
after Netanyahu presented his coalition list of the new government
to the plenum earlier this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu defeated Prime Minister Shimon Peres by a narrow
margin in Israel's first direct prime ministerial election held on
May 29.
</P>
<P>
The government, which is scheduled to convene Wednesday for
the first time, does not include David Levy, who was widely
expected to become foreign minister, and the right-wing hardliner
Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who had worked hard to form a coalition in the last
two weeks, takes three portfolios of religious, housing and
foreign affairs, beside the premiership.
</P>
<P>
The coalition includes the Likud, Shas, the National Religious
Party, United Torah Judaism, Yisrael Ba'aliya, the new immigrant
party, and The Third Way, a new group initiated by hawkish
Laborites.
</P>
<P>
Likud newcomer and former Northern commander of the Israeli
army Yitzhak Mordechai became the defense minister, with the
Finance portfolio went to Dan Meridor, another Likud member.
</P>
<P>
Levy reportedly said that he would not be a member of
the new government without Sharon, who helped to form the
joint-list of Likud, Tzomet and Gesher which eventually
contributed to Netanyahu's victory.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, former defense minister, who wanted to be finance
minister, refused to join the new government, after was offered
the house minister.
</P>
<P>
In his speech before presenting the coalition list, Netanyahu
called on Arab neighbors to hold direct talks with his
government, saying he hopes to lead the Middle East towards an
area of peace.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel would improve its relations with
Egypt, Jordan and other Arab countries, and also would develop
its relations with the U.S. and the European countries.
</P>
<P>
He urged Syrian President Hafez Assad, Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi, Saudi Arabian King Fahd and other Arab leaders
to hold talks with Israel without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
"We will not dictate our approaches to you, and you will not
dictate yours to me," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
The new premier also called on the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) to talk with his government "on the basis of
preserving security."
</P>
<P>
"We will develop a true partnership of peace and good
neighborly relations and cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu vowed that he would make no compromise
on security in any negotiations, and would give the Israeli
security forces a free hand in striking against terrorists,
including inside the Palestinian self-rule areas when necessary.
</P>
<P>
He went further to say that the Jewish settlements will
be encouraged in Galilee, the West Bank and the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Prime Minister Shimon Peres also spoke at today's
session of the Knesset. He said that international agreements
must be observed and the Israeli army should redeploy from the
West Bank town of Hebron.

<HEADLINE> China's Summer Grains Harvest Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- It is estimated that China's summer
grains crops this year will be 2 percent more than that of last
year, a Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech by Zhou Mingchen, President of China
National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp, Zhou
said thanks to the unremitting efforts made by the Chinese
government, China has achieved its grains output targets in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
For example, in 1995 China produced a record crop of 466.6
million tons, of which 101.5 million tons of wheat, 179
million tons of rice, 101 million tons of corn, 14.5 million
tons of soybean and 70.4 million tons of the other sundry
grains and beans.
</P>
<P>
In forecasting China's grains production this year, the
president said, the acreage under grain cultivation in China has
been expanded in 1996. Harvest of summer crops -- mainly wheat --
has already started. It is estimated that the summer grain crops
this year will be 2 percent more than that of last year. All these
facts have provided evidence to show the success of China's
agricultural policies.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said, the Chinese government has always attached great
importance to the fundamental status of agriculture and has drawn
up and implemented series of policies in accordance with China's
own condition to increase grains output, improve distribution
system, encourage agricultural investments, and protect the
initiative of grain growers.
</P>
<P>
Zhou pointed out that  as a country with 22 percent of global
population yet only 7 percent of the total arable land, China has
managed to supply adequate food for her people. However, he also
admitted that the present situation is that China's population is
still on the increase by 17 million per year, while the arable
land has faced the danger of shrinking day by day as the
side-effect of urbanization and industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Facing the above mentioned challenges, Zhou said, the Chinese
government has taken steps to stop this adverse trend. On one
hand, China should, with the support of modern agricultural
technologies, upgrade crop varieties, raise the per unit yield,
construct more water conservancy projects and strengthen the
capability of protection against natural disasters, and at the
same time, reduce the loss of grains during harvesting, processing
and transportation.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China will take an active part in the
international grains trade to dispose of any surplus and
supplement any deficiency for various grains. This kind of import
and export of grains proves to be of great significance to China,
as it greatly stimulates the domestic production and helps to
improve the distribution system in China, he added.
</P>
<P>
In his conclusion, Zhou said that in an effort to become a
member of the World Trade Organization, China now is perfecting its
various laws and regulations to bring them into line with the
international business practice and the trading principles of WTO.
Therefore, in future, international traders can expect that China
will, based on the balance of rights and obligations, conduct its
international business, in grains and all the others alike, in
accordance with the principles set up by the WTO.

to a U.N. spokesman.
</P>

troops by June 17, fulfiling the quota it had pledged before. On
the other hand, the government had completed the quartering of

</P>
<P>
Quartering of troops is considered a key step in the peace
process of Angola, which has been plagued by war and armed
conflicts for three decades.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council established the United Nations Angola
Verification Mission (UNAVEM) in December 1988 to verify the
withdrawal of Cuban troops, which was completed by May 1991.
UNAVEM was entrusted a new mandate, thereafter known as UNAVEM II,
to ensure the participation of the U.N. in verifying the
implementation of the Peace Accords for Angola initialled by the
Angolan government and UNITA on May 1, 1991.
</P>
<P>
UNAVEM III was established on February 8, 1995 for a period of
six months by the Security Council. Its task was to provide good
offices between Angola government and the UNITA, monitor
cease-fire, coordinate humanitarian assistance activities and
supervise presidential elections.

<HEADLINE> Kaczynski Indicted with UNABOM Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A federal grand jury charged
Theodore Kaczynski Tuesday with killing two people and injuring
two others during a 18-year-long spree of bombing terror.
</P>
<P>
The 10-count indictment charged the 54-year-old former math
assistant professor with two bombing deaths in Sacramento,
California, according to new reports.
</P>
<P>
Hugh Scrutton was killed while moving a package bomb left
behind his computer store in 1985. California timber industry
lobbyist Gilbert Murray was killed while opening a package bomb
mailed to his office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kaczynski also was charged with mailing bombs from
Sacramento that injured a geneticist at the University of
California, San Francisco, in June 1993, and Yale University
computer scientist in his office the same week.
</P>
<P>
The indictment said Kaczynski transported an explosive device
with the intent to kill or injure, mailed an explosive device with
that intent and used a destructive device in a crime of violence.
</P>
<P>
He could receive the maximum sentence of death or life
imprisonment if convicted of the transporting and mailing counts,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski is the only suspect in the series of 16 bombings that
killed three people and injured 23. The third fatality occurred in
1994 in New Jersey, and was not mentioned in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
Investigators used the word, UNABOM, because the initial
targets were airlines and university professors.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski was arrested on April 3 at his one-room cabin in
rural Montana and has been held at a Helena, Montana jail on a
single count of possessing bomb parts. He is expected to be
brought to Sacramento by the end of the week for an arraignment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity in First Quarter Revised Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) --The nonfarm productivity in U.S.
was revised down to 2.1 percent at an annual rate from January
through March of this year, the U.S. Labor Department reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the gain in nonfarm productivity was
still the largest since it advanced 2.5 percent in the final three
months of 1993. It reported last month that the initially
estimated productivity in the first three month was 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. productivity had fallen at an 0.8 percent rate in the
October-December quarter and rose just 0.7 percent in all of 1995
following gains of 0.5 percent in 1994 and 0.2 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed little inflation pressure. It said unit
labor costs, typically two-thirds of the price of a product, rose
just 1.2 percent at an annual rate, down from the 2.6 percent pace
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Productivity--defined as output per number of hours worked--is
considered the key to Americans' standard of living. Greater
efficiency means businesses could increase wages without raising
prices since workers are producing more with the same amount of
work.
</P>
<P>
Output shot up 3.1 percent in the first quarter, slower than
the 3.7 percent initial estimate but well above the 0.6 percent
advance in the final three months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Hours worked rose 1 percent, unchanged from the original report
and down from 1.5 percent in the October-December period.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing productivity rose 5.5 percent, slower than the
6.3 percent initially reported but up from 3.7 percent in the
fourth quarter. It was the largest increase since an identical 5.5
percent advance in the second quarter of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Total business productivity, including farming, was up 2.3
percent, down from the 2.8 percent original estimate.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China will provide 5
million Yuan Renmibi (about 600,000 U.S. Dollars) to the Zanzibar
government as part of agreement signed in Zanzibar today on
technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Zanzibar will get technical
guidance from Chinese engineers in operating and maintaining
radio equipment at the Langoni Transmitter House and radio
studio, which were established in 1990 with Chinese assistance.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Tanzanian Minister for Finance
Amina Salim Ali and visiting Chinese Deputy Minister of External
Economic Relations and Trade Lui Shanzai.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, local radio technicians will
receive in house training from Chinese engineers who will be
based in the town of Zanzaibar for two years from September this
year to August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some of the funds will be spent in repairing radio studio at
Dole, West Zanzibar District, and the rest of the money will be
disbursed to other social and economic sectors to be determined
later.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between the two sides began in early June 1964
and China has been assisting Zanzibar in economic sectors
including the construction and initial running of a cigarette
factory, the Mahonda Sugar Factory and a tractor workshop, in
addition to the provision of doctors.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the 13-member Chinese delegation held talks
with the Isles president, Dr. Salmin Amour and Chief Minister
Mohammed Bilal on different occasions.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Origin Countries of refugees
in Africa should address the causes of displacement of people and
find ways for their voluntary repatriation, the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) leader said here today.
</P>
<P>
The message was read at the opening of an arts exhibition
organized by the OAU Secretariat in connection with the Africa
Refugee Day which falls on June 20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim urged African
countries and the international community to make greater efforts
in solving the continental refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
"Only through greater respect of human rights, national
reconciliation, social and economic progress and the
establishment of lasting democratic institutions, can we overcome
the plight of refugees," the secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Vice-minister of Foreign Affairs Tekeda Alemu told
the gathering that this year's theme, "Save the Environment to
Safeguard Asylum", is appropriate as many African countries have
experienced serious environmental damages as a result of hosting
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Despite the gloomy conditions created by the large number of
refugees in Africa, progress has been made over the past few
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which depicts the difficult life of refugees,
will remain open to public during the coming four days.

May 29.
</P>
<P>
A heated debate on the new government formation resulted in
David Levy agreeing to take up the portfolio of foreign
minister. Levy had previously refused to take up the post because
there was no proper portfolio for Ariel Sharon, an extremely
hardline Likud Party veteran.

<HEADLINE> US to Remain Reliable Grains Supplier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific region has become
the most dynamic economic region of the world, and it has been and
will be America's top food market, said Eugene Moos,
undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Conference of the International Grains Council,
Moos said the Asia-Pacific region's phenomenal economic growth is
based on export-oriented industrial development. This leads to
high per capita income growth throughout the region. Asia is also
a part of the world that is making agriculture exporters sit up
and take notice. Agricultural trade there is flourishing.
</P>
<P>
For the United States, the undersecretary said, this region
has been its top food market since the 1980s. Demand is strong
for a diverse range of products, including wheat and coarse
grains, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to U.S grains competitiveness in world markets, he
said agriculture is an increasingly exported-sensitive industry
and one that is very dependent on international markets. America
is a country where the food and agriculture sector relies so
heavily on international trade, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the U.S. agriculture's overall reliance on exports, as
measured in terms of gross cash receipts, excluding government
payments, is estimated at 23 percent and rising to a projected 32
percent by the year 2000. Clearly, America will continue to count
on agriculture trade even more in the future, the undersecretary
added.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. farm policy, Moos said that as great progress is
being made tearing down trade barriers and establishing rules of
fair play for the global trading market, the United States is
reforming its domestic policies to move away from restrictive
government farm programs.
</P>
<P>
The United States is an exporting nation, Moos said. "We know
from our past experience that export restrictions only serve to
undermine our reputation as a reliable supplier and give our
competitors a new advantage in the competitive global market."
</P>
<P>
"As we began a new crop year and stand on the threshold of the
21st century, one thing is for sure -- the United States will
remain a reliable supplier of agricultural commodities on the
global trading market," Moos said.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Panel Ends Work on Whitewater Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Whitewater
Committee ended its work today with highly divided conclusions
between the Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said U.S. President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton engaged in no wrongdoing, while majority Republicans
attacked on Mrs. Clinton and several presidential aides.
</P>
<P>
This year-long investigation shows no misconduct or abuse of
power by Clinton and Mrs. Clinton, the Democrats wrote in a
dissenting report. But the Republicans have a different view.
</P>
<P>
The Republican report concludes that Mrs. Clinton had a
"powerful motive" to hide her law firm billing records outlining
her work a decade ago as a private lawyer for the failed Arkansas
savings and loan, which was at the center of the Whitewater
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans suggested Mrs. Clinton may have wanted to
conceal her knowledge of a fraudulent land development south of
Little Rock, Arkansas, called Castle Grande.
</P>
<P>
The billing records had not been turned over to investigators
until early this year, two years after they were first subpoenaed.
The White House said an aide to the first lady found them on a
table in plain view in the White House living quarters.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Clinton has said she recalls very little about Castle
Grande.
</P>
<P>
The White House today dismissed the Republican conclusions as
"nothing new."
</P>
<P>
But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said the Republican
report detailed "a pattern of attempted concealment at the very
minimum" by the White House.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic report accused Republicans of stretching the
evidence to smear Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also sharply disagreed about the accuracy of
several presidential aides' testimony.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans said there was inaccurate and incomplete Senate
testimony by three individuals -- ex-White House counsel Bernard
Nussbaum, Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff Margaret Williams and the
first lady's confidante Susan Thomases.
</P>
<P>
The Republican report alleged the three concealed the first
lady's role in the handling of documents in the late Vincent
Foster's office following his July 1993 death. At the time, Foster
had sensitive documents about both Whitewater and the purge of the
White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
The committee said it would refer the matter to Whitewater
prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
Democrats dismissed the allegations of a coverup as a
"blatantly political game of tag."
</P>
<P>
The Democrats accused their Republican counterparts of making
"irresponsible claims of possible obstruction of justice."
</P>
<P>
The reports wrap up 14 months of investigation and hearings by
the special committee, which examined the Clintons' actions as
Arkansas governor, the Clintons' Arkansas business dealings
including their Whitewater real estate venture and the conduct of
White House aides in monitoring various Whitewater-related
criminal investigations after Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
The hearings, which began on a bipartisan note, dissolved into
a bitter feud during their final weeks as Republicans stepped up
their attacks on Mrs. Clinton while Democrats charged the whole
probe had become an election-year sideshow.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the committee's investigation was put at about 1.4
million dollars.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) will
offer a second macro-financial assistance loan of up to 200
million ECUs (260 million U.S. dollars) to Ukraine, according to
an agreement signed by the two sides today.
</P>
<P>
This agreement confirms the disbursement of the first portion
of the balance of payments support agreed by the European Council
last October.
</P>
<P>
It comes after the first macro-financial loan of 85 million
ECUs (about 110 million dollars) in 1995 with an aim to support
the efforts for establishing a market economy in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, the present loan will be provided in two
portions of 100 million ECUs. In view of the economic situation in
Ukraine, a first disbursement of 50 million ECUs under the first
portion is foreseen early in July.
</P>
<P>
The funds for the loan will be raised through a loan managed by
the EC and repayable in 10 years.

<HEADLINE> New Ties Between Gov't And People In Pearl River Delta (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua)-- To ordinary people the image of
the 'Party' and the government is the officials of the towns and
villages they meet every day.
</P>
<P>
Along with the economic prosperity in the Pearl River Delta,
people there are no longer satisfied with the stereotyped model
official who is just simple and honest.
</P>
<P>
"They should also be capable and pioneering, so that we can
make more money," a young worker in a township enterprise said.
</P>
<P>
"The prosperity of an area depends largely on the quality of
the officials," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I don't really care whether they ride a luxurious car, or go
abroad with public funds. I do care whether they are capable of
managing an enterprise efficiently," said the worker, who
declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
In the past year in Dongguan City, 136 heads of rural
communities have been removed from office, 51 of them not for
making mistakes, but just for not making any achievements. And 23
successful private entrepreneurs were elected as heads in their
communities.
</P>
<P>
Cities and counties in the Delta have also set up an award
system for their officials to keep them away from possible
corruption. The hope is it will make them concentrate on their
work and not to run household enterprises at the same time.

<HEADLINE> Quake City Set For International Symposium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China is to host an
international symposium on seismology to commemorate the 20th
anniversary of the disastrous Tangshan earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, sponsored by China's State Seismology Bureau,
will be held from July 31 to August 4 in Tangshan City, North
China's Hebei Province, where a massive quake killed hundreds of
thousands of people and destroyed nearly all the houses 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 domestic and world seismologists will attend the
symposium and make an on-the-spot investigation of the ruins in
Tangshan caused by the earthquake. The conference will also take a
journey to the center of the earth - by discussing the physics of
the earth's crust and core.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s China has hosted more than 30 international
seminars and discussions on seismology, said Professor Chen Yong,
an academician from the Engineering Academy of China.
</P>
<P>
At least one thousand experts and scholars in this field from
over 60 countries throughout the world visited China and held
discussions with their Chinese counterparts on issues of
earthquake predicting and relief work, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said studies on earthquake prediction in the populous
continental areas by Chinese scientists have attracted world
attention.
</P>
<P>
The exchange and co-operation in seismological studies with
foreign scholars has helped promote a global development of
seismology and provided opportunities for young Chinese
seismologists to display their talents. enditem

<HEADLINE> Canada May Identify Sperm Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is planning
to reform the country's secretive sperm-donation system so that
children produced from donor sperm will be able to learn the
identity of their biological fathers.
</P>
<P>
This change was proposed in the secondary regulatory phase of
the government's new reproductive-technologies legislation, which
was introduced last week.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will ban 13 practices, including the sale of
sperm or eggs and commercial contracts for surrogate mothers.
</P>
<P>
The exact timing of the second phase is still unclear yet, and
the federal government has promised to consult with the public and
the provinces, according to today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The second phase includes a stringent system of
record-keeping. It plans to establish a donor-offspring registry,
which for the first time will keep track of those who donate
sperm, and any children that result.
</P>
<P>
The registry will include non-identifying information on the
donor, such as medical and social history, ethnic origin and
education.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand donor-inseminated children are born every year
in Canada. The government is under pressure from the parents of
these children to move toward a completely open system of
information sharing.
</P>
<P>
Under this system, offspring could find out the identity of
their biological fathers when they reach the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
However, the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies,
which urged the government to enact strict legislation on
legislation, did not recommend a completely open sperm-donor
system, saying that Canadians are not ready for such a radical
change at this time.

<HEADLINE> New Ties Between Gov't And People In Pearl River Delta (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua)-- Nobody will deny the fact the
"cooperative, cordial and trustful" relations between the
government and the people in the Pearl River Delta are based on
the rich accumulation of collective wealth.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Rural Affairs Office of
Guangdong Province, rural Guangdong has accumulated a total of 170
billion yuan, and the Pearl River Delta alone has at least 100
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
It is also inevitable that along with the snowballing of the
collective funds, graft, embezzlement and waste with the officials
takes place from time to time.
</P>
<P>
What people hope for most is to set up a democratic financing
system, and to turn the "dark safe" for keeping collective wealth
into a transparent one.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to worry about the kinds of rampant collecting
of fees as our counterparts in other provinces, but we also have
our own worries," one farmer said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a severe test for the officials to remain clean before
large amounts of money, especially when the supervision is still
not perfect," he added.
</P>
<P>
To meet the requirements of the people, and also to strengthen
self-control, governments in the Delta have stipulated that all
major spending should be decided collectively.
</P>
<P>
No individual, no matter what his title is, can make decisions
alone.
</P>
<P>
People are mostly concerned about like topics such as the
income of officials, and personnel arrangements.
</P>
<P>
And people also have the right to take part in deciding each
investment and spending. The farmers usually select three to five
educated people as their representatives, either to check
accounts, to participate in the decision-making, or simply to
communicate to them what is going on within the government.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, US to Resume Export Control Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and the United states have
announced the resumption of bilateral talks on export control
policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made Tuesday in Washington after a
meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and
visiting Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides, according
to a Cyprus news agency report from Washington today.

U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the dialogue
will enhance bilateral customs cooperation, including legal and
regulatory structures, licensing procedures and enforcement
issues.

It will also apply strict controls on transfers of
conventional weapons and dual-use goods and technologies, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco, Alcohol, Drug Cost Canada $13.5 Billion Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse
cost Canada more than 13.5 billion U.S. dollars a year, 2.7
percent of its gross domestic product, said a report of a study
released today.
</P>
<P>
That works out 473 dollars for every Canadian, according to the
study conducted by the Canadian Center on Substance Abuse.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco inflicts the greatest cost on society, an estimated 7
billion dollars or 248 dollars per person, while alcohol accounts
for more than 5.4 billion dollars in cost, or 193 dollars per
person. The costs of illicit drugs are valued 1 billion dollars,
or 35 dollars per person.
</P>
<P>
Yet, "the actual number is probably higher and could be
significantly higher," notes the study.
</P>
<P>
The per capita costs are highest in the province of Nova Scotia
and lowest in Newfoundland, it says.

<HEADLINE> China to Set up New Health Care System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- More employees in Beijing are in
favor of a medical insurance system, which can pay most of the
medical expenses for treating serious diseases.
</P>
<P>
"People are willing to pay part of the insurance fee while most
of the insurance fund is collected from their enterprises," said
Wang Jianlun, Chinese Vice Minister od Labor.
</P>
<P>
Reforms, which focused on setting up social medical insurance
funds and personal medical accounts, were first carried out in
Zhenjiang and Jiujiang, two medium-sized cities in east China's
Jiangsu and Jiangxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 cities across the country are now undergoing the
same reform, after the good results witnessed in the two pilot
cities.
</P>
<P>
In Zhenjiang City, enterprises put five percent of their
employee's wage bill into the social medical insurance system, and
another five percent into individual medical accounts. Employees
put one percent of their salary into their personal medical
accounts.
</P>
<P>
The employees pay their medical expenses first from their
personal accounts. When the money in the accounts is used up,
they pay their own expenses until the total medical fees exceeded
five percent of their annual salary.
</P>
<P>
"The way of combining social insurance with the personal
accounts is created through reference to successful foreign
experience, and the Chinese situation," said Wang Jianlun.

<HEADLINE> China to Set up New Health Care System (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over 114 million people in China are currently benefiting from
free medicare services for workers, with the country's total
expenses for health care topping 46.62 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The traditional medicare system can no longer meet the needs of
the socialist market economy and the modern enterprise system,
said Wang.
</P>
<P>
China began to carry out experiments on the reform of health
care system in 1980s. About 90 percent of employees are now paying
part of their medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, many areas began to implement the system of social
funds for retired people, and at present 463 counties and cities
have launched serious illness insurance funds, and 392 counties
and cities have introduced insurance fund systems for the retired.
</P>
<P>
The combination of social insurance funds with the personal
account indicates that the medical care reform in China has
entered a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Medical insurance was divided into three categories, including
hospital expenses, comprehensive and special medical expenses in
Shenzhen City, a special economic zone in south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
China's biggest city of Shanghai plans to shift from the
hospital medical insurance system to a comprehensive medical
insurance system.
</P>
<P>
In south China's Hainan Province, all enterprises and their
employees have joined the medical insurance system, and cases
involving medical insurance are accepted by the courts.
</P>
<P>
Many other cities across China are also trying to work out a
feasible plan for the reform of the medicare system.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislator: Three Gorges Project Must Be Top Notch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese leader has urged the
army of workers building the Three Gorges Dam to do an excellent
job to ensure it become a showpiece project that will benefit the
future generations.
</P>
<P>
The work of construction was quite satisfying so far - but the
need for top quality was stressed because of the importance of the
scheme to China's economy, said Qiao Shi, chairman of the standing
committee of the National People's Congress
</P>
<P>
Efforts must be made to ensure that the project be built
strictly in accordance with the design requirements, said Qiao
when inspecting the on-going construction of the project, along
with other senior NPC officials.
</P>
<P>
Qiao and six NPC Standing Committee vice-chairmen were very
pleased with the work that has been done so far after they visited
the project's construction sites and resettled homes in Sichuan
and Hubei province through June 14-18.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said the National People's Congress has attached
tremendous importance to the construction of the project because
it has a major bearing on the country's economic development and
people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection the NPC chairman stressed the quality of
the project, saying that close examination and strict control
should be made over the project's quality and every piece of work
must meet the design requirements.
</P>
<P>
The main equipment for the project, no matter home-made or
imported, must be first-rate and up to the world's advanced
standard, Qiao said, adding that construction of the project
should serve to raise the overall level of China's hydroelectric
machinery making technology and capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the issue of resettlement of local residents, Qiao
said the matter is vital to the progress and success of the whole
project.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to stick to the principle of
resettlement in the form of development , he said, adding that
resettlement should be combined with the development and
opening-up of the dam area.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies should be made to attract investment from
other places in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, Qiao expounded on the issue of ecology and environmental
protection in the dam area, saying that enough attention must be
paid to the problem of pollution and measures should be taken in
time to guard against the project's possible impact on environment
and ecology, so that construction will go hand in hand with
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Industrial pollution must be strictly controlled, while the
industrial setup of the dam area should be well adjusted,
encouraging those industries with no or little pollution, Qiao
said.
</P>
<P>
The top legislator went into such details as sewage systems for
the new residential areas, vegetation protection, afforestation,
water and soil conservation and water quality of the Yangtze
River, in calling for enhanced awareness of environmental
protection among people, officials in particular, in the area. enditem

<HEADLINE> A Third of Israeli Families Have Personal Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-four percent of all
Israeli homes have a personal computer (PC) with a processor of at
least the 386 type, according to a Gallup-Israel survey conducted
for the Israel Communications Company, Bezeq.
</P>
<P>
The poll, published in the local press today, shows that a
third of those PCs have a modem for computer communications over a
phone line. Ten percent of the PC owners who have no modem said
they would buy one soon.
</P>
<P>
In a survey of all PC users (at work and at home), it was
found that half of the personal computers in the country have
advanced 586 (Pentium) processors. Of all the workplaces with at
least three employees, 88 percent have at least one computer, 60
percent have a modem and 5 percent are sure they will purchase one.
</P>
<P>
Bezeq, which is most interested in the popularity of modems
because they require use of its phone lines, found that 85
percent of those surveyed would hook up to the Internet. And 43
percent of them would prefer "surfing" the internet on a
non-subscription basis.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned company announced earlier this week that it
intends to offer such a service soon through its Goldnet
subsidiary. Modem owners were most interested in using their
equipment to get on-line banking services.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Malaysia to Check Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today welcomed the
pledge given by Indonesia to help stop the influx of Indonesian
illegal immigrants into Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at Pulau Pinang for a meeting with his Indonesian
counterpart Ali Alatas, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi said it is a very encouraging development that the two
countries have agreed to cooperate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to step up surveillance and have more
coordinated naval patrols at the fifth Malaysia-Indonesia Joint
Commission senior official meeting that ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Surveillance by the Malaysian side has been going on for a
long time and we are concerned over the continuing inflow of those
without valid travel documents," said Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
"It is good that Indonesia has agreed to extend its
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said with the undertaking committed by Indonesia, the
Malaysian authorities should not face much problems.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's national news agency Bernama said the Malaysian
authorities found it hard to reduce the influx of the Indonesian
illegal immigrants, most of whom enter Malaysia by boat, as the
coastline is very long between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A total of more than one million illegal immigrants are
estimated to be now working in Malaysia. Most of them are from
neighboring countries.

</P>
<P>
He went on to say that his ministry and the Ministry of

breakthrough in the technology related to high-performance,
low-cost batteries and engines.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoyu, director of Auto Industry Department under the
Ministry of Machinery Industry, said the development of the auto
industry has been troubled by safety, energy and environmental
issues, but this will help the development of better and
environmentally safe automobiles.

the national auto industrial development policy published over a
year ago by the Chinese government.

NICOSIA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General's special
representative for Cyprus Han Sung-Joo will come to Cyprus next
week for a six-day visit for contacts with the two communities on
the island.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman said here today that Han will arrive here
Tuesday afternoon and will have meetings with the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides at different levels as part of his mission
to help the U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's efforts
to push for a settlement on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"Han will also familiarize himself with the U.N. Peace-Keeping
Force in Cyprus," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy is expected to have meetings with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
After his contacts on the island, Han will fly to Athens and
Ankara for talks before moving on to Moscow, Brussels and London
for more contacts concerning the Cyprus peace effort.
</P>
<P>
Han attended a meeting in Geneva between the U.N. secretary-
general and the Cyprus president on June 11.
</P>

Sources close to the meeting said the ministers would discuss
future schemes to detect maritime pollution, ways to improve the
analysis of sea water sample and the development of coastal
regions.
</P>
<P>
Joint efforts to salvage the oil vessels sunk during the war
and still lying in the sea bed would be discussed at the meeting,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
About 260 ships sank in the Gulf during the Iraqi occupation of
Kuwait. The most dangerous ship lying at the sea bottom is the
Iraqi tanker Amouriyah carrying more than 100,000 tons of crude
oil, which was sunk by the U.S.-led allied forces during the war.
</P>
<P>
During the hot summer season, oil is leaking continuously from
the vessel which is on the verge of disintegration.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Kuwait asked the United Nations to interfere
immediately in a bid to descale the impacts of an imminent
dangerous environment crisis that could hit Gulf waters due to
the presence of these vessels.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the last 25 years, the Gulf was hit by various
environment disasters.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Can EU Summit Make Much Ado About Something? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Jobs, Maastricht, the Euro
and not Renaissance relics will keep the European Union leaders
busy when they gather June 21 and 22 here for their semiannual
summit.
</P>
<P>
Though their agenda has already been tightly packed, the summit
participants may have to deal with BSE or mad cow disease first
before sitting heavy on other matters.
</P>
<P>
Chief among these matters is unemployment as 18.3 million
people or 11 percent of the EU workforce are now jobless. Upwards
of 50 percent of women and youths are out of work in some EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Santer, president of the EU executive commission,
warned in March that unemployment has become a serious social
problem in the union and may lead to unrest if not coped with in a
proper and timely manner.
</P>
<P>
Though previous summits had proved that there was not much the
EU can do about jobs as a whole, the topic has to be raised again
in Florence as a precondition for the single currency mechanism
slated to start functioning on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Even if unemployment remains within the domain of member
states, Europe can't be indifferent," Santer said last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The main jobs proposal to be discussed at the summit is
Santer's Confidence Pact, but it may not help either as the
governments of member states are resorting to austerity programs
and axing budgetary deficits to prepare for the circulation of the
Euro, as the single currency will be called.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission and the European Monetary Institute
will brief the EU leaders with reports on the preparations for the
introduction of the Euro and on the relations between those
currencies inside the monetary union and those outside.
</P>
<P>
Another hard nut to crack in Florence is the EU treaty review.
</P>
<P>
The treaty review, known formally as the inter-governmental
conference, has encountered difficulties even before it began in
another Italian city of Turin.
</P>
<P>
The review of the Maastricht Treaty seemed to have bogged down
as most EU countries are experiencing a slowdown of their
economy. The International Monetary Fund has predicted a moderate
average economic growth of 1.8 percent for EU countries this year.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission also admitted in May that the EU
economy is in a dismal prospect this year and next as European
economists predicted a drop of between 0.4 and 1 percentage points
as against last year's growth.
</P>
<P>
The economic slowdown has also put a brake on the process of
the treaty review which has centered on economic norms --
guidelines and gauges for the single currency and for the economy
and trade integration within the union.
</P>
<P>
Now the one and only way out seems to be either a much
watered-down new treaty or a postponed time schedule of the
political and economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit, however, will be claimed a success if
participants can sincerely and confidently discuss all the items
on the agenda which has encompassed an unparalleled long list of
subject matters.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Delta: China's Most Potential Consumer Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Amidst a large vegetable field
stands a two-storey country villa, decorated with milk-cream
colored mosaic. All the five rooms and a sitting room are fitted
with rugs. Oil paintings hang on the walls.
</P>
<P>
It is not home of a millionaire, but of an ordinary farmer in
the Yangtze River Delta, a newly flourishing economic zone in east
China.
</P>
<P>
"Since farmers never need to worry about food or clothing
nowadays, we should give our homes a facelift so that we can live
more comfortably," said the house owner, Li Letian, a 46-year-old
farmer.
</P>
<P>
Li said he had spent 20,000 yuan, four years' total earnings
for an average Chinese worker, on fitting up the house.
</P>
<P>
Such a sum of money was only once a dream for people in the
Yangtze River Delta.
</P>
<P>
A random survey shows that nearly 40 percent of the rural and
urban families spent more than 20 billion yuan on materials for
their house fitting-up over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Covering some 100,000 square kilometers in east China, Yangtze
River Delta includes an area covering Shanghai, China's largest
industrial city, and six major cities in northern part of the
neighboring province of Zhejiang and seven most flourishing cities
in the neighboring province of Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the area, which makes up only one percent of China's
territory, produced 20 percent of the country's gross national
product.
</P>
<P>
The area boasts China's richest and largest number of
consumers: about 50 million urban dwellers earn nearly 6,000 yuan
a year, while 95 percent of the rural families earn more than
10,000 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
"Such an income level marks the beginning for individuals to
spend money on consumer durables," said Yan Xueruo, an official
from Zhejiang Provincial Economic Restructuring Commission.
</P>
<P>
The latest random survey by the Shanghai Municipal Statistical
Bureau shows that 86 percent of the income of Shanghai residents
is used in living expenses, with each person earmarking 490 yuan
for consumer spending.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Orders One Day Off on July 3 for Run-off Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
instructed his government to make July 3, Wednesday, a day-off for
holding the second round of the presidential elections, his press
service said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that Yeltsin issued the order at the request of Central
Electoral Commission Chief Nikolai Ryabov, who thinks it is
necessary to make July 3 a day-off "for the creation of equal
possibilities for all citizens participating in the elections."
</P>
<P>
The press service also said that Yeltsin was acting in
accordance with the Russian Constitution and issued the order to
guarantee the rights of citizens, particularly their equal rights
to voting.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, is expected to
discuss the proposal on declaring July 3 a holiday on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that voting on Wednesday may increase the
turnout of voters. Yeltsin's campaigners put big stakes on the
turnout, saying the victory of the president can be ensured only
if it is not less than that of the first round balloting held on
June 16.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The first 10,000 sets of a new
book series, totalling five million copies, are expected to come
off the press and be donated to schools in poverty-stricken areas
in July.
</P>
<P>
Since early 1995, celebrities and experts in education circles
have selected 500 outstanding titles from an original 2,500
recommended by publishing houses nationwide, to form a book
series, "The Project Hope Book Store", which covers the fields of
science, culture, literature and art.
</P>
<P>
With the launching of Project Hope more poor drop-outs have
returned to classrooms, while more schools equipped with new desks
and chairs have been set up across the country.
</P>
<P>
However, many school students can hardly find children's books
to read after class. The publication of the book series will help
meet the demands of those children.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 publishing houses from 20 provinces,

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping's Asian Tour Fruitful (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The recent official visit to
Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand by Lu Ping, director of
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, has
been described as fruitful.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Lu exchanged views with major leaders of the
four countries on the question of Hong Kong. It was his second
visit abroad in a year.
</P>
<P>
Last year he headed a group of Hong Kong members of the
Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to visit six cities in the
United States, in the capacity of Vice-Chairman of the Preliminary
working Committee. During the tour he explained the Chinese
government's policies towards Hong Kong to U.S. people from all
walks of life as well as to overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
During the recent Asian tour, Lu once again expounded Chinese
government's principles and policies towards Hong Kong to the
government leaders and various social sectors of the four
countries.
</P>
<P>
Official sources described Lu Ping's four-nation tour short but
successful, and it was well received by every country and yielded
good results.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that Japan, an important developed country
in Asia, is a good neighbor of China separated only by a strip of
water, while Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and China are
developing countries, enjoying good relationships.
</P>
<P>
The four countries all have close ties with Hong Kong as an
international financial and trade center and they also have made
much investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1, 1997, which will be a major event in the history of China,
Asia, even the world. Countries in the world, especially in Asia,
are very much concerned about how Hong Kong will be after 1997,
and what principles and policies will China adopt towards Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Lu explained the principles and policies while holding meetings
and talks with leaders and foreign ministers of the four
countries, such as "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Lu reaffirmed that the special social system and policies in
Hong Kong after 1997 are designed not only for guaranteeing Hong
Kong's stability and prosperity, but also for the sake of China's
long-term interests.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Forest Fires Cause 2.2 billion U.S. dollar Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The disastrous forest and
grassland fires that swept Mongolia between February and May have
killed and wounded 85 people and caused a loss of 2.2 billion
U.S. dollars, a leading newspaper said here today.
</P>
<P>
The "People's Right" quoted a government commissioner in charge
of environment and natural disaster affairs as saying that the
forest fires, which broke out on February 23 and lasted for more
than 100 days, engulfed 2.4 million hectares of forest land and
7.8 million hectares of pasture land.
</P>
<P>
The blazes, the biggest ever in Mongolia, also killed 7,800
head of animals and destroyed 35 buildings, 175 tents, 576 animal
pens and 2,778 wire poles, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian government has spent a total of 993.3 million
tugrik (about 2.11 million dollars) to put out the fires, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
It added that local authorities' failure to take active
preventive measures should be blamed for the break-out of the
fires, and their inability to organize timely fire-fighting
operations added to the burning of the flames for several months.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the people's poor knowledge of fire prevention and
a weak sense of responsibility should also be blamed, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
To draw a lesson from the disaster, the paper said,
legislations have been made to make the prevention and supervision
of natural disasters, including fires, a responsibility of local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Mongolian State Great Hural (parliament) adopted
on May 28 a law on the prevention of forest and grassland fire,
and made new amendments to the criminal law, which metes out
severe punishment to arsonists.

<HEADLINE> Drive to Wipe Out Piracy, Pornography Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- In China's continued crackdown on
the piracy of electronic audio and video publications, Sichuan
Province in the southwest and Jiangsu Province in the east have
confiscated a total of 6,000 illegal video tapes and pirated CDs.
</P>
<P>
China recently mapped out a regulation to strengthen its
control over the cultural market, and authorities nationwide have
made great progress in their efforts to eliminate piracy of video
and audio materials and the spread of pornography, according to
"China Cultural News".
</P>
<P>
In a circular, the Ministry of Culture asked all video rental
shops in the country to allow themselves to be inspected for signs
of pirated or pornographic videotapes.
</P>
<P>
Inspections also will be conducted in Liaoning Province in the
north, the coastal Shandong Province, and Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region in the southwest to ensure shops sell legal
products.
</P>
<P>
China has been successful in a new round of national campaign
against piracy and pornography, which started early this month.
</P>
<P>
South China's Guangdong Province recently confiscated 48,000
pornographic audio and video products and pirated CDs after a
series of inspections across the province.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the customs office in the province has seized
134,000 illegal publications since November.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has performed 457 market inspections, and confiscated
1.3 million packs or pieces of illegal video and electronic
publications from last September through March of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Ekeus Arrives in Baghdad to Defuse Iraq-UN Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. official Rolf Ekeus arrived
here today in an attempt to defuse the recent standoff between
the Iraqi government and the U.N. inspectors who were denied
access to some Iraqi sites.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. source said that Ekeus, chairman of the U.N. special
commission (UNSCOM) charged with dismantling Iraq's mass
destruction weapons, is now in his residence in Baghdad and will
stay here until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day visit, he will meet Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz and Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus did not meet reporters upon his arrival as he usually
does, but the U.N. source said that he is likely to give a press
conference before his departure.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-U.N. confrontation started on June 10 when Iraq
prevented U.N. weapons inspectors from entering five military
sites of Iraq's Republican Guard in and around Baghdad. The
53-member inspection team left Baghdad Sunday for Bahrain
apparently to wait for the outcome of talks between Iraqi
officials and their UNSCOM chief.
</P>
<P>
Iraq insists that the U.N. weapons inspectors have no right to
enter "sensitive sites related to national security and
sovereignty" of the county. It has proposed that Ekeus himself
should lead an inspection team to conduct their mission jointly
with the Iraqi side but the U.N. has officially rejected it,
maintaining that it has a mandate to inspect anywhere and at any
time.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi side also demanded that UNSCOM should give a final
and definite list of the suspicious sites they want to investigate.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Ekeus has told a press before leaving New
York for Baghdad that he would go to Iraq "not to negotiate" but to
convince Iraq that it should implement U.N. resolution 687 which
ended the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iraqi government newspaper al-Jumhuriya
available a few hours before Ekeus' arrival carried a strong
worded open letter by its editor Sahal al-Mukhtar to Ekeus. it
accused Ekeus of lying and collaborate with the Americans to
murder Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that Ekeus wants to reach two goals both of
which harm the dignity of the Iraqi people, first to enter
sensitive areas representing the national sovereignty and the
second to decrease the impact of the Iraqi people's reaction so
that they get used to such encroachments.

MOSCOW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The closed-door meeting between
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov and the so-called

meeting with Lebed, who came third with 14.7 percent of votes in
the first round of presidential elections held on June 16.
</P>
<P>
The polls gave Yeltsin a lead over all other candidates, with a
slight 3 percentage points over Zyuganov, who finished second with
32.13 percent of votes. The top two would battle it out in a
run-off early next month, in which Lebed could play an important
role.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Wednesday's meeting between Zyuganov and Lebed,
Yeltsin appointed Lebed as head of the Security Council and his
national security assistant with "enlarged" powers. In exchange,
Lebed offered to make most of his voters support Yeltsin in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
The press service of the Communist Party group at the State
Duma (the lower house of parliament) where the Zyuganov-Lebed
meeting was held refused to comment on its results.
</P>
<P>
Lebed's aide Vladimir Titov told reporters that during the
meeting Lebed explained to Zyuganov why he had agreed to side with
Yeltsin and take high posts in the presidential team.
</P>
<P>
Lebed told Zyuganov that he had been guided "by Russia's
interests and has already begun work in his new capacity in order
to keep his election promises," Titov said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Lebed discussed Zyuganov's proposal to join a
coalition government if Zyuganov won the run-off, Titov
replied: "Lebed respects the people's right and will work with the
president elected by the people."
</P>
<P>
The two politicians discussed all aspects of security
associated with the upcoming second round of elections and agreed
that "all political forces must interact in order to ensure
security, as no one needs any aggravation of the situation," Titov
said.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov and Lebed also agreed that "it is necessary to conduct
the second round in a way as well-organized and quiet as the first
one," Titov added.

<HEADLINE> Japan Blames Human Error for Downing of U.S. Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Defense Agency said today a
human error had caused the shooting down of a U.S. warplane by a
Japanese destroyer in the Pacific on June 4, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency released an interim investigative report on the
incident, saying a Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) lieutenant
commander inadvertently gave a premature order to gunners.
</P>
<P>
An A-6E Intruder from the aircraft carrier Independence was
towing a target on a 5-kilometer cable to allow gunners using
20-millimeter guns on the destroyer, the Yuugiri, to carry out
target practice.
</P>
<P>
But a manually fired shell from the 3,500-ton Yuugiri hit the
plane. Two pilots of the warplane ejected safely before being
rescued.
</P>
<P>
The report said the lieutenant commander, who was directing the
target practice, did not wait for a radio message from the
U.S. plane confirming it was out of range of the gun nor for a
report from observers that the plane had entered a safe area,
according to Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
The officer told MSDF investigators he was nervous at the time
because it was "a rare chance" for him to issue such an order, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral drill was part of a larger multilateral military
exercise called RIMPAC, held biennially in the Pacific under the
sponsorship of the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
The shooting drill was supposed to have been conducted
according to procedure laid down by the U.S. military under which
the gun was to have been fired only after receipt of a radio
message and a report by observers, Kyodo said.

China needs a "bridge" to the western countries in its reform

Hong Kong has been playing that part, and China needs it to

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party May Withdraw Support for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian prime minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao today warned that the Indian National Congress
would be forced to reconsider its support for the United Front
government if the latter committed "grave errors detrimental to
the interests of the country."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting in the southern state of Orissa, the
Congress Party leader said although his party had extended
unconditional support to the new government led by Prime Minister
H.D. Deve Gowda, it is not "a blind support."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Rao to indicate that his party may
withdraw its support for the Gowda minority government which was
formed on June 1 with the support from the Congress party.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, Rao said whenever there
was any omission or commission on the government's party, the
Congress party will point them out and rectify them through
discussion.
</P>
<P>
"But if it committed grave mistakes which went against the
basic principles of the Congress party and did not correct them,
we will be forced to reconsider our support to the government," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Rao, however, expressed confidence that the Deve Gowda
government would be a stable one with the support of more than 300
Congress party and United Front members in the 545-seat Lok Sabha
(lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
With only 190 seats in the Lok Sabha, the 13-party United Front
can not sustain a stable government without the support from the
140-seat Congress party.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Media Criticize UNSCOM Chairman Ekeus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi magazine Alef Baa today
accused Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the U.N. special commission charged
with eliminating Iraq's mass-destruction weapons (UNSCOM), of
forcing crises upon Iraq and causing the embargo imposed on its
people to extend.
</P>
<P>
This criticism comes a few hours before the arrival of Ekeus in
Baghdad on a mission intended to resolve the problems arising from
Iraq's barring the U.N. inspectors from entering a number of Iraqi
sites.
</P>
<P>
"All that Ekeus says in Iraq is altered by him as soon as he
arrives in Manama (capital of Bahrain). And he gets more
suspicious when he reaches New York where the U.N. headquarters is
based," the Iraqi magazine said.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever Ekeus visits Iraq he will announce that some
progress has been secured, but he will soon change his mind as
result of the pressure from the U.S. and Britain," the magazine
added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi newspaper Al-Jomhouriya also criticized Ekeus severely
today, accusing him of insulting the Iraqi people by making the
UNSCOM inspectors insist on getting into the Iraqi governmental
agencies that have nothing to do with arms, or the delicate
centers that are connected with the national security and
sovereignty of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The paper described Ekeus and members of the U.N. inspection
teams as "liars who alter facts."
</P>
<P>
Al-Jomhouriya said, "Ekeus wishes to achieve two objectives: to
get into delicate sites that symbolize the national sovereignty
of Iraq and to make Iraqi citizens accept gradually excesses that
affect their dignity."

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Budget Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan business community,
and foreign envoys here have hailed the 1996 budget proposals
made by Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi in parliament on
Tuesday to enhance a faster growth of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The "Kenya Times" today quoted leaders of the local business
sector as saying that budget is not only sober and realistic, but
that it will encourage both domestic and foreign investment in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders supporting the budget include the
Chairman of the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
Kassim Owango, the Chairman of the Capital Markets Authority,
Paul Melly, the Executive Chairman of the Investment Promotion
Centre (IPC),Joseph Ngok, and the Chief and Executive of the
Export promotion Council (EPC), Peter Muthoka.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the Budget in parliament, Musalia Mudavadi exempted
Kenyan 140,000 workers earning below 6,000 Kenya Shillings from paying
income tax.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the proposals removed Value Added Tax (VAT)
on wheat, wheat flour, bread, maize, Maize meal, rice and milk.
</P>
<P>
The Finance minister also lowered the top rate on VAT-able
products from 25 percent to a standard rate of 15 percent, and
increased the lower rate from 6 percent to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Import Duty has been imposed on kerosene to discourage the
diversion of the commodity to industrial use and smuggling to
neighbouring countries. As a result, the price of kerosene is
going up by 3 Kenya shilling per litre.
</P>
<P>
The Road Maintenance Levy went up by 2.7 Kenya Shillings a
litre for petrol and 2.2 litre for automotive diesel.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget, various fees for the registration and
licensing of motor vehicles and for drivers' licences will be
increased.
</P>
<P>
To encourage tourism promotion, Musalia Mudavadi announced the
removal of certain levies and taxes on hotels and restaurants,
provided visiting groups do so through organised local
associations and approved by the director of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the budget, outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Kenya
Aurelia Brazeal described it as a solid ground for economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
She noted that foreign investors will be encouraged to invest
in the country if what is contained in the budget speech is to be
adhered to.
</P>
<P>
She said the budget speech is a continuation of the economic
structure which the Kenyan Government has put in place over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition parties are disappointed with the
budget. Opposition FORD-Kenya Chairman Kijana Wamalwa said
despite the government allocating huge funds for road
maintenance, nothing tangible has been done.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party chairman Mwai Kibaki, However, objected to
the increase on the Petroleum Levy, saying the government had
failed to account for it.

<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing today
urged local officials to make more efforts to promote vocational
education to meet the needs of social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national conference, Li pointed out that
vocational education may act as a bridge for transforming science
and technology to productive forces.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of vocational education can lead to sustained
economic growth and further development of reforms in industrial
enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that with economic development and the adjustment of
industrial structures, many laborers will be replaced. Vocational
education and training could provide new jobs for the displaced
workers.
</P>
<P>
Li said that it is also an important factor for maintaining
social stability.
</P>
<P>
He said the country plans for 50 to 70 percent of the junior
middle school graduates to receive vocational education, while
rural education should meet the needs of local economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Senior skilled workers are badly needed in China's factories,
while the number of such workers only accounts for 2 percent of
all the skilled workers at present.
</P>
<P>
Li called on enterprises to pay more attention to workers'
training, describing this as "an important factor for the
sustained development of an enterprises."
</P>
<P>
As enterprises immediately benefit from vacational training,
they should become the mainstream driving force in this regard, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the development of vocational education, China is
to implement a Vocational Education Law as of September 1, the
vice-premier said.

powerful economic force while Singapore has a vested interest in
India's economic success.
</P>
<P>
A thriving India would add to the regional prosperity and
provide Singapore with another significant source of growth, he
said.
</P>
<P>
At today's conference, India's new Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram urged overseas Indians to return to invest in India.
</P>
<P>
He assured them that the new government would be open to ideas
and suggestions that would help speed up the flow of foreign
investment into India.
</P>
<P>
To continue the reforms, India now needs money, ideas, and
expertise of overseas Indians, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are some 15 million overseas Indians around
the world.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the new government of India released its
economic blueprint -- the Common Economic Program. It commits the
government to an annual economic growth rate of at least seven
percent and industrial growth of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government is also aiming at a minimum target of 10 billion
US dollars of foreign direct investments a year, as well as
restructuring the public sector to make it commercially profitable
and technologically dynamic.

<HEADLINE> Arsenic, Possible Cure for Leukemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Deadly arsenic has been used by
Chinese doctors to treat patients with leukemia. And the
administering of the poison proved effective, they say.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at Shanghai Hematology Institute are reporting that
arsenic may provide a cure for acute promyclocytic leukemia (APL).
</P>
<P>
They found that if a small amount of the poison is injected
into the blood, it can lead to the death of leukemia cells, while
doing little harm to the human body.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of two renowned Chinese hematologists, Chen
Zhu and Wang Zhenyi, Professor Chen Guoqiang headed a research
group to analyze the treatment of leukemia patients and their
tolerance for routine medicine.
</P>
<P>
They used mice with serious combined immuno-deficiency to study
the molecular mechanism of APL, and discovered that arsenic killed
the leukemia cells.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen and his colleagues then used intravenous drips
of arsenic on 16 leukemia patients, who had developed
drug-resistance to retinoic acid and other chemical therapies.
</P>
<P>
The medicine proved effective on 15 patients, including two
Japanese, who had had relapses three times, and no serious side
effects, such as arrest of bone marrow, was observed.
</P>
<P>
Chen's paper on this safe and effective treatment of APL has
been published in the prestigeous medical journal, Blood, and the
finding was regarded by world hematologists as a major
breakthrough in the hematological field.

<HEADLINE> Youth Encouraged to Contribute More to Advancement of Ethnic Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China is encouraging young people to
participate in the economic construction of areas inhabited by
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
A meeting on exchange experience among outstanding young people
from ethnic areas was held today in Beijing by the State
Nationalities Affairs Commission (SNAC), Communist Youth League of
China (CYLC), and All-China Youth Federation (ACYF).
</P>
<P>
This was the first time such a meeting had taken place in
China, and was designed to cultivate a friendly environment of
aiding ethnic areas in the country, and encourage more young
people to help people in ethnic areas become better off.
</P>
<P>
One hundred outstanding young people were rewarded for the
long-term contributions they have made to the advancement of
ethnic areas across the country.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Ismail Amat, also minister in charge of the
SNAC, told young people to cherish unity of various nationalities
in the way they take good care of their eyes.
</P>
<P>
Li Keqiang, first secretary of the secretariat of the CYLC
Central Committee, encouraged young people to work in border
areas and ethnic areas and introduce advanced technologies to those
areas. Li asked young people to help train more professionals for
the areas.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of ethnic areas across
China reached 561 billion yuan (nearly 68 billion U.S. dollars) in
1995, an 11.9 percent increase over the previous year. The
increasing rate was 1.7 percentage point higher than that of the
whole country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government paid much attention to talent training
for ethnic areas. Thirteen colleges and universities across the
country exclusively enroll students from ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
All schools in the country also recruit ethnic students. There
are 17 cities in inland areas which enroll students from Tibet and
organize special classes for them. More than 8,000 students from
Tibet are receiving school education in what is called "Tibetan
classes."
</P>
<P>
"Xinjiang classes" designed for students from northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have also been set up in some
colleges and universities.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Newspaper Criticizes Natanyahu's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A Syrian newspaper criticized
today the working program of the new Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that it ignores the foundations of the
peace process and opens the road to tension.
</P>
<P>
The program confirms the survival of Jewish settlements in the
Golan Heights and the West Bank and enables Israel to retain
Jerusalem, Syrian newspaper Tishrin said in a commentary today .
</P>
<P>
It said, "The attempt made by Israel Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to absorb international indignation by calling on Syria,
Lebanon and Saudi Arabia to enter into direct negotiations with
Israel without preconditions, simultaneously vowing to make no
concessions that would affect Israeli security, is delusion
itself."
</P>
<P>
In his speech before presenting the coalition list to Israel's
Knesset (parliament) Tuesday, Netanyahu called on Arab neighbors
to hold direct talks with his government but refused to make any
compromise on security in any negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"If Netanyahu refuses to withdraw from the Golan Heights and
return Jerusalem, vows to expand settlement in the West Bank and
even in the Gaza Strip and rejects any Palestinian entity ... what
then has he left to the peace process, and what would he negotiate
with the Arabs? Is it possible for a wise man to imagine that
Syria, for instance, should negotiate with Netanyahu in order to
cede the Golan Heights officially?" the paper asked.
</P>
<P>
"Pretending to be seeking peace is something and working for
peace is something else. If Netanyahu thinks that the Arabs,
including Syria, are going to enter into aimless, meaningless
talks with him, he will certainly be fancying," Tishrin remarked.
</P>
<P>
Political observers in the Syrian capital think that the
commentary is the first Syrian reaction to the working program of
new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> China's Materials Market Price Recorded Negative Rise in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The price index of production
materials fell 0.2 percent in May over April, the first negative
price index recorded this year in China.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the same period last year, the May figure dropped
by 1.5 percent, while the combined figure between January and May
also declined by 0.1 percent, according to the China Materials
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
Market experts attributed the price downturn to a stable but
slower domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
"The recent decrease in interest rates seemed to have not
pushed the market up," an expert pointed out. He added that
another factor is the drop in exports and rise in imports due to
the lowering of rebate rates for export tariffs.
</P>
<P>
In May, the national average price for steel products remained
unchanged, latest statistics provided by the Center show.
</P>
<P>
Demand for non-ferrous metals remained slow in May, with the
general price level falling 0.4 percent compared to April, and
12.1 percent compared to May of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Because of the rise in costs, the price of coal continued to
climb in May, although the once tense demand situation has
improved.
</P>
<P>
The price for chemical products dropped in May by 0.7 percent
over April.
</P>
<P>
The price for motor vehicles continued to drop, due to "traffic
control" in some cities. The price for heavy-duty vehicles fell by
0.1 percent while that of cars by 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese-Loving Foreigners in Dalian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- As China enjoys rapid economic
growth and continues to open its door to the outside world,
Chinese is attracting more foreign learners despite its reputation
as one of the world's hardest languages to learn.
</P>
<P>
"I learn Chinese for more fun on my trips in China and for a
better understanding of the ancient country," said Harigae Toshiko
from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Toshiko, 52, is studying Chinese in Dalian, a port city in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, in the Northwest China
University of Finance and Economics. Her husband is a teacher of
Japanese with the university.
</P>
<P>
To travel to China to learn Chinese was a long-cherished dream
of hers, which only came true four years ago when her husband
retired, and her youngest child got a university degree in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other foreign students, she may be accused of
being too old to learn a new language. But she works very hard,
and is already able to chat with her Chinese friends without much
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
"My rich experience of life helps me a lot," she said.
"Sometimes I can understand something even faster than my young
classmates."
</P>
<P>
In Dalian, Toshiko is not the sole foreigner to show a keen
interest in Chinese language and culture.
</P>
<P>
Koike Naomi, a Japanese girl studying Asian Culture, arrived in
the city last year. Now she can not only talk and write in
Chinese, but also cook some simple Chinese dishes, such as "eggs
fried with tomatoes".
</P>
<P>
"After having a good command of Chinese, I want to study for a
degree of trade in China and find a job in Dalian," she said of
her plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Matthern from Pennsylvania, the US, is only 27, but he
has been living in Dalian for four years. He came to the city as a
student of Chinese, and stayed to teach English.
</P>
<P>
Speaking fluent Chinese, the young man gave himself a Chinese
name "Wang Feng". He and his wife also adopted a Chinese orphan as
their daughter, who is now two and a half years old.
</P>
<P>
"She likes speaking Chinese, as well as eating rice," he spoke
of his daughter in a proud voice. "If we go back to the states
some day, we will let her meet Chinese people often to give her
the chance to speak her mother language."
</P>
<P>
Anthony Ward, a British expert in Dalian, might have uttered
the feeling of many Chinese-loving foreigners: "China is so large
and there are so many things to learn. The longer you stay here,
the more you want to learn."

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Policy Guidelines Could Adversely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
has said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy
guidelines could adversely affect the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday night that the guidelines, published Monday,
spoke of a desire for peace but included many "nos."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called on Arab states to renew peace talks with
Israel but expressed his opposition to returning captured Arab
land for peace.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu ruled out the possibility of the establishment of a
Palestinian state and the return of the Golan Heights to Syria. He
also insisted on the unity of Jerusalem and Israel's exclusive
sovereignty over the city.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Egypt views Israel's policy guidelines as a
reflection of the Israeli intransigence, a stance which he said
would breed nothing but negative effects on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was sworn in Tuesday night as the new Israeli prime
minister.

<P>
MANILA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today asked the Senate to ratify the Philippine's accession to the
1994 International Coffee Agreement (ICA) which was adopted by the
International Coffee Council at its 64th session in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Senate President Neptali Gonzales, the
president said the 1994 ICA aims to enhance international
cooperation on coffee matters by providing for a system of
intergovernmental consultations and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to achieve stability in the prices of coffee and
facilitate the expansion of international trade in coffee.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 ICA provides that world coffee trade is to be
conducted under free market conditions without quotas because of
the supply shortage in the international market and the recent
development in international coffee trade.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is one of the major coffee producers in
Southeast Asia.

<P>
MACAO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Macao businessmen and government
officials applauded the avoidance of a trade war between the United
States and China, saying it will have positive effects to Macao
economy.
</P>
<P>
Leong Song, secretary general of the Macao Entrepreneurs
Association, said that the agreement on intellectual property rights
reached by China and the United States will bring positive influence
to Macao.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the United States began to impose
restrictions on the imports of garments from Macao. Macao Government
has been making efforts to settle down that disputes.
</P>
<P>
Leong said that he believed the agreement will be a help in
solving the disputes between Macao and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Maria Cesar, director of the Macao Economic Department, said
that the avoidance of a trade war will be beneficial to both Macao
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
She said that since Macao and Hong Kong businessmen have close
relations with China's mainland and many have established factories
there, a trade war will inevitably affect their interests.
</P>
<P>
The director added that the agreement reached between China and
the United States will also help China's re-entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said that the Macao Government is trying its

<HEADLINE> Lhasa Teenagers Love Tibetan Opera (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Nyima Doje will be in the
sixth-grade in September, and will graduate from primary school
soon. But unlike most of his classmates, he often seems unhappy.
</P>
<P>
Doje, 11, is a veteran member of the extra-curricular class in
Tibetan Opera at the Snow Primary School in Lhasa, capital of
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to the school's rules, students in the graduating
class must drop out of the Tibetan Opera class in order to
concentrate on their studies.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very upset whenever I think that I am going to leave
the class soon," said Doje, "but I know the school made this
decision for our good."
</P>
<P>
He longs to receive his middle school education in Shanghai,
the largest city in China. To see his dream come true, he must
score good results on next year's graduation examinations.
</P>
<P>
The Snow Primary School offered its Tibetan Opera class two
years ago. It now has 24 students, ages 8 to 12.
</P>
<P>
"All the children have shown keen interest in the ancient art,
as well as great enthusiasm in their study," said Cedan Wangmo,
one of the teachers of the class.
</P>
<P>
Created more than 600 years ago, Tibetan Opera usually features
scenes of harvests and celebrations with a mixture of dialogue,
singing, dancing, and acrobatics. It is highly popular with the
Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
"It is also one of a few operas in the world that use various
masks in the performance," Wangmo added.
</P>
<P>
She said that her students are able to perform six traditional
Tibetan plays and folk dances, and their talents have been praised
by famous artists in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
"Some of them will become top performers of the Tibetan Opera
in the future," she quoted one of them as saying.

<HEADLINE> Lhasa Teenagers Love Tibetan Opera (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The children have teachers from various artistic groups and
institutions. They include directors from the Tibet School of
Arts, actors and actresses from the Tibetan Opera Troupe of the
autonomous region, and even some famous dancers.
</P>
<P>
The teachers have one thing in common: all gave their lectures
free of charge. An 80-year-old elderly man, who had played in the
Tibetan Opera for decades, came to the school every day to teach
the children the fundamental theories and the sophisticated skills
necessary for the complicated performance.
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of the children's parents, however, Cedan Wangmo
worked the hardest: in addition to teaching the children language
courses, she has to complete her daily class chores.
</P>
<P>
"It takes much of her time every day to clear up all the
costumes and props left by the children after their rehearsal,"
one of the parents exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
The Snow Primary School once was located at the foot of the
Potala Palace, a symbol of Lhasa and Tibet. It was moved to the
new site when the government built a large square in front of the
palace.
</P>
<P>
With a state investment of 3.6 million yuan (about 400,000 US
dollars), the school now covers a larger area than before, and is
fully-equipped with audio-visual materials.
</P>
<P>
The school has built a modern rehearsal hall and purchased all
costumes needed by its students for the Tibetan Opera.
</P>
<P>
Now that the Tibetan Opera class has become well known in
Lhasa, its students often are invited to perform publicly.
</P>
<P>
Last year, when the autonomous region marked its 30th founding
anniversary, children from the class performed the Tibetan Opera
for thousands of domestic and foreign guests in the new Potala
Palace square.
</P>
<P>
"It was a great success," recalled Wangmo. "It will be an
everlasting memory for the children of my class, as well as their
parents."

SOFIA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will temporarily freeze

KUALA LUMPUR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian foreign minister
Ali Alatas said today that his country will agree to submit its
claim on the Sipadan and Ligitan islands off the east coast of
Malaysia's Sabah State for arbitration by the International Court
of Justice if current bilateral talks fail to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at Pulau Pinang for the fifth meeting of the
Malaysian-Indonesia Joint Commission, Ali Alatas said Indonesia
was not afraid to have a third party decide on the long-standing
issue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The three-day joint commission meeting enters the final day
today, Malaysian foreign minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Ali
Alatas will lead their delegations respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ali said Indonesia and Malaysia had agreed that the overlapping
claims should be settled through diplomacy and discussions between
the two sides were continuing.
</P>
<P>
Ali said: "When that did not get us the solution, we decide to
still remain in bilateral contact and try to see whether a
political solution was possible and this is the stage that we are
still in."
</P>
<P>
"We will have to wait whether that stage will give result and
if it does not give any result in the sense that we can not find a
solution, then of course we will have to see or bring the matter
up to the third party," Ali Alatas added.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that his country would like to see the
problem resolved amicably between friends and close neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weakens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar weakened
against major currencies today on the news of a
stronger-than-expected Japanese economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar dipped below 79 US cents to 78.84 US
cents, comparing with yesterday's close of 79.16 US cents.
</P>
<P>
The news that Japan saw a quarterly growth rate of 3.0 percent
in the first three months to March sent the US dollar down in
cross rates. A stronger Japanese economy is expected to strengthen
the country's currency against currencies in the dollar system,
prompting Japanese investors to dump the Australian dollar today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar weakened to 85.13 yen against the
Japanese yen from 85.83 yen on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was also weaker against the German mark, ending at 1.1930
marks from 1.2011 marks yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns Wheat Importers against Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cereal importers are
being warned of the possible spread of the disease ustilago in
wheat imported from India, according to a report of the local
daily The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The disease spreads when an odorous fungus replaces the wheat
kernel with black spores known as smut balls.
</P>
<P>
Some countries have already destroyed large quantities of wheat
imported from India which contained the infectious fungicides, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
If the disease were to enter Israel it could spread very
quickly and would be very difficult to eradicate, an announcement
of the Ministry of Agriculture said.
</P>
<P>
While there is no formal ban on Indian wheat imports, the
Ministry is urging importers to take great care in checking
produce.
</P>
<P>
Government officials, however, are stressing that there is no
risk to humans.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Makes Headway in Switchboard Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, China's first special
economic zone, generated a high growth in its production of
telephone switching systems, pushing the output to more than a
quarter of the country's total production capacity.
</P>
<P>
The city's two biggest switch suppliers, Huawei and
Zhongxingxin, received preliminary orders for 3.14 million lines
of switching machines at a national fair for program-controlled
switching systems in March. This accounted for 62 percent of the
entire transaction volume, according to the "Shenzhen Special Zone
Daily."
</P>
<P>
Held by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT), the
fair attracted all the major buyers in China, and the transactions
represented the country's total demand for the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The city's switching machine output stood at 300,000 lines in
1991. In 1995, its production capacity accounted for one-fourth of
the country's. To date, the city has more than 30 factories
specializing in switching machine manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The switching industry of Shenzhen will see vigorous growth
this year, because China's five major manufacturers of
program-controlled switches, including Shenzhen's Huawei and
Zhongxingxin, will receive heavier investment than before, as they
are listed alongside some 1,000 state-owned enterprises in a
large-scale aid program sponsored by the State Economic and Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to MPT's five-year development plan, China will
increase its telephone switching capacity to 174 million lines,
compared to 85 million lines in 1995. The national switching
volume will maintain an annual increase of between 15-20 million
lines over the next five years, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
So far, China's three most widely used switching models, 04, 08
and ZXJ10, are developed by Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa's New Diplomatic Initiative on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
has embarked on a diplomatic initiative to avert a blood-bath in
neighboring Burundi, with a plan for a regional summit soon.
</P>
<P>
The president has sent Col. Jakaya Kikwete, the Minister for
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation to deliver a series
of special messages to the regional leaders, starting with elder
statesman Daniel arap Moi of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Minister Kikwete left for Nairobi on Tuesday, according to a
local press today.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is getting worse in Burundi. It's high time we
avert further killings," an official of the foreign ministry told
reporters without elaberating.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports, however, indicated that a regional
intervention force may be set up to prevent blood-bath and
further complicating the refugee situation in Zaire and Tanzania
in particular.
</P>
<P>
Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, facilitator of recent talks among the
main Burundi political parties, Uprona and Frodebu, postponed
further talks lask week and moved toward regional and
international consultations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The message sent by Col. Kikwete is the latest diplomatic
initiative since the collapse of the second round of the talk in
the lakeside town of Mwanza.
</P>
<P>
Burundi political parties failed to agree on the framework
reached in an earlier round of talks and how to proceed into the
second part. The parties are supposed to re-examine their
postions before the talks are reconvend.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere had stated at a press conference late last week, the
putting off of the talks for two weeks. Fears that an all-out
civil war with a high incidence of massacres on both sides of the
ethnic divide plague diplomatic consultations in Dar Es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Political and diplomatic initiatives need to be taken to
improve the situation, the foreign ministry officials say, but no
agreement exists on what regional powers or the international
community are prepared to do.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, leaders from Burundi, Kenya,
Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Zaire and Ethiopia, which presently
chairs the OAU, are expected to meet in Arusha, northern Tanzania
but dates will be set after responses are received from the
respective heads of state.
</P>
<P>
Principal secretary Eli Mtango in the foreign ministry is
expected to deliver a message to Burundi leaders. Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni had talks with Mwalimu Nyerere and
President Mkapa on the situation in Burundi at a recent meeting
in Mwanza.
</P>
<P>
Killings and massacres are meanwhile continuing in the former
Belgian colony despite repeated appeals by regional leaders to
the various parties to end the fratricidal conflict.

<HEADLINE> Conventional War with Syria Cannot be Discounted: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Army's Deputy Chief
of Staff Matan Vilna'i has said that the danger of a conventional
war with Syria could not be discounted, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Vilna'i was quoted by the local daily Jerusalem Post as making
these remarks in an interview published today by the London-based
Jane's Defence Weekly.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that while the emphasis in the Israeli Army's
planning was moving toward anti-terrorism and "over-the-horizon"
operations, the danger of a conventional war with Syria could not
be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrian Army has some special forces in Lebanon and some
brigades on the Golan Heights border," said Vilna'i. "Except for
these units, all of their army is sitting in their barracks and
training all the time."
</P>
<P>
However, he said he was worried about the lack of training by
Israeli combat troops for a possible conventional war with Syria
as they are preoccupied with anti-terrorism and other duties.
</P>
<P>
Vilna'i vowed Israel must be ready "to fight the next major
conventional war," which is possible because of the absence of a
peace agreement with Syria, adding "we need to maintain and
modernize our armored formations, our jets and our navy."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli new government, led by hardline Likud Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has denied any compromise on its
self-claimed sovereignty over the Golan Heights Israel seized from
 Syria in 1967. Syria, meanwhile, has warned Israel that its tough
policies and continued occupation of the Golan Heights would lead
to renewed tension and violence.
</P>
<P>
Vilna'i pointed out that, in addition to the threat of
terrorism and the possible conventional war with Syria, Israel
was also preparing for the potential threats posed by Iran and
Libya.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be able to counter those as well. That required
new, over-the-horizon capabilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vilna'i was referring to the 25 F-15I long-range strike
aircraft which Israel will receive next year, as well as its
Dolphin-class submarines and Eilat-class missile corvettes, which
could be deployed off the Libyan coast, if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Dalian to Carry out New Medical Care Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Dalian will become the country's
first big city to practice new medical care measures, starting
July 1.
</P>
<P>
Like in other Chinese cities, the current public health
services in Dalian, a port city in northeast China, were
implemented in 1950s under the socialist planned economy, in which
employees in governmental departments and state-owned enterprises
receive free medical services.
</P>
<P>
Following medical reforms, employees began to pay a minor part
of their medical fees, but expenditures shouldered by the state
remained high.
</P>
<P>
The new medical security system will cover all types of
governmental departments and economic entities, including
foreign-funded ventures and private businesses.
</P>
<P>
Medical expenses will be shared by the state, work units and
individuals in accordance with an appropriate proportion.
</P>
<P>
Government departments and other institutions are required to
turn in 10.5 percent of the total pay to employees and retirees.
Businesses should turn in nine percent of the total pay to
workers, and individuals should turn in one percent of their
salary.
</P>
<P>
Part of the money will be saved in individuals' accounts, and
the rest will be used to establish an overall social medical fund.
</P>
<P>
Patients first must withdraw money from their own accounts, and
if the sum does not meet actual needs, they can receive
substantial allowances out of the fund.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the new measures help relieve the burden of the
state and enterprises, ensure better medical care of patients and
facilitate the flow of personnel among different work units.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa on Tanzania's Tourism Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- President Ben Mkapa said
his government would devote time, effort and resources to
creating a favorable environment for the private sector, both
local and foreign, to invest in and manage tourism in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the remarks during a luncheon hosted by his
highness the Aga Khan, to mark the official inauguration of
Serena Lodges in Lake Manyara, Serengeti and Ngorongoro at the
Lake Manyara Serenal Lodge in the northern tourist circuit in
Arusha on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that public investments and management of the
tourism sector had been far from satisfaction, saying, "we will
therefore devote time, efforts and resources in creating a
favorable environment for the private sector, both to invest and
to manage tourism development in tanzania."
</P>
<P>
Mining and tourism were two sectors which, if handled
properly, could provide quick results in contributing to the
country's economic recovery, he observed.
</P>
<P>
The president identified two irksome bottlenecks in the
tourism industry as the poor tourism infrastructure and marketing
of the tourism product aboard.
</P>
<P>
To remove these bottlenecks, the government had embarked on a
tourism infrastructure project financed by the World Bank, which
has earmarked some 130 million U.S. Dollars for the project.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said, because tourism is a highly competitive industry,
it is not enough to have fine lodges, breath-taking tourist
visits and attractions, and a good infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
It is equally important to offer consistently good service in
the entire tourism network, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed the hope that the Serena lodges would
be trend-setters in quality service. "It was for this reason that
tanzania has already identified tourism as the number one foreign
exchange earner by the year 2000," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today from Arusha,
President Mkapa appealed to the tourist board, investors and
other persons or agencies involved in tourism to become effective
partners in the industry "in pursuit of the common goal to put
Tanzania in its rightful place in the tourism world league."
</P>
<P>
The Aga Khan arrived here on Monday for a two-day visit to
Tanzania, having paid his last visit here in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Treasures of Buddhist Art Engage Academics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Experts at a joint Sino-US study
tour in Beijing Tuesday said they hope to enhance co-operation
in protecting and researching China's Buddhist art treasures.
</P>
<P>
According to today' China Daily, the study tour group consists
of 20 domestic and foreign researchers of Chinese art history. On
Monday the group kicked off the first leg of a month-long journey
in the capital, where they will stay for a week, visiting major
Buddhist temples and museums.
</P>
<P>
The scholars are doing on-site study of the remaining Buddhist
art of the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, which spanned the period
from 1271-1911.
</P>
<P>
Besides visiting temples and museums in the capital, they will
also go to the neighbouring provinces of Hebei and Shaanxi for the
rest of their journey, which have huge stores of Buddhist art,
according to organizers of the activity.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's greatest repositories of Buddhist art,
China has become an attractive place for art researchers as well
as tourists from China and abroad. Intellectual exchange in the
sector is growing, especially since the country began opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The study tour program, the first of a three-year series, is
expected to provide a good opportunity for researchers and
students of art to see Chinese Buddhist art up close.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Dialogue between the government
and various political parties in Zambia has been urged to find
ways for a solution to the present political strifes in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Ndola, northern Zambia, Law
Association of Zambia (LAZ) Chairman George Kunda, said, ''we are
very concerned as an association about the lack of dialogue
between the government and the various political parties,
regarding the constitution of Zambia amendments, issues
pertaining to governance and the maintenance of law and order in
Zambia.''
</P>
<P>
The current tension in Zambia needed to be addressed by all
concerned as it would ensure peace in the country, the local
press today quoted Kunda as saying in his statement dated June
18.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another organization the Zambia Indigenous has said
in a statement that the current power struggle in the country is
threatening to destabilize the nation.
</P>
<P>
The current political strife in Zambia is around a
constitutional amendment bill which was adopted in late May.
According to constitutional amendment, only aboriginals are
allowed to run presidence.
</P>
<P>
This amendment actually bars former president Kenneth Kaunda
from running the presidence in the general elections scheduled
later this year as his parents were immigrated from a neighboring
country.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties in the country are opposed to the
constitution amendment and they call for its repealing.

<HEADLINE> Summit Talks Between Nigeria, Cameroon Cancelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to resolve the border
dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon suffered a setback today
with the cancellation of the bilateral summit talks mediated by
Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema.
</P>
<P>
The abortive meeting was the third to resolve the land dispute
of the Bakassi Peninsula between Nigeria and Cameroon, according
to press reports in Lagos today.
</P>
<P>
''The June 19 talks, which has been cancelled by the
Cameroonian side, was expected to bridge the difference between
the two countries,'' said a statement from the Nigerian Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
It said Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim, also planned to join Nigerian Head of
State General Sani Abacha and Cameroonian President Paul Biya at
Kara, Togo.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government deplored the cancellation of the
meeting which it described as an opportunity for resolving the
land dispute of Bakassi.
</P>
<P>
Observers say President Biya hoped to meet General Abacha at
the venue of the OAU summit scheduled from July 8 to 10. Yaounde
is to host the OAU summit and Biya hoped to take the advantage of
his new post as the next OAU chairman.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear whether Abacha would attend the OAU
summit meeting in the Cameroonian capital though the Nigerian
government had said earlier that he would go.

BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China will stage its first
international exhibition and technology exchange seminar featuring
an electric vehicle and a vehicle that operates on a fuel
substitute.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which runs from December 6-12, will be jointly
sponsored by the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC)
and the Ministry of Machinery Industry.
</P>
<P>
Shi Dinghuan, director of SSTC's Industrial Science and
Technology Department, said the activities aim to promote the
development of the country's auto industry and related technology,
and to establish new channels for technological exchanges and
cooperation between China and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Leading domestic and overseas automobile and parts
manufacturers, and industry analysts will be invited to the
events, which take place in the China World Trade Center and the
China World Hotel.
</P>
<P>
China's auto industry policy was published about two years ago
to encourage the development of vehicles that use environmentally
safe energy.
</P>
<P>
The director said China is prepared to cooperate with overseas
auto producers to develop the country's electric vehicle industry
and fuel substitute vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Instead of using gas, the fuel substitute vehicle uses products
made from liquified natural gas, alcohol and hydrogen.

<HEADLINE> Nanning-Kunming Railway Evolves Record-high Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Nanning-Kunming railway,
passing through precipitous mountains and rushing waters,
represents the highest technology level in China's railway
building history, say railway experts.
</P>
<P>
The 898.7-km-long trunk line connecting Kunming, capital city
of Yunnan Province, with Nanning, capital city of Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, in southwest and south China, will have 447
railway bridges totalling over 80 km and 258 tunnels totalling
over 190 km in length.
</P>
<P>
Without the bridges and tunnels, which require complicated
technology to build, the railway would have to be built around the
mountains, a traditional method which can dramatically increase
the cost of the project.
</P>
<P>
One railway bridge across the Qingshui River on the line is the
the highest railway bridge in China, with the height from the
bottom of the river valley to the surface of the bridge being 182
meters.
</P>
<P>
The importance of the railway, which is a dream of several
generations of the Chinese people, lays in the fact that it will
not only connect the the three regions of Yunnan, Guizhou and
Guangxi, but also provide a passage for the underdeveloped and
land-locked regions to link to the sea, thus dramatically pushing
ahead the local economies, expert said.
</P>
<P>
The track-laying of the railway is expected to be completed
next March.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A new railway line exclusively for
coal transport recently has gone into operation in Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The 274-kilometer-long line from Shenmu to Shuozhouin in this
north China province has an annual carrying capacity of 20 million
tons. Construction of the railway began in 1991 at a cost of 5.48
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The line is a part of a trunk from Shenmu in the west to
Huanghua port in Hebei province in the east. Other sections of the
Shenmu-Huanghua line are under construction.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the entire system, the Shenmu-Huanghua
line will become the sole route used to transport coal from
Shenfudongsheng coal mine, which has the largest coal deposits in
China.
</P>
<P>
The Shenfudongsheng coal mine, on the borders of Shaanxi
Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has deposits of 230
billion tons.
</P>
<P>
At present, it produces 15 million tons of coal each year. By
the end of this century, its annual production is planned to reach
60 million tons, two thirds of which will be transported outside
the province.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen of Germany Gets Firm Foothold in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Volkswagen Group of Germany
has a firm foothold in the Chinese market due to 10 years of
planning and hard work.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Volkswagen's sales in China reached 218,032 units, up
46.3 percent from 1994, according to Andreas Meurer, public
relations manager of Volkswagen Asia-Pacific, who is currently
attending the Fourth Beijing International Automotive Industry
Exhibition.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1978, Volkswagen had already entered into
negotiations with China, leading to their first joint-venture
contract signed in October, 1984, and the establishment of the
Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Company Ltd. (SVW).
</P>
<P>
This was followed by a license agreement signed between First
Automotive Works (FAW) in Changchun and Volkswagen in 1988 to
produce the Audi 100, and a second joint-venture between FAW and
Volkswagen in 1991, called FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Company
Ltd. (FAW-VW).
</P>
<P>
Meurer said that in contrast to many European and American
companies which are scrambling to jump on the speeding train,
Volkswagen recognized the trend in Asia early on.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese, whose income levels are rising, want
to buy cars of their own.
</P>
<P>
Since China's policy of opening and reform was initiated in
1979, many people, especially those in coastal areas, have become
wealthy, and they are the practical and potential car buyers, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen's underlying strategy for launching the car
production joint venture with Chinese partners is to gain an early
foothold in the promising Chinese market with its significant
long-term opportunities, he explained. Another objective is the
establishment of a bridgehead in China from which to compete
successfully in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said the local presence of Volkswagen products has now risen
close to 90 percent for the Santana, around 70 percent for the
Audi 100, and more than 60 percent for the Jetta.
</P>
<P>
To help the Chinese suppliers increase productivity and
quality, Volkswagen has established a Local-Content-Team located
in its Beijing office.
</P>
<P>
According to a report published by the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) in the 1990s, the auto market
in industrial nations is expected to grow 1-2 percent. But in the
next 20 years, the increase of car production in such regions as
East Europe, China, India and other developing countries will
account for 60 percent of the total increase in the world's car
output.
</P>
<P>
Thus, large auto-producing countries are forced and anxious to
look for new markets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese State Planning Commission report showed Tuesday that
by the year 2010, the country will have 45-50 million motor
vehicles, and the yearly demand is expected to soar to 5-6.5
million units.

<HEADLINE> 40,000 New AIDs Cases Recorded in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 40,000 new aids cases
were reported in Zimbabwe in 1995, the National Aids Coordination
Program (NACP) has said.
</P>
<P>
''It is estimated that the actual number of new AIDs cases
that occurred in 1995 could be more than 40,000, bringing the
estimated total cumulative to more than 150,000 as at end of
December,'' NACP said in a statement published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
there was an increase in the number of tuberculosis (tb) cases
with more than 22,000 notifications from January to September,
compared to 17,000 during the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
''The worsening AIDs situation is one of the major factors
contributing to the increase in tb,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
''Rationale and decisive action need to be marshalled in the
face of the many challenges that AIDs poses to individuals,
families, communities, organizations, the private sector and
government,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said 1995 had seen the intensification of a
multi-sectoral approach to the AIDs epidemic.
</P>
<P>
in Zimbabwe, more than a million people out of a population of
10.5 million, are believed to be infected with the HIV virus, an
estimated 300 are said to be dying every week due AIDs-related
diseases.

MASAYA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Cuban national
baseball swept the host Nicaraguan side 5-0 after 9-3 win in their
fifth and last game on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, in preparation for the Atlanta Olympic Games, pounded
Nicaraguan pitchers for nine hits, including two home runs by
Orestes Kindelan.
</P>
<P>
Despite a less than spectacular performance by Cuban superstar

the bats of Kindelan, Antonio Scull and Rey Isaac, who pounded
Nicaraguan pitching throughout the series.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua has now lost 12-consecutive games -- five to the
gold medal favourites from Cuba, four to the United States and

<HEADLINE> Painted Pottery Figurine of Ethnic Beauty Found in Princess' Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A painted pottery figurine of a
beautiful woman from a northwestern nationality has been unearthed
from the tomb of a princess and her husband, dated from the Tang
Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
The beauty was one of more than 200 painted pottery figurines
that had been stolen from a tomb in the eastern suburb of
Xi'an. The tomb belonged to the first emperor's granddaughter and
her husband, an offspring of Yu Jin, a famous minister who
contributed greatly to the establishment of the Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Dressed in Han clothing, the beauty has the upturned nose and
hollow eyes particular to the Hu, a nationality which lived during
ancient days in the northwestern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Tang poems have depicted similar beauties who came to Changan,
the present-day city of Xi'an in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, which was the capital of Tang.
</P>
<P>
Other recovered figurines represent scenes of the noble
family's life, such as hunting and banquets.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists also valued figurines of Hu hunters who
had eagles sitting on their arms, and Persian dogs and a leopard
running after them.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that these are the first pottery figurines that
depict hunting with a leopard.
</P>
<P>
Figurines of Han people dressed in Hu garments also have been
found.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows More Young Chinese Run Risk of Hypertension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A national survey has found young
Chinese people run greater risks of suffering from high blood
pressure compared the same age group in the 1950s, mainly due to
changing lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
The average age of incidence of the disease is ten years
younger than it used to be, according to survey results from
people above age 15.
</P>
<P>
About 15 percent of people in the 15-35 age group suffer from
the disease, and 26.5 percent of people over 35 are also
hypertension patients, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Youth Daily" carried the survey, and said that
the fact that the number of young hypertension sufferers increased
in recent years is serious and needs to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate of hypertension in China has gone up from
5.1 percent in 1959 to the current rate of more than 11
percent. About 3.5 million new hypertension cases are reported
each year.
</P>
<P>
The rising incidence rate was attributed to people's
lifestyles, which have greatly changed in the past four decades,
representing an increase in smoking and the greater intake of
high-fat, sodium-rich food.
</P>
<P>
Cardiac and cerebral vascular disease, cancer and respiratory
illness are the three most serious diseases reported in both urban
and rural areas in China. Hypertension is a major contributing
factor to these chronic diseases, according to sources from the
Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate in rural areas is also close to that in
cities.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey among 100,000 farmers in the Fangshan District
of suburban Beijing showed that about 45 percent of people over
the age of 60 suffer from hypertension.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts and public health officials have called for
immediate actions to spread public knowledge on hypertension
control and to speed up research for more effective and safer
medicines.
</P>
<P>
About 200 experts and officials with the Ministry of Public
Health attended a national symposium on hypertension prevention
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed expanding the use of traditional Chinese
medicines to treat hypertension and related complications.

WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Injuried Dominique Moceanu and
Shannon Miller, America's Key women gymnasts, will miss this
weekend's Olympic Trials in Boston, but both can still earn their
spots in the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
The USA Gymnastics has approved Moceanu and Miller's petitions
Tuesday. They can gain a spot in the Olympics team if their scores
from the national meet earlier this year rank among the top seven
at the trials.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who is suffering from a sore wrist, was the all-around
champion at the national meet with 78.38 points, which were high
enough to hold up at the trials.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old Moceanu has a stress fracture of the right leg
and has been advised by doctors not to compete at the trials.
</P>
<P>
Moceanu finished third with 78.220 points. It is uncertain if
her score will be good enough to qualify.
</P>
<P>
Moceanu became the youngest United States gymnastics champion
when, at 13, she surpassed Miller and Dominique Dawes at the 1995
national championships.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Newly-elected MPs May Take Oath Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's newly-elected members
of parliament (MPs) are likely to start taking oath of office next
Sunday, sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the oath-taking ceremony earlier was
planned to start this Friday with the Awami League (AL) taking the
lead, but no party was willing to take oath on the following day,
Saturday, because of "superstition."
</P>
<P>
The parliament secretariat has already prepared letters
inviting the MPs-elect for the swearing-in, hoping the oath-taking
ceremony to be completed in three consecutive days, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the MPs-elect have been asked by top leaders of their
respective parties to stay in the capital for the oath-taking.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh held its 7th parliamentary elections in a total of
300 constituencies last Wednesday. However, voting in 122 polling
stations of 27 constituencies was suspended due to violence and
alleged vote rigging.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission therefore ordered the repolling in the
122 polling stations for today while announcing the results of 273
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
According to the official announcement, the Awami League (AL)
has taken the lead by winning 134 seats out of the 273 declared
seats while the former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
finished second with 104 seats, followed by the Jatiya Party with
29 seats.
</P>
<P>
Today's repolling could yield a majority for Sheikh Hasina's
Awami League in the next government. The AL has also won support
of the Jatiya Party and decided to hold its first parliamentary
party meeting on June 21.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former prime minister Khaleda Zia's BNP has accused
the AL of playing vote rigging in the June 12 elections and
today's repolling.

<HEADLINE> Emerson to Increase Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The US's Emerson Electric Co., one
of the world's largest industrial companies, plans to increase
investment in China, in addition to the more than 100 million US
dollars it has already injected in the country.
</P>
<P>
Charles F. Knight, chairman and CEO of Emerson, revealed
Emerson's investment strategy in China at an opening ceremony of
the Emerson's newest joint venture in China held Tuesday here.
</P>
<P>
Asia, and particularly China, is a rapidly growing market for
electrical and electronic products, and is urging Emerson to pour
large investment in the areas, said Knight.
</P>
<P>
Emerson expects to earn more than 600 million US dollars in
total turnover in China this year.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of 9.5 million US dollars, the Beijing Rosemount Far
East Instrument Co., Ltd. was set up late last year between
Emerson's wholly owned division, Rosemount. Inc., and the Beijing
Far East Instrument Company. Emerson contributed 80 percent of the
investment.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will produce and service high-quality
pressure and temperature transmitters for oil, natural gas,
petrochemical, power and other processing industries in the
Asia-Pacific Region. In its start-up phase, it will focus on
China's market.
</P>
<P>
Emerson has more than 6,000 employees and 14 factories in
China, seven of which are joint ventures. The other seven are
wholly-owned by Emerson.
</P>
<P>
Emerson has committed more than 100 million US dollars of
investment to China, with exports surpassing imports in the
country.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, Emerson also signed agreements to donate
more than 1.2 million yuan to support research work for 12 Ph.D
dissertations on technology in four universities in the country.

<HEADLINE> Housing Figures Foreshadow Stronger Australian Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia's economy is to grow
faster later this year as official figures showed a turnaround in
the housing industry.
</P>
<P>
After 18 months of consecutive quarterly declines, the number
of building starts rose 4.4 percent seasonally adjusted in the
first quarter of this year over the December quarter of 1995, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the Housing Industry Association (HIA)
Ron Silberberg said that the industry was now in the best shape in
two years.
</P>
<P>
"The recent round of reductions in mortgage interest rates and
a general improvement in buyer confidence observed earlier in the
year should lead to further increases in dwelling starts in the
second half of 1996," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, ABS figures showed that the country's economy was
growing at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the March quarter.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration of economic recovery in Australia's top two
export markets, Japan and the United States, is expected to spur
higher growth rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the housing industry has yet to come out of its
trough. Building starts figures in the March quarter was still
22.2 percent below that in the same period of last year.

They said that according to the compromise, coeducation in
Kuwait University and other higher education institutions may be
banned in five years while the segregation may not be imposed on
private foreign schools.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was waiting for a decision of the
government after it was approved by the parliament and referred
to the cabinet last month, had caused a hot debate between
its supporters and the opposition camp across the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
The compromise came after members of the parliament's
Education Committee met Crown Prince and Prime Minister
Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah for more than five hours Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah said that "the government will not be an obstacle in
front of any law that seeks the implementation of the Islamic
Shariah (Islamic laws)."
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Kuwait Times said today that "the
compromise seems to be giving the Islamists all they want
regarding segregation in higher institutions while allowing for
some leeway to private schools."

<HEADLINE> China Is in Seismic Active Period, Chinese Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China is in the final
earthquake-prone period of the century, said Chinese geophysicist
and seismologist Chen Yong.
</P>
<P>
Chen based his conclusion on the strong earthquakes that took
place in southwest China's Yunnan province early this year, and
also in May in Baotou, in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
China has experienced four seismic active periods since the
beginning of this century, according to statistics, forecasts and
experts' judgement. The fifth seismic active period started in the
late 1980s and will last to the next century, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there will be more earthquakes in China
during the remaining five years of this century.
</P>
<P>
China is a country which has many inland earthquakes and
suffers serious damage from seismic disasters, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
It is located in the area between the world's two largest
seismic zones: the region surrounding the Pacific Ocean and the
Euro-Asian seismic zones, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
The country has developed 23 earthquake rift zones, and nearly
all of them have suffered from strong earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since the beginning of the century,
earthquakes measuring at or above six on the Richter Scale have
occurred in the country's 29 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
More than 550,000 Chinese people have died in seismic disasters
since 1900, accounting for 53 percent of the world's total deaths
due to earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 destructive earthquakes have hit 22 provinces and
autonomous regions throughout the country, with casualties from
these disasters accounting for 54 percent of the country's total
disaster death toll.
</P>
<P>
These earthquakes affected 300,000 sq km and damaged more than
seven million houses.
</P>
<P>
China has made great efforts to reduce the losses of earthquake
disasters and set a ten-year target for their prevention.
</P>
<P>
Governments in large and middle-sized cities, populous areas
and economically-developed areas are encouraged to improve
anti-earthquake capacities.
</P>
<P>
With State Council approval, China will establish an "at-risk"
list of 21 key seismic monitoring and prevention zones and 13 key
cities around these zones, based on their population and economic
development in 1996, according to a spokesman from the State
Seismological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The area of these zones and cities accounts for 10 percent of
the country's total. Earthquake-produced losses in these areas are
estimated at 60 percent of the country's total.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Hopes to Cooperate with China: Conte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Lansana Conte, visiting president
of the Republic of Guinea, said here today that Guinea hopes to
cooperate with China to explore its resources.
</P>
<P>
Guinea forged diplomatic relations with China 37 years ago,
after its independence. Since then, Conte said, the country has
had good political, economic and social relations of cooperation
with China, and such cooperations continue to grow strong.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is inspired by China's unselfish and
unhesitant desire to help Guinea's development efforts. Conte said
China was the first country to lend assistance to Guinea following
a military coup in February.
</P>
<P>
He called the bilateral economic cooperation "fruitful," and
said that because Guinea is rich in resources, many opportunities
exist for cooperation with China in several areas, including the
exploitation of bauxite, iron ore and gold. He added that Guinea
hopes China, as a friendly and brotherly nation, will do its
utmost to help Guinea's development and construction.
</P>
<P>
Conte also answered questions concerning Guinea's domestic
situation.
</P>
<P>
The president and his party will leave the Chinese capital this
afternoon for Hainan, China's southernmost province.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Newly-elected MPs May Take Oath Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's newly-elected members
of parliament (MPs) are likely to start taking oath of office next
Sunday, sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the oath-taking ceremony earlier was
planned to start this Friday with the Awami League (AL) taking the
lead, but no party was willing to take oath on the following day,
Saturday, because of "superstition."
</P>
<P>
The parliament secretariat has already prepared letters
inviting the MPs-elect for the swearing-in, hoping the oath-taking
ceremony to be completed in three consecutive days, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the MPs-elect have been asked by top leaders of their
respective parties to stay in the capital for the oath-taking.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh held its 7th parliamentary elections in a total of
300 constituencies last Wednesday. However, voting in 122 polling
stations of 27 constituencies was suspended due to violence and
alleged vote rigging.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission therefore ordered the repolling in the
122 polling stations for today while announcing the results of 273
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
According to the official announcement, the Awami League (AL)
has taking the lead by winning 134 seats out of the 273 declared
seats while the former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
finished second with 104 seats, followed by the Jatiya Party with
29 seats.
</P>
<P>
Today's repolling could yield a majority for Sheikh Hasina's
Awami League in the next government. The AL has also won support
of the Jatiya Party and decided to hold its first parliamentary
party meeting on June 21.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former prime minister Khaleda Zia's BNP has accused
the AL of playing vote rigging in the June 12 elections and
today's repolling.

<HEADLINE> Australian FM to Visit South Korea, Hong Kong, Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Minister for Foreign
Affairs, Alexander Downer, announced here today that he will visit
the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Cameroon from 30
June to 10 July.
</P>
<P>
The visit, he said, represented the commitment his government
has made to closer engagement with Asia, and will enable him to
establish personal contact with governments and other senior
figures.
</P>
<P>
Australia believes the visit to South Korea is of particular
importance, as South Korea is the second largest export market and
fourth largest import source. Besides, the two countries are also
forging a close political and military partnership, and the first
Australia-South Korea political-military talks will take place on
8 July.
</P>
<P>
At least 350 Australian companies are doing business in Hong
Kong, employing over 10,000 staff. In 1995, Hong Kong was
Australia's eighth largest export market and fourth largest source
of investment with two-way trade valued at 3.05 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Downer told reporters that his visit to Vietnam will underscore
his government's commitment to building a constructive and
co-operative relationship with ASEAN's newest member. Over the
past five years, the bilateral trade has grown steadily and
Australian investments in Vietnam totaled around 730 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
As foreign minister since last March, Downer has already
visited six countries in the region -- Thailand, Indonesia,
Singapore, Japan, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the effective curb on
foreign camera smuggling, sales of domestic cameras surged by 30
percent in the first quarter of this year over the same period of
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce said here today that as a result of the crackdown on the
smuggling of foreign cameras, which went unchecked in recent
years, a camera registration system was designed jointly by the
administration and the Ministry of Machine-Building Industry.
</P>
<P>
Under this system, all cameras on sale must be registered with
the local administration of industry and commerce. Owners and
operators who don't register their cameras will be investigated.
</P>
<P>
In April, about 1.2 million cameras from 20 provinces and
municipalities across the country had been registered, the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Adventurer Killed in Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Urumqi, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A well-known Chinese explorer was
found dead in a northwestern desert after a 70-hour search by
rescuers.
</P>
<P>
The body of Yu Chunshun, 48, was found Tuesday morning in his
tent in Lop Nur, a desert in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He went into the desert alone on June 11 to explore the ruin of
the ancient city of Loulan, and carried with him a two-day supply
of food and water.
</P>
<P>
His companions believed that the Shanghainese would succeed, as
he had walked through many dangerous places in China during the
past eight years, including the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the
Takalamakan Desert, also in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
He lost contact with the camp on June 14, and fellow explorers
reported Yu's missing to the local tourism bureau. A rescue
mission was launched with the help of a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Yu's body was black and covered with blisters when it was
recovered.
</P>
<P>
Other adventurers said that when Yu ventured into the desert on
June 12, there was a gale and the ground temperature was 70
degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Lop Nur was once an oasis on the legendary Silk Road, but it
was later buried by sand due to the change of the direction of the
Tarim River, which had long nurtured it.
</P>
<P>
The flourishing trade route began to decline about 1,500 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1900s, a Swedish explorer discovered the
2,000-year-old Loulan city in the sand.
</P>
<P>
Many archeologists and amateur adventurers have been attracted
by its mysteries, ignoring the dangers of the massive desert. In
1981, Peng Jiamu, a noted scientist from the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, was reported missing in the region.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Xinjiang local government issued a notice
to ban unauthorized expeditions or tourist groups from entering
Loulan in order to protect its relics.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear if Yu's expedition was approved by the local
authorities.

<P>
Karpov made his moves in two hours 57 minutes; Kamsky in three
hours eight minutes. Kamsky faced a tough fight Wednesday when the

<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua)-- Trust has become a key word between
government officials and local people in south China's Pearl River
Delta, where service with a smile is normal.
</P>
<P>
It has become an area where a Party secretary moved with his
entire staff to an old dining hall and made their lavish office
building a kindergarten for 300 children and an old folk's home.
</P>
<P>
It is where officials sang songs together with local people who
donated 20 million yuan to build a gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials in some parts of China can be
obsessed about their difficult relations with the community.
</P>
<P>
But their counterparts in the Pearl River Delta, the country's
most economically prosperous region in Guangdong Province, have
formed a "cordial and cooperative" relationship with the people
they serve.
</P>
<P>
"Since the officials have made real concrete efforts for the
benefit of the city and the people, and not for themselves, we
have no reason to distrust them," a local private entrepreneur
said.
</P>
<P>
When the municipal government in Dongguan City, famous for its
fireworks, received more letters and visits from local people in
1992 than the previous year, protesting about irresponsible real
estate development, the obscure use of the money from selling the
land, and invasion of farmland, they immediately set up a special
office, and put it under the direct leadership of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
The office sent investigation groups into the areas people
complained about most, and cleared up the financial accounts and
the occupation of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Economic prosperity has not only aroused people's interest in
government affairs, but also stimulated their need for high
quality education.
</P>
<P>
A small town in Zhongshan City invested a total of 25 million
yuan in recent years to boost its English and computer education.
</P>
<P>
What the government did for the people provided immediate
rewards. When the town decided to build a 30 million yuan
gymnasium this year, its residents voluntarily donated two thirds
of the cost, and their only request was that each of the town's
heads and Party secretary sing a song for them at a gathering.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, letters and visits from people complaining about
officials attending lavish banquets and riding luxurious cars have
become less and less these days within the delta.

<P>
The 15th of each month is important to the people living in the
Pearl River Delta. That is the day they can go directly to the
mayor and voice their opinions.
</P>
<P>
In Zhongshan City, the mayor together with directors of all the
departments of the city government, stay in their offices on that
day to receive visits from the people. The proposals or complaints
are handed over to relevant departments within three days, and
they should be relayed to people before the 10th of the following
month.
</P>
<P>
This system started in 1986 and by the end of last year the
mayor has received more than 8,300 people, with over 70 percent of
the problems solved.
</P>
<P>
This city has also established a "Special Mail for Mayor"
scheme to make things convenient for people unable to visit the
mayor on the 15th, so that they can send their opinions to the
mayor by special mail.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring city Dongguan has established a similar system and
also the "Mayor's Hotline". Its mayor, Li Jinwei, alone received
more than 800 people in 1995 and has carried out on-the-spot
investigations with complainants.
</P>
<P>
"A large majority of contradictions originate from the
grassroots. And through this system, we can solve most of them at
the grassroots level to make our work more easy and timely, and to
avoid more losses," said the mayor.
</P>
<P>
Other mayors in the region hold similar views. Some of them
said that along with economic development, they have become busy
all the time. This system has provided a "solid channel" for them
to communicate with the people.

<P>
It has now been a common understanding for officials in the
Pearl River Delta that the more the economy grows, the more
important are the opinions of the people.
</P>
<P>
Through the regular face-to-face meeting between the mayor and
the people, and through the special mail and the hotline,
government officials now have a clearer idea about what people are
most concerned about.
</P>
<P>
When the system made its debut 10 years ago, 70 percent of the
problems people raised were about housing. Investigations found
that in Zhongshan City alone at least 2,000 families were still
living in less than six square meters for each person.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the municipal government set up a special housing
office and pooled more than 100 million yuan to build apartment
buildings. By 1992, they had built a total of 5,000 flats with
floor space exceeding 400,000 square meters, and about 20,000
people have benefited.
</P>
<P>
According to information the municipal government collected,
many school teachers were still living in shabby houses that
caused complaints. The city government decided to invest 10
million yuan each year for five consecutive years from 1994 to
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, a town in the city decided to build a new kindergarten
and a welfare garden for the elderly people. They selected five
locations for the residents to choose. Unfortunately the residents
were not satisfied with any of the sites.
</P>
<P>
What did really satisfy them was the office building of the
township government, because it is located in exactly the center
of the town.
</P>
<P>
When the Party secretary of the town, Li Wubiao, heard this
information, he decided immediately to move out.
</P>
<P>
Last December, more than 100 officials from a dozen of
departments in the town moved out of their offices to an old
dining hall. Their office building has now been decorated into a
garden for more than 300 children and about 30 elderly people.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Party Chief Flays Coalition Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- President of Nepal's main ruling
Nepali Congress (NC) party Girija Prasad Koirala has again
strongly criticized a coalition partner for breaking the
understanding reached before forming the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Koirala told local reporters Tuesday at his residence that the
second ruling National Democratic Party (RPP) should realize its
bargaining point has ended now, according to a local newspaper
report today.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the recent reshuffle of the cabinet by
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to promote the rankings of some
cabinet members from the RPP.
</P>
<P>
Koirala, a former prime minister, earlier openly accused the
RPP of its "lust for ministerial posts."
</P>
<P>
However, he said on Tuesday that his party has no other option
but to continue the alliance with the RPP as only NC and RPP can
provide a stable government.
</P>
<P>
The RPP, with its 19 MPs in the 205-seat lower house, holds the
key to the survival of the present NC-led coalition government as
NC and its rival opposition the Communist (uml) Party have 86 and
88 seats respectively in the house.
</P>
<P>
The RPP occupies 15 seats in the present 48-strong cabinet, or
the council of ministers, under the prime minister from the NC
party.
</P>
<P>
"RPP has bargained to the limit and it must realize it can't
bargain any further," Koirala was quoted by the Kathmandu Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Koirala on Tuesday also criticized the prime minister for
announcing the cabinet reshuffle last week despite advises to the
contrary from other NC party leaders including himself.

<HEADLINE> India's Left Parties Oppose Government's Austerity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Ministry's drive
to cut down government expenditure has hit a snag with the
communist parties demanding an immediate withdrawal of the
"so-called austerity measures" announced on Monday, The Indian
Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The package of austerity measures, including drastic reduction
in government manpower and weeping out of "redundant" government
schemes, are designed to bring down fiscal deficit to below 4
percent of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The politburo of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM)
and the central secretariat of the Communist Party of India (CPI)
have issued strongly-worded statements against Finance Minister P.
Chidamabaram for crossing the boundaries of the Common Minimum
Program (CMP) agreed by the 13 constituents of the ruling United
Front.
</P>
<P>
The CPM noted that as a minister of the coalition, Chidamabaram
has gone beyond the commitments made in the CMP.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that while the CMP assures the working class job
security, the first action of the finance minister is to axe
existing jobs.
</P>
<P>
The CPI also expressed similar objections to the austerity
measures, demanding that such major steps should not be taken
without being cleared by the United Front Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>
The communist parties will decide their course of action after
discussing the issue with other left front partners and trade
unions.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Lebed Bets, Will He Win? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The news of Alexander Lebed's
alliance with incumbent President Boris Yeltsin came as a bigger
surprise than the retired general's third place in the June 16
first round of Russia's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's campaign team on Monday morning expressed the hope
for cooperation with Lebed. In the afternoon both sides made up
their minds.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning the deal was made public: Yeltsin named
Lebed as head of the Security Council and his national security
assistant with "enlarged" powers; Lebed promised that most of his
voters would vote for Yeltsin in the second round of the elections.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed member of the Lebed's team said that Lebed's
bargaining with the Kremlin started with the office of first
deputy prime minister, if not the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's supporters are euphoric about Lebed's participation
in the presidential camp, considering Lebed's backing as vital for
Yeltsin's possible victory over his only rival, Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov, in the presidential runoff early next
month.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of Sunday's ballot gave Yeltsin first place
among all ten presidential candidates, with a slight lead of
nearly 3 percentage points over Zyuganov, who came in second with
32.13 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
"Their joint potential is higher than that when they moved
separately," presidential political aide Georgy Starov said.
</P>
<P>
Colonel-General Eduard Vorobyov, member of the State Duma
(lower house of parliament) Defense Committee, hailed Yeltsin's
decision to ally with Lebed as wise.
</P>
<P>
He believed that by the year 2000 Lebed, 46, will be a
still-young but already-experienced politician. If he shows well
at his two new posts, his chances to win the 2000 presidential
polls will be very high, Vorobyov added.
</P>
<P>
After he announced Lebed's appointment on Tuesday morning,
Yeltsin told reporters in the Kremlin that Lebed may become his
successor in a few years.
</P>
<P>
However, Zyuganov, obviously confused by the decision of his
until recently potential ally in the second round, did not bother
to hide his disappointment but refrained from criticism. He
confined himself to recalling that "Lebed built his election
campaign on very tough, fundamental criticism of the current
government."
</P>
<P>
Another communist, Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov, viewed
Lebed's alliance with Yeltsin as an end to the general's political
career. "This is an end of Lebed as a politician," he said,
explaining that Lebed has no party or public movement behind him
and ensured the third place in Sunday polls only thanks to his
personal characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that he (Lebed) would bring many votes to
Yeltsin," Seleznyov said. Yabloko Bloc leader Grigory Yavlinsky,
placed fourth in the first round, shared the same opinion.
</P>
<P>
Some sources close to the Kremlin said Lebed's decision to side
with Yeltsin, which observers here regard as an improvisation, had
been contemplated beforehand. Yeltsin's election team under his
first aide Viktor Ilyushin had started building bridges in advance.
</P>
<P>
Whether Lebed's choice makes sense will become clear after the
second round. The decision to vote for him and his promise of
"truth and order" was purely emotional for many voters and the
structure of his supporters is unclear, some observers said.
</P>
<P>
It is very likely that despite Lebed's public call on
television for support for Yeltsin, the president will receive
only part of Lebed's votes, they said. Lebed won 14.7 percent of
the vote in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Yeltsin's chances of winning over voters who chose
Sunday between Lebed and Zyuganov, and Lebed and ultra-nationalist
leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, look bleak, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's decision will prove justified if he, with Lebed's
help, beats Zyuganov in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Lebed's choice will prove justified if he really becomes a
leading figure in the Kremlin and eventually a realistic successor
to the presidency.

<HEADLINE> Former Bangladeshi Ruling Party Fears Vote Rigging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The former ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has expressed fears that today's repolling
in 27 constituencies would be rigged by its rivals.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh held its 7th parliamentary election on June 12 in
300 constituencies. But the Election Commission (EC) ordered a
revote for today since the June 12 polling in 27 constituencies
was suspended due to various disturbances such as violent
incidents and alleged vote rigging.
</P>
<P>
According to the official results announced by the EC, the BNP
won 104 seats and its arch rival Awami (people's) League (AL) won
134 seats out of the 273 declared seats in the June 12 election.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published here today, the BNP chairperson and
former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia said that "the June 12
confirmed election victory of BNP was snatched away through a
planned rigging" and the AL has prepared for the rigging and is
snatching away ballots in today's repolling.
</P>
<P>
The statement hoped the caretaker government and the EC to
perform their constitutional responsibilities by ensuring
congenial atmosphere for holding a free, fair and neutral
repolling.

HONG KONG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Jusco Japan, a department store
operator, is planning to set up a regional base in Hong Kong next
year to oversee its business in Southeast Asia and China.
</P>
<P>
The regional headquarters will look after the general
merchandise store business in Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and
China, and develop more outlets in Southeast Asia, according to
Tatsuichi Yamaguchi, managing director of Jusco Japan.

the region, especially in Hong Kong and China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jusco Japan holds about 70 percent stake in the Hong Kong-based

<HEADLINE> Central American Ministers Discuss Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from around
Central America opened a meeting here today to discuss the
establishment of a training institute for police and other
regional security issues.
</P>
<P>
The 13th meeting of the Central American Security Commission,
held at the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry, is attended by deputy
foreign and interior ministers from the region.
</P>
<P>
Topping their agenda will be the building of a Central American
police training institute in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is extremely important for Central
Americans to have a regional institute where our police can be
trained and professionalized," said Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Ernesto Leal at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The institute will aim to modernize and coordinate police
bodies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Another major topic to be discussed at the meeting is the
ratification of the Central American Security Treaty, signed by
the presidents of the region in Honduras last December.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will also review a treaty on the recovery
of stolen vehicles signed at the same summit and the elimination
of anti-personnel mines in the region.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia, Russia Compound Border Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- There is not any dispute on the
Mongolian-Russian border and the situation of border areas is
stable and quiet, said Palamyn Sundeb, head of the Border
Department of Mongolian Border Army.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent response to Commander of Transbaikalia District
of the Russian Border Guard Troops General Voitinko, who told
Itar-Tass recently that the situation in Russian-Mongolian border
is increasingly tense because illegal crossing cases have
threatened Russian security, Sundeb said Voitinko's remarks are
not true.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper "The World Press" Tuesday carried a statement
by Sundeb who outlined a package of bilateral agreements signed by
the two countries over the border issue, which were aimed at a
better settlement of issues concerning the border.
</P>
<P>
On June 11, the border officials from the two nations met to
discuss a plan on further cooperation in the second half of this
year and they agreed that the situation of the border was stable
and no annoying issues existed, said Sundeb.
</P>
<P>
The two states cooperated very well in late 1995 in the fight
against crimes in the Ubsa-Tuva border area, in which most illegal
crossing happened, said the press, quoting Sundeb.
</P>
<P>
A conference, which was chaired by Mongolian President
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat and attended by officials from departments
concerned in Ulaangom, Mongolia, earlier this year, passed a
resolution to further improve the conditions of the border
areas. The resolution is under enforcement now, added the press.
</P>
<P>
Under the official statistics of Mongolia, since the beginning
of 1996, there have been 42 illegal border crossings by 19
Mongolians and 28 crossings by 63 Russians.

<HEADLINE> Durdibnets Named Ukrainian First Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Law expert and anti-corruption
supremo Vasily Durdibnets was today appointed Ukraine's first
deputy prime minister to replace Pavel Lazarenko, who became prime
minister last month after Evgeni Marchuk was sacked.
</P>
<P>
Durdibnets, 58, a legal expert and former deputy prime minister
in charge of anti-corruption, organized crime and emergencies, was
born in the Transcarpathia region in southwest Ukraine and
graduated from the Ivan Franko State University in 1960.
</P>
<P>
He served as Ukraine's deputy interior minister between
1978-1991 and from April 1991 to May 1994, he served as chairman
of the internal and external security committee of Ukraine's
Supreme Soviet (parliament) and first deputy chairman of the
Supreme Soviet.
</P>
<P>
Later, he served as deputy chairman of the presidential
committee for fighting corruption and organized crime and was
appointed deputy prime minister in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
Evgeni Marchuk, 55, was sacked as prime minister on May 27 by
President Leonid Kuchma for mishandling the country's economy and
for failing to ensure a stable and efficient cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Yabloko Ready to Join Government Pursuing Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian economist and reformer
Grigory Yavlinsky said today that the Yabloko bloc he leads is
ready to participate in the work of a government that would really
carry out reforms.
</P>
<P>
But he said he wanted to know what changes President Boris
Yeltsin proposed to make to his government and policies before he
would be prepared to support him in the forthcoming second round
presidential election run-off between Yeltsin and his archrival
Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
"I would be ready to have any post in a government" which
would be free of corruption, stop the Chechen war, accord private
property the highest value and make human rights the cornerstone
of its policy, Yavlinsky told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky, who won 7.41 percent of the votes in Sunday's
presidential election, is fourth behind President Boris Yeltsin
with 35.06 percent, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov with
31.96 percent and retired general Alexander Lebed with 14.70
percent.
</P>
<P>
As none of the ten candidates won over 50 percent of the votes,
the top two, Yeltsin and Zyuganov, will battle it out in a run-off
scheduled early next month, in which Lebed and Yavlinsky could
play a decisive role.
</P>
<P>
Lebed has already thrown his support behind Yeltsin in return
for a job as national security adviser and secretary of the
powerful Russian Security Council and the sacking of unpopular
defense minister Pavel Grachev, a demand also made by Yavlinsky
during talks with Yeltsin about forming an alliance in the run-up
to the election.
</P>
<P>
Lebed later told reporters that most of his 11 million
supporters would vote for Yeltsin in the runoff.
</P>
<P>
But Yavlinsky, whose support could also prove crucial, said he
believed only a small number of Lebed's supporters would be
prepared to vote for Yeltsin in the run-off.
</P>
<P>
The eventual number will depend on how convincingly Lebed can
explain to his voters why he has agreed to join Yeltsin's team, he
added.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he was prepared to follow Lebed and join
Yeltsin, Yavlinsky said, "I have no problem with employing
myself. I am not looking for a job."
</P>
<P>
Pressed on what kind of posts Yeltsin could offer to
Yabloko members in exchange for supporting his candidacy,
Yavlinsky said that was not the issue.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a deal. What we are fighting for now is not
government seats," he said, recalling that he was deputy prime
minister in 1990 but quit over disagreements with government
policy.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Yabloko bloc, which was established in 1993,
said delegates from its 62 regional branches will make a final
decision on whether or not to support Yeltsin at their congress on
June 21-22 in Moscow.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- At least six American Army
personnel were killed today when two military helicopters collided
during a training exercise at Fort Campbell, Kentuchy, an Army
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two UH-60 "Black Hawk" helicopters from the elite 101st
Airborn Division were carrying 24 troops and eight crew members
when they collided during the "air assault demonstration" over
their base at about 0215 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT), Lt. Col. Bill Harkey
told reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary reports indicate that six are confirmed dead and
at least 16 injured," Harkey said, adding that casualties were
quickly transported to the Community Hospital at Fort Campbell for
emergency treatment.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of U.S. military air training
accidents this year. Two U.S. Marine helicopters collided during a
massive joint U.S.-British exercise at Camp Lejeune in North
Carolina on May 10, killing 14 people.

<HEADLINE> 2 Candidates Boycott Repolling in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Two candidates in Bangladesh's
eastern comilla-12 constituency have called upon people there to
boycott the repolling today due to rigging by the Awami (People's)
League (AL), the leading party in the parliamentary elections held
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although official results of the 273 out of 300 constituencies
have been announced by the Election Commission (EC), repolling was
scheduled to be held in 122 polling centers in the remaining 27
constituencies where the polling last Wednesday were suspended due
to disturbances.
</P>
<P>
The two candidates are Kazi Zafer Ahmed, a member of the
presidium of the Jatiya (National) Party (JP) and the former prime
minister, and Dr. Syed Abdullah Mohammad Taher from the
Jamaat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
According to the official results, the AL has become the
largest party in the country by winning 134 out of the 273
constituencies in the last Wednesday polling while its arch rival,
the ex-ruling Bangladesh nationalist party (BNP) won 104 seats,
the JP won 29 seats and the Jamaat-e-Islami only won three seats.

<HEADLINE> Thai Export Growth Target to Be Reached: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa Tuesday said that the country's export this year would
definitely reach the growth target of 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's poor export performance in the first four months of
this year has led a growing number of economists to predict that
the 1996 export target won't be met.
</P>
<P>
Last year's export target was set at 18 percent over 1994, but
exports ended up growing by 23.5 percent, spurred by a late surge
in agricultural exports to nations that had suffered natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Banharn was quoted by today's Bangkok Post as saying that the
cabinet had discussed the issue and thought that there is nothing
to worry about.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said that Thailand must focus on increasing exports and
curbing imports of luxury goods, adding that he had told the
Finance Ministry to find ways to cut such imports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Bodi Chunnananda contradicted
Banharn's assertion by announcing that export growth this year
might not reach 18 percent due to slower exports in March.
</P>
<P>
Exports in March were worth 120.7 billion baht (4.8 billion US
dollars), a 6.3 percent drop from the same month last year when
128.8 billion baht (5.1 billion dollars) of Thai goods were
exported.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's export target this year is set at 1,658 billion baht
(66.3 billion dollars).

agriculture and rural development in the EU, said that this
measure will help the EU to yield more than 8 million tons of
crops.
</P>
<P>
The proposal needs the approval of the Council of the European
Union before it is put into practice.
</P>
<P>
The EU introduced the crop rotation system in order to shrug
off the heavy burden of agricultural subsidiaries with the union's
15 member countries. The fallow land in the year 1995-1996 were 34
million acres.
</P>
<P>
Due to the bad weather, wheat yielding in such main
grain-exporting countries as some EU nations, the United States
and Australia have reduced a lot, which made the world wheat store
down to the record low and the price in the international market
increase fast, according to Fischer.
</P>
<P>
In such situation, the EU did not need to subsidize their
farmers on planting wheat as it did before, nor should it worry
about the wheat store within the EU, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is time for the EU to take measures to raise the grain
yieldings as a way to balance the world grain market and keep the
grain price at a rational level, said Fischler.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Power Cuts to Be Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The daily 8-hour power cuts now in
Sri Lanka will be reduced to five and a half hours from today, the
Ministry of Power and Energy announced.
</P>
<P>
This follows a slight improvement in the water levels at
reservoirs after heavy rains in past several days, the ministry
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The power cuts were introduced on March 23 this year as a
result of the delayed southwest Monsoon and little rain in the
hydro-catchment areas.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said that the regulations enforced under a
emergency ban on the use of air conditioners and the use of duty
free generators will continue as a temporary step for the power
shortage.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Restore Tariffs on Textile Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has agreed to
restore import duties substantially on textiles and garments in a
bid to protect local producers.
</P>
<P>
Under a decision made by the Thai cabinet Tuesday, duties on
textiles and garments, including suits, shirts, trousers and
neckties, will be restored from 10 percent to 30 percent, matching
the World Trade Organization requirement on clothing for next
year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report available here today, the cabinet also
agreed that the tariff on fur garments would be restored from 5
percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government last month slashed the import tariffs on 13
categories of luxury goods, including garments, leather products
and cosmetics. The duty on garments was cut from 45 percent to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
The tariff reduction triggered strong reactions from local
manufacturers. They said a potential flood of cheaper foreign
products would push them on the edge of bankruptcy and called on
the government to take measures to protect them.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper said today that he will reshuffle his cabinet in
the next few weeks at the end of his second year of government.
</P>
<P>
But Samper, who was acquitted by the Colombian Congress last
week of drug-related corruption charges, denied there was a crisis
in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Three of his ministers have been charged with trying to cover
up the alleged use of contributions from drug cartels to finance
Samper's 1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether any of the three are to be replaced in
the reshuffle. Samper said there would be changes in some
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement after a cabinet meeting during which
Interior Minister Horacio Serpa Uribe expressed the willingness of
all 15 cabinet members to resign immediately to give the president
a free hand to restructure his government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the national RCN radio station confirmed today that
Marco Tulio Gutierrez Moral, director of the Security
Administrative Department (SAD), Colombia's secret police, had
presented his resignation to the president.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his resignation, Gutierrez said U.S. Undersecretary
of State Robert Gelbard's allegation that the SAD had spied on the
U.S. Embassy in Colombia was "ridiculous and slanderous."

<P>
DHAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh this morning began its
revote in 122 polling centers in 27 constituencies of the
country's 7th parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
No detail about the repolling was available at the moment. But
an Election Commission (EC) official said it began on schedule.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier EC announcement, the repolling starts
at 8 a.m. (local time) and continues till 4 p.m. without break.
</P>
<P>
The revote started amid tight security with a 37-member team of
law-enforcing agencies including 20 policemen at each polling
center.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh held 7th parliamentary elections last Wednesday. The
EC ordered the revote for today after invalidating the balloting
in the 122 polling stations in the 7th parliamentary elections on
June 12 because of violence and alleged vote fraud.
</P>
<P>
The EC has officially declared the results of 273 out of the
300 constituencies. Today's repolling will decide the results of
the remaining 27 constituencies.

LISBON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Portugal and
South Africa should be governed by the principle of strengthening
cooperation instead of competition, their leaders said today.
</P>
<P>
"Portugal and South Africa should regard each other as partners
in cooperation rather than as competitors" in the political and
economic spheres, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres and
South African First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki told a joint news

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Adopts Church Burning Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted unanimously Tuesday to give the federal
government greater power to investigate the rash of church
burnings in the South.
</P>
<P>
The House approved the Church Arson Prevention Act, a measure
introduced in response to a string of fires at predominately black
churches in southern United States over the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
"In my view there is no crime that should be more vigilantly
investigated and the perpetrators more vigorously prosecuted than
crimes of this type," said House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde,
who introduced the bill which now has to be passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The move came a day after two churches burned to the ground
in the small town of Kossuth, Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
The new bill, which was supported by all parties, will broaden
the authority of the federal government to investigate the damage
of religious property and prosecute those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Federal agents had complained to Hyde's panel last month that
current law requires the vandals to cross state lines in order to
qualify as a federal offense. Hyde's bill strips some of those
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The Senate agreed unanimously to approve a resolution
condemning the church fire epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"The Senate condemns arson and other acts of desecration
against churches and other houses of worship as being totally
inconsistent with fundamental American values," said the
resolution, which was debated on the Senate floor last week.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority leader Trent Lott said that the Senate would
try to take up Hyde's bill, perhaps as early as next week.

Leaders of the three Central Asian states are speeding up the

The former Soviet republics, which gained independence late
1991, have a combined population of more than 40 million and wield
considerable economic and military power.
</P>

Growing cooperation among them will influence Central Asia as a

In April 1995, the presidents of the three countries held a
summit in Chimken in southern Kazakhstan, where they agreed on a

The 53 cooperation agreements signed during the summit covered
almost every major sector of the economy in the three countries.
</P>

The Central Asian neighbors also agreed to create a joint
peacekeeping force by this summer.
</P>

</P>
<P>
MEXICO -- Gold production in Mexico reached 20.3 tons in 1995,

a drop in world market prices, representative of the World Gold
Council Nora Jaime Trevino said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in gold production, which put Mexico in the 17th
place worldwide, was due to an increase in demand for exports and
to the investments that were made during the past two years in the
mining industry, mainly in the north of the country.

<HEADLINE> China Planed to Become Major VCR Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China is on its way to becoming a
major producer of video cassette recorders (VCR), today's China
Daily quoted Vice-Minister of Electronics Industry Zhang Jinqiang
as saying.
</P>
<P>
China will manufacture at least five million VCRs using the
advanced technology by the turn of this century to meet the
growing demand, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
the country will become not only a major VCR producer, but also
a large market for VCRs, because of the enormous population and
the Chinese favor for televisions, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest VCR manufacturer is the China Hualu
Electronic Co., Ltd, which was set up in 1992, the English
language newspaper noted, adding that the company has signed
technology transfer contract with Matsushita of japan.
</P>
<P>
This Chinese official also said that Chinese manufacturers
supply more than 50 percent of the parts and components needed for
domestically-made VCRs, and Chinese factories have already started
exporting VCRs.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang also expressed his worries about smuggling of
VCRs, and illegal imports of their parts and components.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Chinese people will buy about 6.5 million
VCRs annually. Further strengthening of the domestic VCR market is
critical, Zhang added.

<HEADLINE> Paris Cautiously Welcomes New Israeli Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed a cautious
welcome to the new Israeli government and stressed that it
expected the Middle East peace process to continue.
</P>
<P>
France is paying close attention to the policies of the new
Israeli government, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt
said today in a short, carefully-worded statement.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the French government will spare no
effort to back the continuation of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
France maintains closer ties with Arab nations than other
European countries and has always believed that it has a major
role to play in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
But Paris was disappointed with the victory of nationalist
Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu over moderate Labor Party chief
Shimon Peres in the general elections and Netanyahu's hardline
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
Politicians and diplomats here are especially concerned about
what Netanyahu has called the three no's: no Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, no Palestinian state, and no talks on the
status of Jerusalem which is claimed by both Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Today's statement by the Foreign Ministry is seen by observers
here as a request to the Israelis not to halt the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said France had noted that Netanyahu, who was
sworn in today as the new Israeli prime minister, had promised on
several occasions to pursue the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Only a just and overall peace can bring about stability and
security for all the peoples in the region, including the Israeli
people," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
To maintain its influence in the Middle East, France has been
quick to seek good relations with the new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac phoned Netanyahu after his
victory and invited him to visit Paris. Netanyahu promised to go
to France after he visits the United States.

<HEADLINE> Council of Europe Ends Meeting on Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from 39 Council of
Europe (CE) countries ended their meeting here today with an
agreement to regulate movements of immigrants and integrate them
better in society.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after the meeting, the council declared
that it starts the implementation of a program to "create a more
integral Europe with efforts and tolerance."
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at reducing unemployment of immigrants and
preventing racial discrimination in the European continent.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the council will convene a round table
conference to discuss the Polish role in immigrants' integration.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers pointed out that the nations
in Central and Eastern Europe have become transit countries for
people from Southeast Asia to migrate to Western states.
</P>
<P>
The countries in Central and Eastern Europe will also become
ideal destinations for mass immigrants due to their economic
reforms and Western nations' strict control over immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The two-day CE conference, the first of its kind held in
Central and Eastern Europe, aims to regulate movements of
immigrants and to help Central and East European countries to
adapt their immigration policies to CE standards.
</P>
<P>
"Although the number of foreigners arriving and settling in
Central and East European countries is comparably smaller, the
problem of their relations with society in the country of
settlement is increasingly significant," Polish Interior Minister
Zbigniew Siemieatkowski said at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the key to solve the problem is to draw
experience from the West and to cooperate with Western countries.
</P>
<P>
The Polish minister also told the meeting that his country will
continue to adopt its liberal border policy on visa though the
foreigners from the east have made various kinds of trouble in the
Polish society.
</P>
<P>
Poland has traditionally provided emigrants but now has
growing numbers wanting to settle on its territory, notably from
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the CE show that in 1994, immigrants accounted for
18.6 percent of Switzerland's population, followed by Belgium with
10 percent and Austria with 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In west European countries, Germany had the largest number of
immigrants, totaling 6.8 million and accounting for 8.6 percent of
its population.

<HEADLINE> Russian Election Will Have no Major Impact on Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The outcome of Russia's presidential
election may lead to some minor adjustments in Ukraine's foreign
policy, but there won't be any strategic or fundamental changes,
a spokesman from the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
Any changes in policy toward Russia will also be determined by
developments in Ukraine itself, the director of the Foreign
Ministry Press Bureau, Yury Sergeyev, said.
</P>
<P>
He denied suggestions that Ukraine is more dependent on Russia
than Russia is on Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The fact is, Sergeyev said, Russia and Ukraine are almost
equally dependent on each other. As an example, he cited Russian
loans to Ukraine to allow it to buy its oil and gas from Russia
at higher-than-market prices.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that it's not easy for Russians to find such
a buyer in today's world.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said that only by speeding up its democratic and
economic reforms can Ukraine reduce the impact of external
politics on its domestic affairs, whether the influence be from a
neighboring country or elsewhere in the world.

<HEADLINE> Flourishing Market for Jewelry Trade in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Business in five jewelry and gem
wholesale markets has been brisk in recent years, thanks to a
growing domestic demand that has resulted from the improvement of
Chinese people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Donghai County, in east China's Jiangsu Province, is the
largest crystal producer in China, and has built 200 businesses
that engage in crystal processing. Crystal production bases at
Niukou and Ahu prefectures generate 10 million yuan from
processing of crystal products, according to People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
A crystal festival is held in the county every year in May,
and attracts thousands of overseas jewelry traders.
</P>
<P>
And Changle County in east China's Shandong Province, which has
a huge reserve of high-quality sapphires in their several hundred
million carats, has built a "jewelry world".
</P>
<P>
The county's output value yielded from jewelry processing
surpassed 700 million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The jewelry and jade market at Zhenping County, in central
China's Henan Province, was rated the largest of its kind in
China. The market is home to 21,000 jewelry and jadeware workshops,
which employ 100,000 workers and yield an annual output value of
620 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Jewelry from Zhenping has been sold to 36 countries and
regions, fetching an export value of 360 million yuan a year.

WELLINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Air travel in New Zealand
resumed today after airports in northern North Island closed last
night and airlines said the passenger backlog will be cleared by
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Airlines are using bigger planes or increasing flight number to
ship the passengers stranded since Wednesday afternoon because the
eruption of Mt Ruapehu volcano forced the closure of all the
airports in the northern North Island, including the country's
largest airport in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
But airlines said there is not guarantee that normal flights
will continue tonight if the volcano plays again.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that Mt Ruapehu is calming down, but is still
belching out gas and steam.
</P>
<P>
The lull is the quietest last night since the mountain had been
its eruption on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
However, they warned that it does not mean it is all over.

England's top striker Alan Shearer opened the score by hitting

England coach Terry Venables said that the match was the most
satisfying performance in his two-and-half years in charge of the
team.
</P>
<P>
"You must get your homework right against a side like Holland.
We moved them about in a way they usually do," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the other group match played at the same time in Birmingham,
Scotland beat Switzerland 1-0, but they were denied the access to
the quarter-finals with only one goal difference with the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Scotland eleven have nearly entered the threshhold of the
quarter-finals of Euro 96 when England led the Netherlands 4-0 at
Wembley Stadium, but a late goal for the Netherlands has totally
crashed the Scotland's hope of qualifying.
</P>
<P>
In a group B match played this afternoon, France defeated
Bulgaria 3-1, forcing the World Cup quarter-finalist out of the
European Soccer Championship.
</P>
<P>
France took the lead in the 20th minute when Laurent Blanc
headed into the net from Yuri Djorkaeff's corner and another goal
mistakenly touched into the goalmouth by a Bulgarian player
launched a fatal blow the Bulgarian team.
</P>
<P>
A stunning free-kick from Bulgarian international star Hrito
Stoichkov outside the penalty box opened the Bulgarian goal but
not enough to lift the Bulgarians to equalise.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during another group B match between Spain and
Romania, the Spanish red shirts beat Romania 2-1 and sailed into
the quarter-finals with France.

<HEADLINE> All Townships in Inland Shanxi Linked up by Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The last remaining areas of Shanxi
province, north China, have stepped into the real world - with the
opening of two new highways.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the roads means that access is now provided
to every township in the inland province.
</P>
<P>
The two new roads opened to traffic recently in the mountainous
Yuanqu County.
</P>
<P>
Hu Fuguo, the provincial Communist Party Secretary, called the
completion of the two new roads in Wangxian and Lishan a
"milestone in the history of road construction of Shanxi".
</P>
<P>
This is a special delight for local people living in
mountainous areas, which account for over 80 percent of the
province's total land.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate roads have long remained a hindrance to the economic
growth of Shanxi, and are a main reason for 50 poor counties still
living under the national poverty line.
</P>
<P>
In order to change the situation, the provincial government
launched a voluntary road-building campaign in 1993 designed to
link every township with highways in three years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, almost 12,000 people in the province took part
in the road building campaign.
</P>
<P>
Among the investors in the roads were four well-to-do farmers
from Foyukou Village in Jishan County, who pooled 2.5 million yuan
(301,200 US dollars) into the building of a 28-km-long road for
their hometown.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Debt Up 5.6 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The combined debts of Argentina,
Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, four members of the Southern
American Common Market (Mercosur), rose to 257 billion
U.S. dollars in 1995, an increase of 5.6 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt of that trade bloc accounted for 44.8 percent
of the total debt in Latin America and the Caribbean which stood
at 573.7 billion dollars in 1995, according to a document today by
the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America, whose head office
is in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, with the highest debt in the region in 1995, recorded a
debt of 169 billion dollars, an increase of 14 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, with 2.4 percent, registered the lowest debt
increase in the four-nation Mercosur, whose official operation
kicked off in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay and Uruguay reported the best performances since 1988
after reducing their foreign debts 33.3 percent and 13.1 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here attributed the growth of the Brazilian debt in
1995 to the greater availability of credit for foreign trade and
to the loans received by private sector companies.

<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China generates over 30 billion
yuan (3.6 billion U.S.dollars) of direct economic benefits a year
through the application of rare earth, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Released by the Rare Earth Office of the State Planning
Commission, the statistics indicate that China consumed some
13,000 tons of rare earth in 1995, second only after the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Indispensable materials for developing high-tech industries,
rare earth can also serve to transform traditional industries
owing to various peculiar functions.
</P>
<P>
Rare-earth elements have been applied in over 3.3 million ha of
farmland across China, helping to increase the annual output of
grain, cotton, and sugar by 600 million kg, generating more than
one billion yuan of direct economic benefits annually.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Lacks Funds to Update Public Toilets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital is facing the
problem of a serious shortage of funds to update backward public
toilets, according to a newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
Although China's first ever toilet show has just closed in the
capital a problem for local officials wanting to make street
toilets cleaner is financial difficulties, "People's Daily"
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sharp increases in the flowing population in the city has
generated greater demands for public toilets, but the problem of
insufficient toilets will last for a long time due to lack of
money, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"It will take dozens of years or even a century for Beijing to
realize modernization of public toilets if the city maintains
current investment scales for construction and management," it
warned.
</P>
<P>
Now Beijing's environmental sanitation department, responsible
for management of 6,763 public toilets, can invest only 300 yuan
(about 36 US dollars) into each toilet annually, while it needs
more than 800 yuan just to pay workers' wages and operation
costs.
</P>
<P>
Expert have suggested that besides government funding, various
methods should be cultivated to raise money for maintaining
existing toilets and building new ones.
</P>
<P>
They estimate that Beijing should build 58,000 public toilets
to cater for growing demands, but it is almost impossible to erect
independent WCs along major streets, especially in busy shopping
districts.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the experts as saying that local government
should order roadside public places and buildings to offer toilet
service.
</P>
<P>
It is feasible to set up a "toilet company" to take charge of
management of fee-charging toilets and use profits to re-invest in
new toilets, suggested Wang Weiping, an official from the Beijing
Environmental Sanitation Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Tai He Tong Technology Development Company, which
displayed its no-flush toilets at the recent exhibition, is
considering establishment of a factory to recycle human waste and
make organic fertilizer, the report said.

<HEADLINE> China Ranks Top in Short-Term Seismic Prediction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The accuracy rate for China's
short-term seismic predictions stands at 25 percent, Chai Baoping,
a senior engineer of the State Seismological Bureau has claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview with Xinhua today that the figure is
the highest in the world for quake prediction in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The short-term and pre-quake predictions indicate the forecasts
for quakes several days to several months prior to the quakes.
</P>
<P>
In the past few decades, China has developed practical methods
and software for seismic predictions based on research of
forewarning signs of 200 cases of destructive earthquakes in
China, the seismographer said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China's provinces, autonomous regions with much
seismic activities have all established computerized data banks
for processing warning signs and special organs for reviewing and
discussing seismic predictions.
</P>
<P>
The expert system for earthquake predictions has also helped
the effective determination of quake predictions.
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Chinese experts successfully forecast an earthquake of
7.3 magnitude in Haicheng of northeast China's Liaoning
Province. Over 100,000 lives were saved thanks to pre-quake
prevention measures that were taken.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Chinese experts successfully offered short-time
predictions for 13 quakes of above six magnitude. The losses
caused by those earthquakes were reduced to the lowest level, Chai
said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the accuracy rate of China's predications has
had its contributions from the world's largest quake prediction
force, which groups professional personnel and ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
To date, 16,000 people in China are engaged in seismic research.
</P>
<P>
However the 25 percent of prediction accuracy rate is quite a
low ratio, another Chinese seismographer said.
</P>
<P>
China failed to predict the 1976 Tangshan earthquake which
caused heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the failure of most of the seismic predictions to
the lack of scientific understanding of the pattern of
earthquakes, saying the seismic predictions are a process of
accumulation of experience.
</P>
<P>
He held that the pattern of quakes will certainly be mastered
through the efforts of several generations.
</P>
<P>
China's new plan is to raise the seismic prediction accuracy
rate to 30 by the end of this century.

<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke reaffirmed here today that his government will
continue to expand economic, trade and technological cooperation
with China.
</P>
<P>
He made the pledge at a meeting with visiting Chinese Minister

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Arms Embargo Terminated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
declared today that the arms embargo imposed against the former
Yugoslavia since 1991 had been terminated.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the council after it considered a
report from U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who said
the parties concerned had signed on June 14 in Oslo an agreement
on the limitation of armaments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Under Council Resolution 1021 of November 22, 1995, the
Yugoslav arms embargo would not be terminated until after 180 days
of its implementation and after the Republic of Croatia, the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Republika Srpska begin to implement measures for
sub-regional arms control as envisaged in the Dayton Peace
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The June 14 agreement, based generally on the formula
identified in the Dayton agreement, limits the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to approximately 75 percent of its current holdings
while Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina each are limited to
approximately 30 percent of the current Yugoslav holdings. Of the
latter, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina will have limits
of two thirds of the total in each category of armaments, with
Republika Srpska's limits being the remaining one third of the
total.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, in accordance with sub-paragraph 1(c) of Security
Council Resolution 1021 (1995), all provisions of the embargo on
deliveries of weapons and military equipment imposed by Resolution
713 (1991) have been terminated," said a statement by Ambassador
Juan Somavia of Chile, chairman of the Security Council Committee
on Sanctions against Yugoslavia.

unprecedented transition process from civil war and political
polarization to national reconciliation. They also noted the
country's economic development and progress in debt negotiations
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The IDB, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) acknowledged Nicaragua's good performance in implementing
its stabilization and structural adjustment program. They asserted
that maintaining macroeconomic stability and accelerating growth
remain the main challenges facing Nicaragua.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Greece, Armenia Sign Defense Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Armenia signed a defense
cooperation agreement today, formalizing the already well
established ties between the two countries in the defense sector.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Greek Defense Minister Gerasimos
Arsenis and his visiting counterpart, Vargen Sargisian.
</P>
<P>
"Today's signing of the military cooperation agreement between
Greece and Armenia formalizes the cooperation that has already
begun," Arsenis said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement foresees the exchange of information and
assessments in the defense and armaments sector and the training
of officers and personnel.
</P>
<P>
Greek military personnel have been assisting the Armenian
military since it was first established in 1992. Greece is also
one of the first countries to send a defense attache to its
embassy in Yerevan.
</P>
<P>
Greece intended to give high priority to achieving the
objectives of the agreement, Arsenis said, adding that Greece had
for some time been pursuing the creation of a defense network with
neighboring countries, with the aim of consolidating peace and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sargisian, who is accompanying Armenian President Levon
Ter-Petrosyan on a two-day official visit, said Greece had a "sure
and steady ally" in Armenia and the signing of the agreement was
inevitable given the established cooperation in the field.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos and his
Armenian counterpart, Vahan Papazian, signed today three bilateral
cooperation agreements in the sectors of transports, public health
and public order.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Women Lift Siege of OSCE Banja Luka Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A group of Bosnian Serb women
lifted late today their siege of the building of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the Serb city of
Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
The women, mothers and wives of missing Serbs, had blocked the
building since Monday in an effort to draw the world's attention
to the slow progress in tracing a large number of captured and
missing Serb soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
The women's representative Biljana Malesevic, after meeting
with the international community's Deputy High Representative in
Bosnia Michael Steiner, told reporters that the siege was being
lifted because Steiner had shown a wish to cooperate, the Tanjug
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The blockade came after eight months of uncertainty about the
fate of 1,150 Serb soldiers and 805 civilians missing since last
year's Muslim-Croat offensive against Serb territories in central
and northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, OSCE spokesperson Joana Van Vlitz said today in
Banja Luka that Serb women's blockade of the OSCE headquarters was
not directed at the organization.
</P>
<P>
Van Vlitz made the statement before the two-day blockade was
lifted by a group of Serb women, members of an Association for
Captured Serb Combatants and Civilians.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug quoted Van Vlitz as describing the situation there as
"stable," saying the local police had held talks with the women
and were keeping the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
She added two OSCE officials were held in the building and
access to the two officials was denied until the siege was lifted.

<HEADLINE> American Scientist Disputes Global Warming Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- There is neither evidence that
global warming is a serious problem and nor truly cause to worry
that emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat like
carbon dioxide could disrupt the world's climate, said an American
scientist.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was drawn by Dr. Richard S. Lindzen of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was known because of a
reputation for brilliance that got him elected to the National
Academy of Sciences at age 37.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any evidence that this a serious problem," he
was quoted by the New York Times today as saying flatly.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old leading expert on the physical processes of the
atmosphere put up the challenge as climate experts firm up their
view that human activity is seriously altering the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Last fall, a panel of scientist, convened by the United Nations
to advise the world's governments, concluded for the first time
that green house gases like carbon dioxide are responsible for
changing global climate. The panel also predicted that if
emissions of the gases are not reduced, the average global
temperature will increase by 1.8 degrees to 6.3 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
Lindzen disapproved this formal consensus about the climate
change, saying that the conclusions are based on computerized
models of the climate system. "I do not accept the model results
of evidence," he said. The physics of the atmosphere permit only a
minor and untroubling warming despite the build-up of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Lindzeb's idea is based on a fundamental point of physics:
carbon dioxide and the other waste gases generate only a small
amount of warming. The main candidate, whose presumed amplifying
effect is built into the computer models, is water vapor -- also a
heat-trapping gas, and the most powerful one since there is so
much of it and it is so pervasive.
</P>
<P>
The theory is that a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor,
thereby increasing the warming even more. Without this
amplification, Dr. Lindzen said, the average global temperature
will rise only about a degree Fahrenheit if atmospheric carbon
dioxide is doubled.

<HEADLINE> UN Join Cote d'Ivoire Navy in Search for Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today joined a
sea and air search by the Cote d'Ivoire navy for a
Russian-flagged ship in the Atlantic, off west Africa with 450
Liberian refugees.
</P>
<P>
A Radio Nigerian report monitored here this evening said a
Cote d'Ivoire navy ship was patrolling the area where the
Zolotitsa refugee ship was believed to be adrift.
</P>
<P>
However, it quoted Abidjan's navy officers as saying that Cote
d'Ivoire would only offer emergency assistance to the refugee
ship and passengers without admitting them.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said
it had chartered a plane to search for the ship, which has been
at sea since May 26 and has not been heard for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesman Ron Rredmond said the twin-engined plane would
join Cote d'Ivoire vessels in looking for the Zolotitsa, which
has been turned away by Ghana and Togo. The passengers include
some nationals from west African countries but most are
Liberians.
</P>
<P>
Another plane, chartered by an international aid agency was
forced on Monday to abandon a search for the refugee ship because
of clouds.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR hoped to capitalize on improved weather in the Cape
Palmas area off the Cote d'Ivoire-Liberian border, where a French
vessel reported sighting the Zolotitsa adrift last Saturday.

<HEADLINE> ValuJet Planes Grounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- ValuJet Airlines of the United
States suspended its operation at midnight of Monday at the
request of the government, which found shoddy maintenance and
planes that weren't airworthy.
</P>
<P>
The grounding of ValuJet is the largest carrier in the U.S.
ever shut down for safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
ValuJet, a low-fair carrier started in 1993, had a DC-9
crashing at the Florida Everglades, killing all 110 people aboard
on May 11.
</P>
<P>
A 30-day-long investigation by the Federal Aviation
Administration ended with the airline's agreement for a shutdown
until the carrier can prove that it can pass safety standards.
</P>
<P>
"Systemwide deficiencies" in the airlines' maintenance program
and "multiple shortcomings" were found with the carrier's quality
control, according to a press conference hastily called Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
ValuJet said the FAA's decision "was likely accelerated by the
tragic accident," and it hoped it would be able to resume service
in about 30 days.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of ValuJet's operation will partly benefit its
competitors, mainly Delta Airlines and Southwest Airlines,
according to observers. But low-fair companies will also be more
cautious about their operation, for their safety records are more
closely watched by both the government and consumers.

<HEADLINE> US FAA Announces Shakeup Following ValuJet Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Following the suspension of
ValuJet operations Monday night, the Clinton administration today
announced a major shakeup at the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) by removing the agency's top enforcement official and
tighting inspection rules.
</P>
<P>
As the FAA was under fire in the wake of the May 11 crash of a
ValuJet DC-9 in the Florida Everglades that killed all 110 people
on board, Anthony J. Broderick, the agency's longtime associate
administrator for regulation and certification, was taking early
retirement, officials said.
</P>
<P>
FAA Administrator David Hinson announced Broderick's removal at
a news conference. In addition, Hinson outlined a number of steps
the agency planned to take to beef up the agency's inspections of
airlines.
</P>
<P>
Hinson said the new regulations are "an acknowledgement that we
need to do it differently and in some cases more efficiently."
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the FAA, ValuJet halted operations at
midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said that an exhaustive
review of ValuJet both before and after the crash found "several
serious deficiencies" in the airline's operations, including the
"failure to establish the airworthiness of its aircraft."
</P>
<P>
Pena said the administration would also ask Congress to limit
the FAA's mandate to safety, eliminating its role in promoting the
airline industry.
</P>
<P>
The various changes outlined today were designed to insure that
repairs and general maintenance by airlines and their outside
contractors are more frequently and rigorously reviewed.
