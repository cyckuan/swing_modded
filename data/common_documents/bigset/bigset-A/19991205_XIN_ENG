<HEADLINE> Roundup: UN Council Once Again Extends Oil-For-Food Deal In Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Friday adopted a resolution by a narrow margin
to extend the phase six U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq for an
additional one week until December 11, with France refusing to
participate in the vote and three other members abstaining.
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time that the Security Council made such a
decision on the current oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, which began to be implemented in
late 1996, is aimed to ease the deteriorating humanitarian
situation in Iraq prompted by the stringent U.N. sanctions which
have been in the place for nine years.
</P>
<P>
The six phase of the oil-for-food program began on May, 25,
1999 and should have expired on November 20. The Security Council
on November 19 reached an consensus to extend the program for two
weeks until December 4, saying Iraq should be given additional
time to reach the target of 8.3 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
set by its relevant resolution.
</P>
<P>
The moves are widely seen here as a stopgap of the security
Council amid its sharp division on how and under which terms to
renew another six months period of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Private and informal consultations on the implementation of a
new phase of the program had already been underway among the 15
Council members and the five permanent members of the Council,
namely China, Russia, France, Britain and the United states,
before the expiration date of the six phase program was coming.
</P>
<P>
But the Council failed to hammer out an agreement due to their
sharp division. Russia favors adjustment and improvement to the
new phase of the program, such as lifting the ceiling on the oil
that Iraq could export and double the oil revenues that could be
used by Iraq to import equipment and spare parts for its
dilapidated oil industry while Britain and the United States
wanted a technical rollover of the program, which means Iraq could
only export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in the next
program and Iraq could only use 300 million U.S. dollars to import
oil equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The United States proposed the draft resolution and pushed it
to be adopted, saying it is directed to pressure the Security
Council to narrow their division and reach a new comprehensive
policy towards Iraq in the week-long time, an apparent linkage
between the oil-for-food program and the new U.N. policy towards
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States is deeply concerned at the long absence of
the United Nations weapons inspectors who withdrew from Iraq days
before the U.S.-led military strikes against Iraq last December.
It feared Iraq may have used the vacuum to resume its programs of
weapons of mass destruction, thus posing threat to the security
and stability of the Gulf region and undermine its national
interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. concern could not be eased unless the Security Council
has reached a new comprehensive policy towards Iraq and the U.N.
weapons inspectors have returned to Iraq and resumed their regular
work.
</P>
<P>
The apparent attempts by the United States came under attack.
China, Russia, France and Malaysia stressed that establishing
artificial time limits in this regard was totally impractical and
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on Saturday rejected the United Nations' one week
extension of the oil-for-food program, accusing the United States
and Britain of being behind the new resolution in order to prolong
sweeping U.N. trade sanctions on it.

<HEADLINE> JMC Adopts Working Plan on Congolese Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Military Commission
(JMC) made up of all warring parties to the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) ended a 10-day meeting here
Saturday with a working plan on implementing the Lusaka peace
accord adopted.
</P>
<P>
JMC Chairman Richard Lillali said contrary to reports that the
peace accord was crumbling because of violations of the ceasefire,
it was still intact evidenced by the presence of the rebel
factions at the JMC meeting.
</P>
<P>
He recognized violations from time to time. But he said "these
would not put the agreement at risk, the plan of action that we
have put in place here is aimed at resolving these issues."
</P>
<P>
Africa has done all it can to promote peace in the DRC and it
is now up to the international community to deploy peacekeepers as
soon as possible, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimbabwe's Minister of State for National Security
Sydney Sekeramayi said it was pleasing to note that the meeting
had yielded concrete recommendations relating to the
implementation of clauses on human rights, disengagement of
forces, disarmament and withdrawal of forces.
</P>
<P>
Sekeramayi called on rebel groups to raise the siege of allied
forces which supported the DRC government in Ikela.
</P>
<P>
"Be that as it may, we strongly feel and insist that the
success of the implementation of this agreement depends on
goodwill and faith that all parties are prepared to display," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The countries involved in the conflict, with Zimbabwe, Namibia
and Angola supporting DRC president Laurent Kabila while Uganda
and Rwanda backing the rebel factions, signed the peace agreement
on July 10 and the rebels signed it at the end of August.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Apparently unsatisfied
with their current bilateral trade, Kuwait and Eritrea agreed
here on Saturday to employ joint efforts to increase and develop
their trade.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official called on the private sector to play an
important role in bringing investments into Eritrea.

TEHRAN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces killed
11 drug traffickers and arrested 14 others in armed clashes over
the past three days in the northeastern Khorasan province.
</P>
<P>
During the clashes, the forces also confiscated over a half ton
of illicit drugs, including 41 kilograms of heroin, 621 kilograms
of opium in 10 different areas of the province, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy commander of the security forces Brigadier General
Mohsen Ansari said last week that the forces have seized over 167
tons of various drugs in the first eight months of the current

combating drug trafficking since the Islamic revolution in 1979
and over 2,700 personnel of the security forces were killed in
the process.
</P>
<P>
Iran is used by the drug traffickers as a transit to smuggle
narcotics from neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan to Europe and
the Gulf markets.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Palestinians to Continue Efforts in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and the Palestinians agreed
on Saturday to continue exerting joint efforts aimed at advancing
the Middle East peace process, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks after meeting with visiting Palestinian
Minister of Culture and Information Yasser Abed Rabbo.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that his talks with Rabbo, who is also
chief negotiator to the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks and
arrived here earlier in the day, dealt with the present situation
in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt and the Palestinians agreed to continue
consultations on the peace process in the light of their hope for
a comprehensive and lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are seeking solutions to the
problems regarding the interim stage, including further Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank, and negotiating a final peace
agreement on issues including refugees and Jerusalem, he said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Rabbo said his meeting with Moussa was part of the
continued consultations on means of pushing forward the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that a permanent and overall agreement on the
thorny issues, mainly the future of Jerusalem, the fate of
refugees, final borders, Jewish settlements and water resources
would be reached as scheduled in next September.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo said that Moussa assured him that Egypt intends to
continue its efforts to support the peace process in a bid to
achieve a just and permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of Jewish settlements, he said the
Palestinian side has made it clear that Israel must halt the
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the continuation of Israel's settlement
activities or policy will obstruct the final-status negotiations.

<HEADLINE> SWAPO Wins Landslide Victory in Namibia's Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The ruling South West
African People's Organization (SWAPO) led by President Sam Nujoma
will overwhelmingly win Namibia's third election as the vote
counting is close to an end.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Associated reported on Saturday that with
99 out of 103 constituencies declaring voting figures, the SWAPO
commanded a massive 76 percent of the total votes, indicating the
party would hold on to its two-thirds parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
The Congress of Democrats (COD) and the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance (DTA) were contesting the role of the leading opposition,
with each of two parties gaining 10 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The COD, formed in March by dissident SWAPO members, had a
slight edge, leading by fewer than 200 votes.
</P>
<P>
Election officials estimated that only 55 percent of registered
voters had cast their ballots, much lower than the 1994 figure of
over 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that President Nujoma, who was seeking a third
five-year term after changing the Constitution to allow him to run
again, looked set to win in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The final results of the presidential and parliamentary
elections on Tuesday and Wednesday are expected to be announced on
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Injured in U.S.-British Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 4 (Xinhua) -- One Iraqi civilian was injured
on Saturday in U.S. and British warplanes attacks on civilian
installations in northern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:00 a.m. (0800 GMT), seven
formations of U.S. and British warplanes coming from Turkish
airspace made 14 armed sorties over northern Iraq's Dohuk, Erbil
and Neineva provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes bombed some civilian facilities in this
region, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that 16 formations of U.S. and British warplanes
coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases made 61 sorties over most
provinces in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the enemy
planes and repulsed them to their bases in Turkey, Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have made 16,341 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq and have targetted regularly Iraqi civilian and
military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south
against "attacks by Iraqi government troops."
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones, saying they
were imposed unilaterally by the U.S. and Britain without direct
authorization from the United Nations Security Council.

<HEADLINE> 11 Iraqi Contracts Blocked by U.S., Britain: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Another 11 new Iraqi contracts
signed under the oil-for-food program have been suspended by the
U.S. and British representatives at the United Nations Sanctions
Committee, an Iraqi trade ministry spokesman announced on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that those contracts signed under the fifth
and sixth phases of the oil-for-food deal were blocked during the
committee' session held on November 29.
</P>
<P>
Those contracts were concluded with companies from Denmark,
Turkey, Germany, China, Switzerland, Jordan, Syria and the United
Arab Emirates for the purchases of medicine, storage equipment,
sinking pumps and control systems, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell
limited amount of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and
other infrastructure-related materials for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys of
deliberately blocking the endorsement of its contracts, and
consequently hampering the implementation of the humanitarian
program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Friday night approved to extend the
sixth phase of the Iraqi humanitarian program for an additional
week after it had already extended the program for two weeks when
it expired on November 20.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Baghdad declared its rejection to the new
U.N. resolution, calling the one-week extension "impractical and
illogical." It had rejected the two-week renewal and halted oil
export on November 22.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused the U.S. and Britain of trying to pressure the
other members of the Security Council into passing the "ill-fated"
British proposal which called for conditional suspension of the
sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 following its invasion of
Kuwait.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- India and Vietnam have agreed
to make concerted efforts to achieve a higher level of cooperation
in various fields.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement, issued here Saturday at the end of the
five-day state visit by Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong, said
both sides expressed the hope that the visit would significantly
contribute to further strengthening and expanding bilateral
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam reaffirmed its full support to India's candidature as a
permanent member in an expanded United Nations Security Council,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed their conviction that use of force is
not a solution to problematic issues around the world and affirmed
that their common and consistent stand is that all conflicts and
disputes can and should be solved only through peaceful
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that negotiations should be predicated on nations
strictly respecting each other's independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity and non-interference in any country's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
India reiterated that it fully respects the status of the
Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in Southeast Asia and is ready to convert
this commitment into a legal obligation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to continue their close cooperation in
ASEAN, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and other regional and
international fora and, together with other countries, strive for
a just world order.
</P>
<P>
During the visit of Tran Duc Luong, the first by a Vietnamese
President since 1958, the two countries signed four agreements
including a credit line worth 13.95 million U.S. dollars to Hanoi
on concessional terms and setting up of two software development
centers in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Tran Duc Luong
held a 75-minute meeting last Wednesday with both sides
emphasizing the historical and cultural linkages between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Luong also met Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan who
told his guest that the prospects of economical and technical
cooperation between the two countries are "bright and immense."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.N. Resolution as Political Mockery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad
Rashid on Saturday described as "a political mockery" a U.N.
Security Council resolution on extending Iraqi oil-for-food deal
with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of Arab oil
ministers in Cairo, Rashid said the extension is "only a political
mockery and farce by all standards."
</P>
<P>
He slammed the U.N. resolution as meaningless and totally
impractical, reiterating Iraq's rejection to the move.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted the resolution Friday night
to extend the sixth phase of the oil-for-food deal for another
week until December 11.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under trade sanctions since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. The U.N. program allows it to sell 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food, medicine
and other humanitarian goods for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
The rejection means Iraq will extend its export shutdown at
least for another week. Iraq stopped pumping oil for export on
November 22 after the Security Council voted for a two-week
extension to the program.
</P>
<P>
Asked when Iraq would return to the market, Rashid said Iraq
has to wait and see as it is unable to predict what will result
from the Security Council meetings.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has called for immediate lifting of the sanctions, or at
least a renewal of another six months of the program. Iraq has
carried out all of its commitments concerning the relevant U.N.
Security Council resolutions, Rashid said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Visit to Southeast Asia Successful: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During his fortnight trip which was wound up Saturday, Zhu
visited Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam, and had
informal summits with leaders of the Association of South East
Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The visit is one of China's important diplomatic events in
Southeast Asia at the turn of century and broad consensus has been
achieved between the Chinese premier and other regional leaders,
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
As hoped for, the visit has served to cement friendship, deepen
mutual trust, enhance cooperation, and increase China's influence
in the region.
</P>
<P>
It also served as an important link between the past and future
in regard to the promotion of the good-neighborliness between
China and the four countries Zhu visited and between China and the
whole ASEAN as a whole, and to the further intra-East Asia
cooperation for the new century, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
As to the informal summit between ASEAN on the one hand and
China, Japan and South Korea on the other, Tang said it was an
important meeting held at the turn of century as the East Asian
leaders discussed how to enhance their countries' cooperation in
the new century.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Zhu said that East Asian countries should
concentrate on economic development and make further efforts to
build a peaceful environment, saying these two aspects are where
the East Asian countries share the biggest common interests.
Therefore, East Asian cooperation should put priority to the
economic, scientific and technical and financial areas, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
At another informal summit between China and ASEAN, Zhu said
China will continue to seek peaceful solution to differences with
ASEAN through bilateral consultations for the sake of overall
friendly relations and regional stability. All ASEAN leaders
expressed appreciations to Zhu's statement and satisfaction with
the development of the ASEAN-China relations.
</P>
<P>
During the visit to the four countries, Zhu had in-depth
discussions with leaders of the countries on the development of a
new century-oriented relationship of good-neighborliness, mutual
trust and friendly cooperation, especially in the aspects of
confidence-building, misgiving-relieving and a deeper economic
cooperation, said Tang.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to relieve the misgivings among some Southeast
Asian countries that China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will bring new competition within the region,
Zhu used various occasions to explain China's position and
convincingly argued that China's accession to the WTO will be
conducive to development and prosperity in the region, and all
leaders echoed with welcome and support to China's entry into the
world's largest trade body, said Tang.
</P>
<P>
On the South China Sea issue, Zhu told the leaders that China
is committed to peace and stability in the area, persisting in
seeking peaceful solutions through bilateral consultations.
</P>
<P>
While highlighting the importance of focusing attention on
common interests between China and ASEAN, Zhu said no one should
underline certain specific differences or take actions that would
magnify or complicate what is going on.
</P>
<P>
In face of the recovery from the Asian financial crisis in
1997 and the challenge of economic globalization, Zhu said, China
and ASEAN members have a primary task to further strengthen their
pragmatic cooperation in a conscientious way.
</P>
<P>
Another achievement made in the Vietnam visit is the consensus
reached between Zhu and his Vietnamese counterpart Phan Van Khai
that all the land boundary issues between the two countries have
been solved. The two premiers have instructed the negotiation
teams to speed up the preparations for the hopeful signing of a
formal land boundary treaty later this month.
</P>
<P>
This is an important event for the Sino-Vietnamese relations
and fully conforms to the fundamental interests and common
aspirations of the two peoples, said Tang. It means that the two
countries can enter the 21st century with a new common land
boundary of peace and friendship, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Oil Minister Sameh Fahmi
on Saturday urged Arab countries to mobilize their efforts and
cooperate with each other in the oil prospecting, producing and
distributing fields.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 63rd session of the Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), Fahmi said the world is in
a trend of economic globalization, which requires coordination of
Arab efforts in the face of competition.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world must join efforts in developing the oil sector
in a bid to tackle financial, trade and investment challenges, he
told the one-day session.
</P>
<P>
Effecting cooperation in the oil sphere would help Arabs secure
fair revenues in the world from this natural resource and offer a
good chance for the development process in the Arab countries,
Fahmi stressed, quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Abdel Aziz Treiki, secretary general of the
Kuwait-based OAPEC, reviewed the session's agenda, including a
report on a proposed Arab center for environmental studies and the
organization's budget for 2000.
</P>
<P>
Arab energy ministers discussed the present situation on the
demand and supply of oil in the world markets and the impact on
the Arab oil-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
The officials expressed readiness to cooperate with each other
in the oil field for the benefit of the Arab nation, MENA added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting later endorsed the organization's budget amounting
to 1.45 million Kuwaiti dinars (3.72 million U.S. dollars) and
allocated 120,600 dinars (about 310,000 dollars) for its judiciary
panel in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Envoy in Lebanon on Red Army Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Japanese envoy on
Saturday held talks with Lebanese leaders on the five Japanese
guerrillas imprisoned in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss, Seiishero
Nobora told a news conference that he discussed the Middle East
peace process and bilateral ties, including the fate of five
Japanese Red Army members who are wanted in Japan on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Outside the prime ministry palace in downtown Beirut, scores
of protesters held a sit-in to express their support for the five
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
They held banners calling Lebanon to grant political asylum to
the five Japanese for they joined the Palestinian cause to fight
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Kozo Okamoto, 51, Masao Adachi, 59, Kazuo Tohira, 46,
Haro Wako, 50, and Mariko Yamamoto, 59, were each sentenced to 42
months in prison for forging documents, using false passports and
residing in Lebanon illegally.
</P>
<P>
Okamoto was the sole surviving perpetrator of the 1972 attack
on Lod Airport in Israel that left 26 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The attack was organized by the Japanese Red Army and the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to life imprisonment in Israel but was freed
along with 1,150 Palestinians in a swap for Israeli soldiers in
1985.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which does not have an extradition agreement with
Lebanon, has informally sought the extradition of the five since
they were arrested in Lebanon on February 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Beirut has not disclosed what to do after the five finish their
prison sentences in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hoss told reporters that the decision should be made by
Lebanese judicial authorities instead of his government.

<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-American joint venture
on machinery for construction material processing was founded in
Beijing today. It will hopefully improve the production standard
of construction material in China.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Besser Jinyang Machinery Manufacturing Co. Ltd,
which will produce machines for concrete brick processing, is the
first of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The new joint venture has a registered capital of five million
U.S. dollars, with America's Besser company taking 60 percent of
the stake and Beijing Jinyang New Building Materials Co. Ltd.
taking the rest. When in full operation, it will have an annual
production capacity of 100 production lines.
</P>
<P>
Clay bricks are widely used in China as a construction material,
with 700 billion bricks produced each year. More than 100,000 clay
brick manufacturers are using up a large amount of clay and energy
resources and destroying large areas of arable land each year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already controlled the use of clay
bricks and begun to popularize the use of concrete bricks in
construction.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that China could save more than 10 billion yuan (
about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars) in energy consumption each year if
all the production of clay bricks was replaced by that of concrete
bricks.

<HEADLINE> Arab States Endowed With Trillions Cubic Meters of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The unexplored gas reserves
in Arab states are estimated at 23.5 trillion cubic meters, said a
newsletter released Sunday by the Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OAPEC).
</P>
<P>
The newsletter for December said that declared gas reserves in
Arab states reached some 32.6 trillion cubic meters last year, or
about 20 percent of the global deposits, of which most are in
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
It said that total Arab production of natural gas amounted to
some 400 billion cubic meters in 1997, but they marketed only 226
billion cubic meters of gas, about 10 percent of the world
output.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Arab states' gas exports were incompatible
with their reserves because of scattered liquefaction
capabilities, which affected gas transportation, especially via
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
According to the OAPEC report, Qatar and Algeria account for
over 83 percent of the annual 41.8 million cubic tons of
liquefaction potentials in the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, OAPEC called on gas-producing Arab countries to
integrate their gas sector.
</P>
<P>
The drop of oil prices last year was also believed to have
negative effects on gas projects. The sharp fall of oil revenues
has forced the gas-rich Arab states to cut spending in the costly
gas industry.
</P>
<P>
A seminar on developing natural gas industry was organized by
the OAPEC in Doha, capital of Qatar in October, at which about 50
Arab and foreign experts exchanged views on ways of cutting costs
in gas liquefaction and exports.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Sensation Wins Slalom World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Croatian teenager Janica Kostelic
stormed to take her first World Cup slalom win with a combined
time of one minute and 23.34 seconds on the steep Luc Alphand
piste on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kostelic had virtually raced out of reach in the opening leg,
cutting a 0.72 seconds lead ahead of her closest rival Austrian
Sabine Egger, who was the only skier to get within a second of her.
</P>
<P>
In the second leg Kostelic again clocked the fastest time,
blitzing down in 42.34, resulting in a combined time so fast that
every skier but Bakke was more than two seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Trine Bakke finished second, 1.78 seconds behind,
while reigning World Cup slalom champion Egger ended up third, 2.
39 adrift.
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth largest gap ever recorded between winner and
second place in a women's World Cup slalom.
</P>
<P>
Kostelic has made an impact in her rookie season on the World
Cup scene last year by finishing third in two slaloms and winning
a combined event in January in the Austrian resort of St Anton --
the first World Cup victory for Croatia -- but this was the first
race proper she had won at World Cup level.
</P>
<P>
She kept on showing her potential this year by finishing 4th in
a giant slalom on the same piste on Saturday and fourth in the
opening slalom of the season in Copper Mountain, Colorado.

TOKYO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- World champion Maria Butyrskaya
grabbed the lead from her Russian Compatriot Victoria Volchkova
and took her second NHK Trophy singles title on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Volchkova, 17, who was the leader after Friday's short program,
had few errors to pick fault with but her conservative skating
allowed Butyrskaya to surge atop the final standings.
</P>
<P>
Butyrskaya, 27, who won the NHK Trophy in 1996, came out
strongly in the more important free program with a graceful
repertoire of step sequences, spins and spirals despite a wobble
landing on a triple lutz.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Tatyana Malinina of Uzbekistan, placed
fourth in the short program, came back stronger in the long,
landing four high and clean triples as well as a double axel to
finish third.
</P>
<P>
Ukranian Elena Liashenko, third in the short, placed fourth
after landing two-footed on a triple and skipping a combination of
jumps.
</P>
<P>
The NHK Trophy is the sixth and last event in the International
Skating Union's Grand Prix series. Under a points-scoring system,
the series leads to the Grand Prix final, this time in Lyon,
France, January 14-16.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Opposition Party Announces to Attend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Freedom Movement of Iran
(FMI), a major Iranian opposition party, announced on Sunday to
take part in the forthcoming 6th Majlis (parliament) elections
slated for February.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, FMI Secretary General Ibrahim
Yazid said his party has decided to register 12 candidates,
including himself, to run for the Majlis elections.
</P>
<P>
The final list of the party's candidates for the elections will
be announced later after the conservative-dominated Guardians
Council, which has the right to screen qualifications of
candidates, announced its stance toward the FMI, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the FMI's readiness, the Iranian authorities have
banned the FMI from running for any elections for the past two
decades as the Iranian Interior Ministry refused to issue an
official permit for the party.
</P>
<P>
In a 10-point statement read at the press conference, the
FMI called for the removal of existing obstacles in the way
for more active participation of the people and political
parties in the country's political affairs.
</P>
<P>
It voiced its support for the political reforms advocated by
the moderate President Mohammad Khatami and its readiness to help
the government solve economic problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi said his party would hold talks with other political
groups in the country on a possible coalition to run for the
Majlis elections.
</P>
<P>
"We will talk with those groups which share common views with
us on political developments in the country," he said, declining
to mention the names of the political groups.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the trend of political developments which
started following the election of President Khatami cannot  be
halted because the Iranian people want political developments and
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Political developments were demanded from inside of Iran,
and the election of President Khatami on May 23 1997 was
the result of such a demand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi, former foreign minister of the temporary Iranian
government after the 1979 Islamic revolution, agreed that the
conservatives might create some hurdles for the participation of
the people and political parties in the Majlis elections.
</P>
<P>
Voicing the FMI's disagreement with the screening right of the
Guardian Council, which was dominated by the conservatives, he
stressed that all political parties in the country should be
allowed to run for the elections according to the country's
constitution.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Unveils Priorities for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Sunday unveiled his agenda for the year 2000, saying he
wanted to maintain the momentum of economic growth, drive
unemployment down further and address the feeling of alienation in
the country's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he would also look to further build up Australia's
international reputation.
</P>
<P>
After a hectic year that saw his historic legislation of goods
and services tax passed by parliament, Howard said he had no
intention of slackening the pace.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly want to keep the momentum of economic growth
going," he told Australia's Nine TV Network.
</P>
<P>
"I want to drive unemployment down further and I'm optimistic
that can be achieved," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I want to work hard on the feeling of alienation that many
people experience in the regional areas of Australia and I want to
build on the respect that I believe Australia has in our region
and around the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said Australia's effort in East Timor had strained
relations between Canberra and Jakarta, but he was confident they
could be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
"Sure there are problems with Indonesia at the moment, but,
over time and with patience and providing our expectations are not
too high, that relationship will slowly repair itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Howard said there was growing evidence that the
Asian financial crisis had bottomed out and Australia's economic
outlook was bright.
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason why we shouldn't achieve the 3.5 percent
(economic growth) of the Treasury's forecast," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that many Australians felt they were
missing out on the benefits of a strong economy.
</P>
<P>
"If the whole economy is doing well, then those who are aren't
doing well feel the pain even more," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There's no overnight solution to that," he added.

<HEADLINE> Red Carpet Welcome for Overseas Filipino Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will start
rolling out Monday the red carpet for overseas Filipino workers
(OFWs) who are expected to return home in droves to spend the
Christmas with their families.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma of the Department of Labor and
Employment (DOLE) said here Sunday that more government agencies
have agreed to participate in this year's welcome program for
OFWs.
</P>
<P>
"More groups are joining this year's efforts. This should show
we go beyond lip service when we call our OFWs as our modern-day
heroes," Laguesma said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, there are about 4.5 million OFWS
working in 162 countries and regions, and they earn the country 6
billion to 7 billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said President Joseph Estrada might go to the
Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Manila anytime this
month to personally welcome returning OFWs.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure their arrival is hassle-free. We also
want them to feel that their sacrifices are appreciated by the
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said OFWs should start feeling the red carpet treatment when
they arrive at the NAIA and go through express lanes to provide
fast and hassle-free processing of their papers.
</P>
<P>
Teams from the National Police (PNP) Metro Manila command and
the Land Transportation Office (LTO) will be stationed inside and
outside the NAIA to protect returning OFWs from unscrupulous
porters and taxi drivers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Lucky OFWs would win prizes should they meet
criteria set up by the Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration (POEA) and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration
(OWWA).

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Denounces Israeli Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Cabinet Secretary
Ahmed Abdul Rehim Sunday denounced the Israeli government's
decision to endorse the construction of 500 housing units in a
settlement in Qalqilia governorate.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Voice of Palestine radio, Rehim said this
move is a further evidence of the lack of seriousness on the part
of the Israeli government to make real peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli Housing Ministry has already offered an
adjudication for the construction of 500 units in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
Defending its endorsement of the adjudication, the Israeli
government said it was not taking the decision to construct new
housing units, but was merely implementing decisions taken by the
previous government.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Palestinian chief negotiator in the final
status talks Yasser Abdou Rabbou has addressed a strong warning to
the Israeli side, emphasizing that the Palestinian party will
withdraw from negotiations should the Israeli government fail
to stop the construction of new settlement units.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Manifesto Signatories to Begin Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Five Palestinians detained
for signing a manifesto blaming Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
for government corruption said they would stage a hunger strike
Sunday to protest their detention, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The five, who had been detained by Palestinian police in the
West Bank city of Nablus since they signed the manifesto with
other 15 people one week ago, said they had refused to shift away
their criticism of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto named Arafat, chairman of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Chairman, for the first time in
connection with widespread government waste, fraud and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 20 signatories have backed away from their
criticism after Arafat ordered the arrest of 11 and threatened
to lift the parliamentary immunity of the other nine, who are
members of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
One of the signatories, lawmaker Moawya al-Masri, was wounded
in a gunshot by masked gunmen Wednesday in an attack he claimed
was in response to his signing of the anti-corruption document.
</P>
<P>
Both the PNA and the PLC have condemned the manifesto, saying
it constituted "an invitation to civil war."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Banks Ready for Transition to 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Banks in Israel are ready for
transition to the year 2000 after solving the key problem of the
millennium bug Y2K, the Bank of Israel announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel's banking system has completed preparations and testing
procedures for its computerized system for the year 2000 and
the preparations included adapting all the computer systems such
as hardware, software, databases and embedded systems to ensure
their proper functioning in the year 2000, the Bank of Israel,
the country's central bank, said.
</P>
<P>
The preparations of some non-enssential systems will be
completed during December, it said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the adaptation has been successful, experiments
were made that turned out to be even more complex and expensive
than the actual adaptation.
</P>
<P>
In this framework, aging tests were also run, reproducing the
effects on the system of the transition to the year 2000 by moving
the clocks forward and running the systems while interfaces with
outside agancies such as stock exchange were also tested, it said.
</P>
<P>
There is absolutely no reason to fear that computer problems
will erase customers's balances from the bank's databases or
prevent them from reconsituting customers' balances and
transactions at the transition to the year 2000, becuase backup
files, printouts, original documents and other expedients have
been expanded as part of the special preparations for the
transition to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Other measures for the transition include the increase of
the central bank's cash supply from the current 13 billion
shekels (3.1 billion U.S. dollars) in curculation to 30 billion
shekles (7.14 billion U.S. dollars), preparation for tracking the
developments on the money and foreign exchange markeks and other
contigency plans relating to the collapse of electricity and
telephone systems.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Opposition Party Announces to Attend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Freedom Movement of Iran
(FMI), a major Iranian opposition party, announced on Sunday to
take part in the forthcoming 6th Majlis (parliament) elections
slated for February.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, FMI Secretary General Ibrahim
Yazid said his party has decided to register 12 candidates,
including himself, to run for the Majlis elections.
</P>
<P>
The final list of the party's candidates for the elections will
be announced later after the conservative-dominated Guardians
Council, which has the right to screen qualifications of
candidates, announced its stance toward the FMI, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the FMI's readiness, the Iranian authorities have
banned the FMI from running for any elections for the past two
decades as the Iranian Interior Ministry refused to issue an
official permit for the party.
</P>
<P>
In a 10-point statement read at the press conference, the
FMI called for the removal of existing obstacles in the way
for more active participation of the people and political
parties in the country's political affairs.
</P>
<P>
It voiced its support for the political reforms advocated by
the moderate President Mohammad Khatami and its readiness to help
the government solve economic problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi said his party would hold talks with other political
groups in the country on a possible coalition to run for the
Majlis elections.
</P>
<P>
"We will talk with those groups which share common views with
us on political developments in the country," he said, declining
to mention the names of the political groups.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the trend of political developments which
started following the election of President Khatami cannot  be
halted because the Iranian people want political developments and
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Political developments were demanded from inside of Iran,
and the election of President Khatami on May 23 1997 was
the result of such a demand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi, former foreign minister of the temporary Iranian
government after the 1979 Islamic revolution, agreed that the
conservatives might create some hurdles for the participation of
the people and political parties in the Majlis elections.
</P>
<P>
Voicing the FMI's disagreement with the screening right of the
Guardian Council, which was dominated by the conservatives, he
stressed that all political parties in the country should be
allowed to run for the elections according to the country's
constitution.

<HEADLINE> Ground Water Level Declines Sharply In New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- New Delhi, India's capital
city which has been experiencing a shortage of about 200 million
gallons of water a day, is now facing other major problems: the
sharp decline in ground water levels and the serious contamination
in the water.
</P>
<P>
There has been a decline of four to 10 meters in the ground
water levels in Delhi over the last 10 years, according to the
Central Ground Water Board (CGWB).
</P>
<P>
At the same time, ground water in most parts of the city is
highly contaminated with fluoride, nitrate and a number of heavy
metals, and is not fit for drinking without treatment.
</P>
<P>
CGWB sources said on Sunday that the Central Ground Water
Authority prepared a report entitled "Development and Augmentation
of Ground Water Resources in Delhi," a copy of which had been
given to the Delhi government for follow-up action.
</P>
<P>
In a city with a population of over 10 million, Indian experts
said, the increasing shortage and contamination of water sources
are truly alarming.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted last year by the All India Institute of
Medical Sciences showed that 64 percent of Delhi school children
had a high level of lead in their blood stream, above the safe
permissible level.
</P>
<P>
Water has already become precious in many parts of the Indian
capital and, some say, it will become one of the most rarest
commodities in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
Daily water supply now in Delhi is about 600 million gallons
against the demand of 800 million gallons, leaving a gap of 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
Water pollution and depletion issues were inextricable tied to
many factors, such as the size of the city area, population
density, land use pattern changes, the provisional basic social
services and the degrees of economic development, experts said.

<P>
SINGAPORE, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong will make a working visit to Japan from December 6 to
10, his office said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a statement that Goh will be accompanied by
Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar, Trade and Industry Minister and
other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Goh will meet with Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi and other senior Japanese leaders, it said.
</P>
<P>
The office said Goh will also meet with Japanese business
leaders and members of Japanese think tanks, academia and the
media as well as members of the Singaporean community in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview in Singapore with the Japanese business
daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Goh said he hopes to use his upcoming
visit to Japan to deepen personal ties with Japanese Prime
Minister Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Goh also said that though Singapore's bilateral relations with
Japan were excellent, it was necessary to further deepen mutual
understanding on trade, regional security and other matters of
common interest.
</P>
<P>
Goh is expected to propose a study into a trade pact. "I will
suggest to Prime Minister Obuchi that both sides should study the
feasibility of a free trade agreement as a strategy ... against
free trade areas among other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Goh added: "There will be no discussion on free trade
arrangement between Japan and Singapore. I don't think both sides
are ready for it."

JOHANNESBURG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Pan

reported.
</P>

PAC President Stanley Mogoba while speaking at a media briefing in

</P>

<HEADLINE> UAE Urges Continued Oil Production Curb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) on Sunday called on major oil producing countries to keep
the current production curb intact until next March in order to
maintain stable oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) should
 stick to its production cut policy until March next year if it
wants to maintain a minimum oil price of 21 U.S. dollars per
barrel, said the Emirates Industrial Bank in its monthly
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
OPEC was able to save the deteriorating oil prices, which
began in 1998 up to the first quarter of 1999, due to the good
cooperation by a number of non-OPEC countries, which led to a
daily production cut of about 4 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
"This cut has created a balance in oil demand and supply on the
world oil market and led to the rise in oil prices, which reached
its highest of 25 dollars per barrel in November," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
However, there is a need for OPEC to strive to maintain the
targeted prices next year, the bank warned, adding that oil
producers should keep a high rate of commitment to their cuts.
</P>
<P>
The bank pointed out that oil revenues of the OPEC countries,
except Iraq, could reach 160 billion dollars this year compared to
121 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The oil return of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states
could also rise to 82 billion dollars against the 59 billion
recorded last year," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, which controls 45 percent of global crude oil reserves
and some 20 percent of global production, groups oil giants Saudi
Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Wins China Soccer League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Luneng became the
newly-crowned champions of the Chinese first division soccer
league by routing Wuhan Heart K 5-0 at home court in the final
round on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Initiated six years ago, the Chinese first division league saw
its dramatic title race had to be finalized until the final round
for the first time with Luneng and promoted Liaoning Fushun the
biggest contenders.
</P>
<P>
Luneng, which placed one point adrift of Liaoning after the
penultimate round, made the mark with a total of 48 points
following a landslide victory over the languishing Wuhan side,
which has been relegated to the second division.
</P>
<P>
Luneng head coach Slobodan Santrac of Yugoslavia also had his
name on the history books as he became the first foreign coach to
guide a Chinese soccer club to the league title.
</P>
<P>
Santrac, the former Yugoslavia national coach who stepped down
after the World Cup finals in France, will stay in the newly-
crowned club, ending speculation that he will replace Englishman
Bobby Houghton as the Chinese national coach.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Fushun, a team mostly composing of national Under-23
players, was held to a 1-1 away tie by Beijing Guo'an and had to
settle for second place on 47 points.
</P>
<P>
The titles during the last five seasons have went to Dalian
Wanda for four times and Shanghai Shenhua once.
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the league standings was also a down-to-
wire finish as a total of five teams had to fight to stay in next
season's top flight competition.
</P>
<P>
Four-time champions Wanda, a fallen hero which was yet
struggling in the relegation zone before the final round, finally
escaped from being demoted after the visiting side edged Shenhua 1-
0 for a total of 31 points.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao Hainiu and Shenyang Haishi were the other two teams
which seized the last straw. Hainiu pulled off a home win over
Jilin Aodong for 30 total points while visiting Haishi upset
Chongqing Longxin 2-1 for a total of 28 points.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Ping'an also collected 28 to escape from being
relegated although they lost to 4-0 to Sichuan Quanxin.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Songri bowed to Tianjin Taida 3-2 to lose the final
round and the last chance to stay alive as they collected 27
points, only better than Heart K at the bottom.

<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Government departments at all
levels should steadily push forward housing reforms and hasten
housing construction, said Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao today
during his inspection tour of two residential quarters in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that housing construction, as a new economic
growth point, will meet the needs of the people and stimulate
economic development.

Wen asked government departments to take effective measures to
accelerate housing construction, improve housing quality, create a
favorable environment for residential quarters, improve real
estate management, and steadily push forward housing reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government has pushed housing
construction in recent years. Through October, Beijing had started
to build 4.5 million square meters of government-subsidied houses,
with 1.5 million square meters to be completed before the end of
this year, and one million square meters of houses presold.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senior Lawmaker on Formulation of Legislation Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The formulation of the
legislation law is a critical part of China's lawmaking work and
of vital importance to the success of the rule of law in China,
according to a senior Chinese lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee, made the remark during his November 25-
December 5 inspection tour to Shenzhen, China's first special
economic zone, and three cities in Guangdong Province, south China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that China's legislators must study Marxism,
Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory, which are
the foundation of China's legislative work.
</P>
<P>
"While no state law or regulation is allowed to contradict the
constitution, which is a basic principle of legislative work," the
NPC vice-chairman stressed, adding: "local legislative work should
take local realities into consideration."
</P>
<P>
He called on China's lawmakers to keep in mind the achievements
of the Communist Party of China and the state so that local
legislative work could serve to promote the country's reform,
economic progress and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also urged Chinese lawmakers to use advanced foreign
experience in the field as reference, and called for stronger
Party leadership.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China is still in a campaign to
wipe out the negative influence of the Falun Gong cult headed by
Li Hongzhi, which was outlawed in July.
</P>
<P>
In Jiangsu Province, east China, colleges and universities are
trying to help Falun Gong practitioners, especially teachers and
other senior intellectuals, to get aware of the heresies of the
cult.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in the
province's capital sent educational materials to the homes of
student practitioners, and asked their parents to help students
understand the evil nature of the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
Teachers and students at the Hebei Normal University, in north
China, held a forum recently to expose and criticize the fallacies
spread by the cult.
</P>
<P>
A neighborhood committee in Dongsheng Street in Changchun,
capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, helped 104 Falun Gong
followers alter their erroneous opinions and adopt a healthy
lifestyle by solving real problems in their life.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the public security department in
Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province in northeast China, seized
a number of illegal Falun Gong propaganda sheets from some
practitioners.

<HEADLINE> Guinea-Bissau presidential election to go to runoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Guinea-Bissau will hold a
runoff presidential vote between opposition leader Kumba Yalla and
interim President Malam Bacai Sanha, a report from Bissau said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The National Election Commission (CNE) confirmed late Saturday
that Opposition leader Kumba Yala, head of the Party for Social
Renewal (PRS), was in the lead in the first round with 31 percent
of the vote, while Sanha, the candidate of the ruling African
Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC),
picked up 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
In third place was independent candidate Faustino Imbali,
followed closely by another independent, Fernando Gomes, according
to CNE figures released in the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
The CNE said votes from only two constituencies remained to be
counted from the ballot a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Both Yalla and Sanha, who has the backing of the military
junta that took power in May, have expressed confidence of winning
the runoff.
</P>
<P>
Yalla had already predicted a first-round victory, but after
the near-total results were announced Saturday, he said, "the
second round will be easier."
</P>
<P>
Sanha, for his part, said he would deploy his "25 years of
political experience" to win the vote and bring stability to
Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The elections are meant to end a transition period after the
May 7 ouster of president Joao Bernardo Vieira in a sudden
military initiative which followed 11 months of armed rebellion.
</P>
<P>
In the legislative elections, the PRS won 29 seats of the 82
so far announced in the 102-seat chamber.

<P>
PARIS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Janica Kostelic upset a
strong field of favorites to lead the first leg of a women's World
Cup Alpine skiing slalom at Serre Chevalier, France on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old skier put in sight the first World Cup slalom
win of her career after she clocked a leading time of exactly 41
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kostelic had been impressive in her first season on the circuit
last year when she twice finished third in slalom and then won a
combined event in St Anton last January.
</P>
<P>
Kostelic, fourth in Saturday's giant slalom on the same Luc
Alphand piste, also narrowly missed the podium last month in the
first slalom of the season in Copper Mountain, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Sabine Egger finished 0.72 seconds behind with
Norwegian Trine Bakke in third place, exactly one second adrift.
</P>
<P>
World champion Zali Steggall of Australia was 2.16 seconds off
the pace in 11th place, just 0.03 seconds behind veteran Swede
Pernilla Wiberg.
</P>
<P>
New Zealander Claudia Riegler, winner of the last slalom held
in Serre Chevalier three years ago, was 2.08 seconds slower than
the Croatian in 8th place.
</P>
<P>
France's Christel Saioni, joint winner of the Copper Mountain
slalom, had to settle for 7th place in 43.06. The other Copper
Mountain winner, Spela Pretnar of Slovenia, placed ninth on 43.11
seconds.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- FIFA, the world soccer ruling
body, said here on Sunday that a record total of 198 countries and
regions have entered the preliminary draw for the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Afghanistan,
Niger, Burundi and Papua New Guinea decided to skip the premier
soccer event, to be co-hosted by Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korea's decision ended speculation that it might share
some World Cup games and send a joint team with South Korea, said
Lennert Johansson, FIFA's chief for organizing World Cup
competitions.
</P>
<P>
There were 174 countries that went through the qualifying
rounds for the World Cup in France in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary draw for the 2002 event is also slated on
Tuesday in Tokyo with titleholding France and the two hosts
qualifying directly for the final round.
</P>
<P>
Europe will provide at least 13 other qualifiers from 50
nations which will be split into nine groups, with the winners
going through.
</P>
<P>
Playoffs between eight runners-up will determine four others
with another runner-up facing an Asian team in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
Asia will provide two or three qualifiers, plus Japan and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The South American nations will not be included in the draw,
since they play a league system with the top four qualifying
directly and the fifth facing a team from Oceania in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
Africa will provide five qualifiers, coming through two rounds
of group qualifications.
</P>
<P>
The most complicated system involves the CONCACAF grouping,
with the United States, Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica not
entering the qualifications until the semifinal round.

<HEADLINE> British Investors Inspired by China's Potential: Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of a British
company which has successfully partnered with a Dalian electric
motor plant says that foreign investment in China has inspired the
competitive atmosphere necessary to invigorate domestic
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment has brought China not only funds and job
opportunities, but also the sort of competition that will prod its
domestic enterprises to reform, said Andrews Green, chairman of
the Brook Crompton company under the British Invensys Group.
</P>
<P>
Invensys, an international automation company, and the Dalian
No. 2 Motors Company jointly set up the Dalian Brook Crompton
Electric Motors Co. Ltd. last year with a total investment of 245
million yuan (29.4 million U.S. dollars) in Dalian, a port city in
Liaoning Province, northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Since the cooperation was formed on December 18 last year, the
new company's progress has been "really encouraging," Green said.
</P>
<P>
The prospects of China's entry into the World Trade
Organization will benefit both China and Britain, he said
</P>
<P>
Invensys Group, one of Britain's main investors in China, has
established 19 ventures in the country with a total investment of
200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Britain's contracted investment in Dalian
is 140 million U.S. dollars, covering 38 joint ventures. And
Britain's two key banks, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Co.
Ltd., and the Standard Chartered Bank, have also set up their own
offices in the city.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, Britain had set up more than 2,000 joint
ventures in China with total investment exceeding 13 billion U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> England Prefers Majority Decision on Voting for 2006 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The candidate should have the
support of the majority when the FIFA select the host country next
July, according to Alec McGivan, the chief of England's bid for
the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The voting methods to pick one of the five bidders will not be
finalized until FIFA's Executive Committee meet on Monday here.
</P>
<P>
The two methods under consideration include a straight ballot
with the winner the candidate that takes the most votes, and a
round-by-round vote where the lowest scorer is eliminated until a
straight vote between the two finalists.
</P>
<P>
McGivan said on Sunday that England would prefer the latter
method, thinking that it will be fair for a winning candidate to
have the majority supports.
</P>
<P>
If the straight one-off vote is used, the winner could be a
country that does not necessarily have the support of the majority
of the executive committee, McGivan said.
</P>
<P>
England, Germany, Brazil, Morocco and South Africa are bidding
for the 2006 World Cup.

Commenting on the weakening euro which tumbled to 1 dollar and
even less for the first time on Thursday, Schroeder said on

reason to panic." He said a lower euro would undoubtedly benefit
Germany's exports. At the same time, the strong economic

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Province Closes Heavily-Polutted Plants for Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-five industrial plants
in northeast China's Liaoning province have closed or suspended
production or change business line because they were highly energy
consuming or seriously pollutant.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Provincial Administration of
Environment Protection, most of these plants were involved in
textiles, printing and dyeing, paper making, and architecture
materials industries.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province, one of China's major industrial bases, is
burdened with environmental pollution tasks. The 1,430-km-long
Liaohe River, running through the province, is listed among the
most polluted rivers to undertake key river treatment projects in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The State Council required all industrial plants to control
their emission of polluting matters under a set safety amount by
the year 2000. And some 50 percent of the industrial plants have
so far met the requirement.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the provincial government will upgrade the
traditional industries with high and new technologies and develop
and popularize clean industries to resolve their environmental
problems.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Seattle Failure and Beyond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from 135 members of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) are leaving here empty-handed
as the organization's third ministerial meeting closed late Friday
after four-days of intense negotiations amid violent protests.
</P>
<P>
The expected Seattle Round, or the Millennium Round, had not
been launched. The ministers have now delegated their
representatives to resume negotiations early next year in Geneva
with the aim of initiating the new round of global trade talks.
</P>
<P>
The failure in Seattle, analysts say, had resulted from a
complicated combination of U.S. domestic politics, complexity of
difficult and important trade issues, wide gaps among the members,
and the decision-making mechanism of the WTO based on consensus.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats, complaining that the four-day meeting had been messy,
chaotic and the worst organized, believe that the Clinton
administration lacks a political will to make concessions in areas
where U.S. interests are most concerned, as the presidential
election is nearing.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the meeting, President Bill Clinton
seemed not so disappointed for the failure. "We made progress at
the Seattle WTO trade meetings although significant differences
remain," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the two vital constituencies for Vice
President Al Gore, a Democratic presidential candidate, the White
House had been urging WTO members to include labor and
environmental issues on the agenda of the next round of trade
talks.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Clinton made shrewd calculation. Behind the high-minded
statements, the administration is hoping to seize an astounding
moment of American power to satisfy powerful domestic
constituencies -- labor unions and environment protection groups.
</P>
<P>
As about 30,000 protesters from labor unions and environment
protection groups across the country blocked ministers from
attending the conference, Clinton expressed his sympathy for them
and support for their demands.
</P>
<P>
Protesters felt encouraged and violence followed in downtown.
Tear gas was fired; troops were called in; the city was placed
under curfew; and the meeting was disrupted. Some diplomats called
the meeting the "Seattle Battlefield Round."
</P>
<P>
The opening session had to be canceled. The time left for the
negotiators to complete their contentious job had been cut short.
Chances for success was reduced.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local newspaper, Clinton said in Seattle
that he ultimately favored sanctions against countries with lax
labor standards. This further created a furor among delegates from
developing countries and intensified their opposition to the
inclusion of the labor issue in the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries fear that rich countries would use
labor issues as pretexts to deny the access of developing
countries' products to their markets. They insist that the labor
issue should be managed by the International Labor Organization (
ILO).
</P>
<P>
Apart from controversies between the developing and developed
members, big gaps between developed members also appeared to be
unbridgeable during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that agriculture, a politically-sensitive
issue, was perhaps the biggest problem standing in the way of an
agreement. Disputes between the U.S. and the European Union (EU)
almost resulted in a failure of the Uruguay Round.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture tends to raise more blood pressure at home than
any other sector of the economy," said Dan Glickman, the U.S.
Agriculture Secretary.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, the U.S., together with Australia and other Cairns
Group countries, pressured the EU to agree to eliminate all
subsidies on farm products, while the EU, supported by Japan,
agreed only to talk about substantial reductions in the subsidies.
</P>
<P>
In other areas, differences have remained between the rich and
the poor, and between the rich themselves. Many countries bar
foreign services firms while the U.S. wanted negotiations to open
up a long list of services like banking, education, insurance,
telecommunications and air transport.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also insists on more transparency in the WTO, but
negotiators could not agree on opening up the organization's
controversial dispute resolution process or allowing formal input
into that process from non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
With the significant differences and a policy-making system
based on consensus, it's impossible for the WTO ministers to make
a decision to launch the new round and the prepared declaration
draft was aborted in the end.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, the success of eight rounds of global
trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
, the WTO's predecessor, has accelerated the growth of world trade
and economy. The world's total trade and output last year was  15
times and six times respectively the level of 1950.
</P>
<P>
A new round will add trillions of U.S. dollars to the world
economy and both the developed and the developing countries will
benefit from it. Everyone needs it. Despite the setback in Seattle,
experts say it will be launched when major WTO members have the
political will to make concessions.

The speaker said interested individuals and representatives of
organizations will be invited by the committees to give evidence

<HEADLINE> Two Tanzanian Escapees Taken Back by Hungry Lions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Two Tanzanian inmates who
had successfully escaped from custody had a short-lived freedom
after lions from a nearby forest thwarted their mission, the
Sunday Observer newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, as soon as the two inmates of Ngwale
prison in the southwest Mbeya Region made their escape last
Friday, they came face to face with the fierce looking animals
which were lying a few meters away from the prison surrounded by a
dense forest.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the imminent danger, the two inmates decided to climb
atop a tree where they were also imprisoned for quite some time.
They shouted desperately and finally drew the attention of a
passing vehicle which came to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately enough for the two inmates, the vehicle which
they boarded as soon as they had climbed down did not dance to
their tune. After being questioned for the prison uniform they
were dressing, they were taken back to the "frying pan" they just
escaped.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the two lions was not immediately known. But
obviously they were not amused by the action of the occupants of
the vehicle that came to the aid of the escapees.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that one year ago when three inmates escaped
from the same prison, one of them was killed by a lion from the
same bush and another died of snake bite.
</P>
<P>
Ngwale prison is situated in an area which is surrounded by a
thick forest inhabited by fierce wild animals such as lions,
buffaloes, leopards and elephants as well as very venomous snakes.

<HEADLINE> Iran Eager to Provide Water to UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran is eager to provide
drinking water to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) through a
pipeline, according to Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
Similar projects are also under consideration to supply water
from Iran to Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the Dubai-based Gulf
News daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The pre-feasibility study of transmitting water from Iran to
Dubai, the second largest emirate of the UAE, was submitted to
Dubai authorities in 1994. Iran is still interested in the
project.
</P>
<P>
"We are awaiting a response," said Azizolah Bababee, managing
director of Mahab Ghodss Consulting Engineers, a private joint
stock company in which the government of Iran holds a 49 percent
stake.
</P>
<P>
Due to political differences between the two countries,
especially on the three islands issue, the water project has been
put on the back burner, Bababee was quoted as saying at an
industrial conference.
</P>
<P>
The three islands, namely Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser
Tunbs in the Gulf, are claimed by both the UAE and Iran, but have
been controlled by Tehran since early 1970s, when British forces
left the region.
</P>
<P>
Giving details of the feasibility studies done by Britain's
Lehmayer International, Bababee said Iran proposes to transmit
water from its reservoirs through an undersea pipeline to a high
point in the UAE for distribution within the country.
</P>
<P>
"The price is about 70 percent of the cost of desalination
water produced," he said, adding that the water could by used for
UAE households and industries.
</P>
<P>
Iran currently has 17.5 billion cubic meters of excess water
which it plans to export to Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
The first flow of water will be to Kuwait in the year
2003. Iran is also negotiating with Qatar and Saudi Arabia for
supply of water.
</P>
<P>
Desalination is currently the major source of drinking water
in the UAE. Water demand in the desert country would rise greatly
in the next ten years.

<HEADLINE> China's Scenic Lake Now A Paradise of Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Increasing numbers of
migratory birds have flocked to the well-known beautiful West Lake
in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, adding
color and vitality to its winter scenery.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows there are some 10,000 migratory birds in
the lake area, such as wild ducks, cormorants, gulls, and even
rare white swans and mandarin ducks now dotting on the lake, as
against merely about 1,000 in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Local ornithologists attribute the drastic rise in the number
of migratory birds to a host of measures taken by the local city
government to reinforce environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The ornithologists describe these birds are just as sensitive
to environment as man and say that the multiplicity of birds
itself indicates an ever-improving environment.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Hangzhou Municipal Environmental
Protection Bureau, hundreds of millions of yuan have been
allocated to improve the lake's environment over the last decade.
And a three-km long underground channel has been built to
refurbish the lake by diverting clean water from the Qiantang
River.
</P>
<P>
Local residents have shown great enthusiasm for afforestation
and have planted trees, grass, and flowers around the lake.
</P>
<P>
The latest monitoring shows that the average yearly visibility
in the water is currently more than 50 cm, almost 20 cm more than
in 1979. Experts explain that more than 10 million yuan (1.2
million US dollars) are needed for every cm of improvement.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Airlines Accepts Air Canada Merger Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Canada's No 2 carrier Canadian
Airlines Corp. Saturday accepted the takeover bid by No 1, Air
Canada, to end a merger talks of more than 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Airlines' board announced its agreement to Air
Canada's bid of 92 million Canadian dollars (about 63 million U.S.
dollars) two days before the offer expires.
</P>
<P>
"This is a momentous decision for Canadian Airlines,"
representing "the culmination of months of very public negotiation,
speculation and uncertainty," said Canadian Airlines President
Kevin Benson in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Air Canada offer is the only viable bid to restructure the
industry after Toronto-based buyout specialist Onex Corp. withdrew
its bid of 21 billion Canadian dollars (about 14.3 billion U.S.
dollars) in early November.
</P>
<P>
Canadian gave in with a paltry 88 million Canadian dollars (
about 60 million U.S. dollars) left for its last quarter. The
debt-laden carrier has repeatedly warned that it can survive only
a few more months without support.
</P>
<P>
With the merger plan finalized, Canadian Airlines will be
operated as a separate brand while Air Canada will restructure
Canadian's debt of 1 billion Canadian dollars (about 680 million U.
S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Bangkok's Skytrain Starts Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Blessed by the commuters in
Bangkok as the much-anticipated skytrain, Bangkok's first mass
transit system, finally went into service on Sunday after a
three-month test run.
</P>
<P>
The 23.5-kilometer skytrain, running 12 meters above the
busiest streets in Bangkok, is expected to attract people who
drive their own cars and who use taxis to work.
</P>
<P>
Consisting of two lines, which meet at a transit station, the
system is able to carry 25,000 passengers per hour in both
directions.
</P>
<P>
Each train consists of three carriages, namely one drivers'
carriage and two trailers, which can accommodate up to 126 seated
passengers and provide standing area for 735 additional travelers.
</P>
<P>
The train can travel at a maximum speed of 80 kilometers per
hour, but the average traveling speed will be 35 kilometers per
hour.
</P>
<P>
The longest time traveling from the beginning to the end of the
system will last only 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Powered by electrical motors, the skytrain is expected to cause
little damage to the environment.
</P>
<P>
The fare for the skytrain, running from 6 a.m. to 12 p.m.,
ranges from 10 to 40 baht (0.25 to 1.04 U.S. dollars) based on
distance of the journey.
</P>
<P>
However, Bangkok Governor Bhichit Rattakul said the system
would have limited impact on congestion in the short term.
</P>
<P>
He said the system will eventually ease the city's notorious
traffic in seven or eight years when 11 new feeder routes are
opened to bring passengers from the suburbs to the skytrain and a
planned subway system.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students Offered New Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China's commercial banks are
experimenting with credit-record-based educational loans designed
to allow students in need access to education.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily Business Weekly reported that commercial
banks in the country have often required applicants to submit
collateral before granting loans to avoid credit risks.
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC) loosened its education loan application requirements and
began granting loans to students with sound credit records.
</P>
<P>
With the recommendation of the student work division of
universities, needy students can access State subsidized
educational loans easily without submitting collateral, Li
Yuanyuan, director of the Consumer Credit Division under the ICBC'
s retail department, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Other commercial banks are also pondering enriching their
educational loan varieties to include loans based on credit
worthiness.
</P>
<P>
"After a year's study, students will have accumulated a credit
record, which can be used as a reference when requesting a loan.
Students can act as guarantors for each other in applying for the
loans," Yang Mingsheng, vice-president of the Agricultural Bank of
China, said.
</P>
<P>
College and university students have responded to the new
credit forms enthusiastically, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
However, because China's credit check system remains incomplete,
risks still exist, bankers said.

<HEADLINE> China's Toy Industry Ready for Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into the World
Trade Organization will benefit the country's toy industry in the
long run even though challenges remain, according to a report in
today's China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
"Preferential duties on toy exports will be available when
China enters the trade club," Chao Hongling, secretary-general of
the China Toy Association, said, adding it will stimulate the
growth of the toy production industry.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the industry is expected to increase
markedly when China lifts its tariffs during the next five years,
Chao said. "New ideas, trade experiences and more employment
opportunities will come with it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Six thousand firms produce toys in the country, mainly for
export. And their exports increased in value from 3.55 billion U.S.
dollars in 1995 to 5.35 billion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Chao said trade agents in Hong Kong will also benefit from the
development of the industry because most of the exports are
conducted via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He added that domestic toy makers will not experience
significant changes in the near future although overseas
competitors will continue to battle Chinese toy producers in
international market.
</P>
<P>
Most foreign toy producers focus on luxurious intellectually
oriented toys while China's participation in this market has not
matured, Chao said.

<HEADLINE> China's Banks Told to Use Swaps Wisely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Both commercial banks and
enterprises participating in China's debt-to-equity swap program
must fully reform their operations to avoid incurring new losses
and to attain profitability.
</P>
<P>
"We must guard against some enterprises' using the swap as a
way to avoid collecting legitimate debts," Jiang Jianqing, vice-
president of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC),
was quoted by today's China Daily Business Weekly as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's bank is expected to transfer non-performing assets
worth 350 billion yuan (42.2 billion US dollars) to the China
Huarong Asset Management Corporation, though no timetable has been
announced.
</P>
<P>
"We should bear in mind that only loss-making enterprises
should rely on the debt-equity swap solution to deal with their
debt," he added.
</P>
<P>
Banks should carefully evaluate the quality of their assets,
properly manage valid loans and try to improve their assets before
considering referring them to asset management corporations.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises' high debt ratios have various origins,
with a lack of adequate capitalization one of them, according to
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Many of these enterprises have relied on commercial bank loans
to sustain production or operations, which has led to some of
their high debt ratios, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We will focus on enterprises that have State priority whose
problem loans emerged during the enterprises' technical upgrading
or expansion," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC will take a leading role in arranging debt-to-equity
swaps for 42 firms suggested by the State Economic and Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
After the swaps, the assets-liability ratios of these
enterprises are expected to decrease by an average of 9.5 percent
from more than 60 percent in the beginning, and the quantity and
proportion of non-performing assets held by the ICBC will also
decrease substantially.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Telecommunication Sector May Be Hit by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's telecommunication
sector, especially the state-run Bangladesh Telegraph and
Telephone board (BTTB), may be affected by the Y2K problem, or the
millennium bug, The Financial Express daily newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunication sector, considered a vital and essential
service, may experience disruption in its services due to presence
of some embedded chips in its exchanges, concurred sources were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of the total equipment and systems of the BTTB
have been compliant and the rest are being upgraded, according to
the Bangladesh Computer Council, an organization under the
Ministry of Science and Technology in charge of overseeing the Y2K
issue in the country.
</P>
<P>
"BTTB does not anticipate any problem in transmission, but may
face some problem in data transmission and in monitoring," said a
report of the computer council.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Y2K bug might affect the BTTB across its
network although it had taken necessary steps to make their system
compliant and to maintain continuity of services during the year
2000 transition.

WARSAW, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A fierce winter storm swept
through Poland Friday through Saturday, killing three people and
injuring many others, causing flooding and severely disrupting
power and transport.

tens of thousands of households, according to the Polish Press
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Railways and roads were blocked by downed trees. In inshore
regions, many buildings were submerged by flood water caused by
the storm.

<HEADLINE> China's Interior Decoration Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China's growing demand for
interior decoration is expected to lend vitality to housing
decoration, building materials and furniture-making enterprises,
according to industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
A report from the China Social Survey Institute shows that
about one-fifth of residential housing in large and medium-sized
Chinese cities have been remodeled.
</P>
<P>
The China National Interior Decoration Association predicts the
industry will earn 300 billion yuan (36 billion US dollars) in
annual income during the next four years.
</P>
<P>
This indicates residential activity has been confined to a
small portion of the available home decoration market and means
there is room for further development, Zhang Shili, the newly-
appointed chairman of China Institute of Interior Design, was
quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
People are expected to increasingly shift their attention
towards creating functional homes with professional interior
designs that cater to the special requirements of families.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the newspaper noted, Chinese families are likely
to select special and delicately looking furniture to accent their
newly refined homes.
</P>
<P>
At present, world leading furniture firms have introduced
modern furniture featuring simplicity, solidity and brightness on
Chinese market, nevertheless, high prices have often kept ordinary
families from being able to buy them.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Optimistic About Euro's Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder has remained calm about the euro's slide, believing that
the robust economic strengths of the euroland economy will tide
the currency over the sluggish period.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the weakening euro which tumbled to 1 dollar and
even less for the first time on Thursday, Schroeder said on
Saturday that "we do not need to panic at all and there is no
reason to panic."
</P>
<P>
He said a lower euro would undoubtedly benefit Germany's
exports. At the same time, the strong economic strengths of
European countries would bolster the euro to recover.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the causes of the euro's decline, some economists
here said the economic policies adopted by the Schroeder
administration led the international financial markets to doubt
about the country's zest in reforms. The suspicion was one of the
main causes of the euro's weakness.
</P>
<P>
Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, shared
the same view, saying that the policies adopted by the German
government led to the slow pace in the country's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The German Economic Research Institute in Berlin argued that
the European Central Bank missed the chance to use the lever of
the exchange rate, which resulted in the euro's fall. It said
investors turned to the dollar in the face of a weak euro, which
further added to euro's weakness and the strength of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, it believed that the economic situation in Europe and
the entire world is more favorable to the euro than to the U.S.
dollar. Important statistics show that the euro will gradually
recover its strength.
</P>
<P>
The euro was jointly launched by 11 European nations as the
single European currency on January 1, in a bid to create a
regional and monetary union. It has now devaluated about 16
percent from its initial value.

<P>
FUZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Cultural activities in east
China's Fujian Province have experienced a boom period this year.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has produced rich, vivid and colorful arts programs such
as local opera and TV series, said a provincial cultural official.
To date, a number of cultural facilities have been built,
including a television center and a cultural activity center.
</P>
<P>
Local art troupes have given numerous open-air performances for
the general public, many in enterprises, army barracks, campuses
and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, writers in Fujian Province have printed published
many good novels and literary writings about the celebrities in
the province, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, public cultural activities have increased in the
province, including singing contests, ballets, symphonic concerts
and colorful recreational programs which have attracted flocks of
urban and rural residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
To manage the cultural market still better, Fujian has made a
considerable effort to crack down on illegal printing and selling
of pirated and pornographic publications. So far, more than 20,000
illegal books, tapes, CDs and VCDs have been seized, and 138
illegal bookstores or recreational shops have suspended business.

a major cotton producer in northwest China, has become profitable
this year, with its industrial added value rising to 823 million
yuan and pretax profit to 29.29 million yuan during the first 10

<P>
Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- The Ertan Hydroelectric Power Station, China's largest
hydroelectric power station located on the Yalong River in Ertan
of Sichuan Province, went on line Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The power station has six generators with a total installed
generating capacity of 3.3 million kilowatts. It will generate 17
billion kwh of electricity annually, or a quarter of the combined
power supply of the Chongqing-Sichuan power grid.
</P>
<P>

However, Huang said, the reduction does not represent a reduced
commitment to China. Instead, the bank will shift its emphasis to
helping the country deal with major difficulties related to reform.
</P>
<P>

to lend vitality to housing decoration, building materials and
furniture-making enterprises, said Zhang Shili, the newly-

<HEADLINE> World Bank Shifts Lending Strategy for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) is to slash
its annual lending to China from about three billion U.S. dollars
to some two billion U.S. dollars over the next three years,
according to a WB source.
</P>
<P>
However, the reduction does not represent a reduced commitment
to China but a shift of its emphasis to helping the country deal
with major difficulties related to reform, Yukon Huang, director
of the WB's China Program, was quoted by today's China Daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The WB decision was made possible by China's changed situation
as the country is now expected to make better use of its own
resources and rely less on external borrowing because its interest
rates are comparatively low, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The shift reflects China's maturation in economic strength and
the higher efficiency of lending projects," Huang noted, adding
that even at two billion U.S. dollars a year, China will still be
among the largest borrowers of the bank and will probably continue
to be the largest borrower for investment projects.
</P>
<P>
Huang went on to say that the World Bank will continue to work
with China and will offer more assistance to reform in banking,
housing, enterprise and social sectors.

<P>
HANGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Pan Penghui, an over 40 year
old man living in an outlying coastal village in east China's
Zhejiang Province did not expect that the Internet would provide
him with so many business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
An owner of a valve producing firm in Shuilong Village of
Yuhuan County, a six-hour bus drive from Hangzhou, the provincial
capital, Pan's business has been booming since he bought a
computer and began surfing on Net two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Pan describes the impact of the Net on his business as akin to
an "earthquake measuring 6 on the Richter scale." His company's
monthly business has risen from 300,000 yuan (about 3,500 U.S.
dollars) to one million yuan (120,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hampered by poor, rugged road conditions and little access to
information technology, villagers in Shuilong (lit: "water dragon")
have relied soly on crops as a means of eking out an existence.
However, with the introduction of information technology (IT), in
particular, the Net, local farmers in the village have been
adopted a number of other ways to compete and survive.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiuping, owner of the Yuhuan Carburetor Factory, has
invited a college student to help him get access information from
the Net. His factory produces accessories for China's largest
automobile manufacturer -- China No.1 Automobile Works. Automobile
accessories from Chen's factory have entered the world market and
are sold to Italy, Indonesia, Turkey and other countries.
</P>
<P>
More and more people in the village have telephones and
computers in their homes, attend technical training courses and
surf the Net.

<HEADLINE> 31 Killed in Fresh Riots in Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 31 persons have been
killed and three others injured in fresh riots which have raged
since Thursday night in Central Maluku district, according to the
Antara News Agency Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The riots occurred at Alang Asaude village, Piru subdistrict,
on Thursday. Deputy Chief of the Central Maluku Police Department
Major Drs Agus said that the riots had also spread to Lisabata
Barat and Nuniali villages in Taniwel subdistrict.
</P>
<P>
In the riots, a number of houses of local people were burnt
down but the exact figure of torched houses was still unknown.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the riot-hit areas has calmed down somewhat
after local security forces were reinforced by marines and police
mobile brigade troops from Central Maluku and East Java province,
Antara reported.
</P>
<P>
The causes of the clashes, which have killed 31 persons, are
still unknown, Antara said, adding that unconfirmed reports said
they were religion-related.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 207 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.
</P>
<P>
The province has been ravaged by a series of communal clashes
over the last few months. According to police records, the riots
have claimed 675 lives, left 975 seriously injured and 618
sustained minor injuries on the part of the local people. On the
part of the security agencies, 14 have been killed, 47 were
seriously wounded and 41 slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Police Chief Gen. Roesmanhadi said here Saturday
that the National Police will set up a Maluku Peace Task Force
soon to help overcome communal strife in the East Indonesian
province.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, the task force will endeavor the drawing up
of a joint declaration by village chiefs and the conflicting
parties to bury the hatchet.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the task force will see to the establishment
of lasting peace by all parties concerned on the basis of "pela
gandong" (a traditional principle of communal harmony).
</P>
<P>
As concerns the police on duty in Ambon, capital of Maluku,
Roesmanhadi said that he had asked the local police, both Muslims
and Christians, to act impartially.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- The government and the rebel Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) started Friday their fourth round
of peace talks, expecting a Christmas and New Year ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"The truce is being considered by the FARC secretariat," said
Fabio Valencia Cossio, one of the government negotiators, after a
consultation with guerrilla spokesman Raul Reyes.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Andres Pastrana proposed that all the
actors of the internal armed conflict should cease hostilities for
30 days, starting December 15.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing paramilitary groups also announced their
willingness to respect the truce, in the same way as the Self

CAIRO -- Iraq will reject a week-long extension of the oil-for-
food program considered by the United Nations Security Council,
the oil minister said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival to attend a meeting of Arab oil ministers, Amir
Muhammad Rashid said the possible decision is "an evil and
meanless step aimed at blackmailing the Security Council permanent
members which are trying to push the United States and Britain to
agree to lift economic sanctions."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under international trade embargo since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. The U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food program allows
Baghdad to sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six
months to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The planned one-week extension is not practical, Rashid said,
adding that if the U.N. Security Council adopts a relevant
resolution, Iraq would "turn it down just as (the country) did
with an earlier two-week extension proposal." (Egypt-Iraq-UN)

UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. Security Council Friday voiced its "
deepest concern" at the current violence in Burundi, and welcomed
the African leaders' decision to designate former South African
President Nelson Mandela as the new mediator for the Burundian
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council for the month of December, Jeremy Greenstock,
said, the Council members "expressed their deepest concern at the
ongoing violence in Burundi against the background of a fragile
situation in the region more widely, and appealed to all parties
to the conflict to cease hostilities immediately."
</P>
<P>
"They likewise expressed concern at the worsening humanitarian
situation and called for full, unhindered and safe access for all
U.N. and international humanitarian and human rights workers in
Burundi," the statement said. "They called for a greater focus on
the protection of individual rights in the country."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also repeated its concern at the policy of
forced regroupment and called on the Government of Burundi to
allow the affected people to return to their homes "with full and
unhindered access throughout the process." (UN-Burundi)

WASHINGTON -- The United States said on Friday that it had
asked Iran for cooperation on the probe into the bombing of Kohbar
Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996, but had got no responses.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received from the government of Iran the kind of
responses we have been hoping for," State Department spokesman
James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In August, President Bill Clinton sent a message to Iranian
president Mohammad Khatami through U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Martin Indyk and Bruce Reidel of the National Security
Council, seeking cooperation for the investigation of the bombing
of Kohbar Towers, which killed 19 American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the Iranian response had tended to be "hidebound and
unimaginative."
</P>
<P>
The United States, while seeking cooperation with Iran in
combating international terrorism, has been continuing its
accusation that the government of Iran reneges on promises to
abandon support for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Iran, under the U.S. accusation, has reasonably refused any
suggestion about cooperation. (US-Iran)

<HEADLINE> Honduras Denounces Deployment of Nicaraguan Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Honduran government on
Saturday denounced Nicaragua for deploying some 60 soldiers on the
border near Trojes, a Honduran community.
</P>
<P>
"This deployment of troops does not contribute to raising a
climate of confidence and tranquillity, but increasing the
tensions created by their government," said Honduran Foreign
Minister Roberto Flores Bermudez in "a forceful protest" he sent
to his Nicaraguan counterpart Eduardo Montealegre.
</P>
<P>
Flores Bermudez told Montealegre that the ratification of a
maritime treaty with Colombia is a sovereign action of the
Honduras State.
</P>
<P>
Honduras on Friday sought foreign observers' help to avoid a
military showdown with Nicaragua as the two countries continued
claiming an area of Atlantic waters rich in fishing and potential
oil and natural gas resources.
</P>
<P>
The request followed days of escalating tensions over the
Honduras-Colombia maritime treaty which grants Honduras and
Colombia 130,000 square kilometers of Atlantic waters historically
claimed by Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said territorial disputes are common among the
tiny Central American nations born of the Spanish conquest, but
few have reached this level of belligerence and only this one has
threatened to jeopardize efforts to form a political and economic
union on the isthmus.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for a
peaceful resolution, saying the United Nation is ready to provide
any assistance.

<HEADLINE> Container Port Expansion Project Finished in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Yantian International
Container Port in the south China port city of Shenzhen, which
borders Hong Kong, has increased its annual handling capacity to 2
million TEUs, with the recent completion of the second phase of
the project.
</P>
<P>
Every day, the port handles a large amount of cargo through the
port of entry in Shenzhen. It registered 2.4 million TEUs of
containers during the first ten months of this year, and is
expected to finish at 2.9 million TEUs this year, a rise of 46.8
percent from the previous year. The figure ranks among the world's
top 15 container ports.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 percent of the city's foreign trade is made
through the port, said Zhang Binghan, deputy director of the
municipal port administration authority. With the country's goal
of WTO accession approaching, the handling volume is likely to
continue the upbeat momentum to reach 3.5 million TEUs next year,
he said.

JAKARTA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese world champion Sun Jun
will lose his number one ranking to long-time rival Peter Gade-
Christensen of Denmark next week after he crashed out at the
world grand prix finals, the International Badminton Federation
said in Brunei.
</P>
<P>
It will be a double upset for the injury-hit men's singles star,
who was eliminated Friday by eventual finalist Marleve Mainaky of
Indonesia at the group phase of this season-ending tournament.
</P>
<P>
Gade-Christensen, the Danish former world number one, will
return to the top spot of the world rankings to be published by
the federation on Thursday, whether or not he wins Sunday's final
against Mainaky.
</P>
<P>
Sun, 24, had replaced the 23-year-old Dane at the top after
winning the world championship in Copenhagen in May. However he
had not won a major event since as he struggled with a back injury
which forced him to miss last month's China Open, a grand prix
event.
</P>
<P>
Sun was winless in GP events this year while Gade-Christensen
won the All-England Open in March and reached the semi-finals of
the Danish Open in October.
</P>
<P>
Sun lost in straight sets to world number eight Mainaky on
Friday at the season-ending Brunei tournament, which features the
world's top 16 men's singles players. The second-ranked Gade-
Christensen reached the final without dropping a set. He beat
world number six Wong Choong Hann of Malaysia at Saturday's
semifinal.

<HEADLINE> Preparations Smooth for Hydropower Plant on Hongshui River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for building a
major hydroelectric power plant on the Hongshui River in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are proceeding well and
should be finished by June 2001.
</P>
<P>
Longtan Hydropower Plant, situated inside Guangxi's Tian'e
County near Guizhou Province, is the most important project out of
a number of the planned hydropower plants in exploring abundant
hydroelectric resources on the Hongshui River.
</P>
<P>
The plant will have an installed generating capacity of 4.2
million kw for development in the near future and 5.4 million kw
for long-term development.
</P>
<P>
The project will be second only after the gigantic Three Gorges
Water Control Project on the Yangtze River. The Three Gorges Dam,
which is under construction, will have an installed generating
capacity of 17.68 million kw.
</P>
<P>
Longtan Hydropower Plant will be jointly financed by the China
National Power Corporation, the Guangxi Development Investment Co.
Ltd., Guangxi Power Co. Ltd., and Guizhou Capital Construction
Investment Company.
</P>
<P>
The idea to build the project was set forth back in the 1950s.
In the subsequent years, experts have approved reports on
feasibility, preliminary design, environmental effect,
resettlement plans for local residents who will have to move out
of their homes, as well as analysis into the social and economic
benefits of the project.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory construction for the project began in May 1992. So
far, 550 million yuan (66.3 million US dollars) has been spent in
building infrastructure that will help pave the way for
construction of the hydroelectric power plant.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure includes facilities for power, water,
transport and ground leveling, said an official in charge of the
construction.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the project will help advance economic
growth in China's western areas and lift poor areas inhabited by
people of ethnic groups out of poverty.

BERLIN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Vladimir Klitscho stopped
Hungarian Lajos Eros in two rounds in his first defense of his
European heavyweight title in Hanover, Germany, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Klitscho, a 2-meter Ukrainian fighting in Germany, dropped Eros
to his knees with a series of blows midway through the second
round.
</P>
<P>
A few seconds later, he knocked Eros backwards to the canvas by
battering him with another series of combinations. The Hungarian's
corner threw in the towel to end the one-sided affair.
</P>
<P>
Klitschko, 31-1 with 24 knockouts, snapped Eros head back with
his left jab from the opening seconds. The Hungarian's record fell
to 21-9-1.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I was a little hectic, but I'm a lot more patient than I
was a year ago," said the 23-year-old Klitschko.
</P>
<P>
Klitschko is being built up for a world title fight, but that
can only come against Lennox Lewis since he owns the three major

<HEADLINE> EU Commends Mozambique's Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Joint
Observation Mission has praised the first day of Mozambique's
second multiparty general elections for the high turnout of voters
and the efficient operation of polling stations.
</P>
<P>
The country's seven million registered voters began casting
ballots on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A Saturday press release from the EU mission said that most of
the 64 EU observers had communicated with the mission's Maputo
office on Friday night or on early Saturday morning. They had
visited over 450 polling stations (more than five per cent of the
total) in 34 districts scattered through the 11 provinces.
</P>
<P>
Observers said "turnout on the first day was good, typically in
the 40 to 60 percent bracket of registered voters", but reports
from the largest constituency, the northern Province of Nampula,
indicated a lower turnout there.
</P>
<P>
"Polling was running smoothly and we had only half a dozen
minor problems reported", said the EU mission.
</P>
<P>
Perti Paasio, head of the EU Joint Observation Mission, said:
"We are particularly impressed by the competence of polling
station staff, the manner in which they assist voters who need
explanation, and the disciplined behavior of the hundreds of
people we have seen everywhere waiting in queues to vote."

<HEADLINE> Madagascar to Jail Rwanda Genocide Convicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Madagascar has agreed to
offer prison facilities for those convicted of producing the 1994
genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR),
sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mali was the first country to offer prison facilities when it
signed an agreement with ICTR in February, and Benin followed in
August.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Detention Facility in Arusha, northern
Tanzania, where the ICTR sits, has 56 well-equipped cells holding
38 genocide suspects.
</P>
<P>
Established on November 8, 1994 by the United Nations Security
Council, the ICTR has the mandate to try persons suspected to be
responsible for genocide and other serious violations of the
international humanitarian law committed in the territory of
Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal has so far issued 28 indictments against 48
individuals since ICTR began operating in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
About half a million Rwandans, most of them Tutsis, were
reportedly killed during the 1994 genocide by the majority ethnic
Hutus.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Proposes Genoa For 2001 Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema proposed here Saturday that the Italian northwestern city of
Genoa be the city in which Italy will host the summit of G7 in
June of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference, he said he envisaged Genoa utilizing
the summit to enter a new phase in its growth, just as Naples did
for the G7 summit in July, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The summit enabled the southern port city to push through a
radical refurbishment of its image and city center, which also led
to the international banking community willingly subscribing to
its municipal bonds.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema pointed out that the 2001 summit will be especially
significant because there will be a new U.S. president, a new
Russian president and also a new Italian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
General elections must be held in Italy no later than the
spring of 2001, that is in the weeks preceding the summit.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said that, even though the government would not be able
to earmark large sums to finance preparations for the summit, it
would enable the city to use fast-track planning procedures which
he said were the crucial factor for relaunching Naples.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian President Demands WTO Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso demanded Saturday deep reforms in the
World Trade Organization (WTO) that will permit poor nations
access to the markets of the rich nations.
</P>
<P>
The present system of multilateral commerce adopts a regime of
discrimination that protects the rich and punishes the poor, said
Cardoso during a ceremony to mark the 40th anniversary of the
Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) creation.
</P>
<P>
The WTO faces two options: to continue with the old
discriminatory model, or to make deep reforms to build rules
really universal, that will permit also the less developed
countries to enter the market in fair conditions, said Cardoso in
Petropolis, Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso reaffirmed the Brazilian government position before the
recent third ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization
in Seattle, United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that the many challenges of international relations
need the joint effort of the American Continent countries for the
strengthening of their ties in the commercial, financial,
scientific and technological fields.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said that the American countries started the
international integration with the reduction of custom duties and
the elimination of trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the South American countries are redesigning the
economic geography with the creation of new axes of development,
not with a national perspective, but with the landscape of gradual
construction of an integrated space of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian president mentioned as an example the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur) highway, the construction of a Bolivia-
Brazil gas pipeline, and the projects of cooperation in the
electricity and oil areas.

<HEADLINE> Six Firefighters Feared Dead in U.S. Building Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Six firefighters were
missing and feared dead Saturday after becoming trapped as a five-
story blaze roared through an abandoned industrial building in
Worcester of Massachusetts State in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out Friday night, was still burning
Saturday morning, and investigators could not yet enter the gutted
building to search for the cause or the missing firefighters.
</P>
<P>
Two of the firefighters had entered the maze-like, brick
structure shortly after the fire began to scout out flames and
searched for two homeless people who reportedly lived there.
</P>
<P>
Those two firefighters radioed for help after becoming
disoriented, and four members of a rescue team sent after them
failed to reappear after the team was ordered out.
</P>
<P>
If the six firefighters are confirmed dead, it would be the
deadliest building blaze for firefighters in the United States
since six New York City firefighters died in a supermarket fire on
August 2, 1978.

sustained growth, the strengthening of democracy, and more
participation of the civil society in public administration.
</P>

The Inter-American Development Bank was founded 40 years ago in
Petrololis, some 100 kilometers outside Rio de Janeiro to help
