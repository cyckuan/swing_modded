<HEADLINE> 90,000 Indians Die A Year For Inaccessibility of  Kidney Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 90,000 Indians die
each year for poor access to a kidney transplant in the country,
the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Government hospitals across India are seeing an influx of
kidney patients requiring transplants, many of whom are turned
back either for the lack of adequate kidneys or for their
inability to afford a transplant, PTI quoted Dr. S.C. Dash, head
of the nephrology department at the All-India Institute of Medical
Sciences, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Only a quarter of the patients can afford a transplant and
among them, only a half can find a vacancy in a hospital, the
doctor noted.
</P>
<P>
"We have to turn a large number of kidney failure patients back.
This is a very frustrating experience in government hospitals," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The doctor added that due to their poor facilities, many Indian
hospitals also fail to provide kidney failure patients with
specialized treatment like dialysis, which is currently not
available to 90 percent of the patients.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government take steps to promote the
manufacturing of dialysis equipment at home to reduce the cost of
treatment and make it available to the poor.

STOCKHOLM -- Senior representatives of 45 governments stated
Friday in the Stockholm holocaust conference declaration that the
international community is liable for reminding mankind of the
terrible suffering of Nazi victims, and to prevent historical
tragedies from repeating.
</P>
<P>
Their declaration was part of the conclusion of a three-day
conference entitled, Stockholm International Forum on the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
The declaration stated that the holocaust, planned and carried
out by the Nazis, fundamentally challenged the foundations of
civilization. After half a century, it remains an event with a
profound impact.
</P>
<P>
The international community shares a solemn responsibility to
strengthen the moral commitment of all peoples, and the political
commitment of all governments, to ensure that future generations
understand the causes of the holocaust and reflect upon its
consequences. (Switzerland-Holocaust Conference)

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Draws Pakistan in Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Pakistan was held to
a 1-1 draw by Hong Kong, China, here Friday in the first round
match in the 2000 Asia/Oceania Zone Group II for the Davis Cup
tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not quite happy with my players' performance today," said
Pakistan captain Khavaja Saeed Hai.
</P>
<P>
Khavaja acknowledged that his players lacked experience because
"they play tournaments mainly in our country."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, which was beaten by China last year in the Asia/
Oceania Zone Group I, was surprised in the first singles when
their number two player Asim Shafik was no match against Hong Kong
's top player Melvin Tong.
</P>
<P>
Shafik was beaten in straight sets 6-2, 6-1 and 6-4.
</P>
<P>
But Aisam-ul-Haq Qurashi, now ranked 301st in the world and the
key man who carries his team's winning hope, had to do his best in
full sets by coming from one set down to outgun the host's number
two player Wayne Wong in the second singles with an uneasy score
of 6-7 (7-9), 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 and 6-3.
</P>
<P>
"The results went as we expected, and I think the doubles on
Saturday will be the decider of the match," said trainer Xia
Jiaping from Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
Aisam-ul-Haq Qurashi, will team up with Asim Shafik to play
doubles on Saturday against Andy Brothers and Andrew Town.

<HEADLINE> GCC Officials Discuss Issues on Common Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Customs officials of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states began a meeting in Riyadh,
capital of Saudi Arabia, on Saturday on some key issues related to
the establishment of a GCC common market.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting of the GCC Customs Union Committee will
discuss a mechanism for distributing customs revenues and unifying
GCC members' different import systems, the Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary General for GCC Financial Affairs Ajlan Al-
Kawari said the panel will study a Kuwaiti report on the customs
union, which recommends a fair distribution program of customs
revenues among member states.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the six GCC states, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, agreed at their
20th annual meeting held in Riyadh last November to unify their
tariffs and establish a common market in March, 2005.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, tariffs on a total of 1,289 kinds of
imported goods in the GCC states will be classified into three
categories: duty-free goods, basic goods with a 5.5 percent tariff
and luxury goods with a 7.5 percent tariff.
</P>
<P>
But as GCC countries have different import systems, they have to
reach a consensus on a unified GCC import system before the
targeted date.
</P>
<P>
Since the customs duties in the GCC states are varying between 4
percent and 20 percent, a fair distribution of customs revenues
will have impact on some GCC states, particularly the UAE, which
fear that unifying tariffs will undermine their national interests.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, which has the lowest tariffs among the six GCC
members, was concerned that a unified tariff that is higher than
its current customs level will impair its bid to attract foreign
investment. It has asked for various forms of compensation if it
has to raise its customs to a higher GCC unified tariff.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Draws up Plan to Stimulate Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government has drawn
up a plan aimed to stimulate exports of the country, Minister of
Planning and Minister of State for International Cooperation Ahmed
Mahrous el-Darsh said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar, titled "Exports, Egypt's building a strong
economy," at the Cairo International Book Fair, el-Darsh said the
government will provide technical assistance and necessary funds
for exporters, and seek the assistance of major international
marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
Without exports, the horizons of development will be narrower,
job opportunities will be less and hopes to improve the living
standard will be reduced, the official Middle East News Agency
quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 32nd Cairo book fair attracted 3,700 publishers from 85
countries and 12 Arab and international organizations including the
Arab League and the United Nations. It was opened on January 26 and
will be held through February 2.
</P>

Cairo International Book Fair comes second of the same kind
after the Frankfort International Book Fair in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Wu on China's Economic Prospects in 21st Century (part 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China will stick to
its reform and opening-up policy and participate actively in
international economic cooperation and exchanges in accordance
with the trend towards globalization, said Chinese Vice Premier Wu
Bangguo here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special session on China at the 30th annual
meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Wu told the audience
that guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory over the past two decades,
China has carried out reform and opening up and successfully
embarked on the road of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the social productive forces have rapidly
expanded, China's overall national strength has grown markedly and
the Chinese people have enjoyed a much better life. From 1979 to
1998, China's GDP was up by 490 percent in real terms with an
annual average growth rate of 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"What China has achieved has not only laid a solid foundation
for the future development in the country, but also contributed to
the peace and stability in Asia and the world at large," he said.
</P>
<P>
On China's current economic situation, Wu said that the Chinese
economy has maintained a sound momentum for growth in spite of
impact of the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 devastating
floods. Its GDP increased by 7.8 percent in 1998 and 7.1 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The reason why China has been able to maintain a good momentum
of economic growth in an adverse economic environment is that it
has, under the leadership of President Jiang Zemin, adopted timely
measures to respond to the circumstances and gone ahead with
reform and opening-up," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Right now, the exchange rate of RMB has remained stable with a
foreign exchange reserve of over 150 billion U.S. dollars, Wu said,
adding that both rural and urban residents in China are leading a
much better life.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Wu on China's Economic Prospects in 21st Century (part 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talking about China's development strategy in the new century,
the Chinese vice premier said that China adopted a three-step
development strategy at the initiative of Deng Xiaoping in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The strategic target set for the first step is to double the
GNP of 1980 by the year 1990 and to meet the people's basic needs
for food and clothing and for the second step, to double the 1990
figure by the end of the 20th century and ensure the people a more
comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
The goals set for these two steps have been achieved ahead of
schedule, Wu said. Now, China has set about accomplishing the goal
for the third step, that is, to raise the per capita GDP up to the
level of moderately developed countries, to achieve modernization
by and large and to build China into a strong, prosperous,
democratic and culturally advanced socialist country by the middle
of this century.
</P>
<P>
"As the third step, during the first decade of this century, we
will try to double the year 2000 GDP and achieve an annual average
growth rate of 7 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu briefed the leaders in politics and business present at the
session of China's strategic priorities:
</P>
<P>
-- To conduct strategic economic restructuring. China will
promote industrial optimization and upgrading by relying on
scientific and technological progress and technical innovations in
order to make our industries responsive to the demand on the
domestic and international markets;
</P>
<P>
-- To continue the construction of infrastructure. China will
intensify efforts to harness major rivers and lakes, build a large
number of large and medium-sized economically and socially viable
water conservancy projects, develop clean and renewable energy,
build new urban and rural power grids and upgrade old ones. China
will also improve the transportation and telecommunications
facilities, including express ways, high-speed railways and
communications trunk ways, fiber optical trunk ways in particular
as well as the construction of urban infrastructure with priority
given to subway and rail transportation facilities;
</P>
<P>
-- To develop rural industries and small cities and towns. The
main objective in this aspect is to step up the development and
upgrading of rural industries and commerce on the basis of
processing farm and sideline products;
</P>
<P>
-- To implement the strategy of vigorously developing the
western part of China, or developing the west strategy. As early
as in the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping explicitly put forward a proposal
of strategic importance, that is the two-front development
strategy of overall importance to China's economic modernization.

<P>
"Reform and opening-up is a long-term and basic state policy of
China," Wu pointed out. "We will unswervingly deepen the reform
and open China wider to the outside world. The objective of the
Chinese economic reform is to establish a socialist market
economic system. The key link in this reform is the reform of
state-owned enterprises aimed at establishing a modern enterprise
system."
</P>
<P>
"To conform with the trend towards economic globalization, we
will take a more active part in international economic cooperation
and exchanges, further improve the all-directional, multi-layered
and wide-ranging opening-up pattern and make a better use of both
domestic and international markets and resources so as to promote
the development of the national economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China will not be able to develop in isolation of
the world and the world also needs China for its prosperity. In
the next 10 years, China will continue its large-scale
modernization drive. It is expected that its fixed asset
investment will grow by over 10 percent annually and its total
import in the coming decade will exceed 2,000 billion dollars,
making China the fastest growing "block" and one of the markets
that have the greatest potential.
</P>
<P>
On China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Wu
said that China will not only enjoy its rights, but also fulfill
its obligations after joining the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"We will expand our opening-up program at a quicker pace in
energy, transportation, communications and other infrastructure
areas, gradually provide more opportunities for foreign investment
in the banking, insurance, tourism, retail business, foreign trade,
legal consulting and other sectors, improve the system of laws and
regulations on foreign investment and offer better services to
foreign-invested enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
To conclude his statement, Wu said that China will surely offer
broad prospects for trade and economic cooperation between China
and the rest of the world with economic growth and progress in
reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
"China will present huge business opportunities not only to the
Chinese entrepreneurs but also to those foreign business people
who have vision, courage and will to make investment and set up
factories in China," Wu said. "We sincerely hope that business
people from other countries will seize the opportunity and come to
China for investment and business to our mutual benefit."

<HEADLINE> Adams Says N.Irish Gov't Fall Would Block Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
urged the pro-British unionists not to proceed with their threat
to pull out of Northern Ireland's coalition government, saying
such move would scupper prospects for IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"The one thing we know for certain is that if this (coalition)
collapses, there is not going to be decommissioning (disarmament),
" Adams, whose party is the Irish Republican Army's (IRA)
political arm, told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
He also implied that the IRA might break off talks with General
John de Chastelain, head of the province's disarmament authority,
if unionists withdrew and brought down the home-rule government,
or if Britain were to suspend it.
</P>
<P>
"We also know -- and the UUP (Ulster Unionist Party) and the
British government knows this -- that we got the IRA to go into
the de Chastelain commission... to try and sort this issue out,
provided the (political) institutions were in place," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Are the IRA going to stay in there if the institutions are
collapsed, especially if (they) are collapsed at the whim of one
party because of a unilateral (disarmament) date set by them?"
</P>
<P>
Adams's comments deepened a war of words that has cast a dark
cloud over hopes of political progress after a 30-year guerrilla
war against British rule which the IRA halted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Rival parties are braced for a key report from De Chastelain
Monday that could decide the fate of the eight-week-old provincial
government in which Sinn Fein and the UUP are sharing power for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
Unionists, who speak for the majority Protestant community, say
its survival depends on an early handover of IRA arms as proof
that the republicans' war is over.
</P>
<P>
Unionist leader David Trimble has threatened to resign as the
province's first minister if guns are not handed in. His party has
set February 12 as the deadline when it could pull out of the
power-sharing arrangement.

<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Economic
Forum (WEF) Saturday expressed regret about some violent
demonstrations several hundred meters from the congress center
where the organization's 30th annual meeting is being held.
</P>
<P>
"The World Economic Forum learned with regret that today a
limited group of demonstrators chose violence over dialogue," said
the WEF in a formal statement. "We are saddened that two police
officers have been hurt, and that damage has been inflicted to
private property."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some of the demonstrators smashed shop
windows but failed to penetrate tight security to get near the
conference center.
</P>
<P>
Police in riot gear and backed by water cannon surrounded the
anti-globalization protesters, who smashed car windshields and at
the local McDonald's restaurant in the eastern Swiss town.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Start of New Round of Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton Saturday pledged to continue pushing to get agreement with
other members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) for the launch
of a new global trade round.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 30th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum
(WEF) here Saturday, Clinton said, "I will keep working for
consensus on a new round. We will show flexibility and will ask
our partners to do the same."
</P>
<P>
He called on nations to encourage greater and more widely
sustained economic growth by supporting an open rule-based trading
system. He said that there is no substitute for the confidence and
credibility that the WTO lends to expanding trade based on rules.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Clinton called for more transparency of the
WTO, saying, "We have to let the public see what we're doing. We
have to make more documents available faster. We have to open
dispute panel hearings to the public, we have to let organizations
and individuals give the panels their views."
</P>
<P>
He also held that labor issues should be discussed in a new WTO
working group and environmental issues in sessions of a committee
where developing countries have a majority.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Invited to Attend Summit Meeting of Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
said Saturday his country would attend the summit meeting of
developing countries to be held in the Cuban capital of Havana in
April, at the invitation of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was included in a letter delivered to Saddam by
Castro's personal envoy Alfonso Fraga Piers who was visiting Iraq,
the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said during his meeting with the Cuban envoy that since
the 1970s, Iraq has shown its interests and effectively
participated in the activities of the Non-Alligned Movement and the
Group of 77.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president slammed the United States for imposing
hegemony all over the world, citing U.S. military actions and
embargoes against Iraq and Yugoslavia, and the U.S. efforts of
destabilizing Cuba and Indonesia through embargoes.
</P>
<P>
He called on world countries to show solidarity to defend their
independence and national interests "regardless of sacrifices
needed for changing the present situation for the better."
</P>
<P>
Saddam confirmed that Iraq would also attend the preparatory
meetings and activities of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Asian, African and Latin American developing
countries will be invited to the summit, due to be held on April
10-14, to discuss issues of globalization of the economy, North-
South cooperation and South-South cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Biosafety Protocol Adopted by More Than 130 Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The success came after five years of dispute over the use of
genetically modified organisms (GMO) and failures in attempts to
reach an agreement in the past year in Cartagena and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
One of the key compromises already made is that a vague
labeling is required for genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
Under a compromise version of "Article 8.7," a label must go
with GMO exports indicating they might be a GMO product, without
specifics though.
</P>
<P>
The parties involved may continue negotiating a deal on the
labeling details in the following two years.
</P>
<P>
The labeling compromise is considered part of the rights gained
by the European Union and less developed countries to possibly ban
imports of genetically modified products if they believe the
products are unsafe.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Environment Minister David Anderson said Saturday in a
statement that his country "recognizes the right of every country
to restrict the import" of living modified organisms that "would
harm its biodiversity."
</P>
<P>
"That is why Canada supports the precautionary approach which
allows nations to take action even in the absence of full
scientific certainty," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The Miami group, including the United States, Canada, Australia,
Argentina, Uruguay and Chile, is also a winner being awarded a "
savings clause" to ensure there won't be override over other
international agreements, including those under the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The historic agreement resulted from the conflict of concerns
about losses to the rising biotech industry, which already
generates billions of dollars in international trade, and about
human health as genetically altered crops have not been adequately
tested for safety.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace activists also fear that GMO could proliferate in
the environment, wiping out native species.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, which is yet to be ratified before taking effect
in the next few years, is reached under the auspices of the United
Nations Biodiversity Secretariat and chairmanship of Colombian
Environment Minister Juan Myar Maldonado, who vowed not to leave
Montreal without a deal at Monday's opening session.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 253 Tons of Illicit Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian police have seized
over 253 tons of various narcotics since the beginning of the
current Iranian calendar year, which will end on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the anti-drug headquarters Mohammad Fallah on
Saturday told a seminar of anti-drug officers of Iran and Pakistan
that 740 drug traffickers have been apprehended so far in the
Iranian year, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 183 Iranian soldiers were killed and many more
injured in the anti-drug campaigns, Fallah said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar opened here on Saturday with the aim to
review ways to combat drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Iranian Vice President for Executive Affairs
Mohammad Hashemi said that 235 tons of various narcotics were
confiscated in Iran in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from Afghanistan
and neighboring Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Strict anti-drug campaigns kicked off in Iran in 1989 after the
Majlis (parliament) passed an anti-drug law authorizing capital
punishment on drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
A commander of the Iranian security forces said last November
that the country has spent 1 billion U.S. dollars on combating drug
trafficking since the Islamic revolution in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Keeps Low Key on Resumed Proximity Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said here Saturday that the Greek Cypriot side will not
turn the U.N.-brokered proximity talks into confidence building
measure talks with the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to the talks to discuss the substance of the
Cyprus problem, and not the measures", because the measures could
be discussed in Cyprus, Clerides noted before leaving for Geneva to
attend the resumed proximity talks on Cyprus which will start on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that such measures could be discussed, as
long as they do not imply recognition of the breakaway regime in
the north of the island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash held the first
proximity talks last December in the United Nations' headquarters
in New York, the United States, during which the two sides
contacted through U.N. officials shuttling between them.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said, "The U.N. Secretary-General has not asked us to
discuss specific issues."
</P>
<P>
He said the Geneva talks aim at an in-depth discussion on the
four core issues -- the distribution of powers, territorial
aspects, security and property.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his Special
Adviser for Cyprus Alvaro de Soto will have separate meetings with
Clerides and Denktash.
</P>
<P>
De Soto will then take over the proximity talks, expected to
last about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when the
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been pushing for the reunification of Cyprus in a
bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but no significant
achievements have been scored so far.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots, backed by Ankara, demanded that their
breakaway republic be recognized and that the talks with Nicosia be
on equal basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Saturday praised the economic readjustment made by Malaysia to
overcome the negative effects from the Asian economic and
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said during a dinner with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad at the Elysee presidential palace that he was happy to see
that the economic recovery of Malaysia was rapid, according to
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also told Mahathir that France intended to relaunch its
economic cooperation with Malaysia, whose perspectives of economic
growth were considered "bright" by France, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting was the occasion to see how to relaunch our
bilateral relations, which were a little restrained by the effects
of the Asian crisis," she said.
</P>
<P>
France intends to launch a number of cooperation projects in
the economic and military fields with Malaysia and French State
Secretary of Exterior Trade Francois Huward will visit Kuala
Lumpur in March, said French officials.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir arrived here Saturday from South America and he will
go to London later.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Mahathir also mentioned the preparation for the
third summit of the Europe-Asia Forum to be held in Seoul in
October, and both of them stressed the importance of close
European-Asian cooperation said Colonna.

<HEADLINE> 95 Chechen Rebels Surrender Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-four rebels surrendered in
Grozny Saturday to a representative of the Chechen Prosecutor
General's Office and to units under Beslan Gantamirov's command, a
senior Kremlin official said.
</P>
<P>
This brought the total number of rebels surrendering Saturday
to 95 across the whole territory of the breakaway republic, said
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, aide to Acting Russian President Vladimir
Putin.
</P>
<P>
Gantamirov leads a group of Chechen militia loyal to the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky described it as the first mass surrender of
militants in the Chechen campaign, which marks "a turning-point"
and could become the key trend soon, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Some of the rebels were badly wounded and received immediate
medical aid following their surrender, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
The rest were whisked by Justice Ministry vehicles to Urus-
Martan and placed in the facilities of the interior department of
the Chechen town.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' identity and possible involvement in terrorist
activities in Russia are being established, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Those who are not guilty of crime would be pardoned in line
with a presidential decree and a State Duma ruling, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition Launches Offensive Toward Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean largest opposition
party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), launched its
offensive on Saturday toward the parliament election which is
scheduled for this March by unveiling a manifesto promising to
restore economic stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
MDC, which was founded in last September, started its two-day
 inaugural congress in Chitungwiza near Harare on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition placed its priorities to widening access to
resources and build productive capacities for long term social
and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
It promises to redistribute at least five million hectares of
land to 100,000 families.
</P>
<P>
It said that the party will establish an economic and
development policy framework that is geared for stable and
equitable growth and the provision of basic needs, supported by
greater participation, accountability and transparency in the
formulation and implementation of financial, fiscal, economic and
development policies.
</P>
<P>
 MDC has been accusing President Robert Mugabe's Zanu (PF)
government of mismanaging the economy and is seeking a chance to
take over the reins of power and correct the situation.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 delegates from all over the country are
attending the congress. The MDC, which got support of the
country's largest trade union organization, Zimbabwe Congress of
Trade Union, attempted to win more seats in parliamentary
elections in March this year.

CAIRO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic news
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon imported 4,992,360 tons of oil and its
derivatives at a value of some 809.4 million U.S. dollars last
year, according to statistics from the Ministry of Oil.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Lebanon saw an increase of 5.3 percent in the
amount of oil and oil product imports from 4,740,939 tons in 1998,
which cost the country 624.19 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The imports increase was mainly attributed to the rise in global
oil prices last year and the mounting domestic demand for oil.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and Iraq have reached an agreement on extending
a pipeline to Jordan's oil refinery before the end of the year,
said Jordanian Minister of Energy Wael Sabri .

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Assistant FM to Moscow For Multilateral Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Assistant Foreign
Minister Sayyed Qassem al Masri left for Moscow Saturday for the
deputy foreign ministers' meeting, which is part of the first
multilateral talks in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Masri said the Moscow meetings will
discuss prospects for making progress in Arab-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign ministers' meeting on Monday will precede the
the ministerial meeting, at which the Egyptian delegation will be
led by Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Masri said the gathering will examine reports by five working
groups, organized in the first multilateral talks in 1992, on
environment, water, regional economic cooperation, disarmament,
regional security and refugees and hammer out the final document on
the reports.
</P>
<P>
The 1992 talks was the outgrowth of the 1991 Madrid Mideast
peace conference that kicked off the Mideast peace process.   But
the talks were frozen, together with the bilateral negotiations, in
early 1996 as the whole peace process was derailed following a
series of terrorist attacks in Israel carried out by Islamic
militants. 
</P>
<P>
The upcoming multilateral talks have been chilled by the lack of
progress on bilateral tracks.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were stalled only after two
rounds of negotiations following last December's resumption and on
the Paletinian track, no tangible progress have been made though 21
rounds of talks have been held since last September when a new
interim peace deal was signed.
</P>
<P>
Syria and its ally Lebanon will not attend the Moscow
multilateral talks.

BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Officials and people from all
walks of life in Fujian Province today voiced their support of
President Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposition for peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan issue and reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Mingyi, government of the eastern coastal province that
sits opposite Taiwan across the Taiwan Straits, said that Jiang's
remarks made five years ago are guidelines for resolving the
Taiwan issue and reunification of the motherland. Following the
eight-point proposition will ensure a smooth development of the
cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Fujian will strengthen its economy to make it more attractive
to Taiwan investors, Chen said at a gathering marking the fifth
anniversary of Jiang's announcement of the eight-point proposition.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life also met to mark the anniversary
in Tianjin, north China.
</P>
<P>
Duan Chunhua, city committee secretary of the Communist Youth
League of China, said that as long as Taiwan is separated from the
motherland, the Chinese people will continue to fight for
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Cao Xiaoheng, deputy director of the Taiwan Economy Institute
of the Nankai University, said that although Lee Teng-hui's
separatist remarks have put a halt on constructive dialogue
between the mainland and Taiwan, the solid ice that keeps the
Chinese people across the straits apart has thawed.
</P>
<P>
A similar gathering was also held in Shanghai and participants
expressed their hope for an early reunification of the motherland
under the one China principle.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf
Denktash Saturday reaffirmed his two-state position on the Cyprus
issue, two days before a new round of "proximity talks" that will
start in Geneva on January 31.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made available to the press here, Denktash said "
there exists in Cyprus today two equal sovereign and democratic
states which represent the two peoples of the island." "
Reconciliation in the island will only be permanent if it is
achieved between the two equal states, and the balance between
Turkey and Greece preserved," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into a Turkish Cypriots-ruled north and
a Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of an aborted coup which sought unity with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots in 1983 unilaterally declared a "republic of
northern Cyprus," which is recognized only by Turkey. Turkey and
Greece take sides in the divided island along ethnic line.
</P>
<P>
U.N. has been trying to end the 26-year division through a bi-
communal or bi-zonal federation formula, but Turkish Cypriots opted
out of peace talks in 1997 and later conditioned the resumption of
the negotiations on recognition of their republic as a equal state.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming Geneva meeting is the continuation of last
December's proximity talks in New York that was sponsored by U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan between Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Denktash stressed in the statement that any comprehensive
initiative directed toward achieving lasting reconciliation
requires a common ground to be found for negotiations between the
two parties, and that if progress is to be achieved in Cyprus, this
can only be done, on the basis of the equality of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Denktash believed that "there is a new era in front of us. We
believe we are entering this era under new conditions, with new
parameters and new hopes." "It was in this understanding that we
went to New York as two equal parties. In order to facilitate
progress, we requested the international community to confirm that
a joint administration in Cyprus does not exist," he added.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said that in New York he conveyed his view at the
highest level to Annan, claiming that "our views are beginning to
gain ground within the U.N. framework in New York and among
interested third parties."
</P>
<P>
"As always, we will attend the forthcoming proximity talks,
which will take place in Geneva, with good-will and in a
constructive spirit," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Denktash put forward the confederation proposal on August 31,
1998. He said in the statement that the proposal, which had been
rejected by the U.N. and Cypriot government, had opened a path
leading to what he called a lasting settlement on the Cyprus issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate
reached a 32-week high of 3.31 percent for the week ended January
15, 2000, on account of a rise in select indices under the
Manufactured Products category.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate touched the previous high of 3.53
percent for the week ended June 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the wholesale price index for "All Commodities" for
the week ended January 15 remained unchanged at the previous level
of 365.0.
</P>
<P>
Though the inflation rate had remained below 3 percent for most
part of the 1999-2000 financial year, economists predict that it
will further rise to 4 percent in the coming months as a result of
the abnormal rise in agricultural commodities prices last year.
</P>
<P>
Records show that the inflation rate for the week ended January
15 in 1999 was at a much higher level of 4.53 percent.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Refugee Center Not to Be Closed Soon: Thai  PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A major holding center for
Myanmar refugees in Thailand is unlikely to be closed before all
Myanmar students there are resettled in third countries, Thai
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told reporters that the Maneeloy Holding
Center in the western province of Ratchaburi in Thailand would not
be closed immediately, but tougher control must be imposed, the
official Thai News Agency (TNA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan made the remark after a news report saying Friday the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was planning
to shut down the Maneeloy Center as a result of the recent hostage
crisis in a Ratchaburi hospital.
</P>
<P>
A group of 10 heavily-armed men from a Myanmar ethnic rebel
faction broke into the hospital on Monday, trapping some 500
medical staff, patients and visitors hostage.
</P>
<P>
The 22-hour hostage drama was ended early Tuesday by a sudden
storm by Thai commandos into the hospital, in which all the 10
gunmen were killed and all hostages rescued.
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis, the second in Thailand in less than four
months after a similar attack on Myanmar embassy last October by
five armed Myanmar students, has put Thailand's security policy,
especially policy toward Myanmar students staying in Thailand,
under the limelight.
</P>
<P>
The government is under mounting criticism on its soft stance
on and lax control of Myanmar students after the two hostage
crisis.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,200 Myanmar students who are given shelter at
Maneeloy Center, but some of them have left for Bangkok and other
provinces as a result of loose control.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said the government will bring all the wandering students
back to the center because any further trouble caused by the
students will be definitely unacceptable for all Thais.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, negotiations are underway to resettle all the
students to third countries.
</P>
<P>
Thailand Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sanan
Kachornprasart said earlier that Thailand and UNHCR were trying to
resettle the Myanmar students to third countries by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that students who had escaped the Maneeloy
Center and refused to report to the center immediately would be
considered aliens illegally entering the kingdom and would be
arrested.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Commemorates Jiang Zemin's Eight-point Speech (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The "People's Daily" will carry
an editorial tomorrow to commemorate the 5th anniversary of the
publication of President Jiang Zemin's speech containing an eight-
point proposal on China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, entitled "To realize peaceful reunification, and
make concerted efforts to rejuvenate China," says that China's
complete reunification process has entered a new stage after Hong
Kong and Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of "peaceful reunification, one country, two
systems" and Jiang's eight-point proposal, exchanges between
Taiwan and the mainland have increased. As a result, the two sides
have made significant bilateral progress.
</P>
<P>
However, some separatist forces in Taiwan, headed by Lee Teng-
hui, are determined to divide the island from the motherland,
pointing to the "two states" remarks by Lee Teng-hui in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese government,
along with all the Chinese people, have fought staunchly against
Lee Teng-hui and his supporters who are trying to create "Taiwan
independence," "two Chinas," or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui's position has not won support from the
international community.

<P>
But Lee and separatist forces have begun to plot a conspiracy
to sever Taiwan from China "lawfully" by drafting a so-called "
Taiwan basic law," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and the Chinese government have been sincere in the
efforts to realize reunification through peaceful means. The
editorial calls on the people of Taiwan to respond positively to
President Jiang Zemin's proposal and discuss or negotiate any
issues to find political solutions acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
As both sides of the Taiwan Straits seek entry into the World
Trade Organization, they should further strengthen economic
cooperation. "We pin our hopes for reunification on the people of
Taiwan. Taiwan compatriots are opposed to 'independence' of the
island and want to realize peaceful reunification and promote
relations across the straits."
</P>
<P>
The smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao has proven that the "
one country, two systems" principle can be successfully applied to
resolving the Taiwan issue. Any suggestion and advice on
reunification from Taiwan compatriots will be carefully listened
to and respected.
</P>
<P>
With support and participation of all Chinese people across the
world, the editorial says, the Taiwan issue will be settled sooner
than later. The glorious rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and
its people will be realized at an early date in the new millennium.

BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Any attempts to deny the
Nanjing massacre committed by Japanese troops in 1937 are doomed
to failure, experts said here today.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 scholars and experts on the Chinese people's War of
Resistance against Japan in the 1930s and 1940s gathered at a
meeting and said that during 14 years of Japanese aggression of
China, the Japanese militarists committed countless atrocities. In
the 1937 Nanjing massacre alone, some 300,000 unarmed Chinese were
massacred by Japanese troops.
</P>
<P>
These crimes have been exposed and condemned by the
international community, and the arch-criminals have been
convicted by an international military tribunal, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
However, right-wing activists in Japan tried to deny these
atrocities and even made the outrageous claim that the Nanjing
massacre was committed by Chinese troops.

<HEADLINE> 6,191 Allowed to Run for Parliamentary Seats in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 6,191 hopefuls have
been allowed to run for Iran's upcoming Majlis (parliament) slated
for February 18, Tehran radio reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Director general in charge of election affairs at the Interior
Ministry, who was only named as Zeker, told the radio that the
hopefuls got their candidacy approved through screening processes
by the executive boards, the supervisory boards and the Guardians
Council.
</P>
<P>
Lists of candidates will be sent out to constituencies
throughout the country and election campaigns will officially kick
off on February 10 and last until February 17, said the official.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,860 people have registered to run in the
parliamentary polling, which is believed to be sensitive to
creating a new power balance in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the radio quoted a statement issued by the
conservative Guardians Council as saying that 407 applicants were
rejected by the executive boards assigned by the Interior Ministry
and 355 others were disqualified by the supervisory boards
appointed by the council.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said, the council approved 192 of those
rejected by the executive and supervisory boards while it also
disqualified 99 hopefuls who have been approved by the boards.
</P>
<P>
The council said that the disqualified are mainly from illegal
political groups or those who have been convicted on various
charges.
</P>
<P>
However, those hopefuls rejected directly by the council have
the right to complain against the rule within three days.
</P>
<P>
Iranian moderates, the main supporters of the reformist policies
of President Mohammad Khatami, have accused the supervisory boards
of disqualifying their key hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers said that at least 69 pro-reform hopefuls in Tehran
constituency, mainly journalists and clerics, were disqualified by
the supervisory boards.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives, who dominate most of the country's
state organs, dismissed the accusation by claiming that most of the
disqualified are from illegal political parties, such as the
opposition Freedom Movement of Iran and the Nationalist Front.
</P>
<P>
Months before the elections, the two rival political camps have
launched their election campaigns. The conservatives expect to
tighten their control on the Majlis while the moderates hope to
grasp more seats in the legislative body so as to pave the way for
the political reforms advocated by President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
However, political analysts here believe that independent
candidates will play an important role in the future Majlis.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment (
FDI) in Pakistan in the first six months of fiscal 1999-2000
reached 306 million U.S. dollars, about 23 percent up against the
FDI inflow during the corresponding period of last year, the local
press quoted official sources as saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The private foreign investment inflow into Pakistan during July-
December 1998 was recorded at 255.2 million U.S. dollars which

showing a net increase of 85.7 million U.S. dollars over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
This is followed by an investment of 95.3 million U.S. dollars
by the United States which, however, declined from 114.7 million U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>

last year.
</P>
<P>

29.4 million U.S. dollars as against that of 6.6 million U.S.
dollars in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The major chunk of FDI has been made in the sectors of chemical,

mining and quarrying - oil exploration which accounted for 222.6
million U.S. dollars out of the total 306 million U.S. dollars.

<P>
LAGOS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The British Royal Navy has
expressed its willingness in assisting the Nigerian Navy in
policing the nation's exclusive economic zone along the Niger
Delta region.
</P>
<P>
Paddy McAlpine, commanding officer of a visiting British Naval
Frigate, HMS Somerset, was quoted by the Post Express newspaper as
saying on Friday that the trip to Nigeria was to define a new path
of cooperation with the Nigerian Navy, especially in the
protection of the country's oil installations in the Niger Delta
region currently being threatened by youths in the region.
</P>
<P>
Recently, militant youths in the Niger Delta area repeatedly
hijacked flow stations and security personnel guarding oil
installations, disrupting the oil production in the West African
oil-producing country.
</P>
<P>
The British Warship, arriving here on Thursday, is on a
four-day visit to Nigeria. HMS Somerset, a 3,500-ton type 23,
Duke class frigate, boasts of an impressive array of weapons and
sensor systems with a crew of 185.
</P>
<P>
The warship, which is on the homestretch of its Atlantic Patrol
Tasking deployment, has visited Casablanca, Cape Verde Islands,
Sierra Leone, Rio de Janeiro, Tristan da Cunha and Libreville.
</P>
<P>
It left the United Kingdom in September 1999 and has conducted
a number of tasks such as industry promotions, search and rescue
exercise, peace support operations in Sierra Leone and exploiting
rocks to build a big harbour in Tristan da Cunha.

<HEADLINE> Short-Term World Economy Linked With U.S. Economic Measures: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The short-term world
economy will depend largely on how the United States deals with
its expanding economic growth and rising inflation rate, a top
official of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference during the ongoing annual meeting of the
World Economic Forum (WEF), Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first
deputy managing director, said if the U.S. Federal Reserve is able
to handle the rapid growth and inflation, the world will enjoy
continuing and rising growth.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said he expects the U.S. Fed to raise short-term
interest rates at its policy-setting council scheduled for next
week to cool down the economy, which grew by 5.8 percent in the
October-December period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the euro, Europe's single currency, has a great
potential for appreciation.
</P>
<P>
He added the euro, which is "at and extremely low level," is
not likely to cause a significant rise in Europe's inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fischer said Japan should maintain stimulative
fiscal and monetary policies in a bid to ensure a sustained
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
He said the yen is currently "in a range where it should be in
the long-term," warning that a further strengthening of the
currency against the U.S. dollar will be "a real problem for Japan.

<HEADLINE> Forum Held to Mark Jiang's Speech on Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China's non-communist parties
held a forum here this morning to mark the 5th anniversary of the
publication of President Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposition on
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Participants hailed the eight-point proposition as a "
programmatic document for developing relations across the Taiwan
Straits and realizing peaceful reunification of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, further progress has been achieved in
cross-straits exchanges in the economy, culture, trade, science
and technology, said Zhang Kehui, vice-chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee and
chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Any activities meant to split Taiwan from the motherland are
doomed to failure, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Li Ganliu, vice-chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the
Chinese Guomintang Central Committee, said that the return of Hong
Kong and Macao to the motherland has greatly inspired the Chinese
people including Taiwan compatriots to make contributions to
resolving the Taiwan issue as soon as possible and realize the
peaceful reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Feng Kexi, vice-chairman of the China Democratic National
Construction Association Central Committee, said peaceful
reunification accords with the will of Chinese all over the world
and the general trend of events.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan authorities will promote exchanges
across the Taiwan Straits with all their heart" said Feng.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Zhang Huaixi, vice-chairman of the China
Association for Promoting Democracy Central Committee, said that
Lee Tenghui's "two states" statement goes against the trend of the
times and betrays the Chinese nation."

<HEADLINE> China Will Not Tolerate Separatism in Taiwan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official on
Taiwan affairs warned Friday that if Lee Teng-hui and his
supporters continue to advocate "Taiwan Independence" and reject
the one China principle, the mainland will take resolute measures.
</P>
<P>
China expects to resume negotiations between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits on the basis of the one China principle and
fulfill the plan for Wang Daohan, president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits to visit Taiwan, said Chen
Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party
of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is also director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council, made the remarks at a forum held in Beijing Friday
to mark the fifth anniversary of President Jiang Zemin's eight-
point proposition on reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's 1995 speech on the Taiwan issue expounded the essence
of Deng Xiaoping's concept of "peaceful reunification, one country,
two systems," Chen said. On that occasion, Jiang put forward the
eight-point proposition for advancing cross-straits relations and
promoting peaceful reunification of the motherland at the present
stage.
</P>
<P>
"Reviewing the cross-straits development and our struggle
against separatist forces in Taiwan over the past five years, we
came to know more clearly that Jiang's speech is a programmatic
document on solving the Taiwan issue and realizing peaceful
reunification of the motherland," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
"We will unswervingly adhere to the one China principle, which
serves as the basis and prerequisite for China's peaceful
reunification. It ensures that peaceful and stable relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits are maintained."  (

<P>
It is worth noting that Lee Teng-hui and some separatists are
trying to divide Taiwan from the motherland by attempting to
tamper with its "constitution and laws", Chen said.
</P>
<P>
If separatist forces in Taiwan continue to advocate such
policies, they will make it impossible to fulfill the goal of
peaceful reunification. The mainland is keeping a close eye on
separatist activities in Taiwan, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The only way to realizing peaceful reunification is to carry
out negotiations between both sides of the Taiwan Straits on the
basis of the one China principle. The mainland has made
unremitting efforts in promoting cross-straits dialogue. But Lee
Teng-hui's "two states" statement has seriously undermined cross-
straits dialogue and postponed the scheduled visit to Taiwan by
Wang Daohan.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Macao have returned to the motherland, marking a
significant progress in the course of China's peaceful
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Resolving the Taiwan issue accords with the will of the people
and the general trend of events, thus it can not been delayed
indefinitely, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to implement the basic policy of "peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems" and the eight-point
proposition of Jiang Zemin, and create favorable conditions for
resolving the Taiwan issue as early as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also extended New Year's greetings to Taiwan compatriots
on behalf of the Taiwan Work Office of the CPC Central Committee
and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council on the eve of
Spring Festival.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Rejects Amnesty of Opposition Leaders on Treason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar
Revolutionary Government has flatly rejected pleas of amnesty for
the 18 Civic United Front (CUF) activists facing treason charges,
local newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar Chief Minister Mohamed Bilal was quoted as saying on
Friday that his government would not interfere in the trial by the
judiciary despite local and international appealing for the
release of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to make it clear that the Zanzibar Revolutionary
 Government will not interfere in the treason trial because the
Judiciary is there," he said, stressing that "it is up to the
Zanzibar High Court to determine the innocence or guilt of the
suspects."
</P>
<P>
Bilal made the remarks while meeting with Permanent Secretary
of Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation Elly Mtango.
</P>
<P>
During his courtesy call, Mtango presented Bilal with messages
from members of the diplomatic corps accredited to Tanzania
expressing their concern over the fate of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Bilal advised the worried foreign ambassadors and high
commissioner to " calm down" and allow the Zanzibar Judiciary to
do its job.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, nearly 50 members of parliament (MPs) from the
ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party (CCM) petitioned Zanzibar
President Salmin Amour to drop the treason charges against the CUF
activists.
</P>
<P>
Families of the 18 treason suspects have also pleaded to the
Zanzibar government for the release of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
The first arrests in the treason case were made at the end of
November 1997 on the eve of an important by-election in Mkunazini,
Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen CUF members and supporters were arrested and charged
with sedition, but in the next month the charge was changed to
conspiracy to commit treason, which is a non-bailable offence and
carries a mandatory life or death sentence under Zanzibar laws.
</P>
<P>
Over the following months, four more CUF members were charged
with the same offence on allegations of conspiring to topple the
Zanzibar president and the revolutionary government.
</P>
<P>
All the 18 treason suspects, who have been languishing in the
Kiinua Miguu prison for more than two years, had pleaded not
guilty to the treason charges.
</P>
<P>
The first hearing of the case was held on January 19, which saw
fierce clashes between police and rioters, with at least 29 people
including 14 policemen being injured and hospitalized and some 40
others arrested.
</P>
<P>
The second hearing of the treason case on Thursday was peaceful
and a new hearing is expected on February 28.

<HEADLINE> World Community Urged to Donate Aid to Ethiopian Famine Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Country
Team (UNCT) in Ethiopia has appealed to contribute relief food to
Ethiopia where more than eight million people are suffering from
hunger.
</P>
<P>
The UNCT said in a statement available Saturday that about 190
million U. S. dollars worth of emergency food aid are necessary
this year to feed the famine victims, including some 250,000
foreign refugees mainly from neighboring Somalia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Because of drought and flood disasters, Ethiopia harvested 10.7
million tons of grain in 1999, down 700,000 tons as compared with
that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"The situation (in Ethiopia) now is very serious," country
director of the U.N. World Food Program Judith Lewis told local
mass media, saying Ethiopia needs a lot of food, especially in the
next six months.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission said
last week there were only 100,000 tons of food reserve in
Ethiopia, hardly enough for two months at the planned distribution
level.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that nearly seven million Ethiopians benefited
from food aid from foreign donors last year.

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch Scheme to Promote E-commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government will
launch a voluntary certification authority (CA) recognition scheme
next month as one of the measures to promote and facilitate the
development of e-commerce in Hong Kong, a senior official said
today.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the scheme is to enhance public confidence
in electronic transactions and protect consumer interest, Director
of Information Technology Services Lau Kam-hung, said at a
luncheon.
</P>
<P>
"The government policy on CAs is to offer maximum assistance in
facilitating their smooth operation and to minimize the
unnecessary regulations or requirements," he said, adding that the
planned implementation of a voluntary recognition scheme is to
make sure that CAs can apply for government recognition on a
voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
CAs are responsible for the issuance, renewal and revocation of
digital certificates which are electronic documents certifying the
identity of legal entities participating in electronic
transactions and recording their public key information. They
serve as trusted third parties to ensure trust and security in
electronic transactions.
</P>
<P>
With the digital certificates issued by CAs and the use of
digital signatures, participants in electronic transactions will
be able to authenticate the identity of the parties involved in
electronic transactions, ensure the integrity of the messages
exchanged and make sure that the transactions cannot be repudiated.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the private sector to provide CA services, the
government does not impose any mandatory licensing requirement for
the sector to set up its CAs.
</P>
<P>
On January 14, the Code of Practice for Recognized
Certification Authorities was issued to specify the standards and
procedures for recognized CAs to carry out their functions.

<HEADLINE> Best Elderly Projects Awarded in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Social Welfare Department
of Hong Kong today awarded a dozen of elderly projects for their
contribution to promoting a caring community for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
With an allocation of 11 million HK dollars (1.41 million U.S.
dollars), the Social Welfare Department runs a three-year program
"Opportunities for the Elderly Project" (OEP) from 1999 to 2001 to
advocate a sense of worthiness among the senior citizens and to
promote a caring community.
</P>
<P>
The project last year subsidized 259 community programs
organized by various welfare agencies, district or local
organizations and volunteer groups between last May and September.
</P>
<P>
Two Hong Kong Best Projects and 10 Regional Best Projects were
awarded at today's OEP Award Presentation Ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Director of Social Welfare Andrew
Leung Kin-pong, said more than 9,000 volunteers had participated
in and 130,000 elderly and other persons had benefited from these
elderly programs.
</P>
<P>
"The OEP has helped create a community spirit of care for the
elderly," Leung added.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman Refutes Japanese Diplomat's Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for foreign
affairs here today strongly refuted Acting Japanese Consul General
Shuhci Takahashi's accusation against Hong Kong media of their "
negative and unfair" coverage concerning the recent anti-China
rally in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
Takahashi sent a letter on January 26 to Hong Kong media,
accusing them of "negative and unfair" coverage concerning the
recent anti-China gathering in Osaka staged by Japan's right-wing
activists to deny the Nanjing massacre.
</P>
<P>
"It is totally unjustified for Shuhci Takahashi, as Acting
Japanese Consul General, to make unwarranted charges against the
media in Hong Kong concerning the issue," said the spokesman from
the Office of the Commission of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "We are shocked by and deeply regret over
the remarks in his letter which was tantamount to openly and
flagrantly defending and supporting the right-wing activists'
denial of the massacre."
</P>
<P>
"Compatriots and the media in Hong Kong together with all the
Chinese people expressed their stern condemnation and utmost
indignation, which fully reflected the Chinese people's righteous
position of loving peace and opposing aggression," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"If the Japanese government continues to remain inactive and
refuse to take any action against the fallacies spread by right-
wing activists, it will only serve to damage its relations with
neighboring countries and its international image, and eventually
it will bring about endless harm to the Japanese nation," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government values the statements and commitments
made by the Japanese side on historical issues and hopes that the
Japanese government should honor and take concrete actions to
contain the current of the rightist activists to militarism and
reverse Japan's aggression history so as to eliminate the
pernicious consequences of this incident and safeguard the
political foundation of China-Japan relations," the spokesman
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Leaves for World Economic Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein left here Saturday for Davos, Switzerland to attend the
ongoing 30th World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to deliver a keynote speech Sunday at the five-
day forum, which is attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton, other
international leaders and world-renowned businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The monarch will brief participants on the business
opportunities in his kingdom and efforts to improve the country's
investment environment so as to lift the economy out of a chronic
stagnation since the 1990 Gulf crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He is also scheduled to hold talks with Clinton, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and other
world leaders on bilateral ties and developments of the Middle East
peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah will join Jordanian Deputy Prime Minster and Minister
of Planning Rima Khalaf, Minister of Trade, Industry and Supply
Mohammed Halayka and Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Akel
Biltaji who had arrived at the forum earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
The ministers had been engaged in extensive lobbying activities
during the forum to attract more foreign investments into the cash-
strapped kingdom, which was suffering from a total foreign debts of
7.8 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the kingdom is emerging from a decade-old economic
recession thanks to various economic reform efforts by the 37-year-
old King Abdullah, who acceded to the throne in last February after
his father King Hussein died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is expected to achieve an economic growth rate of 1.5 to
2 percent in 1999 though official figures have not been released.
The annual economic gathering, which opened on Thursday night, will
last until February 1.

CAIRO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian chief negotiator in the final-status talks Yasser
Abed Rabbo and Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian local administration
minister, arrived in Cairo Friday for talks with Egyptian officials
on the regional peacemaking, particularly on the Israeli-
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa is to address the
Ministerial Steering Committee on Mideast multilateral talks in

talks with the Palestinians on the one hand, Syria and Lebanon, on
the other.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:

<HEADLINE> Snow-Caused Accidents Kill 4 Jordanians, Injure 38 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Four Jordanians were killed and 38
others injured in 150 traffic accidents caused by heavy snow which
hit the kingdom over the weekend, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the casualties took place on Friday and Thursday, when
snowfall reached nearly 50 centimeters in parts of the kingdom,
creating traffic jams and accidents though drivers were moving
extremely cautiously on the icy roads.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 major roads of the country had been closed due to the
snow and commercial activities were paralyzed in the capital Amman
on Friday when the snowfall hit its peak and no pedestrians or
moving vehicles could be seen on the streets.
</P>
<P>
However, the snow, the heaviest in the current rainy season, is
expected to alleviate a severe drought prevailing from last year
and to improve water supply for this summer.
</P>
<P>
The water-sparse kingdom largely depends on stockpiling rain and
snowfall in winter to meet its fresh water demands in summer.
</P>
<P>
Amman and the western mountainous parts of the kingdom have a
Mediterranean weather, hot and dry in summer, mild and rainy in
winter.

<HEADLINE> Former Tehran Mayor Lobbying for Rafsanjani's Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A former Tehran mayor was
lobbying for former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani so as to
get him candidacy in the coming parliamentary elections next month,
local daily Tehran Times reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gholamhussein Karbaschi, the former Tehran mayor, met Secretary
General of the leftist Society of Combatant Clergymen in Tehran
(SCC) Mahdi Karubi soon after his release from prison on an amnesty
in an effort to convince the SCC to put Rafsanjani on its candidate
list for the February 18 elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the result of the talks was not clear so far, said the
paper, adding that Rafsanjani was behind the release of Karbaschi,
a prominent reformist who was jailed since last May on graft
charges, but pardoned on Tuesday by the supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, chairman of the powerful arbitral and advisory State
Expediency Council, has announced to run in the parliamentary
elections and Karbaschi's pro-reformist Party of Constructive
Executives of Iran (PCEI) has strongly supported his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
However, some leftist parties and groups, including the SCC and
the Islamic Iran Partnership Front (IIPF) headed by Mohammad Reza
Khatami, brother of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
refused to put Rafsanjani's name on their lists.
</P>
<P>
The leftist reformist parties, which were isolated during
Rafsanjani's presidency, considered his nomination as a stumbling
block to Khatami's reform course because of his close links with
the conservatives, particularly his relations with Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Rafsanjani's candidacy has caused a split
between the pro-Khatami left groups and the pro-Rafsanjani central-
right groups in the moderate coalition "May 23 Front" formed after
Khatami's election in 1997, newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The reformist groups and dailies have recently criticized
Rafsanjani's policies during his two terms as president from 1989
to 1997 and blamed him for some failures and mistakes that the
country had made during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who served as the Majlis (parliament) speaker for 10
years before being elected president in 1989, is believed to be the
next Majlis speaker if he wins a seat in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Iran's moderates and conservatives have pinned their hopes on
the coming parliamentary polling for a change in the power balance
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who dominate most of the country's state
organs, try to tighten their control on the Majlis while the
moderates hope to win a majority in the legislature to pave the way
for the political reforms advocated by President Khatami.

Europe, any international meeting without the participation of the

journal Science.
</P>
<P>
The two compounds, part of a chemical family known as diketo
acid inhibitors, were shown in test-tube studies to keep HIV's
genetic material from combining with the genetic material of white
cells. Biochemists working at Merck &AMP; Co. reported in the journal
Science that they eventually screened about 250,000 chemicals
until they found the two that were able to keep integrase from
carrying out its job. The report also suggests the compounds were
especially potent in blocking HIV replication when compared with
similar tests of existing drugs. (US-AIDS)

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang to Turn Arable Land into Fruit Orchard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 29 (Xinjiang) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region will mainly plant fruit trees on some 200,000 hectares of
low-yield arable land within three years as part of the country's
strategy to develop the western China.
</P>
<P>
Local agricultural officials said this move will not affect the
region's cotton production, as most of this land has a cotton
yield of less than 80 kilograms per mu (15 mu equals one hectare)
and is exposed to the danger of becoming a desert.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is the largest cotton producer in China, and also
ranks first in terms of total cotton yield per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The officials said this plan will mean a net increase of 30,000
hectares of fruit trees in the region.
</P>
<P>
Both the central and regional governments will provide one-time
subsidies to farmers and encourage them to plant trees and reclaim
grassland.
</P>
<P>
It is believes that the per capita ownership of fruit trees in
Xinjiang will be increased to 0.7 hectares of orchard in three
years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Building Power Plant for UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. energy giant, CMS
Energy Corp., is racing against time to build the first independent
water and power project in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
In a bid to intensify its involvement in the UAE and other
neighboring markets, the company is now building the 750-million-U.
S.-dollar Taweelah A2 plant, a project it won in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Electricity production will become operational in May this year
and by August 2001, water will be produced at the plant and the
entire facility will be completed," Victor Fryling, chief operating
officer of CMS Energy, was quoted by the Gulf News daily as saying
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The American firm, which has annual sales of about 6 billion
dollars and assets of about 14 billion dollars worldwide, is also
speeding up its efforts for fetching a project for the expansion of
Abu Dhabi's Taweelah A1 power and desalination complex.
</P>
<P>
The program was designed to uplift the station's power
generation capacity to 1,000 megawatts and water production to 70
million gallons (about 318 million liters) per day from the current
29 million gallons (132 million liters).
</P>
<P>
Four companies presented their bids for the project last year,
but CMS Energy is optimistic about winning the contract.
</P>
<P>
The company is also eying Abu Dhabi's third power and
desalination venture, the 408-million-dollar Shuweihat project.
</P>
<P>
The tender for the first phase of the project will be announced
in mid-February, said Abdulah Al-Naimi, director of privatization
at Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority.
</P>
<P>
The plant will be able to produce 5,000 megawatts of electricity
and 300 million gallons (nearly 1.4 billion liters) of water per
day, enough to meet local demands for electricity and water until
2010.
</P>
<P>
It is only in the last few years that CMS Energy has become an
active player in Gulf markets. The company is in the final list for
the RasLaffan project for supply of liquefied natural gas in Qatar
and is bidding for a power plant in Oman.
</P>
<P>
"We are also active in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia in the water and
power sector," Fryling said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Projects Fishery Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Saturday projected a 8.3-percent growth in the fishery and aquatic
products sector this year, or a record-high output of 3 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here Saturday, Agriculture Secretary
Edgardo Angara said this expected output represents an increase of
200,000 tons from the 2.8 million tons recorded in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Angara said his department foresees breaching the historical
production level of 2.8 million tons due to an expected higher
output of the aquaculture industry.
</P>
<P>
With higher production, he said, the country may become self-
sufficient in fish this year and enable millions of low-income
Filipinos to avail themselves of an affordable source of protein
in their diet.
</P>
<P>
"If production growth trends are maintained, we may even become
a surplus producer and fish exporter before the term of President
Joseph Estrada ends in 2004," Angara said.
</P>
<P>
He said aquaculture, the country's biggest fish supplier since
the mid-90s, would remain to be the largest contributor to fishery
production in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Its output would reach 1 million tons, or 34 percent of the
total production of the fisheries sector, Angara said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Angara reported that the country's fishery sector
improved by 2.68 percent in 1999 with gross revenues, at constant
prices,hitting 47.9 billion pesos (1.2 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Provide Scholarships For Swimmers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Swimming
Federation (PRSI) will provide scholarships for talented swimmers
wishing to pursue higher education in the United States and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the federation Rahardi Ramelan said the education
system in both countries allowed swimmers to maintain their
careers while studying.
</P>
<P>
He said he would seek sponsorships from local companies to pay
forthe students' studies, in exchange for use of the firms' logos
ontheir sports clothes. The scholarships would be based on need.
</P>
<P>
"If they want to be successful in the pool and in their
studies,they have to go this way. But I will have to find
sponsorships. Hopefully, there will be companies who are
interested in giving scholarships to the swimmers," he was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian young swimmers have traditionally faced
difficulties in choosing between their studies and swimming. Most
high schools and universities here do not include sports training
in their education system, and many talented swimmers have given
up the sport to concentrate on their studies.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the new organizational structure, Rahardi said
he wanted to focus on developing junior swimmers instead of
spending money to train veterans to go for top honors in many
competitions.
</P>
<P>
"We have spent about 80 percent of our resources to groom
senior swimmers so they can scoop as many golds as they can in
every competition. As a consequence, we don't have second
stringers. There are the third stringers but they are still
developing," he said.

<HEADLINE> hke012913 --Roundup: Bangladesh Faces Volatile Political Situation by Pan Xiaozhu  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh faces a volatile
political situation following Leader of the Opposition Begum
Khaleda Zia's "no"to any dialogue with the ruling Awami League and
her threat of calling hartal (general strike) one after another to
force the government to resign and hold early election.
</P>
<P>
Hope for peace through a dialogue between Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina and Chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
Khaleda Zia was dashed after the opposition leader's rejection of
the businessmen's call to shun general strike.
</P>
<P>
In the latest development, the Federation of Bangladesh
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) held a two-day business
conference where Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina attended the
inaugural day on January 22 and Leader of the Opposition Khaleda
Zia the concluding day on January 24. Business leaders from all
the 67 chamber bodies and 161 associations took part in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Although it was a business conference, the main agenda was
politics. Business leaders urged the conflicting political parties
to resolve the current crisis through dialogue for the sake of the
country's economy. They requested Khaleda Zia to accept the offer
for dialogue and find out alternatives to general strikes and road
barricade programs, which badly affect business in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We can sit for talk only with the caretaker government to
discuss the process of elections and other details," said Khaleda
Zia.
</P>
<P>
"The current situation does not permit holding of any dialogue
with the government as it is not sincere for a political
settlement and has destroyed the atmosphere for talks," she said,
adding that the opposition parties have already launched a one-
point oust government movement, "Resignation of the government is
the only solution to restore peace, political stability and ensure
development."
</P>
<P>
Analysts feel that khaleda Zia's rejection of the offer for any
talks throws the country's politics into a very uncertain future.
One can foresee nothing but violent clashes and destructive
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly appealed for a
negotiated settlement and accused the opposition of trying to
foment unjustified unrest against her 41-month-old government.
</P>
<P>
At the inaugural of the FBCCI conference, the prime minister
condemned the opposition in most of her speech. She blamed them
for most of the violence in the country's politics. But at the end
of her speech, she reiterated her offer for talks including on the
very sensitive issue of resignation of her government to hold
early elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Sheikh Hasina's key aide and Home Minister Mohammad
Nasim said on January 24 that the ruling party was in no mood now
for talks with opposition.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on BNP chief's stand, the home minister noted that
the opposition parties are talking of resignation of the
government even after the prime minister showed such a liberal
attitude. The ruling party is not prepared to take any further
initiative for dialogue with them, he said, adding "we will now
tackle them politically on the streets."
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said that while the ruling party
should win the opposition's confidence by creating a better
environment for talks,the opposition leader's outright rejection
of talks would only lead to further confrontation and instability
in the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Make Breakthrough in AIDS Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have found
two experimental compounds able to obstruct the ability of an
enzyme playing a critical role when AIDS virus infects cells,
according to Friday's journal Science.
</P>
<P>
The two compounds, part of a chemical family known as diketo
acid inhibitors, were shown in test-tube studies to keep HIV's
genetic material from combining with the genetic material of white
cells.
</P>
<P>
Biochemists working at Merck &AMP; Co. reported in the journal
Science that they eventually screened about 250,000 chemicals
until they found the two that were able to keep integrase from
carrying out its job.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggests the compounds were especially potent
in blocking HIV replication when compared with similar tests of
existing drugs.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, the first in the long march of searching for
weapons targeting integrase, was hailed by leading U.S. newspapers
as a breakthrough in AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
Although Merck said there is still a long way from turning the
research into drugs, the discovery opens an venue of exploration
in the company's intensive search for AIDS treatments, The Wall
Street Journal said.
</P>
<P>
The findings will probably trigger a race among competing
pharmaceuticals companies to find similar compounds.
</P>
<P>
For years, ever since scientists first identified the integrase
enzyme inside HIV about 12 years ago, drug makers have been
unsuccessful in coming up with chemicals that stop the enzyme's
action.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has
disbursed 300 million U.S. dollars of the blocked 600-million-
dollar loan package destined for Indonesia's social safety net
program.
</P>
<P>
The loan package was originally approved on May 18, 1999, but
was delayed due to technical issues and the emergence of the high-
profile Bank Bali scandal.
</P>
<P>
"The release of these funds had been stalled, but a new
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and progress
on the resolution of the Bank Bali case have enabled this
disbursement to proceed," the bank said in a statement issued here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile World Bank country director Mark Baird said, "The
disbursement of the bank's program loans for Indonesia is a clear
signal of international support for the government as it puts in
place its new economic recovery program."
</P>
<P>
He said that the bank needs to help finance the country's
social safety net program in a bid to reduce the number of
impoverished people in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Based on the bank data, the number of poor people in Indonesia
fell below 20 percent to 19.34 percent as of August 1999, compared
to its peak of 20.47 percent in February of the same year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, donor countries grouping in the Consultatives
Group on Indonesia (CGI) are due to meet in Jakarta on February 1-
2 to discuss the country's loan disbursement.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the CGI members have stated their
commitment to extend a new loan of 4.1 billion dollars for
Indonesia, while the WB will offer a whopping 1.3 billion dollars.

President Leonid Kuchma said Friday in a draft document to be

This year alone, the country will have to repay more than 3

Since Yugoslavia is part of the Balkan region and Europe, any
international meeting without the participation of the country is
"a waste of time and energy" and violates the interests of the
European Union and the whole Europe, said Vujovic.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile expressed Yugoslavia's willingness to cooperate
with other countries and international organizations on the basis
of equality, mutual benefit and respect and no political pressure.
</P>
<P>
Vujovic said the key problem in Kosovo was that the
international community had failed to fully implement the U.N.
Resolution 1244 on the Kosovo issue and the relevant technical
military deal between Yugoslavia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
The multi-national peacekeeping forces and the U.N. missions in
Kosovo "have become an accomplice of Kosovo Albanian terrorists
and separatists, who are attempting to separate Kosovo from
Yugoslavia by force", he accused.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that Kosovo is an inalienable part of
Yugoslavia and Yugoslavia will never allow the establishment of
any foreign diplomatic mission in Kosovo.

<P>
CARACAS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's state-owned company
Petroleos de Venezuela dismissed 1,700 employees, most of them at
the managerial level, in 1999, company sources said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government attributed the large-scale dismissal to a cost-
cutting program. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez charged that the
company operates like a "state within the state" because of its
culture of unlimited spending.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that an in-depth corporate restructuring in
1998 found thousands of its managerial posts unnecessary. The
previous government kept most of them to avoid a high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The oil firm still employs 42,200 people, including 19,600 on
the major payroll, 13,200 on the minor payroll and 9,400 ordinary
workers.

<HEADLINE> Blair Calls for New Round of Trade Talks This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime
Minister Tony Blair on Friday called for the launch of a new round
of trade talks this year despite the failure in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 30th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum
(WEF) here, Blair said, "I believe we can and should try to launch
the new trade round this year. We cannot afford another Seattle,
but nor can we afford to postpone the massive gains that a
successful new trade round would deliver."
</P>
<P>
In his special address to the gathering of business, government,
academic and civil society leaders, Blair called for the early
establishment of an Eminent Persons Group to provide advice on how
to improve the working methods of the World Trade Organization (
WTO).
</P>
<P>
"We need more transparency and more effective processes for
building consensus," he said. "This need not take long. I see no
reason why such a group could not provide early conclusions by the
summer."
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister called on the United States, Japan
and other developed countries to follow the European Union in
giving the least developed countries duty-free and quota-free
access for nearly all goods.

LAGOS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Cameroon scored a convincing win
of 3-0 in a Group A contender against Cote d' Ivoire in the 22nd
African Nations Cup held in Ghana's capital Accra on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spain-based duo Raymond Kalla and Samuel Eto'o scored in the
first half as the Cameroon team, champions in 1984 and 1988,
brushed aside a poorly performed fight from Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
With the game drifting to a close, a left-footed long-distance
shot about 20 meters away from the gate from Cameroon's Patrick
Mboma screamed into the net, culminated the indomitable lions
scoring orgy.
</P>
<P>
The result left Cameroon and Ghana level on four points in
group A and Togo and 1992 champions Cote d'Ivoire level on one.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon will be looking to secure the first place in the pool
by winning their final group game against Togo, while a draw with
Togo will be enough for Cameroon to enter the quarter-finals.

LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- American boxer Mike Tyson
branded Julius Francis as "fat" after conceding a huge weight
advantage to his opponent on Friday as they prepare for Britain's
biggest boxing bout for years.
</P>
<P>
British heavyweight champion Francis weighed in for Saturday's
heavyweight showdown in Manchester at 243-1/2 pounds (110.5 kgs)
substantially heavier than Tyson who registered 223-3/4 pounds (
101.5 kg).
</P>
<P>
Friday's weigh-in, as with much of the build-up to the fight
over the past two weeks, was a chaotic affair.
</P>
<P>
Proceedings were delayed for well over an hour and when the
fighters did come face-to-face it was far from the intimidating
affair that usually precede big fights.
</P>
<P>
This time there was no staring from Tyson - instead he just
smirked at Francis, while appearing to nervously twiddle his hair.
Tyson said of his opponent: "He's kinda fat. He can't hit me with
his eyes. I'm cool, I'm relaxed and I'm ready to fight."
</P>
<P>
Tyson is at a similar weight as for his previous two bouts,
against Orlin Norris and Francois Botha.

LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Former England manager Glenn
Hoddle returned to football as manager of Premiership strugglers
Southampton on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He will replace David Jones for 12 months, while the out-going
boss fights a court case relating to his time employed as a care
worker in a children's home on Merseyside.
</P>
<P>
Jones, whose trial is expected to start later this year, is to
take a sabbatical pending the outcome of the trial.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle has been out of work for a year, since being sacked as
England manager in a row over alleged comments about reincarnation
and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
He said he was delighted to be back in the management fray
despite taking on a club facing a battle against relegation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to it," he said. "I've been out of the
game for a year and it's been good to recharge the batteries.
</P>
<P>
"It's a big challenge, but I've got no reservations. My
experience of the England job was superb and I'll keep that under
my belt."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Southampton's board of directors insisted Jones
had not been sacked and revealed he would continue to be paid.
</P>
<P>
"His contract of employment is not terminated and no-one should
confuse this situation with that of dismissal," it said. "The
board also wish to state quite clearly that there is no change in
their view that David is innocent until proven otherwise," said
the statement.

<P>
LAGOS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Egypt defeated
Senegal 1-0 on Friday to become the second country after South
Africa to secure the quarter-final berth in the 22nd African
Nations Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, in the match held in Nigeria's northern city Kano,
dominated the first-half and got their decisive goal after 41
minutes when veteran striker Hassan Hossam headed in off the post.
</P>
<P>
Despite a couple of late scares, prompting the excellent
Egyptian keeper to make good saves, the Pharoahs defended
efficiently as they did in the last tournament, and prevented the
hard working Senegal players from a well deserved equalizer.
</P>
<P>
Egypt now tops the Group C with two wins out of two matches.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's French coach Gerard Gili, a former coach of French side
Marseille, said before the game that four Pharaoh's players,
including three strikers had been stricken by flu. But they seemed
unaffected by it, judging from their performance in the match.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians were strong in their defense and good at menacing
counter-attacks, which, according to some commentators contributed
to the Pharoachs' success in the last tournament and this one.
</P>
<P>
Senegal and Egypt both won their opening games, with Senegal
overpowering Burkina Faso 3-1 and Egypt beating Zambia 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is to fight Burkina Faso but the outcome of the match is
unimportant for it. Senegal's final game in the group is with
Zambia.

<TEXT>

LAGOS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Angry fans flew bottles down to
the champion hopefuls and co-hosts Nigeria's Supper Eagles players
when they were held to a surprise goalless draw by Congo on Friday
in their Group D match in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria dominated the whole possession but could have snatched
a close-at-hand victory deep into injury time, which will
guaranteed their entry into the guarter-finals, when Jay-Jay
Okocha saw his goal-bound shot bundled off the line.
</P>
<P>
Thoughout the game, the Super Eagles, boasting world-class
players like Nwankwo Kanu, Victor Ikpeba and Finidi George, simply
could not dig their way through a stubborn Congolese defense.
</P>
<P>
At a result of today's draw, the Eagles will have to beat
another of the tournament's top sides Morocco to secure their
passage to the knock-out stages.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, other factors off the pitch may have also
affected the Eagles' morale and aided the Congolese in another way.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that win bonuses promised by Nigeria's
Football Association had not been paid to the players after their
4-2 victory over Tunisia, and the hotel, where the Eagles perch
earlier, had threatened to eject the players for their sponsors'
failure to settle their bills before the match.
</P>
<P>
"The Nigerian FA promised the players $3,000 each if they win
any first round game, but they turned up with $2,500 each after
the Tunisia game and the players rejected this," Eagles' Dutch
coach Jo Bonfrere said on the eve of their game against Congo.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Super Eagles met the Congolese in the
African Nations Cup. During the 1994 World Cup qualifying
competition, Nigeria defeated the Congolese home and away.

<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Rob Harris, the referee at the
center of the controversial FA Cup tie between Tranmere Rovers and
Sunderland, has been suspended until February 29, according to the
BBC report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rob Harris was the official at the January 8 clash which ended
in chaotic scenes when it was realised Tranmere had 11 players on
the pitch despite having a man sent off.
</P>
<P>
Tony Green, assistant referee and fourth official David
Unsworth, were both cleared of allegations that they "less than
proficiently applied the laws of the game relating to a
substitution".
</P>
<P>
But Harris was found guilty of a charge that he had less than
proficiently applied the laws.
</P>
<P>
Football Association officials took more than five hours
dicussing the case at a meeting in Peterborough.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard many times managers complaining that referees
are not accountable but this case proves that they are," said FA
spokesman Steve Double. Tranmere beat Sunderland 1-0 in the fourth
round tie at Prenton Park.
</P>
<P>
The result was allowed to stand despite the fact the player who
should have left the pitch for substitute Stephen Frail helped
defend a late Sunderland free-kick.
</P>
<P>
Harris admitted his breach of the rules but in a written
submission he said he had been unaware of an illegal substitution
as he was focusing on a confrontation on the pitch.

BERLIN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- German soccer head coach Erich
Ribbeck complained that its national squad is short of time to
prepare for the European Championship from June 10 to July 2 to be
co-hosted by the Netherlands and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Ribbeck said the warm-up schedule from the German Football
Association (DFB), was too pressing for him and his players to
prepare for the European Championship.
</P>
<P>
Under the schedule, Germany will play the Netherlands in
Amsterdam on February 23, against Croatia in Rijeka on March 29
and face Switzerland in Kaiserslautern on April 26.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Bundesliga will start its second phase from February 4
to May 20 and the German national team will later have a seven-day
's training in the camp at Spanish Majorca from May 27 to June 2
after the end of the League.
</P>
<P>
Ribbeck said "it is optimal that the national players have two-
weeks vacation and then begin to train for four weeks for the
important matchs."
</P>
<P>
During the second circle of Bundesliga, two rounds of matchs
will be arranged within a week for several times. And at the
beginning of March, the Cup of the European Champions and the UEFA-
Cup also will be continued.
</P>
<P>
There will be more matchs within short time for several clubs
such as Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen, Berlin Hertha BSC and
Borussia Dortmund. Ribbeck is worried about their forms as most
of the national players come from these clubs.
</P>
<P>
Out of the same concerns, team-doctor Kindermann has no choice
but to cancel the routine medicinal check-up and condition test
for the national footballers.

<HEADLINE> Azeri Soccer Chief Refuses to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the Azerbaijan
Soccer Federation (ASF) said on Friday he would fight any attempt
to remove him from his job over internal crisis which have
jeopardised the country's FIFA membership.
</P>
<P>
"I have no intention of resigning and I'm going to fight for
my rights until the very end," vowed ASF president Fuad Musayev
after talks with Azeri Prime Minister Artur Rasizade.
</P>
<P>
Government leaders have asked the ASF chief to resign amidst
allegations of corruption and misuse of funds and have promised
him immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Azeri soccer was split into two rival groups after
bosses of eight leading clubs rowing with Musayev ignored FIFA's
plea for a peaceful solution and went on a collision course with
the ASF.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Sepp Blatter earlier threatened the world's
soccer's governing body could ban the country unless they settle
the crisis at an early date.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The 17th Arab interior ministers
meeting opened here Saturday in the Algerian capital, during which
the ministers will discuss issues relating to the fighting against
terrorism, organized crime and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day meeting, the ministers will also explore a
project to reinforce security in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The Arab interior ministers signed a five-year anti-terrorism
agreement in 1988, aimed to strengthen cooperation among their
countries.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika
blamed some Arab and Islamic bodies, which he did not name, of
having contributed to the elongation of the eight-year devastating
civil war of his country.
</P>
<P>
The north African country has been torn by a civil war, murders
and massacres that started in early 1992 after the military-backed
government canceled elections that the Islamic Salvation Front was
poised to win. So far 100,000 people have been killed in the
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million people have been affected by the violence in
some way, Bouteflika said.
</P>
<P>
Security conditions have improved after Bouteflika, the first
civilian leader of the country in 24 years, launched his initiative
aimed at national reconciliation after taking office.

BEIRUT, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of Lebanon's Amal
Movement attacked on Saturday evening Israeli troops' outposts in
Hardoun, Shama and Tir Hyzma in the western sector of the Israeli-
occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops retaliated by bombing villages and valleys near
the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon.
</P>
<P>
No casualties in the attacks were reported so far.

<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who is also
president of the Syrian-backed Amal movement, accused Israel of
trying to annex more Lebanese lands.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the Israeli attempts to annex Lebanese land
continue, there will be more resistance operations against the
Israeli occupation forces in the occupied territories even if
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, reaches a peace deal with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 15-kilometer deep border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 as a self-styled security zone to buffer guerrillas
cross border attacks. Lebanese resistance groups have been fighting
to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and their 2,500 allied militiamen
there.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Arrest 700 Hezbollah Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police have arrested a
total of 700 suspected Hezbollah militants since a nation-wide
crackdown on the clandestine Islamic organization began more than
10 days ago, reported Anatolia News Agency on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The confessions of those arrested Hezbollah members have led
police to discover corpses of people ,killed by the Hezbollah and
buried in basements and gardens in cities throughout the country,
these days.
</P>
<P>
The victims included businessmen who refused payoffs to
Hezbollah and a women's rights activist who insisted on women's
right to pray alongside men.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, police also found a Hezbollah weapons cache in the
country's southeast, confiscating a mortar, three rocket launchers,
several hand grenades and automatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
Police started the all-round campaign to net the terrorist group
with a raid on the major Hezbollah hideout in Istanbul, the largest
city of Turkey, on January 17.
</P>
<P>
During a four-hour shootout, the head of Hezbollah, Huseyin
Velioglu, was shot dead and two hardcore militants were captured.
The two men confessed that Hezbollah abducted and killed at least
40 businessmen in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Hezbollah, which has no links to the Iran-backed
Lebanese Hezbollah which is fighting a guerrilla war against
Israeli occupation troops in southern Lebanon, wants to set up a
fundamentalist Islamic regime in the constitutionally secular but
overwhelmingly Muslim-populated Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The radical Islamic organization began life and grew up in the
1980s in turbulent southeastern Turkey, where it fought with the
separatist Kurdish Workers' Party, a fact that has aroused public
speculation that the authorities gave tacit consent to the
existence of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Ankara vehemently denied the inference.

"We're going to try everything we can to get China permanent
trading status so we can support their entering the WTO. And I

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced Saturday that he will discuss with congressional leaders
from both parties his State of the Union proposals, including a
plan to pay off the 3.6 trillion dollar national debt.
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost, I hope we can agree on my plan to pay down
the debt entirely over the next 13 years and make America debt-
free for the first time since Andrew Jackson was president in 1835,
" Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he wants to reserve a third of the projected
federal surplus for debt reduction, and a lower debt would free up
interest payments that should be used to preserve Social Security.
</P>
<P>
"That will keep it strong and sound for 50 years and take in
the life span of the baby boom generation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's final year agenda range from passing a patients bill
of rights to raising the minimum wage. He also wants to create a
new Medicare prescription drug benefit and spend more on education,
scientific research and military pay.
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure that every child begins school ready to learn
and graduates ready to succeed. We must help every family succeed
at home and at work," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"We must do all of this while maintaining the fiscal discipline
that brought us to this rare and promising moment we enjoy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But the Republican party maintained that the strong economy has
left the government more money than it needs to save Social
Security, pay down the national debt and deal with other
priorities.
</P>
<P>
Republican Representative Jim Nussle of Iowa said the rest of
the money should be returned to Americans in the form of tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Introduces China-made New Anti-malaria Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 DAR ES SALAAM, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has officially
 introduced a new anti-malaria medicine, Artemether, to its people
who suffer heavily and widely from this fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
 Artemether, created by a Chinese pharmaceutical, is
characterized by high activity, rapid action and lower toxicity,
officials said at a news conference here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Marketing the new drug, a senior official from Tanzanian
Ministry of Health said that Artemether was officially registered
by the Tanzanian Pharmacy Board on December 29, last year
following a two-year period of successful clinical trial and
testimony in many areas.
</P>
<P>
M. J. Mwaffisi, the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, said
that she expected Artemether, in forms of capsules, tablets and
injection, will help effectively in the fighting against malaria.
</P>
<P>
"Following the emergence of resistance of malaria parasites to
 traditional anti-malarials, we welcome the entrance of Artemether
in the Tanzanian market in our endeavor to save the lives of our
people," she added.
</P>
<P>
Officially approved by the Chinese health authorities in 1987,
 Artemether, exclusively produced by the Kunming Pharmaceutical
Co. Ltd. (KPC) in China' s southern province of Yunan, has since
been highly commended by medical experts worldwide as an effective
drug to treat all kinds of malaria.
</P>
<P>
 The World Health Organization (WHO) registered Artemether in
the "WHO Essential Drug List" in December 1995 following clinical
trials in Asian, African, Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
 Experts confirmed that As a new type of non-quinoline
anti-malaria drug, Artemether exhibits rapid parasitemia clearance
and constant curative effects, representing a hope for achieving a
decrease in mortality from malaria, and in particular from
cerebral malaria.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO reports, malaria remains an endemic
parasitosis in 107 countries, a scourge to which 40 percent of the
world's population is exposed with an estimated incidence of 300
to 500 million clinical cases annually.
</P>
<P>
The global mortality due to malaria reaches 3 to 5 million
annually, primarily among children below 5 years old.
</P>
<P>
At present, the available pharmaceutical forms of Artemether
are intramuscular injection 80 mg/ml and 40 mg/0.5 ml, oral
capsule 40 mg and oral tablet 50 mg, KPC officials concluded.

<HEADLINE> Natural Disasters Make 2 Million Latin Americans Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 2 million Latin Americans
now bear the status of refugees or displaced persons because of
the natural disasters that have affected South and Central America
in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The "La Vanguardia" daily said Saturday that the violent
climate changes that have scoured the American continent have
caused an increase of natural catastrophes, and as a consequence,
millions of persons have been forced to leave their homes to seek
refuge in safe zones.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees has doubled since 1997 and experts agree
that the figure continues growing.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations' Center for Evaluation of Disasters in Latin
America and its Caribbean president Romulo Caballeros said that up
to a few years ago there was one natural disaster a year in the
region, but that now "there are three or four" because of the
climate change.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane "Mitch" caused Honduras damage for some 5 billion
dollars in 1998, and at least 320,000 Hondurans emigrated
illegally to the United States and many more settled in Mexico,
Costa Rica, or Panama.
</P>
<P>
The drought made some 300,000 persons to abandon the rural
areas and go to the big cities in Brazil, while in Venezuela the
strong rains last December caused serious economic losses and
thousands of dead and victims.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Protest in Miami for Return of Cuban Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The protesters yelled "Send Elian Home" as a small plane towing
a banner with the same slogan passed overhead, according to an
Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
Cuban-Americans among the group said they wanted to show that
not all Cuban-Americans want Elian to remain here. They said the
six-year-old had been kidnapped and should be returned to his
father, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 after his mother died when
their boat capsized in the sea near Florida. His relatives in
Miami demand the boy stay in the United States while the boy's
father asked Elian to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled earlier this month that the boy should be
returned to Cuba, but some U.S. lawmakers say they plan to offer a
citizenship to the boy.
</P>
<P>
"Every child needs a father and a mother," Juan Morales, a
Cuban who has lived in the United States for eight years, was
quoted by AP as saying.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Appoints Central Bank Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Gatemala Saturday appointed
economist Lizardo Sosa president of the Central Bank to replace
Edin Velazquez.
</P>
<P>
Reports received here say that Sosa will assume the post next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesperson Fernanda Castejon said Saturday that
President Alfonso Portillo appointed Sosa as central bank
president because of his wide experience, that includes his
presidency of the same entity during the 1989-1990 period, and
also his performance in the Economy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Velasquez, who assumed the post in July 1997 and should
relinquish it in 2001, left the post after President Portillo
announced a 10-percent reduction in the general budget of the
nation, as well as a 26-dollar-a-month pay raise for all public
and private workers.
</P>
<P>
Portillo said that Velasquez' exit from the Central Bank was
not a surprise for him since he had already foreseen Sosa's
appointment.

<HEADLINE> FARC Criticize U.S. Assistance to Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The rebel
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) criticized Saturday
the 1.6 billion dollar assistance promised by the United States to
the country, saying it will be used to combat the guerrillas
instead of fighting drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Marulanda, the highest ranking FARC leader, said that
there are unemployment, hunger and social injustice in Colombia,
problems that are not solved with rifles, machine-guns, or bombs,
but with political and economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Marulanda made these statements in the locality of Los Pozos,
in San Vicente del Caguan, department of Caqueta, in the south of
the country, but he did not attend Saturday the public hearings
inauguration of Villa Nueva Colombia, the official site of the
peace negotiations between the government and the FARC.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton pledged 1.6 billion dollars to
support the Plan Colombia for the war against drug trafficking and
for the substitution of drug-yielding cultivations in that country.
</P>
<P>
The head of the biggest and oldest insurgent group in the
country insisted that unemployment should be the first theme in
the Dialogue and Negotiation National Table 12-point agenda.
</P>
<P>
Colombia went last year through the most serious economic
crisis in 60 years, characterized by an unemployment rate of
almost 20 percent.
