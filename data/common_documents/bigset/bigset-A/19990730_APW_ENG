<HEADLINE> Kings' Abdul-Wahad Undergoes Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sacramento Kings guard Tariq  
Abdul-Wahad underwent arthroscopic surgery Friday to repair a minor 
cartilage tear in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Wahad injured the knee while playing for the French  
National Team during the 1999 European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-minute procedure by team physician Dr. Richard Marder was  
successful, and Abdul-Wahad will be able to resume his offseason 
training within three weeks, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6 Abduh-Wahad averaged 9.3 points, 3.8 rebounds and  
one assist as the Kings' starting shooting guard last season.

<HEADLINE> Titans To Turn Kearse Loose on QBs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The first time a college teammate saw a  
shirtless Jevon Kearse stretch out his arms, he thought of a 
pterodactyl. 
</P>
<P>
	Taunted by an assistant coach during a Tennessee Titans minicamp  
drill, Kearse easily outraced his fellow defensive linemen and 
scooped up not just one, but all three cones with one hand. His 
speed left coaches nearly speechless. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-round draftee nicknamed ``The Freak'' for his physical  
abilities is being counted on by the Titans to play just one 
position quick enough to revive a dormant pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will get the job done,'' he promises.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he picks it up real quick to help out his coach,'' said  
Jim Washburn, hired as the Titans' new defensive line coach in the 
offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 Kearse, who has 4 percent body fat on his 265-pound  
frame, had 16 1/2 sacks in three seasons at Florida, including 7 1/2 in 
1998, splitting time between outside linebacker and end. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee drafted Kearse with the 16th pick in April convinced  
that he can gain about 10 pounds and still retain his speed. Coach 
Jeff Fisher has slotted him at left end, planning to turn him loose 
on opposing quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans desperately need someone to pile up some sacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Only Chicago and Cincinnati had fewer sacks than Tennessee's 30  
in 1998. Kenny Holmes, the team's No. 1 pick in 1997, has yet to 
pile up the sacks expected of him. In two seasons, he has 9 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans also feature some new tackles in veterans Jason Fisk  
and Mike Jones and rookie John Thornton in an attempt to stiffen 
the pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
	But it all starts with Kearse, who now is working in training  
camp learning how to play on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's never really rushed the passer a great deal,'' Washburn  
said. ``You can see him go through a thought process instead of 
just reacting. It's a pretty drastic change from stand-up 
linebacker to a guy down over 300-pounders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kearse hasn't had to think much up until now. He earned his  
nickname at Florida when coaches quickly realized he was too quick 
and big to play safety and switched him to linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	That was where he picked up his nickname due to an 86-inch arm  
span and hands that stretch 12 inches from thumb to pinkie. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got arms as wide as a pterodactyl and hands as big as  
Andre the Giant,'' said offensive lineman Zach Piller, a teammate 
both at Florida and now with the Titans. ``I've seen him vertical 
jump 40 1/2 inches and run a 4.40 on grass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To play every down, Kearse also must improve his defense against  
the run. Washburn isn't too worried after seeing him do something 
in that pursuit drill he hadn't seen in his 23 seasons as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was phenomenal to see a big guy run that fast. But what  
we've got to do is translate all that good athletic ability and 
speed into playing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Kearse is eager to learn and is ready for the  
pressure being heaped on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it. I love to have people depend on me,'' Kearse said.

<HEADLINE> 300 Little Caesars To Get Makeovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The abrupt closure of 300 Little Caesars pizzerias does not mean  
the Detroit-based company can't stand the heat and is getting out 
of the kitchen as it battles to keep its shrinking market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the opposite, Harsha Agadi , president of Little Caesars  
Enterprises Inc., said in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's No. 3 pizza restaurant is beginning a multimillion  
dollar overhaul to make its stores more appetizing, especially to 
teen-agers, and to appeal to convenience-minded consumers with 
features like drive-thrus, Agadi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision last week leaves Dallas, Pittsburgh and  
Indianapolis without any freestanding Little Caesar pizza outlets 
for the time being. Stores were also closed in Houston, Denver and 
other cities but the franchises in those areas remain open. 
</P>
<P>
	All 300 closed stores will either be remodeled or relocated  
sometime in the next 12 months as part of a ``triple-digit'' 
multimillion dollar makeover, Agadi said. He did not know how many 
employees were affected by the recent closings, but said they were 
informed of the company's decision the same day the stores were 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Agadi declined to discuss the privately held company's finances,  
other than to say its debt is among the lowest in the industry and 
its owners, Detroit sports magnates Michael and Marian Ilitch, 
remain committed to its future. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year, some franchise owners complained the fast-food  
chain was doing a poor job and that its ``2-for-1'' pizza deals 
make it hard to make money. There were also layoffs at Little 
Caesars corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ron Paul of Technomic Inc., a Chicago consulting firm, says  
Little Caesars is losing market share at the expense of No. 4 Papa 
John's International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul estimates Little Caesar's sales fell 7 percent to $1.76  
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody slipped a little bit last year,'' Paul said. ``But  
it appears (Papa John's) took a bigger bite out of Little 
Caesars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul said Papa John's is also affecting sales and market share  
of the No. 1 and No. 2 pizza restaurants: Tricon Global Restaurants 
Inc.'s Pizza Hut and Bain Capital Inc.'s Domino's Pizza Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The 300 shuttered Little Caesar stores represent more than a  
quarter of the 1,100 pizza outlets owned by Little Caesars 
nationwide. There are another 3,300 franchise operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Agadi said all the company-owned stores will undergo ``Image  
2000'' remodeling in the next five years, although they probably 
won't close their doors because they are in more profitable 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchise owners are also being urged to remodel.  
</P>
<P>
	Agadi said the new stores will emphasize quality and  
convenience, two key components of the company's expansion 
strategy. In addition to drive-thrus, there also may be some new 
menu items. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to make it so customer-friendly with drive-through  
units ... and kids are going to love it,'' said Agadi, who is also 
the chain's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Little Caesars, which already has outlets overseas, will also  
open stores later this year in Iceland, Bahrain, Qatar and 
Guatemala.

<HEADLINE> MIT Said To Pull Graduate's Diploma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has  
taken back the diploma of a 23-year man accused of providing 
alcohol at a 1997 fraternity party that left a freshman dead from 
alcohol poisoning, his lawyer says. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's decision was made Wednesday, after Charles Yoo and  
attorney Timothy Burke attended a hearing before the MIT Committee 
on Discipline, Burke said. Yoo now works as a stockbroker in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoo, 23, who graduated in 1998, will sue MIT, Burke said. School  
officials declined to comment on the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Scott Krueger died in September 1997 after he was  
forced to drink huge quantities of liquor as part of a pledge 
contest at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house. Krueger's blood 
alcohol level of .401 was five times the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoo was the pledge trainer at the fraternity and provided  
freshman -- including Krueger -- with whiskey and beer, authorities 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said MIT's punishment of Yoo was too harsh, and could cost  
Yoo his job. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the student who gave Krueger a bottle of rum was  
only suspended for a semester. 
</P>
<P>
	``MIT needed to scapegoat someone,'' Burke said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Officials Enforce Ignored Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- No blood, no foul? Not this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	Whistles are blowing and players are grumbling in the NBA's  
summer leagues, where officials are using a by-the-book approach to 
experimental rules aimed at boosting offense. Long-ignored rules 
are being enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're calling the rules very literally. That's their job  
right now,'' said Portland coach Mike Dunleavy, watching his team 
of rookies and regular-season bench-warmers at the Rocky Mountain 
Revue. 
</P>
<P>
	A defender who uses a hand check or a forearm is immediately  
whistled for a foul. Likewise, an offensive player who moves while 
setting a screen will get tagged with a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	Another experimental rule bars defenders from impeding offensive  
players cutting through the lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Try guarding Shaquille O'Neal in the low post without a forearm  
in his back, or stop Allen Iverson off the dribble without a hand 
check. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players are used to putting their hands on people and moving  
them around,'' Sacramento coach Rick Adelman said. ``If they're not 
allowed to do that, it's going to make it much harder to guard 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One rule seeks to make illegal defense guidelines more  
understandable. Another sets the shot clock at 14 seconds after 
fouls or out-of-bounds plays in the frontcourt, rather than the 
usual 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA director of officiating Ed Rush said the changes are  
intended to reinvigorate the plodding offenses of the 1990s, 
returning the league to the 100-point games that were the norm in 
earlier decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the best athletes in the world,'' Rush said from the  
NBA offices in New York. ``Quickness and pure athleticism are big 
parts of basketball. We want to make sure our athletes have the 
chance to showcase their talents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it backfired last week as play during some Salt Lake City  
games was agonizingly slow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Jazz summer team had 49 fouls in one 40-minute game,  
the typical total in an NBA game for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Rush stressed no decision has been made on using the rules in  
the regular season. A 16-member committee of past and present 
players, coaches and front-office officials will meet before the 
season to evaluate the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will it make a difference if they call it like this during the  
regular season?'' Antonio Daniels of the San Antonio Spurs asked. 
``Without question. I think you'll see a lot of guys in foul 
trouble. A lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Daniels found a silver lining.  
</P>
<P>
	``On defense, you have to play with your feet and do more than  
using your hands,'' he said. ``Offensively, if you're quicker than 
somebody who's guarding you, it gives you a huge advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches and players at the Rocky Mountain Revue were reluctant  
to publicly criticize the experiment, but most agreed there's been 
plenty of griping in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Better to try it out here than in the regular season,''  
Adelman said. ``Everybody's going to complain. Players and coaches 
just have to adjust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels agrees players will have to deal with any changes.  
</P>
<P>
	``This takes you back to the fundamental way basketball is  
supposed to be played,'' Daniels said. ``Whether you like it or not 
is irrelevant. If they change the rules, you deal with it.''

<HEADLINE> Va. Steelworkers End Shipyard Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Steelworkers at Newport News  
Shipbuilding ended their 16 1/2-week strike Friday, approving a 
58-month contract with the nation's only builder of aircraft 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members voted 2,724 to 1,696 to approve a contract that  
provides a pay raise averaging $3.10 an hour over 58 months and 
improves the pension plan for longtime workers, said union 
spokesman John Duray. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to put down the picket signs, pick up the tools and  
go back with our heads held high,'' said Arnold Outlaw, president 
of Local 8888 of the United Steelworkers of America, which 
represents 9,200 workers at the yard, about half its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement comes after much hard work and important  
compromises by both sides,'' said shipyard spokesman Mike Hatfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the union hall, members remained divided.  
</P>
<P>
	William McGlone Jr., 40, of Hampton, a welder with 20 years  
experience at the yard, said the contract is two years too long. 
``Those last two years are going to be a long two years,'' he said. 
He said he would vote against the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Outlaw said he did not like the length of the contract either,  
``but we have to give a little to gain a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union members will begin returning to work next week. The  
company reserved the right to take as long as 28 days to recall 
workers, because of work schedules and because some workers may 
need to be retrained.

<HEADLINE> Doug Flutie Recording Album </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- First came Flutie Flakes. Now there's the  
Flutie CD. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Flutie, quarterback of the Buffalo Bills, has been  
recording an album with his rock band, The Flutie Gang. It will 
feature nine original songs and will be released by Frequency 
Records in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the proceeds will benefit the Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation  
for Autism. His popular ``Flutie Flakes'' cereal also benefited the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, whose son suffers from autism, said being the drummer in  
a rock band is a lot like being a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in each you have the ability to control tempo,''  
Flutie said this week. ``You have a big say in whether a play or a 
piece succeeds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie isn't giving up his day job -- he reports to Buffalo Bills  
training camp today. But he loves his side interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great release for me,'' Flutie said. ``Football is my  
profession. This is my hobby.''

<HEADLINE> House Dems Condemn GOP Reductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are on the attack as House  
Republicans carve money out of social programs and use the funds to 
boost veterans, space and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll meet the obligations of the country, but in a  
conservative way,'' Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., said Friday as the 
House Appropriations Committee approved by voice vote a $92 billion 
measure financing veterans, housing, space and environment programs 
for the coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh was the bill's chief architect. The Senate hasn't written  
its version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	To bolster the legislation's chance of House passage next week,  
Walsh and his GOP colleagues increased its funds for NASA and 
veterans. To do so, they killed the Americorps national service 
program, cut disaster response funds, and transferred $4 billion 
out of a separate measure providing $300 billion for health, 
education and labor programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes were approved by voice vote.  
</P>
<P>
	Facing tight, legally required spending caps, Republicans have  
spent months shifting billions among the 13 annual spending bills 
for fiscal 2000, which starts Oct. 1. Committee Chairman Bill 
Young, R-Fla., said Friday's actions would be ``the last time we 
rob Peter to pay Paul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats condemned the reductions, saying they would result  
in huge cuts in medical research, job training, school aid and 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're looking at a long and tortured fall,'' said Rep.  
David Obey of Wisconsin, top Democrat on the committee, referring 
to inevitable bargaining between Congress and the White House over 
several of the spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter, White House budget chief Jacob Lew said the cut in  
the labor-education bill would be ``irresponsible'' and would show 
that overall GOP spending plans are ``simply unworkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee added $400 million to NASA's 2000 budget, bringing  
it to about $12.7 billion. That remains $1 billion below this 
year's budget and $900 million short of Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appeal to members of Congress to fully restore the  
president's budget,'' NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin said in a 
written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The added NASA money would go to projects including Mars  
exploration and a planned orbiting infrared telescope, which an 
earlier version of the bill had cut. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA officials, who earlier had said the agency's Jet Propulsion  
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and Goddard Space Flight Center in 
Greenbelt, Md., might be in jeopardy of closing, said they did not 
yet know whether the threat remains with the new numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel boosted spending for veterans' health care by $700  
million, responding to pressure from veterans' groups. That would 
bring the program's total to $19 billion, $700 million more than 
Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also removed controversial emergency designations  
for $5.5 billion worth of spending for veterans and disaster 
relief. The emergency label lets Congress ignore required spending 
limits and pay for items with the anticipated federal budget 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor, health and education measure -- the biggest of all 13  
annual spending bills, and the last to be written -- won't begin 
moving through committee until September. The $4 billion shifted 
out of it Friday left the measure almost $17 billion below this 
year's levels and $20 billion short of what Clinton wants. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans are looking to add money back to it, and are  
considering several budget gimmicks to accomplish that. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest, they would delay some federal Medicaid payments  
to the states from late September 2000 into early October, said 
aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	That timing shift would push the expenditure out of the books  
for fiscal year 2000 and into 2001. That would allow Republicans to 
claim savings next year of several billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the committee used successive party-line votes to hold  
fast to its prior decision to label the $4.5 billion cost of the 
2000 census an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said unless they did so, FBI agents would have to be  
laid off and 80 U.S. embassies closed. Democratic efforts first to 
remove the emergency label for the entire $4.5 billion, and then 
for a portion of it, lost by 30-26 and 32-26. 
</P>
<P>
	That fight came as the panel used a voice vote to approve a  
$37.7 billion measure financing the departments of justice, state 
and commerce for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	White House advisers have threatened a veto because the  
legislation cuts Clinton's requests for hiring police officers, 
legal aid for the poor, U.S. participation in international 
organizations and other programs.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Again Files for Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has filed  
for divorce from his wife, Marianne, after 18 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Papers filed Thursday in the Superior Court of Cobb County, Ga.,  
said the couple -- married Aug. 8, 1981 -- have been separated since 
May 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cause of the ... separation was the fact that the marriage  
is irretrievably broken,'' the papers said. They added that 
Gingrich and his wife were attempting to reach a settlement 
``resolving all matters and controversies between them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich's attorney, Victoria Toensing of Washington, said,  
``Marianne is saddened and disappointed at Newt's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich reserved the right to ``set forth additional grounds  
for divorce'' if the parties could not reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, architect of the Republican revolution in the House,  
served as speaker from 1995 until the end of last year, when he 
gave up his seat in Congress. The marriage was his second.

<HEADLINE> Grain Futures Up on Hot Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices were higher Friday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade as the Midwest continued to bake under stifling 
heat and humidity. 
</P>
<P>
        Grains started higher on follow-through from Thursday's strong  
showing, and mostly maintained the gains through the close. 
</P>
<P>
        Both corn and wheat posted gains, shaking off news that more  
favorable weather may be in store for heat-addled growing regions. 
September and December wheat contracts hit their highest levels of 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
        ``This week we went through a critical time frame with corn,  
'' said Don Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. ``For 
the areas that didn't get the rain, this heat really took a toll.'' 
</P>
<P>
        The heat, which reached the high 90s and triple digits in key  
growing states Friday, could bake parched crops and reduce yields. 
</P>
<P>
        Gains were limited by the more favorable weather forecasts  
for this weekend and next week. Forecasters are calling for rain and 
cooler temperatures throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybean prices were mixed Friday.  
</P>
<P>
        ``The soybeans can withstand the heat a lot better than the  
corn,'' Roose said. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery rose 6 1/4 cents to $2.79 3/4 a  
bushel; December corn rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.14 1/2 a bushel; December 
oats fell 4 3/4 cents to $1.11 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 
1/4 cent to $4.33 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef futures were mixed and pork higher Friday on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
        August live cattle fell .10 cent to 64.22 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .17 cent to 76.87 cents a pound; August lean hogs 
rose .67 cents to 48.27 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 3.0 
cents to 52.12 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Braves Observe Moment of Silence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves observed a minute of silence  
before the start of Friday night's game in memory of people killed 
in a shooting rampage in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton, a chemist turned day stock-trader, walked into  
two brokerage firms where he traded and fired randomly Thursday. 
Nine died and 13 were wounded. His wife, son and daughter were 
later found bludgeoned to death in the family home. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton killed himself a few hours later when police closed in on  
him at a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner Broadcasting System, which owns the Braves, said that  
while the company and team shared the city's ``profound sorrow,'' 
they felt they could best serve the community by playing the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts go out to the families who lost loved ones and we  
wish a full, rapid recovery for those who were injured,'' the TBS 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Braves general manager John Schuerholz said: ``The important  
thing for us to do is focus on the families and the awful 
circumstances they're having to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been in a situation like this. It's horrible for  
everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta pitcher Tom Glavine wants the team to wear a special  
patch on its uniforms for the rest of the year. The Braves wore 
nothing Friday night in honor of the victims and their plans were 
not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened is a situation that makes us all open our eyes.  
One, that there's a lot of crazy things going on out there, and 
two, that you can't take for granted what you have,'' Glavine said 
before the game against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Right fielder Brian Jordan admitted he's often fearful of crowds  
of any size. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's going on in our society?'' Jordan asked. ``It's scary.  
You just never know when something could happen to you in your job. 
Guys go crazy and shoot people for no reason. It really makes you 
think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, three of Denver's professional sports teams canceled  
games after a shooting spree at suburban Columbine High School left 
15 people dead and 23 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Nuggets postponed a game that was scheduled to start  
about eight hours after the rampage began. The Colorado Rockies 
postponed two games, and the Colorado Avalanche postponed two 
playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillies first baseman Rico Brogna said he believed the Braves  
would have postponed the game if it had been scheduled on the day 
of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played the first game after the Columbine shootings, and I  
think the people there were ready for some kind of normalcy to 
return to the community,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Promoter May Stop Races at Charlotte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The promoter of the speedway where three  
spectators were killed during an Indy Racing League event in May is 
leaning toward not bringing the series back to the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway Motorsports Inc. is concerned about how questions of  
fan safety, declining attendance and car design could affect the 
IRL's future at Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte, company 
president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler told The Associated Press on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really taking a hard look at Charlotte,'' Wheeler said.  
``The IRL people are good people. We don't want to drop them. But 
at the same time, we've got shareholders we've got to appease. So 
we're going to continue to study this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said officials of Concord-based SMI have until  
mid-October to make a final decision on whether to bring the IRL 
back next year to the 1.5-mile, high-banked superspeedway in the 
north Charlotte suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	IRL officials, who first came to the heart of stock car racing  
country three years ago, said they were not giving up hope of 
competing again at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``A promoter has to do what's best for their facility, and I  
think a promoter ultimately would have the best sense of that,'' 
IRL spokesman Ron Green said by telephone from Dover, Del., where 
the circuit has a race scheduled Sunday. ``Our teams love competing 
in Charlotte and would love the opportunity to race there again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the 11 races on this year's IRL schedule are run at  
facilities operated by Concord-based SMI. Wheeler said the company 
is leaning toward retaining the rest of its IRL races for next 
year, which means the circuit could still run events in 2000 at SMI 
properties in Atlanta, Dallas and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said SMI's long-term relationship with the circuit could  
depend on what changes, if any, the IRL makes in car design. 
Wheeler said SMI favors larger cars that are safer and more visible 
and identifiable to spectators. The company also would favor the 
IRL incorporating some sort of fender covers to its wheels, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL, which has slowed its cars and made their wheel  
assemblies more durable since the Charlotte accident, is studying 
additional changes for 2000 but is not yet ready to commit to any. 
</P>
<P>
	``League officials, with the cooperation of car designers, are  
doing everything to address safety issues even as we move forward 
with the year 2000 car design,'' Green said. ``They're trying to do 
this yet still maintain the league's open-wheel heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-car accident early in the VisionAire 500 on May 1 at  
Charlotte sent a wheel assembly and suspension parts rocketing over 
a catch fence and into the fourth-turn grandstands. Three 
spectators were killed instantly and eight were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the first spectator fatalities in the history of the  
speedway, which opened in 1960 and has long been considered the 
home track by most NASCAR Winston Cup drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened here was extremely traumatic for everybody  
involved,'' Wheeler said. ``We have to live with this every day. 
It's a situation where you tell yourself in the back of your head 
that this could happen, but you're also saying it probably won't 
while you're alive. But it did. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you've got to think about everything you can do to keep  
that from happening again. So certainly that tramautic event has 
had a very, very negative effect on my personal feelings about this 
whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the accident, there were signs the IRL was having  
troubles in Charlotte. The inaugural race in 1997 drew more than 
70,000, but that number dropped to about 50,000 in 1998 and to less 
than 40,000 for this year's race, which was canceled after the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public votes every time you have an event on whether they  
like it or not,'' Wheeler said. ``And when they don't come, they're 
voting that what you're presenting to them, they don't like, never 
will like or maybe would like if you changed some things. And I 
think that's where the answer is. I think some strong changes need 
to be made.''

<HEADLINE>  Jags' Coach Focuses on Mental Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- No sunglasses. No kneeling. No sitting  
on your helmet. All those rules are passe compared to the newest 
directive at Camp Coughlin 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	No laterals.  
</P>
<P>
	Any player who laterals the ball during Jaguars training camp  
will be fined. It's one way coach Tom Coughlin is trying to send 
the message that mental mistakes, like the one that crippled 
Jacksonville in its playoff game at New York last season, will not 
be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be more attention to detail at this camp than  
ever before,'' Coughlin said. ``More attention paid to assignments, 
assignment errors, penalties, that sort of thing. As far as 
pressure for people to perform well, we will never let up from a 
mental standpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While offsides penalties and missed assignments can slowly chip  
away at a team's effectiveness, the kind of mistake the Jaguars 
made in last year's 34-24 playoff loss to the Jets can end a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through the second quarter, safety Chris Hudson, who is  
no longer with the team, intercepted and returned the ball into 
Jets territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Inexplicably, he tried to lateral to a teammate. The ball  
bounded around and was recovered by the Jets. New York stayed on 
offense, drove for a touchdown and controlled the ball for more 
than 14 minutes of that decisive second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mental errors are one reason we haven't been able to get to  
the next level,'' Coughlin said. ``More players are aware of that. 
They have to work among themselves and put peer pressure on people 
in order to not be a mistake or error guy. The more that happens, 
the better off we're going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By moving some of the focus to the mental side, several players  
have noticed a subtle downshift in the amount of physical toil they 
endure in Coughlin's camp, once known as the toughest in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the team won't practice in full pads until next  
Monday, letting four practices go by in shells and shorts. Coughlin 
isn't as stringent about a rules list that bordered on ridiculous 
five years ago, when discipline was the best way to find out who 
could play for his first-year expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	And Coughlin hasn't totally dismissed shortening some practices  
if the temperatures, which have been in the high 90s for two weeks, 
don't let up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real surprising,'' said cornerback Dave Thomas, who has  
been present for all five Jaguars camps. ``The first year we 
started, we're in Wisconsin, it's 103 degrees out and we're in full 
pads every day. I'd say there's a big contrast from then to now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Mark Brunell says he's noticed a difference, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if easy is the word,'' Brunell said. ``But I'd  
say we're being smart the first two days. We're not going to go 
right out there and kill ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any slackening on the field is being made up for in the meeting  
rooms. Coughlin said the Jaguars faced too many 2nd-and-12 
situations last year for a team with 11 victories. He wants to 
eliminate the illegal procedure penalties that cause them. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the defense has to learn a new system with new  
terminology under coordinator Dom Capers. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Coughlin wants to give the players plenty to work on.  
And he doesn't think the new structure will diminish his reputation 
as a drill sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a gentler Tom,'' Coughlin said. ``I don't know who  
came up with that one. We've just adjusted accordingly. The mental 
part of camp will be just as tough as any camp, just as demanding 
as any camp we've had.''

<HEADLINE> Giants' Snow Signs for 4 Years, $24M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- First baseman J.T. Snow agreed to a $24  
million, four-year contract extension Friday as the San Francisco 
Giants locked up the middle of their batting order into the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual move, the Giants also exercised options on Barry  
Bonds and Jeff Kent, extending their contracts for one more year. 
Bonds now is under contract through 2001 and Kent through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for us not only to satisfy the players but also  
to show the Bay area and our fans that we're serious about our 
future, too,'' general manager Brian Sabean said. ``While we're 
focused on winning now, it was the right timing to do something 
like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The moves came one week after the Giants traded two minor league  
pitchers to Florida for starter Livan Hernandez to improve their 
chances of making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow, 31, could have been a free agent after this season. The  
four-time Gold Glove winner makes $3 million this season, the 
option year of a deal he agreed to in March 1996. His new contract 
also includes an option for a fifth year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabean said an agreement was reached with less than 24 hours of  
negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to give the Giants credit. They handled this  
professionally,'' Snow told reporters before a game against the 
Cincinnati Reds. ``They didn't take any cheap shots through the 
media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds' option pays him $10.3 million in 2001. Kent's option pays  
him $6 million in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unusual for a team to exercise a contract option so far in  
advance because an injury could diminish the player's value. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is out of character in baseball,'' Sabean said.  
``It's a great leap of faith. You usually don't do those things 
unless you're up against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it is a vote of confidence, it is the right investment  
because you're talking about special people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snow leads NL first basemen with a .997 fielding percentage and  
84 assists, committing only three errors in 874 chances. He leads 
the Giants this season with 68 RBIs and 57 walks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, 35, was recently selected player of the decade by The  
Sporting News. He's an eight-time All-Star, has seven Gold Gloves 
and is one of only eight players to have won three Most Valuable 
Player awards. He's the only player in history to have 400 home 
runs and 400 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent currently is batting .291 with 13 home runs, 63 RBI and 12  
stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabean is still looking at improving his pitching staff, but  
said the chances he'll make another deal are ``20 percent or 
less.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybeans futures prices opened higher  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, mirroring Thursday's strong 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
	Grains were higher, following up from Thursday, as well as  
concerns over the continued heat wave across the Midwest. The heat, 
reaching the high 90s and triple digits in key growing states, 
could bake parched crops and reduce yields. 
</P>
<P>
	While brutal weather was forecast today for most of the Midwest,  
and the rest of the country for that matter, market participants 
say much of that news has already been factored in. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains were also limited by favorable weather forecasts for  
Midwestern growing states for this weekend and next week. 
Forecasters are calling for rain and cooler temperatures throughout 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's advances in corn and soybean prices ended days of  
sharp declines. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Shooting Victims Shocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Dean Delawalla's daughter Shahala turned 4 on  
Thursday, but he was saving the big bash for Sunday -- a trip with 
her school friends to Chuck E. Cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way it looks, the funeral may be Sunday,'' said  
Delawalla's brother Fred. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Delawalla, 62, who had given up his law practice last year  
to focus on options trading, was gunned down in his broker's office 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other people were killed in Mark O. Barton's rampage at  
two Atlanta brokerages, and 13 were injured. Barton also killed his 
wife and two children, and committed suicide as police moved in to 
arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
	Another victim was Texas native Kevin Dial, 38, office manager  
at Momentum Securities, where the shooting started. Dial was the 
son of former Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys wide receiver 
Buddy Dial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw the guy without a smile on his face -- never, not  
once,'' said Eric Blaier, who works down the hall as a sales 
manager with Allegiance Telecom. He stood with a Diet Coke and 
stared in disbelief at the satellite trucks ringing his workplace. 
``Probably one of the happiest guys I ever saw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Delawalla, other victims were in the offices to day trade  
on the stock market. One of them was Edward Quinn, 58. 
</P>
<P>
	The father of three was only a couple of years into his  
retirement after decades with United Parcel Service, where he last 
served as Southeast regional director for security and loss 
prevention. Friends and neighbors said Quinn seemed to have three 
passions besides his family -- his lawn, flyfishing and golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he retired, his plan was to begin traveling the world and  
playing at all the great old courses across the planet,'' said Ken 
Sternad, a UPS spokesman who had known Quinn for 10 years. ``That 
was his goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Allen Tenenbaum, 48, was another of the day traders.  
</P>
<P>
	Tenenbaum jogged several miles a day, was president of his  
synagogue and ran his family's grocery business, Great Savings. 
</P>
<P>
	His synagogue's rabbi, S. Robert Ichay, said Tenenbaum was  
planning his first pilgrimage to Israel next year. And last week, 
he talked with his wife about getting burial plots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he had a premonition of anything,'' Ichay said.  
``But he knew that life was not always the way we imagine it, or 
the way we would like it to be -- that things could happen. And 
therefore he was a great believer in doing things and not missing 
opportunities -- and doing them with people he loved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the victims had nothing to do with the stock market.  
</P>
<P>
	Vadewattee Muralidhara, 44, had just moved to Atlanta from tiny  
Swainsboro three months ago with her pediatrician husband. The 
soft-spoken homemaker and mother of two college-aged children was 
at the financial center taking a computer course ``to expand her 
knowledge,'' said Peggy Corbin, a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I would say is she was a very sweet-spirited  
person,'' Ms. Corbin said. ``Just very dedicated to her children. 
They were her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another victim, Scott Webb, 30, had just moved from  
Chesterfield, Mo., an upscale community outside St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of single people don't take the time to be really kind  
to their neighbors,'' said a neighbor, Susan Frey. ``He was such a 
nice young man and always had the time for a beautiful smile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``I wish he had never moved to Atlanta.''  
</P>
<P>
	Also killed was 42-year-old Russell J. Brown of Cumming, Ga.  
Police did not release the names of the other two people who died 
at the brokerage firms.

<HEADLINE> Stations Said To Rent Donor Lists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of a House telecommunications  
panel said Friday that several public broadcasting stations rented 
donor lists from the Clinton-Gore election campaign, violating a 
law that prohibits nonprofit groups from participating in political 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., head of the House Commerce Committee's  
subcommittee on telecommunications, released a list he said he had 
obtained from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting of stations 
that responded to a survey on donor list-swapping. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three stations -- WCNY in central New York State, WBGU  
in Bowling Green, Ohio, and WCET in Cincinnati -- got the lists from 
a commercial list broker, the survey said. Other stations also 
acquired the lists, but the survey left their source unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice ``shakes the foundation of public broadcasting and  
undermines the integrity of PBS,'' said Tauzin spokesman Ken 
Johnson, adding that it also ``raises serious questions about PBS' 
objectivity and fairness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A counsel for Clinton-Gore did not return telephone calls  
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Epstein, a PBS vice president, said public television  
stations that exchanged or rented lists did so with both political 
parties in accordance with their non-profit tax status. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dole '96 campaign, for instance, did business with several  
public television stations,'' he said. ``IRS regulations indicate 
that if lists were available to all political parties, there would 
be no violation of the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin, who supports public broadcasting, is considering  
legislation that would reduce federal funding to those stations in 
response to reports that they swapped donor lists with political 
parties. Nonprofit groups are prohibited from engaging in political 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The CPB, which distributes federal funding to public  
broadcasters, issued rules Friday that would withhold grants from 
stations that do not take specific steps to ensure the privacy of 
their donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new guidelines, stations seeking grants must inform  
their members periodically that lists containing their names might 
be sold, rented or exchanged and offer members a way to ask that 
their names not be released. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people will see this as an unprecedented step, and sadly,  
they will be right,'' CPB President and CEO Robert T. Coonrod said 
in a statement. ``Our goal is to restore the public's trust in the 
work public broadcasting does every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, PBS disclosed that at least two dozen public  
television stations exchanged membership lists with political 
groups. Some Republican lawmakers responded by renewing calls to 
strip public broadcasting of its $250 million government subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
	Stu Kantor, PBS director of corporate communications, called the  
new guidelines ``a vital and much-needed positive step to restore 
the trust relationship that public television and public radio have 
relied upon with the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin's list was first reported by The Washington Times.

<HEADLINE> Lightning Re-Sign Nylander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Lightning re-signed center  
Michael Nylander to a one-year contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Nylander, 26, scored two goals and added seven assists in 24  
games with the Lightning after being acquired from the Calgary 
Flames in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is an extremely talented offensive player who has  
proven he can produce at a top level, both in the National Hockey 
League and internationally,'' Lightning general manager Rick Dudley 
said. ``He's an intelligent player who provides us with an 
important offensive dimension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nylander, a 5-foot-11, 195-pound native of Stockholm, Sweden,  
was the 59th overall pick by the Hartford Whalers in the 1991 entry 
draft. He was dealt to Calgary in 1994 and appeared in 168 games 
with the Flames, scoring 34 goals and adding 74 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been a member of Sweden's national team seven times,  
including five world championships appearances, the 1996 World Cup 
team and the 1998 Olympic team.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Limits `Three Strikes' Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The California Supreme Court has limited  
the reach of the ``three strikes'' sentencing law, ruling that a 
residential burglary conviction in juvenile court cannot be counted 
as a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	By a unanimous vote Thursday, the court threw out an eight-year  
prison term for Edwin Garcia of San Diego, whose sentence was 
doubled under the three-strikes law because he had a juvenile court 
burglary conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Gary Nichols, said the ruling could affect  
``potentially thousands of cases throughout the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia has already served more than four years in prison.  
Nichols said he will immediately seek Garcia's release, and that 
his office would challenge the sentences of dozens of other people 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Burglary is one of the most common juvenile offenses. Minors  
account for 40 percent of all burglaries, according to FBI 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The court appears to be backing off its previous strict  
interpretation of the law, said Frank Zimring, a criminal law 
professor at Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law. ``I think they're 
more comfortable in the current political culture, so they don't 
have to look over their shoulder,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three strikes law was signed by Gov. Pete Wilson in 1994  
amid outrage over the murder of Polly Klaas in Petaluma. 
</P>
<P>
	Only adults can be prosecuted under the law. A defendant with  
two prior convictions for a serious or violent felony can receive 
25 years to life if convicted of any third felony. A felon with one 
prior can receive double the normal sentence.

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft Camera Misses Asteroid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NASA scientists sounded philosophical after a  
camera flub on the Deep Space 1 probe left them with no images of 
its brush with an asteroid. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, they said, the spacecraft's use of 12 new  
technologies to forge more than 117 million miles from Earth was no 
small feat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no secret we wanted to get neat pictures,'' deputy  
mission manager Marc Rayman said on Thursday. ``But it's a very 
small disappointment at the end of a very successful and important 
mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The probe is estimated to have flown within 10 miles of the  
Asteroid Braille late Wednesday, the closest flyby ever of an 
asteroid. But pictures it sent back from the encounter show only 
empty space, said Robert Nelson, a mission scientist at NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The barrel-shaped, 8-foot spacecraft, launched in October and  
designed primarily to test new forms of technology for future 
deep-space flights, otherwise accomplished all of the objectives of 
the $152 million mission, NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole asteroid encounter was pure bonus,'' Rayman said.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the technologies, the Autonomous Navigation system, lost  
the target asteroid about 20 minutes before the 35,000-mph 
encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on data that was still arriving from the spacecraft  
Thursday, scientists believe the probe's camera missed the pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just haven't gotten enough data down yet to determine where  
the broken link is,'' Rayman said. ``AutoNav had already 
successfully guided the spacecraft for many, many months and worked 
extremely well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other technologies aboard is an ion propulsion engine  
that moves the spacecraft by sending out a stream of high-speed 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
	The engines are considered preferable for future spacecraft  
because they deliver 10 times more thrust than a conventional 
engine for a given amount of fuel, allowing spacecraft to be 
smaller, lighter and less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	An instrument that analyzes ions appeared to operate normally  
during the flyby, and its data could help researchers figure out 
the rock's composition, the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the lack of images is disappointing to scientists given  
how little is known about the thousands of asteroids that 
irregularly orbit the sun, sometimes colliding with planets. An 
asteroid impact on Earth 65 million years ago is believed to be 
responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1 will remain functional when its prime mission  
officially ends Sept. 18, but could fly by two comets in 2001 if an 
extended mission is funded.

<HEADLINE> Aviators' Quest Locates 1948 Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- For years, Marc Millican and Kevin  
McGregor have been fascinated with Northwest Airlines Flight 4422, 
which long ago plowed into a mountain peak, killing all 30 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The two pilots made it to the wreckage of the 1948 disaster on  
Saturday, reaching debris nestled in a remote valley buttressed by 
avalanche-prone walls and tucked under a glacier about 200 miles 
east of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	They found not only bits of the flight's twisted propeller and  
shredded fuselage but human remains long preserved by ice and snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska state troopers on Wednesday retrieved a human arm and  
hand from the wreckage, which Millican and McGregor found scattered 
about 10 miles inside Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and 
Preserve. The hand may be in good enough condition to be 
fingerprinted, said patrol spokesman Greg Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage for years had been too remote to reach safely. But  
a glacier has since pulled it down from its original 8,000-foot 
resting place on Mount Sanford, and it can be hiked to. 
</P>
<P>
	The DC-4 is believed to have collided with a near-vertical wall  
along the mountain's 16,237-foot peak on March 12, 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash killed six crew members and 24 passengers, most of  
whom were members of the U.S. Merchant Marines who were returning 
from delivering a cargo ship to Shanghai. The flight was bound for 
Edmonton, Canada, and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	More than the disaster's location has sat unresolved. Aviators  
still don't completely understand why a flight piloted by two 
veteran Alaska fliers airborne for just an hour would crash into a 
mountain in good weather, having sounded no distress report. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the aurora borealis has been blamed; it was shining that  
night like ``the headlights of a car,'' a pilot who searched for 
the ill-fated flight told McGregor. Perhaps the pilots were blinded 
by the northern lights reflecting off a thin cloud layer atop Mount 
Sanford, investigators said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, McGregor and Millican, both commercial pilots,  
began probing the debris' location after discovering their mutual 
interest in the disaster while attending an Air Force reunion. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we got more and more into it, I got more and more  
intrigued,'' Millican said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior expeditions, some lured by rumors of gold aboard, had  
declared the wreckage too dangerous to approach. The pair located 
it only after repeatedly flying and hiking through the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took literally thousands of pictures, but we never saw  
it,'' Millican said. 
</P>
<P>
	The longtime friends said they discovered the wreckage in 1997  
but waited to inspect it until receiving government clearance and 
unanimous consent from victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reopening,'' said Dorothy Denman of Anchorage, whose  
uncle, August Koistinen, was a passenger. ``I've been crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millican, 42 and McGregor, 44, have been deliberately vague  
about the debris' location to safeguard it from the curious. They 
say they hope some wreckage they brought back -- a twisted table 
knife with the old Northwest logo, an engine plate, a scrap of 
aluminum -- can be displayed in a museum, or used in a memorial to 
the crash victims. 
</P>
<P>
	National Park Service officials have declared the area closed  
for two months while they decide how to handle any other visiting 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want treasure hunters in there out of respect for the  
families,'' said Jane Tranel, a National Park Service spokeswoman. 
``We consider it a burial site -- a resting place for those souls on 
board.''

<HEADLINE> Firm To Pay $28M in Ageism Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An insurance brokerage and employee benefits  
firm will pay $28 million to settle a lawsuit that alleged it 
practiced age discrimination by requiring members of its board of 
directors to retire at age 62. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced the  
consent judgment Thursday, saying Johnson and Higgins Inc. would 
make the payout to settle a 1993 lawsuit filed by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and Higgins, which had 7,000 workers nationwide,  
allegedly enforced a mandatory retirement policy before it was 
acquired by Marsh &AMP; McLennan Companies Inc. two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Perlmutter, vice president of public affairs for Marsh &AMP;  
McLennan, said the company was ``pleased to have this matter behind 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It related to the policy of a privately owned firm that we  
acquired in 1997,'' she said. Ms. Perlmutter added that there was 
no such policy at Marsh &AMP; McLennan, which employs 50,000 people in 
more than 100 countries worldwide in insurance services, investment 
management and consulting. 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC had accused Johnson and Higgins of requiring its  
directors to retire at the end of the year in which they turned 62 
or at the end of the year in which they reached age 60 with 15 
years completed on the board. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case demonstrates that companies cannot arbitrarily  
impose age-based requirements for employees even if they place them 
on their board,'' said James Lee, the EEOC's New York District 
regional attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	A consent judgment filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan  
said the $28 million settlement resulted from extensive 
negotiations. The deal also required the company to pay the EEOC 
$100,000 for the costs of the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Football Fans Still Have Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prospective NFL owner Ed Roski Jr. insisted  
there is no public money available to sweeten a deal to bring an 
expansion NFL franchise to Los Angeles, but he was hopeful that a 
compromise could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes the deal tougher, but not impossible,'' Roski said,  
The Orange County Register reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	During a meeting Wednesday in Chicago, NFL owners did not commit  
to a proposal submitted by Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has remained tight-lipped about whether the city will be  
a pro football town again. City officials are optimistic, but some 
aren't sure if they can satisfy the league's demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL is seeking more public contributions instead of settling  
for $150 million in bonds proposed by Bill Chadwick, chosen by Gov. 
Gray Davis to negotiate with the league to return a team to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL also said there would be no set franchise fee and that  
it would take bids from the two Los Angeles groups vying for 
ownership. Those groups joined forces on a stadium proposal after 
the NFL said it wanted the team to play at the Coliseum, but 
ownership is still up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think there's any public money available,''  
Roski said. ``It's hard to imagine that the state or someone else 
would give money to help build a football stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick was confident going into the meeting that the owners  
would sign off on the stadium proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether what the NFL wants is possible,''  
Chadwick said Thursday. ``I'm not sure how to feel, but I'm not 
quitting. ... I learned quite a bit while I was in Chicago. Based 
on what I learned, I have to re-evaluate the possibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Fabiani, adviser to an investor group led by Hollywood  
agent Michael Ovitz, said Thursday that they would continue to work 
to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have worked very hard to make it happen for almost four  
years. We are not giving up,'' Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Los Angeles doesn't come up with a proposal that satisfies  
the owners by Sept. 15, the NFL will likely turn to Houston, which 
has a plan largely embraced by the owners. Houston initially came 
in second to Los Angeles only because of its size. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am concerned that we have a lot to do in a relatively short  
amount of time,'' City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said. ``We 
can't afford to waste one day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue has said the September deadline  
won't be pushed back under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Los Angeles groups -- one led by Ovitz and billionaire  
Ron Burkle, the other by Broad and Roski -- presented a unified 
stadium plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue now is how to pay for all of the improvements'' to  
the Coliseum and the area around Exposition Park, Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, Chadwick presented league owners with plans to raise  
$150 million from bonds for 15,000 additional parking spaces. He 
also called on the NFL to contribute up to $150 million for 
development of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also calls for the team owner to pay the state an  
annual rent of $5 million, subject to increases every five years. 
Many NFL teams play in rent-free stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick thought the NFL would sign off on his proposal before  
he left Chicago, but Tagliabue called it a work in progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need further negotiations. ... There are a number of  
economic issues that need to be improved in order for the team to 
be successful,'' Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad has said it will take about $900 million to ensure a team  
for Los Angeles, including the stadium and franchise fee. He also 
believes a team would generate a profit of $25 million to $28 
million a year.

trading deadline at Saturday midnight EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, most teams were on the prowl for pitching.  
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte of the Yankees, Rolando Arrojo and Roberto  
Hernandez of Tampa Bay, Brad Radke and Mike Trombley of Minnesota, 
Arthur Rhodes and Orosco of Baltimore and Darryl Kile of Colorado 
were said to be available. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be shocked if we don't do something,'' Cleveland  
general manager John Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, looking at a potential playoff matchup with the  
Yankees, hoped to close a deal with Anaheim for Finley, 16-9 
lifetime against New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees also eyed Finley, along with Arrojo and Hernandez.  
Pettitte, who has struggled all season, seemed the most likely 
player to depart the World Series champions, with Houston, 
Philadelphia and Seattle interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had things presented to us, we've had offers made to  
us,'' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, the AL East-leading Yankees had enough prospects to  
swing a deal. Especially if it meant heading off the AL 
Central-leading Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Yankees, you do things short-term, anyway,'' manager  
Joe Torre said. ``You always want to win now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City was fielding a lot of offers for Appier, its  
longtime ace. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all likelihood, we will make a trade before Saturday  
night,'' Royals general manager Herk Robinson said. ``I can't tell 
you who it's going to be with. It's whoever wants him the most, I 
guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few deals have been made already.  
</P>
<P>
	In the last week, San Francisco got former World Series MVP  
Livan Hernandez from Florida, the Mets acquired Kenny Rogers from 
Oakland and Toronto got first baseman David Segui from Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday night, the Athletics tried to boost their  
wild-card chances by getting infielder Randy Velarde and pitcher 
Omar Olivares from Anaheim for three minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you compare apples to apples, just by numbers Omar was  
having a better year than Kenny,'' Oakland general manager Billy 
Beane said. ``Omar was on a wish list. We were trying to prepare 
ourselves for him in the week since we traded Kenny. We knew he was 
going to be moved, but we weren't sure when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, there was a flurry of activity on July 31 with more  
than 10 trades. 
</P>
<P>
	In the big deal, the Astros acquired Randy Johnson from Seattle.  
The Big Unit helped pitch Houston into the playoffs, but went 0-2 -- 
despite a 1.93 ERA -- against San Diego in the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last season, Texas got Todd Stottlemyre, Royce Clayton and  
Todd Zeile in separate trades with St. Louis and Florida, Los 
Angeles got Mark Grudzielanek and Carlos Perez, San Francisco got 
Ellis Burks and Baltimore got Juan Guzman. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, these late deals are made for minor leaguers or young  
major leaguers. And while such trades may seem one-sided at the 
time, often they look a lot different a year later. Consider the 
Cardinals' acquisition of powerful Fernando Tatis, along with 
Darren Oliver, from Texas for Stottlemyre, now in Arizona, and 
Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Sunday, trades can still be made. But from that point,  
players must pass through waivers, a tricky proposition at this 
time of year. With so many teams in contention, it's more and more 
unlikely a club would let a key player slip through to a rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Aug. 31, the last day a team can acquire a player and have  
him eligible for the postseason, San Diego got utilityman John 
Vander Wal from Colorado and Cleveland acquired infielder Joey Cora 
from Seattle for David Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were said to be looking at Orosco, the bullpen ace from  
their 1986 World Series team, and Rhodes. There was also a chance 
they might make a lesser move, perhaps trading someone like 
middleman Greg McMichael, to set a up a bigger deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, a hard-throwing lefty, was receiving plenty of interest.  
Earlier this week, he heard he might be going to Cleveland. On 
Thursday, he talked with Orioles owner Peter Angelos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I'd love to stay in Baltimore,'' Rhodes said. ``He  
said he'd love to keep me, too.''

<HEADLINE> Worker Kills Boss, Self in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A maintenance worker entered a trucking  
terminal Friday, warned other workers to ``get out of the way,'' 
and shot and killed his supervisor before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a specific target,' said Charlotte-Mecklenburg police  
spokesman Keith Bridges. ``He intended to kill him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The supervisor died at the scene and the gunman was transported  
to Carolinas Medical Center, where he died about 3 1/2 hours after the 
noon shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the victims were being withheld until family  
members were contacted, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for the shooting was under investigation, Bridges  
said. But workers at the west Charlotte company said the gunman had 
been having problems with his supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me the supervisor was messing with him,'' said Derrick  
Hooker, who said he spoke with the maintenance worker Friday 
morning.

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft Camera Misses Asteroid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NASA scientists sounded philosophical after a  
camera flub on the Deep Space 1 probe left them with no images of 
its brush with an asteroid. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, they said, the spacecraft's use of 12 new  
technologies to forge more than 117 million miles from Earth was no 
small feat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no secret we wanted to get neat pictures,'' deputy  
mission manager Marc Rayman said on Thursday. ``But it's a very 
small disappointment at the end of a very successful and important 
mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The probe is estimated to have flown within 10 miles of the  
Asteroid Braille late Wednesday, the closest flyby ever of an 
asteroid. But pictures it sent back from the encounter show only 
empty space, said Robert Nelson, a mission scientist at NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The barrel-shaped, 8-foot spacecraft, launched in October and  
designed primarily to test new forms of technology for future 
deep-space flights, otherwise accomplished all of the objectives of 
the $152 million mission, NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole asteroid encounter was pure bonus,'' Rayman said.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the technologies, the Autonomous Navigation system, lost  
the target asteroid about 20 minutes before the 35,000-mph 
encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on data that was still arriving from the spacecraft  
Thursday, scientists believe the probe's camera missed the pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just haven't gotten enough data down yet to determine where  
the broken link is,'' Rayman said. ``AutoNav had already 
successfully guided the spacecraft for many, many months and worked 
extremely well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other technologies aboard is an ion propulsion engine  
that moves the spacecraft by sending out a stream of high-speed 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
	The engines are considered preferable for future spacecraft  
because they deliver 10 times more thrust than a conventional 
engine for a given amount of fuel, allowing spacecraft to be 
smaller, lighter and less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	An instrument that analyzes ions appeared to operate normally  
during the flyby, and its data could help researchers figure out 
the rock's composition, the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the lack of images is disappointing to scientists given  
how little is known about the thousands of asteroids that 
irregularly orbit the sun, sometimes colliding with planets. An 
asteroid impact on Earth 65 million years ago is believed to be 
responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1 will remain functional when its prime mission  
officially ends Sept. 18, but could fly by two comets in 2001 if an 
extended mission is funded.

<HEADLINE> 8 Food Stands Close at Safeco Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners and catering contractor  
Volume Services shut down eight Safeco Field concessions stands 
before Friday's game with the Baltimore Orioles because of 
equipment problems, team spokesman Randy Adamack said. 
</P>
<P>
	King County inspectors found dozens of health-code violations  
during two inspections of concession stands during the Mariners' 
first homestand at the new $517 million stadium. A July 22 
inspection found 26 ``red critical'' violations, meaning they had 
to be immediately corrected because they posed the threat of 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners and Volume Services were hoping to avoid costly  
``third strike'' violations during their second homestand, which 
began Friday. Concessions workers and managers underwent food 
service retraining while the team was on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamack said the Mariners hope to re-open the eight closed food  
stands by Saturday's game, but weren't sure that would be possible 
because of a 1 p.m. PDT start time.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Women Top Argentina in Hoops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Only the outcome brought any  
satisfaction for the U.S. women's basketball team in its Pan 
American Games opener. 
</P>
<P>
	In a game long on effort but short on style, reserves Amy Herrig  
and Michelle Marciniak gave Team USA the lift it needed to get past 
Argentina 63-55 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just OK,'' said Marciniak, a former Tennessee standout.  
``It was by no means acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The young Americans, most of whom have little international  
experience, shot only 39 percent and committed 24 turnovers. They 
trailed by a point at halftime and led by only three midway through 
the second half before finally grinding down the Argentines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just not playing good basketball right now,'' said coach  
Nell Fortner, who had just 13 days to get her team ready and 
substituted constantly trying to find the right combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to start executing better, we've got to play smarter  
defense,'' she said. ``I think we will, but we've got to start 
doing it soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herrig made 11 of 12 free throws while scoring 15 points and  
grabbing nine rebounds. Marciniak scored 13 points and made her 
presence felt early. Entering the game at 15:46 of the first half, 
Marciniak twice grabbed a rebound and drove the length of the court 
for baskets to inject some life into a struggling offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of pent-up energy,'' Marciniak said. ``I get  
really anxious sitting on the bench, so when I get in there, I want 
to make something happen. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's 
bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Far more satisfied with their effort were the American men in  
water polo. By beating Cuba 11-7, they earned the only available 
berth in the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Humbert of Lodi, Calif., scored five goals.  
</P>
<P>
	Canada beat the U.S. women 8-6 for the gold medal, building a  
3-0 lead and holding on. It was the third straight loss to Canada 
for the Americans. Waneek Horn-Miller scored a hat trick for the 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	Michele Smith had a perfect game into the seventh inning for the  
U.S. women's softball team. But she couldn't match teammate 
Danielle Henderson's perfecto of Thursday, yielding a hit to the 
Netherlands Antilles in a 5-0 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Things were bad at the track, on the hockey field and on the  
volleyball court for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	No American won on the final night of track and field, while  
Cubans took five of the 10 events. High jumper Javier Sotomayor won 
his fourth Pan Ams gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spectacular ... fantastic,'' Sotomayor said. ``This is  
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so great were U.S. relay teams, which were blanked. Jamaica  
had the year's fastest time in the men's 1,600 and women's 400 
relays. 
</P>
<P>
	When Argentina's men beat the United States 4-1 in field hockey,  
it ended any chances of the Americans qualifying for the Olympics. 
And there'll be no medal for the men's volleyball team, which was 
knocked out when it lost to Venezuela 25-21, 28-26, 25-22. The U.S. 
women could win a bronze, but their shot at gold ended with a 
three-set sweep by Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Things went better in the ring on the opening night of boxing.  
</P>
<P>
	Flyweight Jose Navarro of Los Angeles started off with a 14-4  
decision over Carlos Valcarcel of Puerto Rico in the new format of 
four two-minute rounds. Welterweight LeChaunce Shepherd of 
Milwaukee, Wis., dominated Isaac Caballero of Nicaragua, stopping 
him in the first round. Caballero received three standing-8 counts 
to end the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first bout is always the hardest,'' Shepherd said. ``I was  
a little anxious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans did win the premier rowing event, the men's eight with  
cox. The U.S. team took control at 500 meters and won by nearly 
three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a big move about three minutes into the race and that  
sealed it,'' said Nick Anderson of Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	An official from the International Baseball Association told  
several reporters that two Cuban baseball players had defected. But 
Canadian immigration officials and sources close to the Cuban team 
said the official was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball continues Saturday with the quarterfinals. The United  
States plays Panama and needs to win that game and its semifinal 
match to secure a berth in the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The other baseball quarterfinals are Canada vs. Guatemala, Cuba  
vs. the Dominican Republic, and Nigaragua vs. Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Firm Won't Appeal Paula Jones Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The lead law firm for Paula Jones said  
Friday it will not appeal a federal judge's order awarding it 
$79,999 from President Clinton for costs incurred because of his 
false testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the Dallas-based firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher  
&AMP; Pyke all but wraps up Mrs. Jones' dispute with Clinton, who has 
said he is willing to comply with the court order issued Thursday 
by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought that more attorneys fees were caused by his lying,  
but Judge Wright didn't see it that way and so it's over,'' said 
lawyer Wes Holmes of the Dallas firm. ``There's really nothing to 
appeal. It was totally discretionary by her. She made a decision, 
and we're going to live with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The head of The Rutherford Institute, a Virginia-based  
conservative group that also worked for Mrs. Jones, said he likely 
would decide next week whether to appeal the institute's $9,485 
award, but would prefer to let the case end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're weighing the money, the attorney time, the chance factor  
with the court and then probably as big of a factor: Do we want to 
be in this case for another year?'' said Rutherford President John 
W. Whitehead. ``We all want this to end if we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas firm had sought $437,825 and The Rutherford Institute  
had sought $58,533 -- about six times what it received. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts who have tracked Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment  
suit said her attorneys would be wise not to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They run the risk of losing it all, and there's very little  
chance of increasing their take,'' said Georgetown University law 
professor Paul Rothstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's attorneys have said the president will not appeal the  
$90,686 payment ordered to compensate for legal costs related to 
what the judge called his ``false, misleading and evasive answers'' 
in his January 1998 deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	But if The Rutherford Institute appealed, Clinton's lawyers  
could raise broad objections. For example, legal experts said 
Clinton could argue that Wright should not have determined the 
contempt award because her office is also being compensated for 
costs -- $1,202 to cover her trip to Washington to preside over 
Clinton's deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's denials of a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky led  
to his impeachment by the House. The Senate acquitted him after a 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit April 1, 1998, but Clinton  
agreed to an $850,000 settlement after Mrs. Jones appealed the 
dismissal. Clinton admitted no wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> NBC Overhauling Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NBC is putting more ethnic diversity in  
its new and returning series, partly in response to criticism of 
the major broadcast networks for a nearly all-white slate of new 
fall shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be totally disingenuous to stand up here and say we  
did this totally on our own,'' NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa 
said Thursday, acknowledging the effect of complaints from the 
NAACP and others. 
</P>
<P>
	The network said it is working with actor-writer Keenen Ivory  
Wayans and producer Yvette Lee Bowser (``Living Single'') to 
develop a pair of sitcoms that will feature black characters. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayans' show was described as ``Not the Bradys,'' featuring an  
interracial marriage and the resulting merged family. 
</P>
<P>
	Several planned cast additions involve minority actors: Sherri  
Shepherd on ``Suddenly Susan''; Jesse L. Martin on ``Law &AMP; Order'' 
and Michelle Hurd on its spinoff, ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims 
Unit''; Darryl Theirse on ``Jesse'' and Michael Michele and Ming-Na 
Wen on ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Michele (``Homicide: Life on the Street'') will play a  
second-year resident, while Ms. Wen is reprising her role from the 
medical drama's first season as Dr. Deb Chen. Joining them will be 
Maura Tierney (``NewsRadio'') and Goran Visnjic. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Alda (``M-A-S-H'') and Rebecca DeMornay (``Risky  
Business'') will guest star in several ``ER'' episodes, while 
recurring character Dr. Romano (Paul McCrane) is now a regular. The 
series returns Thursday, Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC, more vulnerable since losing ``Seinfeld,'' also is  
overhauling shows to improve ratings and try to maintain its 
top-ranked position. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Ms. Shepherd, ``Suddenly Susan'' will add Eric Idle  
(``Monty Python''), Rob Estes (``Melrose Place'') and Currie Graham 
as the magazine the characters work for becomes a sports 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
	``Veronica's Closet'' is losing Ron Silver and bringing aboard a  
new adversary for Veronica (Kirstie Alley): Silver's young widow. 
The series, which has failed to capitalize on its stellar Thursday 
slot behind ``ER,'' is moving to Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both ``Veronica's Closet'' and ``Jesse'' are getting new  
producers. The latter also is adding Kevin Rahhm (``Everything's 
Relative'') as a cast member. 
</P>
<P>
	``West Wing,'' a new series set in the White House and  
criticized as having an unrealistically all-white cast, will add a 
black actor in a recurring role, said NBC Entertainment President 
Garth Ancier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa said the network ``should have done a better job'' in  
creating racially diverse shows. Diversity is good business for the 
network, he said, because NBC-owned stations in big cities draw 
more ethnic viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's new schedule will debut the week of Sept. 20.

<HEADLINE> Minorities Got More Loans in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blacks, Hispanics and American Indians got  
more home mortgages last year than in 1997, new government data 
show, but they were still turned down more often than whites 
regardless of income. 
</P>
<P>
	Low interest rates fueled a big jump in home refinancing, but  
low- and moderate-income people and blacks fell behind others in 
refinancing their mortgages, according to the latest annual survey 
of 7,837 banks, thrifts and other mortgage lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	It was released Thursday by the Federal Financial Institutions  
Examination Council, which is comprised of the bank regulatory 
agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, the Department of Housing and Urban  
Development announced Thursday it is requiring the two biggest 
housing finance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to finance 
more mortgages for low- and moderate-income families. The move will 
boost their total to $2.4 trillion in such mortgages over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new HUD requirement means the companies must buy an  
additional $488.3 billion in mortgages from banks and other 
lenders, enough to provide housing loans for some 7 million 
families of modest means. 
</P>
<P>
	They showed a total of 24.7 million home mortgage loans and  
applications in 1998, up 50 percent from the year before, which the 
survey attributed largely to a big increase in refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
	Of an estimated 11.8 million home loans issued last year, some  
50 percent were for refinancing, according to banking industry 
experts. That compares with about 30 percent of 6.9 million home 
loans in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The government survey showed that the number of conventional  
home mortgage loans, those not backed by government guarantees, 
issued last year to Hispanics rose 22.3 percent to 162,365. For 
American Indians, it was up 17.1 percent, to 13,175; for blacks, it 
rose 13.4 percent, to 158,266; for Asian Americans and whites, it 
increased nearly 15 percent, to 118,486 and 2,760,370, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Minorities, however, continued to be denied conventional  
mortgage loans at similar rates as in recent years, the survey 
showed: Denial rates of 53 percent for blacks and American Indians 
and 38 percent for Hispanics, compared with 25 percent for whites. 
</P>
<P>
	And low- and moderate-income people and blacks didn't keep up  
the pace of other groups in the refinancing boom. The data showed 
low- and moderate-income borrowers last year getting 21 percent of 
the refinancing loans, down from 25 percent in 1997, while blacks 
received 4.5 percent of them, down from 6.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks got 75 percent more refinancing loans than in 1997, while  
whites received 146 percent more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the ability to ... refinance your loan going to remain the  
privilege of the well-heeled, or will it become an important way to 
help working people increase their income and assets?'' asked John 
Taylor, president and CEO of the National Community Reinvestment 
Coalition, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry maintains that lenders continue to seek  
qualified borrowers in minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banks are increasing their outreach efforts to all  
communities,'' said Patricia Boerger, a spokeswoman for the 
American Bankers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	As lending institutions cast the net more widely, loan  
applicants become more diverse and include more unqualified people, 
resulting in continued relatively high denial rates, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's home ownership rate rose to a near-record 66.7  
percent in the first three months of this year and set records for 
blacks and Hispanics, reflecting low interest rates and low 
unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stock, Futures To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's stock exchange and futures exchange  
have agreed to a merger plan, a cornerstone of the government's 
market reform program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong will hold 70 percent of the  
merged entity, while the Hong Kong Futures Exchange will own 30 
percent, acting Financial Secretary Rafael Hui said. 
</P>
<P>
	A feud over how much each exchange would own had threatened the  
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders will vote on the deal in September, while  
legislation will be taken up in the legislature by year's end, 
paving the way for completion of the merger in early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hui said he expected shareholders to pass the plan, but the  
government would pursue merger and reform through ``other means'' 
if they voted it down. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Asian financial crisis dealt a severe blow to Hong  
Kong's financial markets and exposed some of their noncompetitive 
problems last year, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang announced in 
March that the two exchanges and several associated entities would 
merge to create a more open market.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall for a Second Day / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell for a second session Friday  
after a key report revealed that inflationary pressures intensified 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 13/32  
point, or $4.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, a key 
influence on borrowing costs, rose to 6.10 percent from late 
Thursday's 6.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell by 1/32 point to 3/32 point, while intermediate-term Treasurys 
fell by 3/32 point to 7/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices plunged Thursday after the Labor Department reported  
that employment costs -- which typically account for two-thirds of a 
product's price -- rose 1.1 percent from April through June. That 
was the biggest quarterly change since the second-quarter of 1991, 
when wages and benefits increased 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The data convinced many investors that the Federal Reserve will  
push its key lending rates higher again to slow the economy -- 
possibly weakening the job market so that workers would have less 
leverage with their employers. Rising inflation and interest rates 
make the fixed payoff on bonds less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose 4.74 percent while the  
discount rate rose to 4.62 percent, an increase of 0.03 percentage 
point on both. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields rose to 4.83 percent and the discount to 4.65  
percent, up 0.01 percentage point. One-year yields rose to 5.09 
percent as the discount increased to 4.84 percent, up 0.01 
percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged from late Thursday's 5.13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/4 point to 117 24/32. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.59 percent, up from 5.58 percent on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Tours Big Apple After Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lance Armstrong's initial surprise at the size  
of the crowds welcoming him back to the United States quickly gave 
way to appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to try and do this every year,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was greeted by raucous, cheering New Yorkers on  
Thursday, four days after completing his inspiring victory in the 
grueling Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea how much America, how much the communities  
around America, were following the Tour de France,'' he said. ``To 
see the turnout and the response in the sports world and in the 
media, it makes my day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who overcame an advanced form of testicular cancer  
two years ago before winning cycling's most prestigious race, spent 
the day being interviewed on talk shows, touring the New York Stock 
Exchange and making a promotional visit to Nike's Manhattan store. 
</P>
<P>
	Since winning the tour, Armstrong has ridden in races in Europe  
on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Then he flew to New York for 
Thursday's round of appearances at the ``Today'' show, ``Good 
Morning America,'' the stock exchange, the Nike store and a taping 
of ``The Late Show with David Letterman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani proclaimed July 29 ``Lance  
Armstrong Day'' in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	And the impact of his victory still hasn't sunk in.  
</P>
<P>
	``I still can hardly believe I won the race,'' Armstrong said.  
</P>
<P>
	In his interviews with NBC and ABC, Armstrong, accompanied by  
his wife Kristin, talked about the cancer that nearly took his life 
in 1996 when it spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm able now to look a year out, two years out, 10 years out,  
20 years out, whereas in the first couple of months of my illness I 
was only able to look a day away, and in the first year I was able 
to look a week away or a month away,'' Armstrong said on NBC. ``But 
now we feel confident in my health and feel confident as a couple 
and as a family and we want to have a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kristin, whom Armstrong met toward the end of his chemotherapy,  
is expecting the couple's first child in October. 
</P>
<P>
	On ``Good Morning America,'' Armstrong received a congratulatory  
phone call from Olympic skater Scott Hamilton, also a survivor of 
testicular cancer, and spoke to Kelly Davidson, an 11-year-old 
cancer patient in Fort Worth, Texas. Armstrong, a native of Plano, 
Texas, developed a friendship with Davidson after meeting her 
during a promotion in Austin in 1997, and he wished her well on 
camera while riding in the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson, her head bald from chemotherapy, wore a ring on a  
chain around her neck given to her by Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me really, really happy that he won,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong presented Davidson with a mountain bike on the air,  
and Davidson showed Armstrong a stuffed animal she bought as a gift 
for his baby. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the three weeks (of the race) I thought about Kelly  
and people like Kelly and the entire cancer community,'' Armstrong 
said. ``I get so much of my own motivation and inspiration from 
them, that extended family. They're so special to me and to Kristin 
and to the whole team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 27, was found to be cancer-free in 1997, and his  
chances of a recurrence are estimated at 2 percent by his doctors. 
But Armstrong, who started the Lance Armstrong Foundation during 
his recovery to raise funds to help people manage and survive 
cancer, feels the need to share what he has learned in his battle 
with cancer, with others suffering from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to believe,'' he said. ``You have to want to live.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a responsibility to tell my story, to encourage people  
to fight.''

<HEADLINE> American, Brit Airways Try New Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Transportation Department is dismissing a  
3-year-old application by American Airlines and British Airways for 
special government permission to form an alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. government official said the department would make the  
dismissal today because British Airways had reached a stalemate 
with the United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trade over surrendering 
landing and takeoff slots at London's popular Heathrow Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways long has fought to retain its hundreds of  
takeoff or landing spots at the airport, contending it would suffer 
as a result of increased competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a lack of progress on the underlying issues and  
it is in the best interests of all that the petition be dismissed 
without prejudice,'' a Transportation Department official said, 
speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``This will allow the 
airlines to resubmit the petition should progress be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In anticipation of the announcement, the two airlines issued a  
joint statement Thursday saying they planned to expand their 
existing marketing relationship in ways that would not require 
government approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Carty, chairman of American Airlines, said: ``While our  
alliance may now evolve somewhat differently than originally 
proposed, it will still be a beneficial one for our customers, 
shareholders and employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of the quasi-merger should not affect passengers.  
For example, the airlines' existing exchange of some frequent-flier 
benefits through their ``oneworld'' marketing partnership is not 
expected to dissolve. The airlines and their shareholders, though, 
may be upset at the missed chance to operate more efficiently under 
an alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are real advantages to (a formal alliance), but the fact  
they you do not have it is not a deal-breaker,'' said Darryl 
Jenkins, an airline specialist and head of the Institute of Tourism 
Studies at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	The two carriers had applied to the Transportation Department  
for antitrust immunity. It would have allowed them to discuss 
pricing and seat inventory, and let them share revenues from 
passenger and cargo service. Such cooperation is prohibited without 
a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin Atlantic Airways, a British carrier, and various U.S.  
airlines contended the alliance would give two huge airlines a 
stranglehold on transatlantic travel -- especially into Heathrow 
Airport. It is a gateway to Europe, Africa and the Middle East and 
is frequented by high-paying business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Access to Heathrow also has been a sticking point in  
U.S.-British negotiations over a new aviation agreement. The 
current treaty allows only two U.S. carriers -- now American and 
United Airlines -- access to Heathrow. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials want more access for other carriers with the aim  
of reducing airfares. The United States already has 30 such ``open 
skies'' agreements around the world. British officials have balked; 
they have sought, in exchange, a drop in current prohibitions 
against foreigners owning U.S. airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Transportation Department has firmly stated that it  
would not approve the airline alliance without the concession of 
better access to Heathrow. Some U.S. airlines have accused the 
British government of protecting British Airways, a former state 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins said the dismissal of the application may simplify the  
issues in the aviation negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what will happen is this will make it easier for the  
British government and U.S. government to reach an open skies 
agreement, and after that happens they both can reapply for 
antitrust immunity,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Freeman Becomes Holdout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers welcomed their  
veteran players to training camp practices Friday, but were still 
without their key passing combination. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Antonio Freeman officially became a holdout and  
quarterback Brett Favre was with his wife and newborn daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, an unrestricted free agent before the Packers  
designated him their franchise player, is still hammering out terms 
of a new contract with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd love for Antonio to be in camp,'' coach Ray Rhodes said.  
``But as we all know, when you're doing contracts, sometimes that 
stuff takes time. But I'm certain Antonio is working hard and 
preparing himself to come to training camp, and I hope it will be 
solved very shortly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre is expected to join the team Saturday. The veterans who  
did arrive were ready to go, Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, the veterans are in good shape,'' Rhodes  
said. ``The guys are going to be a little rusty, but I saw some 
good things. I was very pleased with the way they reported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes said physical testing went well when the veterans arrived  
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the best shape we've been in for some time,'' he  
said. ``It will take a couple of days before we get the timing 
down.''

<HEADLINE> Paint Delays Reduce Timber Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Forest Service said Friday a shortage of  
tree-marking paint is reducing logging in federal forests this year 
by as much as 25 percent in some regions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agency said it will try to make up the logging deficit  
by next year at the latest. 
</P>
<P>
	Timber sales in the five-state Rocky Mountain region are down 15  
percent to 25 percent because of the paint shortage, forest 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the other nine regions are in ``roughly the same  
ballpark,'' although they could catch up before the end of the 
year, said Ann Bartuska, director of forest management for the 
Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are coping perfectly well,'' she added.  
</P>
<P>
	Some foresters are marking trees the old-fashioned way while  
they wait for the paint -- they are using a hatchet to make notches 
in trees, Bartuska said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency on May 15 stopped using oil-based paint to mark the  
trees it plans to cut down after workers blamed the paint on an 
increase in miscarriages and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bartuska said the transition to water-based paint was more  
difficult than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	There was an explosion at a paint factory, procurement delays by  
the General Services Administration and delays in getting the 
forest workers' union to approve the new paint. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong,'' she said,  
adding that the Forest Service is rushing as much paint out to 
forests at it can. 
</P>
<P>
	Timber sales in South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Wyoming and  
Colorado could be down as much as 51 million board feet this year, 
regional forester Lyle Laverty said in a letter earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	That disclosure prompted a letter last week from six senators to  
Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck. 
</P>
<P>
	``These downfalls are not acceptable,'' the senators from  
Wyoming, South Dakota and Colorado said. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators said they had worked to revive timber sales in  
areas such as the Black Hills National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now a shortage of tree-marking paint threatens to upset all  
those gains,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The paint shortage also will have an impact on California timber  
sales, although it's unclear by how much, spokesman Matt Mathes 
said. Forests that have received the new paint are sharing it with 
those that don't have it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington and Oregon, timber sales are running on schedule  
so far.

<HEADLINE> CNN Waits To Go With Shooting News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The shooting rampage in CNN's home town didn't  
make the cable network's airwaves until after its two all-news 
competitors had gone with the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based CNN said it had conflicting reports about  
Thursday's office building shootings and held out in the interest 
of accuracy. Early reports from MSNBC and Fox News Channel proved 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3:43 p.m. EDT, MSNBC broke the story of the shooting, which  
began shortly after 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at 3:47 p.m., MSNBC cut to a helicopter view of the  
building, located in Atlanta's Buckhead section, courtesy of its 
local affiliate WXIA-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox News Channel followed at 3:50 p.m. Eight minutes later, it  
began airing chopper video from affiliate WAGA-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was 3:57 p.m. before CNN, whose worldwide headquarters is  
a few miles away in downtown Atlanta, gave viewers word of the 
shooting and cut to aerial video from WXIA-TV. CNN is affiliated 
with four Atlanta stations whose live feeds it has permission to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN spokesman David Bittler said the network had been monitoring  
what he termed ``conflicting reports'' from local stations before 
it chose to go with the story. He said there were ``differing 
accounts of the event from our four affiliates,'' including 
different reports about the number of wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our editorial decision was to be accurate with what we went  
with, rather than be concerned with being first,'' Bittler said.

<HEADLINE> 76ers Ready To Sign Snow, Lynch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers are ready to sign two  
of their own free agents, Eric Snow and George Lynch, when the 
NBA's moratorium on trades and signings is lifted Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers planned a conference call for 1:30 p.m. EDT Sunday in  
which general manager Billy King is expected to announce the 
signings, a source close to the negotiations told The Associated 
Press Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Snow  
and Lynch were expected to be on the conference call. A one-month 
ban on trades and free-agent signings ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow, who went from being the fourth guard in Seattle to the  
starting point guard in Philadelphia, is expected to get a 
seven-year deal worth about $29 million. During a recent summer 
camp, Snow said he turned down a better offer from the Toronto 
Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	``On paper they were probably offering more,'' Snow said. ``But  
looking at where it is and the tax aspect, it probably didn't add 
up. ... It was an easy decision to stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snow, who made $840,000 last season, will make about $3 million  
in the first year of the deal. He would fall under the so-called 
Larry Bird exception that allows for maximum raises of 12.5 percent 
a year for free agents resigning with their teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers plan to use their $2 million ``middle class''  
exception to sign Lynch, who made the five-year veteran's minimum 
of $537,500 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia, which made the playoffs for the first time since  
1991 last season, still has to decide whether to re-sign free 
agents Harvey Grant, Jerald Honeycutt, Rick Mahorn and Doug 
Overton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers also are interested in several other free agents, but  
would have to do sign-and-trade deals to get them because they're 
already over the salary cap. Free agents who could be good fits for 
the Sixers include Rodney Rogers and Eric Piatkowski of the 
Clippers, Detlef Schrempf of Seattle and Sam Mack of Houston.

<HEADLINE> Veriato Leads Utah Showdown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Little-known Steve Veriato tamed the Park  
Meadows Golf Club with an 8-under-par 64 Friday to seize the 
first-round lead in the $1.35 million Senior PGA Tour Utah 
Showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Veriato's first round was simply a continuation of his torrid  
play here. He qualified for a spot in the field with a 63 on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former winner Tom Shaw, long-hitting John Jacobs and Leonard  
Thompson shot 65s on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-under were Dave Eichelberger and Terry Dill, followed at 67  
by Alberto Giannone, Fred Gibson, Hale Irwin, Dave Stockton and 
Simon Hobday. Defending champion Gil Morgan was at 6-under on No. 
17 when rain halted play. 
</P>
<P>
	Veriato, whose best finish this year was 29th in the U.S. Senior  
Open, had three birdies on the front nine and five on the back in a 
bogey-free round. 
</P>
<P>
	``This course suits my game,'' Veriato said. ``But I think my  
talent has something to do with it. Everything seemed to gel today 
and I was very patient, especially at the start when I wasn't 
making anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of Vertiao's birdie putts came within 15 feet. He was the  
first player off the tee and avoided a lightning delay early in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``This course is in excellent shape and you can't help but make  
a few putts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs shot a front-nine 31 and seemed poised to charge into the  
lead, only to have weather interfere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came back out on the 13th hole and my tempo wasn't there,''  
Jacobs said. ``Of course, anything can happen here. A player can be 
behind five or six shots on Sunday and still make a run at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a bogey on the par-5 15th, Jacobs managed to pull his game  
together for the final three holes, making birdie putts of 30, 10 
and 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, the 1989 Utah Showdown winner, had eight birdies and a  
lone bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The delay didn't bother me at all,'' Shaw said. ``I just  
picked up right where I left off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The threesome of Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino and Arnold Palmer  
drew a gallery of over 20,000.

<HEADLINE> State Dep't Denies Impeding Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department denied Friday that its  
officials impeded U.S. law enforcement agents from apprehending two 
suspects being held by Sudanese authorities in the 1998 U.S. 
embassy bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	According to MSNBC, which first reported the story, and The New  
York Times, Sudanese officials last Aug. 8 arrested two men who 
were believed linked to the bombings, which occurred the day before 
in Kenya and Tanzania. The bombings killed more than 250 people, 
including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times account said White House and State Department  
officials were adamantly opposed to reopening relations with Sudan 
because of its alleged terrorist links and ``this reticence 
prompted them last August to discount the Sudanese offer of 
assistance in the investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC said the State Department ``refused to allow an FBI team  
to travel to the Sudanese capital to discuss apprehending the 
suspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Sudan released the two suspects after American  
cruise missiles struck a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan two weeks 
after the bombing. The plant was suspected of involvement in the 
efforts of Osama bin Laden, a reputed Saudi exile terrorist, to 
produce the deadly nerve gas VX. The owner of the plant has denied 
it was involved in any effort to produce nerve gas. 
</P>
<P>
	David Leavy, a White House spokesman, said ``no one at the White  
House knows anything'' about the FBI being blocked by another 
government agency in its efforts to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, spokesman Philip Reeker said the news  
accounts were ``fundamentally inaccurate'' and added that the State 
Department and the FBI have had a cooperative relationship on the 
issue all along. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reach the Sudanese Embassy for comment were  
unsuccessful.

<HEADLINE> Leyritz May Go Back To Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Jim Leyritz is on the verge of going back to  
the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz, who's hit clutch postseason home runs for both the  
Yankees and the San Diego Padres, could be dealt from San Diego to 
New York by Saturday night's deadline, several people familiar with 
the talks said Friday night on the condition they not be 
identified. The Padres would probably get a prospect or two in 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres general manager Kevin Towers would say only that trading  
Leyritz remained a possibility. Sources said Leyritz apparently 
asked the Padres to send him to New York, where he played from 
1990-96. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that could be a precursor to a Leyritz trade and maybe  
a deal for a third baseman, the Padres activated Leyritz from the 
15-day disabled list Friday night and designated third baseman 
George Arias for assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been known practically all season that the Padres would  
consider trading Leyritz, who loves the postseason spotlight, to a 
contender for prospects, and possibly re-signing him as a free 
agent after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very good possibility,'' Leyritz said before Friday  
night's game. ``Even if something does happen, I've got no 
bitterness. What they've done for me here is great. From a family 
standpoint I'd love to stay here, but I understand it's a 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz has 12 career postseason hits, and seven are homers. He  
helped change the course of the 1996 World Series with a three-run 
shot off Atlanta's Mark Wohlers in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz hit four homers in the playoffs last year, three against  
Houston in the division series and one against Atlanta as the 
Padres won the NL pennant. The Yankees swept the Padres in the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz broke a bone in his left hand at Los Angeles on June 23,  
clearing the way for the Padres to promote rookie Ben Davis, their 
top non-pitching prospect. Davis has been impressive not only with 
his defense, but brought a .324 average into Friday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time Leyritz was hurt, the Padres were in the midst of a  
14-game winning streak that got them back into contention. But 
after losing seven straight games, they went into Friday night's 
game seven games behind NL West leader Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres traded catcher Greg Myers to Atlanta on Monday for a  
minor league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres want to upgrade at third. Arias struggled in his  
second chance as a big league starter. He took over at third after 
Ken Caminiti returned to the Houston Astros as a free agent after 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed 24 of the first 27 games due to a thumb injury and  
struggled at the plate. He was batting .244 with seven homers and 
20 RBIs in 55 games.

<HEADLINE> Astronomer May Be Buried on Moon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Colleagues of a late researcher noted for his  
expertise on outer-space collisions came up with an astronomical 
way to honor his memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming all goes to plan, a vial carrying an ounce of Eugene  
Shoemaker's ashes will slam into a moon crater at 3,800 mph early 
Saturday, riding shotgun along NASA's Lunar Prospector science 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the very first human inhabitant of Earth to be laid to  
rest on another celestial body,'' said Carolyn Porco, a University 
of Arizona professor and Shoemaker's college on NASA's Voyager 
expeditions. ``That's very significant because it says we have 
arrived at our place in the solar system, the solar system is our 
own and it's beckoning us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Ms. Porco who spearheaded the tribute effort and designed  
an epigraph that accompanies the ashes of Shoemaker, who died two 
years ago in a car crash while crater-hunting in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Credited along with his wife for the discovery of about 20  
comets and 800 asteroids, Shoemaker gained worldwide fame as a 
co-discoverer of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 that slammed into Jupiter 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunar Prospector was expected to hit the moon at 5:52 a.m. EDT.  
</P>
<P>
	David Morse, spokesman for NASA's Ames Research Center, called  
the memorial ``a special honor for a special human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoemaker, a geologist by training, applied to be an astronaut  
in the 1960s but was rejected because of a medical problem. He 
later worked on several U.S. space missions, including the Apollo 
missions to the moon. He taught Apollo astronauts about craters. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoemaker said shortly before his death the biggest  
disappointment in his life was ``not going to the moon and banging 
on it with my own hammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Grown men have told me they've been moved to tears when they  
heard this story, of the man who wanted so badly to go to the 
moon,'' Ms. Porco said. ``Through no fault of his own he was taken 
out of the running. Thirty years later, he finally will get 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA officials expect the polycarbonate vial containing  
Shoemaker's remains to pulverize on impact with the wall of the 
crater. 
</P>
<P>
	``If all goes well, it may literally be buried,'' said Lisa  
Chu-Thielbar, Prospector outreach coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Shoemaker's ashes may rise in a cloud of soil and,  
perhaps, water vapor -- the focus of the Lunar Prospector's 
swan-song experiment. NASA will use the Hubble Space Telescope to 
try to detect water from lunar ice in the plume created by 
Prospector's impact. 
</P>
<P>
	The cylindrical container that carries Shoemaker's remains was  
manufactured by Celestis Inc., a Houston company that has used 
commercial rockets to launch into space the cremated remains of 55 
people, including Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and 1960s drug 
guru Timothy Leary. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoemaker's wife, Carolyn, attended the launch of Prospector on  
Jan. 6, 1998, with her children and grandchildren. At the time, she 
said her husband would have been thrilled about having his ashes 
rest forever on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be the man in the moon to us,'' Mrs. Shoemaker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Porco's epigraph, a laser-etched piece of brass foil, is  
wrapped around the vial containing Shoemaker's remains. It depicts 
Meteor Crater near his home in Flagstaff, Ariz., and the Hale-Bopp 
comet. 
</P>
<P>
	It also has these lines from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet:  
</P>
<P>
	``And, when he shall die,  
</P>
<P>
	Take him and cut him out in little stars,  
</P>
<P>
	And he will make the face of heaven so fine  
</P>
<P>
	That all the world will be in love with night,  
</P>
<P>
	And pay no worship to the garish sun.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says 9 Dead in Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- U.S. and British warplanes attacked several  
sites in northern and southern Iraq on Friday, killing nine people 
and wounding 23 others, the Iraqi armed forces said. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. military statement confirmed the strikes in the north,  
saying U.S. warplanes bombed Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery sites in 
response to anti-aircraft fire. There was no independent 
confirmation of the reported strikes in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Iraqi News Agency quoted the Iraqi military as  
saying that 11 enemy formations carried out 24 sorties over the 
northern provinces of Dohuk, Irbil and Mosul, striking ``civil and 
service installations.'' It said six people were killed and 21 were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	INA quoted the military as saying in a statement that allied  
planes also attacked a number of ``our civil and service 
installations'' in the southern province of Najaf, 105 miles south 
of Baghdad, killing three people and injuring two. 
</P>
<P>
	The warplanes, confronted by Iraqi air defenses, were ``forced  
to flee our skies'' to their bases in Turkey, Kuwait and Saudi 
Arabia, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the third time in two weeks that Iraq has reported  
fatalities in airstrikes by allied planes patrolling no-fly zones 
in northern and southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported 14 deaths on July 18 and eight deaths on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The zone in the north was established shortly after the 1991  
Persian Gulf War to protect the rebelling Kurdish minority from 
government air raids. The no-fly zone in the south was set up in 
1992 to protect Shiite Muslims who defied President Saddam 
Hussein's rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq does not recognize the zones and has challenged the allied  
planes patrolling them since Dec. 28.

<HEADLINE> Carter Now Does Tackling for Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Marty Carter has made more than 1,000  
tackles in his NFL career. The one he remembers most of all doesn't 
count on his resume. 
</P>
<P>
	The year was 1991. Carter was an unknown rookie safety for the  
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, getting a chance to start for the first time 
in an exhibition game against the Atlanta Falcons at old Fulton 
County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Deion Sanders, beginning his tenure as a two-way star, lined up  
at receiver for the Falcons. Surely he's just a decoy, Carter 
muttered to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, he was facing one of the most dreaded moments for a  
defensive back: Neon Deion grabbed a pass, broke free in the 
secondary and seemingly had a clear path to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deion started to do his strut, and I collared him from behind  
at the 2-yard line,'' Carter said Friday, relishing the moment 
again nearly eight years later. ``I like to say I ran him down. 
I've still got a tape of that play. My son watches it almost every 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the 29-year-old Carter will get a chance to make  
those kind of plays for the Falcons instead of against them. He 
signed as a free agent after establishing himself as a sure-handed 
tackler during four years in Tampa Bay and the last four with 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy's a headhunter,'' Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan  
said. ``Me, I hit when I have to. He goes around looking for 
someone to hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is a homecoming for Carter, who played at LaGrange High  
School -- a.k.a. The Cradle of Defensive Backs -- and now lives in 
the Atlanta suburb of Marietta. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was happier when Carter signed a five-year deal with the  
Falcons than his mother, Ellen Dunlap, who still lives in LaGrange. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I told her, I could hear a thump on the other end of the  
phone line,'' Carter recalled, chuckling. ``I said, `What 
happened?' She said, `I just fell off the sofa.''' 
</P>
<P>
	His mother was hesitant to make the long trip to Chicago, and  
she downright refused to attend games on frigid winter days at 
Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``She would just stay in the apartment and fix dinner for me  
when I got home,'' Carter said, knowing his mother plans to be on 
hand for every game at the always-72-degrees Georgia Dome, located 
about an hour's drive from LaGrange. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter is one of at least four defensive backs from LaGrange  
High who've made it to the NFL. Tony Stargill came before him, 
Tyrone Poole and Walt Harris followed. A fifth, rookie Jason Bray, 
is getting a free-agent tryout with the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	``In LaGrange, it was kind of instilled in us at a young age  
that you've got to play football around here,'' Carter remembered. 
``We had a better weight program than most colleges at that time. 
When Tony made it and then I made it, it kind of gave the guys 
under us some incentive that it can be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1, 210-pound Carter has been one of the NFL's  
fiercest tackles, a de facto linebacker who's averaged almost 160 
stops in each of the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he wants to make it clear than he can also handle the  
coverage duties required of a strong safety. The Falcons aren't 
convinced yet, pulling Carter off the field during passing 
situations in the opening days of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early on, I had to come up to play the run a lot and I got  
labeled as a run defender,'' Carter said. ``I don't shy away from 
contact. I like to play the run. But it's not a one-dimensional 
thing. I like to do all the things a deep defensive back needs to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That includes talking. Carter was a vocal leader in Chicago and  
he's trying to make himself heard in the Falcons secondary, though 
that's not an easy task with teammates like Buchanan and Eugene 
Robinson, two of the NFL's all-star chatterboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We play a style of defense where the safety on the right side  
has to control his side,'' Carter said. ``So I get in a couple of 
words when I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Friday's practice, he barked out commands to his  
teammates several times, drawing a compliment from Buchanan for his 
vocal skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Communication is big in the secondary,'' Buchanan said. ``He's  
doing a great job with a new team.''

<HEADLINE> Man Found Guilty of Killing Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A Maryland man was convicted of murdering  
his infant son 12 years ago in a case that was first believed to be 
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrett Eldred Wilson, 43, a former piano salesman, has been  
charged with killing two of his children to collect $190,000 in 
life insurance money and is scheduled to stand trial later this 
summer for the suffocation death of a daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	He was found guilty Thursday of the 1987 smothering death of his  
5-month-old son and faces possible life in prison with no chance of 
parole when he's sentenced Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the verdict came, he was heaving. It was almost like  
someone hit you in the stomach and took your breath away,'' said 
defense attorney Barry Helfand. He said an appeal is likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson received $150,000 in life insurance benefits after his  
son's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of Garrett Michael Wilson was ruled a case of SIDS  
until the child's mother went to the police in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this has helped the nation realize what's happening to  
children,'' said Mary ``Missy'' Anastasi, the dead child's mother, 
who was Wilson's third wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Anastasi, 45, first expressed her suspicions that her former  
husband killed their son on the morning the boy was pronounced 
dead. In 1994, she persuaded Montgomery County police to 
investigate the case. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 9-day trial, jurors reviewed evidence from the death  
of Garrett Michael and the death six years earlier of Wilson's baby 
daughter from a previous marriage. They heard from nearly 30 
witnesses, including five forensic pathologists. 
</P>
<P>
	``They understood that SIDS is not genetic, and they rendered a  
proper verdict in two hours,'' said Montgomery County State's 
Attorney Douglas Gansler. The deaths of both babies were originally 
considered cases of SIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson faces trial Sept. 14 in Prince George's County, Md., for  
the 1981 death of Brandi Jean Wilson, his daughter from his second 
marriage. If Wilson is sentenced to life in prison with no chance 
of parole for the murder of his son, Prince George's prosecutors 
could elect to not try the second case. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of the 2-month-old girl was reclassified in 1998 as  
probable suffocation by undetermined means. Prosecutors said Wilson 
received $40,000 from life-insurance policies he purchased from two 
different companies within six weeks of her birth.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Eases Proposed NASA Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Appropriations Committee voted  
Friday to ease proposed cuts in NASA's budget but left the space 
agency well short of what President Clinton wants for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's extra $400 million was part of an effort by majority  
Republicans to bolster support for a massive $92 billion measure 
financing veterans, housing, space and environment programs for the 
coming fiscal year. The panel also boosted spending for veterans' 
health care by $700 million, responding to pressure from veterans' 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one step in the process,'' said Rep. James Walsh,  
R-N.Y., alluding to even bigger spending increases expected to 
emerge from budget bargaining this fall with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the overall bill, which passed by voice vote, faces an  
administration veto threat for its reductions in space, housing and 
other programs. Though the added funds would bring NASA's 2000 
budget to about $12.7 billion, that remains $1 billion below this 
year's budget and $900 million short of Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appeal to members of Congress to fully restore the  
president's budget,'' NASA administrator Daniel Goldin said in a 
written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The added NASA money would go to projects including Mars  
exploration and a planned orbiting infrared telescope, which an 
earlier version of the bill had cut. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA officials, who earlier had said the agency's Jet Propulsion  
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and Goddard Space Flight Center in 
Greenbelt, Md., might be in jeopardy of closing, said they did not 
yet know whether the threat remains with the new numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for the space and veterans increases, the committee voted  
by voice to kill the Americorps national service program, cut 
disaster relief funds and shift money from a separate $300 billion 
bill financing labor, health and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also removed controversial emergency designations  
for $5.5 billion worth of spending for veterans and disaster 
relief. The emergency label lets Congress ignore required spending 
limits and pay for items with the anticipated federal budget 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor, health and education measure --the biggest of all 13  
annual spending bills, and the last to be written -- won't begin 
moving through committee until September. The $4 billion shifted 
out of it Friday left the measure almost $20 billion short of what 
Clinton wants for those social programs and only intensified 
Democratic opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking it from kids in Head Start,'' said Rep. Steny  
Hoyer, D-Md. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walsh, chief author of the space and veterans' bill, said,  
``We'll meet the obligations of the country, but in a conservative 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To help pay for the labor, health and education bill,  
Republicans are considering another budget gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
	They would delay some federal Medicaid payments to the states  
from late September 2000 into early October, said aides speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	That timing shift would push the expenditure out of the books  
for fiscal year 2000 and into 2001, which begins Oct. 1. That would 
allow Republicans to claim savings next year of several billion 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier, the committee used successive party-line votes to  
hold fast to its prior decision to label the $4.5 billion cost of 
the 2000 census an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said unless they did so, FBI agents would have to be  
laid off and 80 U.S. embassies closed. Democratic efforts first to 
remove the emergency label for the entire $4.5 billion, and then 
for a portion of it, lost by 30-26 and 32-26. 
</P>
<P>
	That fight came as the panel used a voice vote to approve a  
$37.7 billion measure financing the departments of justice, state 
and commerce for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	White House advisers have threatened a veto because the  
legislation cuts Clinton's requests for hiring police officers, 
legal aid for the poor, U.S. participation in international

<HEADLINE> Army Expands Junior ROTC Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is expanding its Junior ROTC program  
at a time when the number of Americans who have served in the 
military has dropped to an all-time low, Army Secretary Louis 
Caldera said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The program expansion ``is not principally meant as a recruiting  
tool,'' Caldera said at a news conference. ``But it's important as 
fewer and fewer Americans ever have served in uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JROTC, founded in 1916, offers programs at 1,370 high schools in  
all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Caldera said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has approved the Army's plan to expand the program to  
50 additional high schools every year for the next five years, for 
a total of 1,620 high schools. Half of all JROTC cadets are women 
and 40 percent pursue careers or reserve duty in the military, 
Caldera said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Congress will let us do more, we'll do more,'' Caldera  
said. The government pays for uniforms and equipment and the 
schools match the cost of the $100 million annual program, 
primarily by paying salaries for instructors, all of whom are 
retired officers and noncommissioned officers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program's expansion ``will make an important difference in  
the lives of thousands and thousands of young people,'' said 
retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	JROTC teaches the 230,000 young people involved in the program  
to believe in themselves and that hard work and an education will 
get them ahead in life, he said.

<HEADLINE>  Cowboys Give Spellman Second Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Alonzo Spellman convinced the Dallas  
Cowboys he's overcome a horrible stretch during which he lost his 
job, his marriage and, at times, his battle with a mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's got to prove it.  
</P>
<P>
	Spellman participated in his first workout with the Cowboys  
today and said afterward that he is excited about the chance to 
play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great opportunity for me to come back and do some good  
things on the field,'' he said. ``I can't wait to get started. It 
feels great to get back on the field. I'm just ready to keep on 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys on Thursday signed Spellman, a defensive end who  
missed all of last season, to a one-year, $400,000 contract with 
another $450,000 in incentives. He did not receive a signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represented to me that he would do anything and everything  
it takes to be a productive player on our team,'' team owner Jerry 
Jones said. ``We've represented to him he has a genuine shot of 
making our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 292-pound Spellman was a first-round pick by the  
Chicago Bears in 1992 and an anchor on their defensive line for 
several seasons before being limited by injuries in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, from March to September 1998, he lost his job and his  
marriage as he struggled to control bipolar disorder, a mental 
disorder that is treatable by medication but can lead to manic 
behavior if pills aren't taken. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys have been talking to Spellman since October. Jones  
said the team conducted an extensive background check and he 
personally did a lot of research before deciding to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident this will work,'' Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dallas has a lack of depth and experience on its defensive line,  
especially with tackle Leon Lett indefinitely suspend for drug 
problems. The only way for Jones to bring in someone of Spellman's 
caliber for such a cheap price is by taking what many would 
consider a big risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``You weigh the positives and negatives of any player that's out  
there right now that could possibly come to your team, whether it's 
Alonzo Spellman or anybody else,'' coach Chan Gailey said. ``I 
don't think we're down to the bare necessities, grabbing at 
anything that might show up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey, a devout man, said he believes second chances ``are part  
of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm much more interested in the present and the future of a  
person than condemning somebody forever for the past,'' Gailey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spellman's problems began when he barricaded himself for eight  
hours inside the home of his publicist. SWAT negotiators couldn't 
talk him into coming out, but former Bears star Mike Singletary 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	Spellman was hospitalized that night, but the next day he walked  
out of the building into freezing weather without wearing a shirt 
or shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Other incidents included:  
</P>
<P>
	--Detroit police using pepper spray to subdue him from attacking  
hotel security guards who were trying to break up a fight between 
two women who were with Spellman. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Bears releasing him two years into a four-year, $11.6  
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	--Getting pulled over for erratic driving, which led to his  
arrest for having in the car a semiautomatic handgun and a bullet 
in a gun case and a half-empty wine bottle, and for driving with a 
revoked license. 
</P>
<P>
	--Getting evicted from his home.  
</P>
<P>
	--Being awaken by police from a nap in his car in the fast lane  
on an interstate highway. Officers said that when they woke him, he 
didn't seem to know where he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Remnants of that ruinous period remain. He faces an Aug. 19  
court date in Michigan for a felony charge of carrying a concealed 
weapon and misdemeanor charges for having open alcohol in a vehicle 
and driving without a license. If convicted, he faces up to five 
years in prison on the weapon charge and up to 90 days in jail on 
the misdemeanor charges.

<HEADLINE> FTC Wants Online Pharmacies Watched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To help state authorities monitor how well  
online pharmacies are complying with the law, the Federal Trade 
Commission wants Congress to force Internet sites that sell 
prescription drugs to disclose more information about their 
businesses and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	In making the recommendations, the FTC recognized the limits of  
its own authority in monitoring online pharmacies and the 
challenges state officials face because of jurisdictional problems 
and the lack of adequate identifying information on the Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``State authorities appear to have laws that are substantively  
adequate to stop irresponsible prescribing and dispensing of drugs 
via the Internet,'' Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau 
of Consumer Protection, said. ``The real challenge lies in dealing 
with the logistical difficulties of identifying responsible parties 
and enforcing laws across states boundaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein was to testify today before the House Commerce  
subcommittee on oversight and investigations about the need for new 
laws covering Internet pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC says the sites should contain the name, address and  
phone number of the pharmacy that will dispense the drugs and where 
that pharmacy is licensed to do business. Similar information also 
should be provided about physicians who prescribe drugs over the 
Internet, as well as the states where that physician is licensed or 
authorized to practice medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	There should also be information about any Internet operator --  
separate from the doctor or pharmacy -- that is offering the drugs 
for sale, including the principal owners of the business. 
</P>
<P>
	The site should tell consumers the states from which it will  
accept orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission says such disclosures are needed because of the  
new problems posed by Internet pharmacies, even as consumers enjoy 
the cost-savings and convenience. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a consumer might go to a Web site and have an  
online consultation with an unknown doctor who then prescribes 
drugs for the pharmacy to dispense. 
</P>
<P>
	Prescriptions could be issued without adequate review of a  
patient's medical history, posing serious health threats, Bernstein 
said.

	It is illegal for doctors to prescribe for patients in a state  
where they are not licensed to practice. Licensed doctors also must 
meet standards of care that in most states require a patient 
relationship to prescribe drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some online pharmacies stress they operate with the same  
standards as a traditional pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers at drugstore.com, for example, must already have  
prescriptions from their doctors, which must be either mailed or 
faxed to the store, said Peter Neupert, the company's president and 
chief executive officer.

<P>
	``We must be careful to distinguish between safe, legitimate  
online pharmacies and profiteers using the Internet to engage in 
illegal activities with willing participants,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the company has applied for approval from an  
online certification program established by the National 
Association of Boards of Pharmacy.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Give Spellman Second Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Alonzo Spellman convinced the Dallas  
Cowboys he's overcome a horrible stretch during which he lost his 
job, his marriage and, at times, his battle with a mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's got to prove it.  
</P>
<P>
	Spellman participated in his first workout with the Cowboys  
today and said afterward that he is excited about the chance to 
play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great opportunity for me to come back and do some good  
things on the field,'' he said. ``I can't wait to get started. It 
feels great to get back on the field. I'm just ready to keep on 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys on Thursday signed Spellman, a defensive end who  
missed all of last season, to a one-year, $400,000 contract with 
another $450,000 in incentives. He did not receive a signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represented to me that he would do anything and everything  
it takes to be a productive player on our team,'' team owner Jerry 
Jones said. ``We've represented to him he has a genuine shot of 
making our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 292-pound Spellman was a first-round pick by the  
Chicago Bears in 1992 and an anchor on their defensive line for 
several seasons before being limited by injuries in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, from March to September 1998, he lost his job and his  
marriage as he struggled to control bipolar disorder, a mental 
disorder that is treatable by medication but can lead to manic 
behavior if pills aren't taken. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys have been talking to Spellman since October. Jones  
said the team conducted an extensive background check and he 
personally did a lot of research before deciding to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident this will work,'' Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dallas has a lack of depth and experience on its defensive line,  
especially with tackle Leon Lett indefinitely suspend for drug 
problems. The only way for Jones to bring in someone of Spellman's 
caliber for such a cheap price is by taking what many would 
consider a big risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``You weigh the positives and negatives of any player that's out  
there right now that could possibly come to your team, whether it's 
Alonzo Spellman or anybody else,'' coach Chan Gailey said. ``I 
don't think we're down to the bare necessities, grabbing at 
anything that might show up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey, a devout man, said he believes second chances ``are part  
of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm much more interested in the present and the future of a  
person than condemning somebody forever for the past,'' Gailey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spellman's problems began when he barricaded himself for eight  
hours inside the home of his publicist. SWAT negotiators couldn't 
talk him into coming out, but former Bears star Mike Singletary 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	Spellman was hospitalized that night, but the next day he walked  
out of the building into freezing weather without wearing a shirt 
or shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Other incidents included:  
</P>
<P>
	--Detroit police using pepper spray to subdue him from attacking  
hotel security guards who were trying to break up a fight between 
two women who were with Spellman. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Bears releasing him two years into a four-year, $11.6  
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	--Getting pulled over for erratic driving, which led to his  
arrest for having in the car a semiautomatic handgun and a bullet 
in a gun case and a half-empty wine bottle, and for driving with a 
revoked license. 
</P>
<P>
	--Getting evicted from his home.  
</P>
<P>
	--Being awaken by police from a nap in his car in the fast lane  
on an interstate highway. Officers said that when they woke him, he 
didn't seem to know where he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Remnants of that ruinous period remain. He faces an Aug. 19  
court date in Michigan for a felony charge of carrying a concealed 
weapon and misdemeanor charges for having open alcohol in a vehicle 
and driving without a license. If convicted, he faces up to five 
years in prison on the weapon charge and up to 90 days in jail on 
the misdemeanor charges.

<HEADLINE> Non-Panama Presence Hurts Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The phasing out of U.S. military bases in  
Panama is robbing the United States of an irreplaceable weapon in 
its battle against U.S.-bound drug shipments from South America. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a key conclusion of a retired Army general and  
Republican lawmakers who spoke Thursday at a House International 
Relations Committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Panama is critical to counterdrug efforts,'' said retired Gen.  
George A. Joulwan, who once led all U.S. military operations in 
Latin America. He said losing the U.S. military infrastructure in 
Panama will affect the U.S. ability to prosecute the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Panama Canal treaties, the United States has until the  
end of the year to terminate all military operations in Panama -- a 
process that is well under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., said the authors of  
the 1979 treaties ``could not have foreseen neighboring Colombia's 
drug-fueled agony, nor the sophistication of the drug cartels' 
corrupting criminal reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman said the United States should not have put itself in the  
position of closing Howard Air Force Base, from which 15,000 
military flights had taken off annually, many of them tracking 
planes carrying cocaine and heroin to U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	With the May closure of Howard AFB, the administration has been  
conducting surveillance flights from airfields in the Netherlands 
Antilles and also plans similar flights from Ecuador and a Central 
American country yet to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said these new sites more than  
compensate for the loss of Panama, saying official analyses show 
the locations will be able to handle up to 120 percent of the 
traffic that Panama had been handling. 
</P>
<P>
	But a 28-page report, based on a trip by a seven-member  
congressional staff delegation, said that even when the new 
arrangement becomes fully operational, it ``will not replicate the 
mission capacity in Panama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The closure of Howard AFB has significantly decreased the  
ability of the U.S. to provide airborne counterdrug surveillance in 
the source region,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation recommended that the administration act on  
comments by Panamanian President-elect Mireya Moscoso and explore a 
continued U.S. presence at key facilities in Panama. She will take 
office Sept. 1.

<HEADLINE>  13 More Major League Umps Purged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After spending their careers ejecting players,  
13 National League umpires found themselves tossed out. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unprecedented purge precipitated by a labor strategy that  
backfired, 13 NL umps lost their jobs Thursday, meaning one-third 
of major league umps will depart Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe West, famous for slamming pitcher Dennis Cook to the ground  
in 1990, and Eric Gregg, criticized for a wide strike zone in the 
1997 playoffs, were among those let go, management officials said, 
speaking on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hallion, suspended for three games earlier this month for  
bumping a player and coach, will be forced to leave, too, along 
with crew chiefs Frank Pulli and Terry Tata, who have each spent 
more than 25 years in the major leagues and worked four World 
Series apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are some of the finest umpires in the history of this  
game,'' union head Richie Phillips said. ``Terry Tata has worked 
many, many important games. What they're saying is that an umpire 
who has never even worked a spring training game in his life is 
more fit to umpire in the major leagues than Terry Tata. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the conduct of major league baseball is reprehensible  
and oppressive. What they've really done here is attempt to execute 
surrendered prisoners. I absolutely vow to fight to the death in 
this case, and I will never, ever rest until I right this wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine AL umpires were told Monday that their resignations were  
accepted. That means 22 of the 68 major league umpires are 
departing. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulli, 64, has been a member of the NL staff since 1972. He was  
planning to retire after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a slap in the face. This is what I deserve after 28  
years?'' Pulli said from Pittsburgh, where he was to work the 
Florida-Pirates game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to go to war,'' he said. ``This is the biggest favor  
they ever did for this union. These guys will come together, I 
guarantee you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many NL umpires were angry with commissioner Bud Selig and Sandy  
Alderson, the vice president of baseball operations in the 
commissioner's office, saying the moves were made over the 
objection of NL president Len Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a plan by Bud Selig and Sandy Alderson to break the  
union,'' NL umpire Steve Rippley said, adding that the firings have 
made him consider retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Many umpires spent the day wondering if they'd be kept or let  
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting since 6:30 this morning, calling people and  
getting phone calls,'' NL ump Dana DeMuth said in Los Angeles 
before the Dodgers played Cincinnati. ``And from that time on, our 
hearts have been jumping. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're standing here with our heads in a guillotine, and the  
blade is right here,'' he said, holding his hand behind his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	He survived, but also let go were Gary Darling, Bob Davidson,  
Bruce Dreckman, Bill Hohn, Sam Holbrook, Paul Nauert, Larry Poncino 
and Larry Vanover. 
</P>
<P>
	Ability, diversity and experience were among the factors used to  
make the decisions, several management officials said, all speaking 
on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has pushed to increase minority hiring in recent years  
and didn't want to decrease the percentage of minority umpires. 
Baseball also had to be careful not to accept the resignations of 
too many of the union's leaders, because that would open the sport 
to a charge of illegal retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips promised he will file a ``massive, massive unfair labor  
practice charge,'' and hoped to it by Monday. He cited a clause in 
the labor agreement barring ``discrimination or recrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL umpire Jerry Crawford, the union president, said the actions  
were ``illegal, reprehensible and immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 14, the day following the All-Star game, most umpires  
resigned effective Sept. 2, thinking the tactic would force an 
early start to negotiations for a new labor contract. The current 
deal expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than a dozen umpires refused to resign and baseball  
hired 25 replacements from Triple-A, effective Sept. 1. The umpires 
let go sent a letter Tuesday withdrawing the resignations, but 
baseball said it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, in anticipation of baseball's moves, umpires sued  
in federal court in Philadelphia. Their attempt to gain a 
restraining order was denied by U.S. District Judge Edmund V. 
Ludwig, but a hearing on the case will be scheduled after Aug. 12, 
Ludwig's office said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Prolonged Dry Spell Hits Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A prolonged dry spell has seized the Northeast, withering crops,  
feeding forest fires and sucking rivers and lakes so dry that 
Baltimore has only a month's worth of drinking water in its 
reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland declared the first drought emergency in its history  
Thursday, joining Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware and scores of 
communities in urging people and businesses to curb water use. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saharan summer is so worrisome that forecasters are rooting  
for a tropical storm. Better yet, two. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could send the remnants of a hurricane over us for a day  
or two, that would be nice. That's pretty much what it would take 
to bring a quick end to the drought,'' said Matt Belk, a 
meteorologist in Charleston, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The water level in Maryland's Liberty Reservoir is 24 feet below  
average, with less than half its capacity of 43 billion gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect this drought to get worse before we see serious  
relief,'' Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, which has received just 58 percent of normal rainfall  
in June and July, has 35 days of water immediately on hand, though 
the city can tap the Susquehanna River to serve customers through 
early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since 1988 has the Northeast had a widespread drought this  
severe. Weather watchers say if it worsens, it could rival the 
awful five-year drought of the early 1960s. In several places, it 
already has: Maryland is seeing its worst drought in 30 years. In 
northern Virginia, meteorologists went back to the 1930s to find 
drier weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Blame El Nino's sister, La Nina. Cooler waters in the equatorial  
Pacific help push weather patterns off kilter. Wetter weather has 
ended up in Minnesota and Michigan instead of Pennsylvania and New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last 365 days, rainfall is down 7 to 15 inches in many  
places. So far in June and July, New York City has gotten 1.03 
inches of rain, 14 percent of normal. Providence has 1.02 inches 
(17 percent), Philadelphia 2.38 (31 percent), Buffalo, N.Y., 2.83 
inches (45 percent), and Portland, Maine, 2.58 (41 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Worst hit are the farmers. Officials in Pennsylvania, New  
Jersey, Maryland, West Virginia and parts of Ohio might seek 
federal disaster declarations, which trigger low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember a summer this bad,'' said Sal Colasurdo,  
owner of Mill Rock Farms, a 75-acre blueberry farm in Hammonton, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about bad timing: John Davis picked this summer to try to  
save some money for college by -- no joke -- landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had known this was going happen, I would not have gotten  
into this business,'' said Davis as he clipped hedges in Ephrata on 
Thursday, a rare day of work in a summer when most bushes and lawns 
are barely alive, let alone requiring cutting. ``There's nothing to 
do.''

<HEADLINE> Dan Marino Reports for 17th Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- It's a Miami Dolphins tradition, like the  
pre-game invocation, Don Shula tributes and a lousy running attack. 
When Dan Marino reports to training camp, cameras cluster around 
his locker and he speaks optimistically about the team's chances of 
winning the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual ritual was repeated Friday. Marino is 0-for-16, walks  
with a limp and could easily opt for the hottest trend in 
professional sports -- retirement. But he'd rather try again for an 
NFL title. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why you're playing -- to have a chance to win a  
championship,'' he said. ``My position is no different from anybody 
else in this locker room. If it is different, they probably won't 
be here long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He turns 38 in September, so the ritual -- like Marino -- may be  
on its last legs. But he's back for his 17th training camp, and the 
way things are going around the NFL, that's big news. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Sanders retired this week at age 31. John Elway quit in  
April at 38. But while they can start working on their Hall of Fame 
speeches, Marino will stick with a familiar refrain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody on the team is real excited,'' he said. ``This is  
the time of year you have to be. We just have to work hard and turn 
it loose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino admits this could be his last chance. Despite poor  
mobility because of nine operations on his knees, right ankle and 
right Achilles' tendon, he has started 44 consecutive games. But he 
realizes retirement could be a sack away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to play as long as I possibly can, but who knows?''  
Marino said. ``At this point in my career you have to take it one 
year at a time. You never know what your health situation and 
circumstances around the team are going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Elway's retirement, Marino is the lone active quarterback  
remaining from the esteemed Class of 1983. Todd Blackledge quit in 
1989, Tony Eason in 1990, Ken O'Brien in 1993 and Jim Kelly in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Each was a first-round draft pick. Only Elway won an NFL title.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins lost in the Super Bowl in 1984, Marino's second  
season, and haven't been back since. Jimmy Johnson touts this 
year's team as by far the best in his four years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last couple of years we've had more talent and higher  
expectations,'' Marino said. ``We'll just have to see what 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Marino's 47-page biography in the Miami media guide notes, he  
holds 25 NFL passing records, including career marks for touchdowns 
(408), yardage (58,913) and completions (4,763). 
</P>
<P>
	His right arm shows few concessions to age. Last year, despite  
Johnson's efforts to emphasize the run over the pass, Marino ranked 
seventh in the NFL in touchdowns (23) and yardage (3,497). 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really see any letup,'' said receiver Tony Martin, who  
was with the Dolphins in 1990-93 and rejoined them this year. 
``He's still throwing the ball with a lot of velocity and still has 
that quick release, and you still have to get your head turned 
around if you don't want it knocked off. He's telling the receivers 
all the time, `I want to see your head spin around like Linda Blair 
in `The Exorcist.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Throwing footballs is still fun, but Marino admits the drudgery  
of training camp becomes more difficult each year. He stood in the 
hot sun for four hours Friday, occasionally taking a snap and often 
looking bored. 
</P>
<P>
	Practice finally ended, and Marino walked swiftly off the field,  
hoping he's headed for the Super Bowl.

<HEADLINE> British Newspaper Deal Worth $1.98B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Trinity is buying Mirror Group for $1.98 billion  
in stock and cash in a deal that will create the largest regional 
newspaper company in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal marks the climax in a takeover battle for Mirror,  
publisher of the tabloid Daily Mirror. The new company, to be 
called Trinity Mirror, will own 155 newspapers and have a weekly 
circulation of more than 15.3 million and a daily circulation of 
2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merged group will have enhanced scale and financial  
strength providing a strong platform for future expansion,'' 
Trinity chairman Peter Birch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is expected to yield annual cost savings of $24  
million by the end of 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity chief executive Phil Graf will become head of the new  
group, while Trinity's finance director, Mike Masters, will be 
responsible for regional newspapers. Mirror's head of national 
newspapers, Roger Eastoe, will keep that role in the new business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strategic fit between our two businesses enables us to  
build further on our market-leading positions,'' Mirror Chairman 
Victor Blank said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Stephen Byers approved  
the deal last week on condition that Trinity sell off its four 
newspapers in Northern Ireland, where Mirror Group already owns 
several titles. Byers said he was concerned that there needed to be 
a diverse ownership of newspapers in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity's papers include the Western Mail, the Liverpool Echo  
and Daily Post and the Newcastle Journal. Mirror Group owns 
Scotland's Daily Record and Sunday Mail along with the Daily 
Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal appears to shut the door on a potential third bid for  
Mirror, by an ousted former chief executive of Mirror Group, David 
Montgomery, who said last week he was trying to arrange backing for 
an offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition needs approval from shareholders and British  
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity will pay the equivalent of $4.34 per Mirror share, well  
above the roughly $3.20 offered by rival bidder Regional 
Independent Media. Trinity shareholders will own 48.4 percent of 
the new company, with Mirror investors holding 51.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> SEC Updates Y2K Readiness Database </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said  
Friday it has updated the database on its Web site that includes 
Year 2000 readiness reports that brokerage firms, mutual funds and 
transfer agents must file. 
</P>
<P>
	The database contains more than 27,000 reports that describe the  
companies' state of Year 2000 preparedness, their costs for fixing 
the problem and their contingency plans. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the SEC adopted rules under which it will go to  
court starting Dec. 1 to shut down brokerage firms that are not 
ready for the millennial date change. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 5-0 vote, the commissioners set a target date of Aug. 31  
for brokerages to complete their Year 2000 compliance efforts but 
allowed additional time for unprepared firms to show that they will 
be ready no later than Nov. 15.

<HEADLINE> Note Surfaces From Atlanta Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The investor who killed his family and nine  
people at two brokerage firms vowed in a note to kill ``the people 
that greedily sought my destruction,'' police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton left the computer-generated note in the living  
room of his family's apartment in suburban Stockbridge, describing 
how he killed his wife and two children by hitting them in the head 
with a hammer Tuesday and Wednesday, said Jimmy Mercer, police 
chief in Henry County, where Stockbridge is located. 
</P>
<P>
	The note made no direct reference to Thursday's slayings at the  
two brokerage firms in Atlanta, except the reference to greedy 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't plan to live very much longer, just long enough to  
kill ... the people that greedily sought my destruction,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton wrote that he killed his children -- 11-year-old Matthew  
and 8-year-old Mychelle -- to spare them the pain of living without 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a hammer ``just seemed like a quiet way to kill and a  
relatively painless way to die,'' he wrote. ``There was little 
pain. All of them were dead in less than five minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton also expressed regret for killing his 27-year-old wife,  
Leigh Ann, ``my honey, my precious love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for  
my demise as I planned to kill the others. I really wish I hadn't 
killed her now. She really couldn't help it and I love her so much 
anyway,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, 44, killed himself Thursday evening as police closed in  
on him in Atlanta's northern suburbs about five hours after the 
shootings in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen people were injured at the two brokerage firms, some by  
bullets and others by their frantic attempts to avoid the killer. 
Four remained in critical condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years ago, Barton was a suspect in the bludgeoning deaths of  
his first wife and her mother, authorities said. But Mercer said 
Barton's note denied responsibility for those slayings and wrote, 
``There's no reason for me to lie now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation on a motive has centered on Barton's work as a day  
trader, an investor who attempts to profit from moment-by-moment 
changes in the stock market, a risky trading method. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting rampage -- the third in the Atlanta area in little  
more than two months -- and the ensuing manhunt stunned the city of 
3.1 million and quickly captured national attention. It was the 
latest in a grisly wave of mass slayings at schools and workplaces, 
and President Clinton today expressed sadness at the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, dark-haired and 6-foot-4, was wearing khaki shorts when  
he walked into the Momentum Securities day trading firm in the Two 
Securities Centre building about 3 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were dead within minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a lot of blood in the hallway,'' said Chris Carter, 32,  
who works on the building's third floor. ``There was a trail of 
blood leading from one end of the hallway to the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton then walked across a busy six-lane road and into the  
All-Tech Investment Group, a day trading firm in the Piedmont 
Center. Five died there. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, who was carrying a pistol in each hand, ``made comments  
to the extent that it was a bad trading day and something to the 
effect that it was going to get worse,'' Atlanta Police Chief 
Beverly Harvard said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been a customer of both firms.  
</P>
<P>
	Nell Jones, 53, a day trader at All-Tech, said she was sitting  
at her computer when she heard shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting outside the door when he exited, so I was the  
first person to look into his eyes,'' Ms. Jones told WSB-TV. ``He 
was someone who was very calm and determined, no feelings. The 
bullet missed me and then he turned to shoot at other people, so I 
was able to escape,'' 
</P>
<P>
	For hours, the mayor and police did not know where Barton was  
and SWAT teams and helicopters swarmed Buckhead to look for him. 
Police told workers to stay in their offices and lock the doors; 
some huddled in their cubicles four hours after the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put the furniture up against the door and barricaded  
ourselves in,'' said Morgan Lyle, 51. ``We had no idea what was 
going on so we just got really quiet and tried to stay calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's unoccupied minivan was eventually spotted by security  
guards at Town Center Mall in Atlanta's northwest suburbs, said 
Cobb County police Cmdr. D.E. Cook. Around the same time, Barton 
approached a woman in the parking lot and attempted to take her 
vehicle, telling her he would shoot her if she screamed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was able to run away and contact security,'' police  
spokesman Dana Pierce said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton returned to his van and police began following him north  
on Interstate 75. The rampage ended when Barton shot himself as 
police cornered him at a service station in Acworth, 30 miles 
northwest of Atlanta and roughly five miles from the mall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pulled over, and then killed himself,'' Mayor Bill  
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harvard said two weapons, a 9 mm Glock and a .45-caliber  
Colt, and a duffel bag full of ammunition were recovered from 
Barton's van. The Glock was registered to Barton, who bought it in 
1993, but the Colt was registered to someone in Texas, and ``we are 
not sure why or how Mr. Barton came into possession,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's first wife -- the mother of the children who were slain  
this week -- and mother-in-law were bludgeoned to death in 1993 in 
Cedar Bluff, Ala. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was,''  
said Richard Igou, the district attorney at the time of the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton worked as a chemist before he began trading stocks,  
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had swings up and down,'' said the mayor. ``He apparently  
was concerned about losses, at least expressed that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech requires each day trader to put up at least $50,000 in  
equity to open an account. To cope with the stress, the company 
employs a psychotherapist to help traders. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, both buildings where the shootings happened were  
open. Someone left a bouquet of spring flowers -- red carnations, 
yellow chrysanthemums and white daisies -- outside each with a card 
that said, ``I'm so sorry. God bless you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the building where the first victims were killed, Allegiance  
Telecom sales manager Eric Blaier was already at work but took a 
break to sip a Diet Coke and gaze at the TV satellite trucks parked 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the game of telecom sales, it's business as usual,'' said  
Blaier, who works on the same floor where four victims were killed. 
``Unfortunately true.''

<HEADLINE> Virgnia Steelworkers Cast Ballots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Steelworkers began casting ballots this  
morning on a proposed contract that would end a 16-week strike at 
Newport News Shipbuilding, the nation's only builder of aircraft 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Local 8888 of the United Steelworkers of America  
began voting at 6 a.m. Results were expected later this evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote will either end the strike or send the union and  
company back to the bargaining table to try again. 
</P>
<P>
	If a simple majority of those voting support the contract, union  
members will begin returning to work next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreement was reached last week during federally  
mediated talks. Some union members said they were disappointed with 
the proposed raise and the length of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract provides a pay raise averaging $3.10 an hour over  
58 months and improves the pension plan for workers who retire at 
62 with at least 30 years experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The union represents 9,200 production and maintenance workers.

<HEADLINE>  13 More Major League Umps Purged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After spending their careers ejecting players,  
13 National League umpires found themselves tossed out. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unprecedented purge precipitated by a labor strategy that  
backfired, 13 NL umps lost their jobs Thursday, meaning one-third 
of major league umps will depart Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe West, famous for slamming pitcher Dennis Cook to the ground  
in 1990, and Eric Gregg, criticized for a wide strike zone in the 
1997 playoffs, were among those let go, management officials said, 
speaking on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hallion, suspended for three games earlier this month for  
bumping a player and coach, will be forced to leave, too, along 
with crew chiefs Frank Pulli and Terry Tata, who have each spent 
more than 25 years in the major leagues and worked four World 
Series apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are some of the finest umpires in the history of this  
game,'' union head Richie Phillips said. ``Terry Tata has worked 
many, many important games. What they're saying is that an umpire 
who has never even worked a spring training game in his life is 
more fit to umpire in the major leagues than Terry Tata. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the conduct of major league baseball is reprehensible  
and oppressive. What they've really done here is attempt to execute 
surrendered prisoners. I absolutely vow to fight to the death in 
this case, and I will never, ever rest until I right this wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine AL umpires were told Monday that their resignations were  
accepted. That means 22 of the 68 major league umpires are 
departing. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulli, 64, has been a member of the NL staff since 1972. He was  
planning to retire after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a slap in the face. This is what I deserve after 28  
years?'' Pulli said from Pittsburgh, where he was to work the 
Florida-Pirates game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to go to war,'' he said. ``This is the biggest favor  
they ever did for this union. These guys will come together, I 
guarantee you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many NL umpires were angry with commissioner Bud Selig and Sandy  
Alderson, the vice president of baseball operations in the 
commissioner's office, saying the moves were made over the 
objection of NL president Len Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a plan by Bud Selig and Sandy Alderson to break the  
union,'' NL umpire Steve Rippley said, adding that the firings have 
made him consider retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Many umpires spent the day wondering if they'd be kept or let  
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting since 6:30 this morning, calling people and  
getting phone calls,'' NL ump Dana DeMuth said in Los Angeles 
before the Dodgers played Cincinnati. ``And from that time on, our 
hearts have been jumping. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're standing here with our heads in a guillotine, and the  
blade is right here,'' he said, holding his hand behind his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	He survived, but also let go were Gary Darling, Bob Davidson,  
Bruce Dreckman, Bill Hohn, Sam Holbrook, Paul Nauert, Larry Poncino 
and Larry Vanover. 
</P>
<P>
	Ability, diversity and experience were among the factors used to  
make the decisions, several management officials said, all speaking 
on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has pushed to increase minority hiring in recent years  
and didn't want to decrease the percentage of minority umpires. 
Baseball also had to be careful not to accept the resignations of 
too many of the union's leaders, because that would open the sport 
to a charge of illegal retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips promised he will file a ``massive, massive unfair labor  
practice charge,'' and hoped to it by Monday. He cited a clause in 
the labor agreement barring ``discrimination or recrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL umpire Jerry Crawford, the union president, said the actions  
were ``illegal, reprehensible and immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 14, the day following the All-Star game, most umpires  
resigned effective Sept. 2, thinking the tactic would force an 
early start to negotiations for a new labor contract. The current 
deal expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than a dozen umpires refused to resign and baseball  
hired 25 replacements from Triple-A, effective Sept. 1. The umpires 
let go sent a letter Tuesday withdrawing the resignations, but 
baseball said it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, in anticipation of baseball's moves, umpires sued  
in federal court in Philadelphia. Their attempt to gain a 
restraining order was denied by U.S. District Judge Edmund V. 
Ludwig, but a hearing on the case will be scheduled after Aug. 12, 
Ludwig's office said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Chairman of China Everbright Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- The China Everbright Group, one of the  
country's largest corporate groups, announced Friday that its 
chairman resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	But company officials denied reports that he was under  
investigation for alleged ``economic irregularities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu Xiaohua, who resigned, was one of China's most prominent  
executives and a protege of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji. He was 
replaced by Liu Mingkang, a deputy governor of China's central 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu said he also took over Zhu's position as chairman of China  
Everbright Bank, one of China's most profitable and innovative 
commerical banks, as well as its listed units in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	China Everbright Group is controlled by China's State Council,  
or the cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu insisted it was a ``normal transfer,'' denying widespread  
but unconfirmed media reports that Zhu was fired and under criminal 
investigation for bad deals costing more than $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, this is part of normal operations,  
nothing more, nothing less,'' said Liu. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong newspapers reported on Friday that Chinese President  
Jiang Zemin personally ordered Zhu's return to Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Senate Readies for Vote on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican bill to cut taxes by $792  
billion, after dodging numerous attempts to alter or shrink it, 
headed for passage in the Senate and the larger obstacle of a 
promised presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP majority was expected to give solid backing today to the  
10-year plan that would reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 14 
percent, ease the so-called marriage penalty, reduce estate taxes 
and increase IRA contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
	First though, they accepted, 98-2, an amendment by Sen. Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and other GOP conservatives that would 
speed up measures to reduce tax disadvantages for married couples. 
Other tax breaks in the bill would be delayed to offset the $6 
billion cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taxing the fundamental institution that we build values  
around,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	With passage, GOP leaders intended to move quickly to resolve  
differences with a House-passed bill that would reach the same $792 
billion level of tax relief through different kinds of cuts. The 
bill, however, was not expected to be sent to the president until 
September, giving both supporters and opponents a chance to press 
their case during the August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton reminded Congress again Thursday that the bill  
faced a certain veto. In remarks before leaving for Europe, he said 
the ``large and risky tax cut'' could carry America back ``to the 
dark old days of huge deficits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he would accept no tax cut greater than $300  
billion and only if it came after the future of Social Security and 
Medicare was secured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a veto threat but we've also got a responsibility to  
the American taxpayer,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, a 
member of the Senate Finance Committee that crafted the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists have forecast that the budget surplus would total  
nearly $3 trillion over the next decade, but the fight was over 
what to do with the non-Social Security surplus of approximately $1 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans said the bulk of that should be returned to  
taxpayers. Democrats said there was a real chance the forecasters 
were wrong, and that even if the surpluses were realized they 
should be used for debt reduction and needed spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bright-line test,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.  
``There is a radical difference in terms of what we stand for and 
what we fight for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Republicans, joined by six Democrats, rejected a  
Democratic alternative that would have limited the tax cut to $290 
billion. On Thursday, a $500 billion compromise bill that attracted 
moderates from both parties was withdrawn under pressure from party 
leaders. ``I don't think either of the two parties at this time is 
supportive'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who sponsored the 
alternative with Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Also defeated was a proposal by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
that the bill be altered to include funds to provide prescription 
drug benefits to Medicare recipients. ``Our plan presents a clear 
choice between prescription drug coverage for the elderly and 
unnecessary new tax breaks for the wealthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., promised action  
on the prescription drug issue in the fall, but ``we should not be 
pressured into simply accepting something that does require our 
most careful and studied attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the Republican side, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, sought  
changes to make the bill more compatible with the House version. 
Gramm's amendment, defeated on a procedural vote, would have 
eventually reduced all income tax rates by 10 percent, repealed 
estate taxes and eliminated the marriage tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Texan Republican Hutchison said the across-the-board cut  
was ``the fairest of all tax cuts,'' but Democrats assailed it as 
unfairly benefitting wealthier taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of the benefits would go to the 10 percent with  
the highest incomes, said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``It is a 
class warfare amendment and it should be trounced in a vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 percent tax rate cut included in the House bill was  
likely to be one of the major issues when the House and Senate meet 
to resolve differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 14 percent and increase  
the number of people eligible for that tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provide relief to married couples who are pushed into a higher  
tax bracket because of their combined incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase allowable contributions to retirement funds.  
</P>
<P>
	--Provide deductions for health insurance costs and long-term  
care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase the eligible income limits for student loan interest  
deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Repeal estate tax rates in excess of 50 percent and, in 2007,  
increase the $1 million exemption to $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1429.

<HEADLINE> EU Junked Car Recycling Law OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union countries have approved  
a law that forces automobile manufacturers to take back old 
vehicles for free and recycle the parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The law on ``end-of-life'' vehicles was endorsed July 22 by a  
majority of the 15 EU countries after months of delay linked to 
German opposition to the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was formally approved Thursday evening in a written  
procedure without debate, an EU official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The law will apply from 2006 to all cars sold in the EU,  
according to the spokesman. Starting in 2001, it will apply to new 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers will have to recycle 80 percent of the weight of  
the materials in cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The European auto industry has argued that the law will force it  
to take hefty provisions for the recycling of vehicles. The 
industry has reportedly said the law will cost it more than $10 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Report to Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHENEY, Wash. (AP) -- The day after rookies and a few veterans  
showed up to camp, the remaining members of the Seattle Seahawks 
reported Friday -- with the exception of wide receiver Joey Galloway 
and Lamar King. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joey will get here sooner or later,'' free-agent cornerback  
Lenny McGill said. ``Hopefully sooner than later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway was eighth in the AFC with 1,047 receiving yards last  
season. Ten of his 65 receptions went for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Camp's going to be good, but it will be even better when Lamar  
and Joey get here,'' rookie free-agent running back Jay Kinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway is seeking a sizable raise from the $1.6 million he is  
scheduled to receive this season in the final year of his current 
contract, The Spokesman-Review of Spokane reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks have reportedly offered Galloway a five-year deal  
worth around $22 million, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Metz, agent for both Galloway and King, did not return a  
phone message left Friday at his Phoenix office. Nor did new coach 
Mike Holmgren, also the team's general manager, make himself 
available to discuss Galloway's situation. 
</P>
<P>
	King is seeking a deal somewhere between the contracts signed by  
the No. 20 and No. 24 picks in the draft, also defensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20th pick was Dallas' Ebenezer Ekuban, who signed a  
five-year deal worth $5.65 million. The 24th pick was Reggie McGrew 
of the San Francisco 49ers, who signed a seven-year contract worth 
as much as $7.4 million. McGrew's contract converts to four years 
if he reaches incentives.

<HEADLINE> Brawl Marred Phillies-Braves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After the Phillies-Braves game was delayed 16  
minutes by a power outage, Atlanta manager Bobby Cox and two of his 
players -- pitcher John Smoltz and catcher Eddie Perez -- were 
ejected in separate incidents Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez was thrown out in the top of the fourth inning for shoving  
and then throwing a punch at Phillies pitcher Paul Byrd, who had 
hit Perez with a pitch the previous inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Both benches emptied and a melee ensued, with players on both  
sides shoving each other. When order was restored, Perez was 
ejected and replaced by Greg Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad blood between Perez and Byrd, former Braves teammates,  
started Sunday in Philadelphia when Byrd -- who leads the majors 
with 13 hit batters -- plunked Perez with a pitch in Atlanta's 5-4, 
10-inning win. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bottom of the third Friday, Byrd hit Perez again with a  
pitch. Perez motioned to Byrd and both benches emptied but there 
there were no physical altercations at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The lights went out in the bottom of the third on a night when  
the heat index reached 100 degrees. The outage, which also affected 
other areas in north Georgia, was caused by an equipment failure at 
a Georgia Power substation and the heavy strain on the electric 
system due to the hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
	When play began 16 minutes later, Perez was called out for  
interference on a grounder by Smoltz. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the double play, Cox ran onto the field and argued  
with second-base umpire Larry Poncino. After a few minutes, Poncino 
ejected Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz, Atlanta's starting pitcher, was ejected in the top of  
the fourth by plate umpire Jerry Meals after hitting Alex Arias 
with a pitch. Smoltz charged towards Meals, apparently upset that 
he got no warning before getting tossed. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Springer then replaced Smoltz. Two batters later, Byrd came  
to the plate with Arias on first and two outs. Byrd said something 
to Perez -- apparently telling the catcher he didn't mean to hit him 
the previous inning -- but Perez then attacked Byrd.

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Young Says It'll All Work Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- A slew of questions came at Steve Young.  
</P>
<P>
	How much longer would he play? How would the San Francisco 49ers  
handle the loss of Garrison Hearst? Would his line hold up? Would 
the team survive its ownership tumult. How would Lawrence Phillips 
and Charlie Garner fit in? 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you guys seen `Shakespeare in Love?''' Young said after  
taking part in San Francisco's first full-team workout Friday. ``In 
the movie, the guy would be like, `I don't know how it works, but 
it all works out in the end,' and that's the way it's been here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year, there's a litany of things that are going on.  
There's a lot of doubts and a lot of changes. But there's a point 
where the 49ers heritage kicks in and somehow we just kind of put 
it together. I don't think that's Pollyana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 37, is in his 15th season and ninth since succeeding Joe  
Montana as the 49ers' quarterback. A two-time MVP who led the 49ers 
to their fifth Super Bowl title in 1994, Young is coming off one of 
his best years, passing for a team-record 4,170 yards while leading 
the league's top-ranked offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, I don't feel any different,'' said Young, who  
turns 38 in October but proved durable last season, playing all but 
one game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't notice the years. Mentally, you're almost a better  
player in a way because you've calmed down a lot. You take things a 
little slower. You handle things better. I'm at a point where 
there's kind of golden years and your mind's mature and your body 
is still good. I'm enjoying those right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said coach Steve Mariucci: ``As far as his throwing, being in  
sync with his receivers, and his knowledge of the system, he's on 
top of his game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young said he's aware San Francisco is trying reassert itself  
after finishing second last season to Atlanta in the NFC West and 
then losing to the Falcons in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco also was confronted by organizational tumult that  
saw its entire front office turn over in the past year and siblings 
Eddie DeBartolo and his sister Denise DeBartolo York feud over 
control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Young said Bill Walsh's return -- the Hall of Fame coach was  
brought in as general manager last January -- had a stabilizing 
impact and helped the 49ers keep their competitive footing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took over really a kind of messy situation. It really feels  
cohesive,'' Young said. ``You can tell he had a plan and he went 
out and did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, the 49ers are trying to overcome a severe blow  
stemming from the loss of Hearst, who rushed for a club-record 
1,570 yards last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke his left ankle in the postseason loss at Atlanta and  
circulatory complications have stagnated his recovery to the point 
where he's not expected back until December. Their best defensive 
player, Bryant Young, also is coming off a serious leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, though, said the 49ers' offense will still be a  
formidable because Walsh was able to keep San Francisco's triple 
threat at wide receiver intact, re-signing J.J. Stokes and Terrell 
Owens to go with Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like, `Wow, that was fortuitous,' because we're going  
to need those weapons,'' Young said. ``In the NFL, if you don't 
line up, if you don't have the game kind of in your favor when you 
warm up by who comes out of the locker room, you're in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To replace Hearst, the 49ers signed Lawrence Phillips, gambling  
the Rams' top pick from 1996 has put his off-field problems behind 
him. They also added from Philadelphia running back Charlie Garner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie Garner is a guy that can step in as a player in this  
offense because he knows the system already there's no question 
Lawrence, once he learns it will be a force,'' said Young, who gave 
Phillips a hug and personally welcomed him at the team's meeting 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were sitting here and really didn't have any threats  
running the ball, then I'd be like, `Geez, I don't know what we 
would do.' 
</P>
<P>
	``But at this point, I feel like we have threats and we're the  
best at bringing new guys in, and indoctrinating them into our way 
and making them great players. So let's go for it. This might 
evolve into something that makes us even more explosive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young said he doesn't believe the 49ers' image has been  
tarnished by the signing of Phillips, who twice was convicted in 
assaults on women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the image is intact because the people that carry it  
are the ones that have carried the torch for a lot of years and 
demand it,'' said Young. ``So now if you add people, they have to 
join and accept the challenge of being a 49er.''

	Police Reveal Atlanta Shooting Note  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In a chilling suicide note, the investor who  
killed his family and nine people at two brokerage firms vowed to 
kill ``the people that greedily sought my destruction,'' police 
said today. Mark O. Barton left the note in his family's apartment 
in suburban Stockbridge, describing how he killed his wife and two 
children Tuesday and Wednesday, the Henry County police chief said. 
Barton wrote that he killed his children to spare them the pain of 
living without parents. Using a hammer ``just seemed like a polite 
way to kill and a relatively painless way to die,'' he wrote. 
``There was little pain. All of them were dead in less than five 
minutes.''

	Gore Offers Plan for Cutting Taxes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling the Republicans' broader tax cuts  
``kind of crazy'' Vice President Al Gore today proposed new, but 
narrow, tax breaks of his own. Gore said in prepared remarks at the 
Minneapolis Community and Technical College that the GOP would undo 
today's prosperity by ``repeating the trickle-down tragedies of the 
past.'' Gore proposed a new ``401(j)'' program that would allow 
families and employers to contribute up to $2,500 a year that can 
be saved and withdrawn tax-free for educational expenses. To 
address the so-called ``marriage penalty,'' Gore proposed doubling 
the standard deduction for all joint filers.

	NTSB: No JFK Jr. Plane Fire  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The wreckage of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane  
showed no signs of in-flight breakup or fire, and the engine 
appeared to have been working when the aircraft plunged into the 
ocean, a federal safety panel said today. The National 
Transportation Safety Board also said that 75 percent of the plane 
was recovered from the waters off Martha's Vineyard, Mass. The 
safety board also said that Kennedy had received a weather forecast 
via the Internet for his flight. The report, issued about two hours 
before takeoff, was for good visual-flight-rules conditions, with 
six to eight miles visibility.

	Heat Wave Death Toll Climbs to 78  
</P>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- This summer's unrelenting heat has been  
sapping energy from outdoor workers, drying up crops and turning 
forests into kindling across the nation. At least 78 deaths in 14 
states have been blamed on the heat wave that has gripped much of 
country since July 19, as temperatures linger in the 90s and 100s. 
Missouri has the highest death toll at 27. The heat is expected to 
last at least until today before a change in the jet stream brings 
cooler air from Canada to northern states.

	Clinton Lauds Sarajevo Rebirth  
</P>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- President Clinton said today  
he was awed by the ``remarkably astonishing'' rebirth of this 
war-ravaged city and he wants Sarajevo to stand as a symbol of 
tolerance in the Balkans and not for its violent past. ``The war is 
over,'' Clinton told students at a multiethnic high school. ``We 
have to build a better peace for Bosnia and all of Southeast 
Europe.'' During the war that ended in 1995, Sarajevo's besieged 
population was pinned down by Bosnian-Serb forces. Amid daily 
tragedies, a few seared the world's conscience and propelled the 
West to intervene with airstrikes that ended the war.

	Woodstock Rape Reports Investigated  
</P>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Rape counselors and crisis intervention  
workers say they treated far more sexual assault victims than the 
four reported to police during the Woodstock '99 festival. Sandy 
Lattimore, emergency services director of the Rome office of the 
American Red Cross, said her staff treated multiple victims of 
sexual assaults. The Oneida County Rape Crisis Center yesterday 
reported that two other teen-age girls have come forward with 
allegations that they were raped. One of the alleged rapes occurred 
in a mosh pit 30 yards away from the stage, police said.

</P>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- All the cyclists in this year's  
Tour de France were tested for banned substances and none was 
found, world cycling's governing body said today. The International 
Cycling Union said it carried out tests during every stage of the 
race and there were no positive results. The three-week race was 
won by Texan Lance Armstrong, making a remarkable comeback from 
cancer. The cycling union said earlier that tests on Armstrong had 
shown traces of corticosteroids but this had been caused by a skin 
cream he was using with a doctor's OK.

<HEADLINE> United States 2, Germany 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Ben Olsen and Joe-Max Moore scored  
goals Friday night to lead the United States to a 2-0 victory over 
Germany and into the semifinals of the Confederations Cup soccer 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsen took a pass from Marcelo Balboa in the 23rd minute and  
shot it to the left of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. In the 49th minute, 
Moore drove a free kick into the top right corner of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil faced New Zealand in the final game of the tournament's  
first round later Friday. Brazil was all but assured of finishing 
first in the Guadalajara group, which would allow it to stay in 
Guadalajara and face Saudi Arabia in a semifinal game on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans would have only one day to travel to Mexico City  
and prepare for Sunday's semifinal against Mexico, the top team in 
the Mexico City group. The final will be played Wednesday in Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	The game Friday night was slow and characterized by missed  
passes and little offensive flair. Each side pressed the other 
closely, and Germany didn't make a single offensive play until the 
14th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans mounted a strong defense in the penalty box, and  
Balboa repeatedly cleared the ball during German offensives. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also a rough game and referee Gilberto Alcala doled out  
seven yellow cards, four to the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans played without many of their usual starters,  
saving players like Cobi Jones, John Harkes and Kasey Keller for 
Sunday's semifinal. Forward Brian McBride entered only in the 76th 
minute and Jovan Kirovski in the 82nd. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States showed surprising strength against Germany,  
traditionally one of the world's best teams. The Americans upset 
the Germans 3-0 in February in Florida, and many had said another 
loss to the Americans would be humiliating.

<HEADLINE> `Scared Straight!' Is Remade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOODBRIDGE, N.J. (AP) -- Kevin Stout came to East Jersey State  
prison 22 years ago. Convicted murderers spit profanities in his 
face, pushed him around and told him never to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, you couldn't have told me nothing,'' said Stout,  
who was 15 when he became one of the earliest participants in the 
Lifers' Program, which, first documented in the film ``Scared 
Straight!,'' is meant to keep juvenile delinquents like him out of 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He came back to the same prison three years later, a murderer  
and robber, in for life. For years, he kept away from the Lifers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he woke up one day and thought, ``I don't want anybody to  
be like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stout, 37, is one of a new group of Lifers who appear in  
``Scared Straight! '99,'' an MTV remake of the gritty documentary 
that shocked the world in 1979 with convicts' expletive-filled, 
intimidating tirades about life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	This ``Scared Straight!,'' which airs Sunday at 10 p.m. EDT, has  
a new cast of prisoners (those from 1979 are either dead, released 
or transferred), new delinquents, and, since this is MTV, a rock 
soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV recruited Arnold Shapiro to make the sequel for an ongoing  
anti-violence campaign. Shapiro, who produced the original film, 
won an Academy Award for best documentary as well as an Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hesitant at first to take on the new project, worried  
about confusion with another ``Scared Straight!'' film he produced 
for UPN that aired in April. 
</P>
<P>
	But he realized he could reach a generation too young to  
remember the original film, while re-creating the tense 
confrontation between young criminals and the hardened convicts who 
want to stop them before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is this great television, but it's great sociology,''  
Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	History appears to repeat itself for much of ``Scared Straight!  
'99.'' Twelve boys, ages 12 to 17, walk in cocky and walk out 
shaking, vowing never to return after convicts scream about prison 
rape, filth and lack of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see the stars at night. I ain't seen the stars in 20  
years,'' one prisoner screams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will eat you alive,'' warned ``Crazy Chris, the Nightmare  
Man,'' who is serving a double life sentence for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	But while they are younger -- the youngest delinquent in the 1979  
film was 15 -- these kids seem a bit tougher. Not one shed a tear. 
</P>
<P>
	And the inmates are louder, a bit over-the-top and, if possible,  
more profane than in 1979. (MTV plans to air the expletives uncut, 
with warnings.) 
</P>
<P>
	When a bald, muscular inmate grabs the smallest 12-year-old in  
the group and screams, ``Look at me, little boy. What ... you doing 
in my house today?'', it's powerful. But not as powerful as an 
inmate who brought a kid to tears in 1979 by quietly, methodically 
explaining how he'd like to rip out one of his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50,000 youths have come through ``Scared Straight!'' since  
it was founded 23 years ago. Officials say they can't track success 
rates because juvenile crime records are confidential. Shapiro 
found that 15 of his original 17 delinquents from 1979 stayed 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1999 film, 10 out of 12 stayed clear of arrests for three  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	But some criminologists say the program doesn't work. Rutgers  
University's Jim Finckenauer conducted a study that showed that 
some delinquents reoffend at a higher rate after going through 
``Scared Straight!'' The inmates' brash performances may actually 
encourage some of the youths, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message, verbally, to them is don't be like me,''  
Finckenauer said. ``But at the same time there's this undercurrent 
of here's a guy who really got his act together, knows who he is, 
tough guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Youths who participated in MTV's special said the two-hour visit  
changed them. 
</P>
<P>
	A counselor took Brian Potanovic, 17, of Yonkers, N.Y., to  
prison after he was arrested for graffiti vandalism. Asked on film 
what he would do if he knew he wouldn't get caught, Potanovic said, 
``Kill everyone I had a beef with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a screening of the film at the prison earlier this month,  
Potanovic appeared chastened, smiling for cameras and politely 
fielding questions from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a bad kid,'' he said, ``and I don't intend coming back  
here anytime soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one of the boys who was rearrested after three months for  
assault had carved the initials S.U.K. into his arm, which he said 
stood for Serious Untouchable Killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way I am,'' said Melvin, 14. ``They can't change  
me.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Costliest High School Hits Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It was supposed to be the crown jewel of the  
nation's second-largest school district, a towering complex for 
5,300 students in a desperately overcrowded part of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	At $175 million, the Belmont Learning Center would be the most  
expensive high school in the United States. But it may never open. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-acre site school officials chose is a former oil field  
with high levels of potentially explosive methane gas and lesser 
amounts of hydrogen sulfide, a highly toxic gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The school sits half-completed, although a banner proclaiming  
``Belmont High'' is draped hopefully over a scaffold. State 
lawmakers, school officials and environmental experts are trying to 
determine whether the school ever will be safe enough to open. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have already begun to consider other school sites in  
case the project dies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you know somebody who wants to pay us back our money and  
take it off our hands, send them to us,'' School Board President 
Genethia Hudley Hayes quipped Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, district officials have known the area needs a new  
school. The current Belmont High School has 4,700 students, and 
hundreds more are bused as long as an hour and a half to schools on 
the other side of sprawling Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the district sought to take over the site of the old  
Ambassador Hotel, where Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1968. 
Donald Trump, who owned the site and wanted to build a commercial 
development, fought back. The district is still trying to get back 
the $50 million it gave Trump as a down payment. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up on the Ambassador site, the district turned to  
one of the few remaining open parcels near downtown. The plan was 
to reduce construction costs by teaming with a private developer 
who could build 200 housing units and retail space. 
</P>
<P>
	What evolved was a striking design of beige and brown stone  
featuring tennis courts, soccer, football, baseball and softball 
fields and eight ``academies'' that would teach art, science and 
other specialties. 
</P>
<P>
	As early as 1989, a state Division of Oil and Gas official  
recommended against building on the old oil field. But the plans 
moved ahead, and district and state officials, consultants and 
critics went back and forth over how serious the problems were and 
whether they could be mitigated at reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the district essentially said there was no  
environmental risk on a 24-acre chunk of land that would house the 
main buildings. The district now acknowledges the environmental 
assessment it conducted was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a real rush to get this done quickly,'' said  
Assemblyman Scott Wildman, head of the Joint Legislative Audit 
Committee, which is investigating the project. ``They apparently 
thought they could discover the problems as they go and fix them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan to include private development also fell apart. Nobody  
wanted to set up shop in a scruffy area between two freeways, 
blocks away from major shopping meccas. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in February, high levels of methane were found at the site.  
Work was sharply scaled back and will slow further next month. Some 
work continues, such as painting and installation of doors and 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will never `clean up the site,''' said Angelo Bellomo, an  
environmental consultant and chair of the school district's safety 
team. ``There will always be chemicals that are being generated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monitoring and venting the gases could cost hundreds of  
thousands of dollars a year, Bellomo estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the problems, some parents want the project to continue.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know we need that school,'' said Gloria Soto, whose son is a  
Belmont sophomore. ``Our high school has been promised for 20 
years.''

<HEADLINE>  NFL Camps Open, Optimism Abounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- The future is now for the only NFL team  
that has never won a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a message repeated over and over by the New Orleans  
Saints' hierarchy on the first day of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, if I had told you the Falcons would be in the Super  
Bowl, you would have laughed,'' general manager Bill Kuharich said 
Thursday. ``This year, we're the team that will make believers of 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints' dedication to proving Kuharich right could be seen  
in their offseason workouts, which were the most successful in the 
history of the franchise, with 98 percent of the players 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys understand that our chance is now, not three years  
from now,'' coach Mike Ditka said. ``The bottom line in this 
business is winning. The bottom line for me is winning. I didn't 
win my first two years. If I don't win this year, I shouldn't be 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans, which has not had a winning season in seven years,  
was 6-10 in each of Ditka's first two seasons. Yet when Ditka 
introduced Ricky Williams to a crowd of fans following the draft 
and pronounced his team playoff bound, nobody snickered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe everything he says,'' said Williams, who predicted  
at least a trip to the playoffs. ``This is a good team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Heisman Trophy winner isn't able to carry the Saints, he  
should at least give it a big boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka, who still dreams of the days when Walter Payton was  
carrying the football for him, believes Williams is from the same 
mold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this kid is the real thing,'' Ditka said. ``I don't  
think anything bothers him except not doing his job and not 
winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is to get the football to Williams at least 20 times a  
game -- something the Saints have not done for other running backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamar Smith, last year's leading rusher, had only 138 carries --  
an average of eight a game -- and 457 yards. The Saints have not had 
a 1,000-yard rusher in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, people are going to try to stack the line and stop  
Ricky,'' offensive coordinator Danny Abramowicz said. ``We have to 
find a way to stop that and get the ball to him anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abramowicz believes that Williams can wear down opposing  
defenses if he is given enough opportunities. He also believes that 
Williams can be used as a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints, who ranked 28th in the NFL in offense last season  
and dead last in rushing, also signed left guard Wally Williams, 
coupling him with Pro Bowl tackle William Roaf and leaving former 
No. 1 pick Kyle Turley in his natural position at right tackle to 
stabilize the line. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans traded their No. 2 pick for wide receiver Eddie  
Kennison, counting on his speed to provide a deep threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``People talk about us giving up all our picks to get Ricky,''  
Kuharich said. ``But that's misleading. It's not as if we have only 
one new player from last year. We've been active in getting people 
we need and keeping the good players we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Billy Joe Hobert, who missed all of last season with  
a ruptured right Achilles' tendon, is the starter going into 
training camp. Although Hobert has only a 3-2 record as a starter, 
Ditka has enough confidence in him and backups Billy Joe Tolliver 
and Danny Wuerffel to pass on acquiring Jeff George, Warren Moon, 
Neil O'Donnell and Eric Kramer via free agency, or trading for Jim 
Harbaugh or Brad Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only worry I have about that position is someone getting  
hurt,'' said Ditka, who has started four different quarterbacks in 
each of his first two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense had a hard time last year, partially because it was  
on the field for most of every game. This year, Ditka said that 
should not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the work we've done has been on the offense. That's  
probably not fair, but I don't think the defense needed as much 
work,'' Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints on Thursday re-signed safety Sammy Knight, who led  
the team with six interceptions last year. Knight agreed to a 
five-year deal worth $9.225 million. 
</P>
<P>
	They also acquired veteran corner back Ashley Ambrose, counting  
on his cover skills to beef up the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
                               *Rams    	
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams have reportedly offered holdout running back  
Marshall Faulk a seven-year contract worth $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But his agent, Rocky Arceneaux, opposes a seven-year deal unless  
the Rams guarantee they won't make Faulk a franchise or transition 
player after four years. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	Alonzo Spellman, out of football since the Chicago Bears  
released him in 1998 following several bizarre episodes, has agreed 
to a contract with the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Spellman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said the defensive lineman  
accepted a one-year contract for the veteran minimum of $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Bengals    	
</P>
<P>
	Carl Pickens, the leading receiver in Bengals history, will sit  
out the season if the team doesn't trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	As Cincinnati prepared to open training camp in Georgetown, Ky.,  
Pickens was working out in Atlanta. His agent, Steve Zucker, said 
the receiver won't play for the Bengals this season. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Panthers    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Robert Daniel will miss the season after fracturing a  
disc in his neck during a blocking drill. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery to fuse the two vertebrae between the disc will be  
performed next week after the swelling goes down. Recovery is 
expected to last three to four months, but the team said he should 
be able to play next season. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Mike Peterson, the Colts' second-round draft pick,  
ended his holdout and joined the team at training camp in 
Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts didn't announce terms of the agreement, but his agent  
said Peterson agreed to a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Jaguars    	
</P>
<P>
	First-round draft pick Fernando Bryant, who's involved in a  
contract squabble, missed the first day of camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerback has demanded a four-year deal, while the Jaguars  
have insisted that he sign a five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Eagles    	
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle Rhett Hall will sit out the entire season and  
might retire because his ailing left knee hasn't responded to 
rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, who led the Eagles with eight sacks in 1997, hasn't  
recovered from surgery to repair a fractured kneecap that forced 
him to miss the final 14 games last season. He had major surgery on 
the same knee to repair torn ligaments in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Halfback Gary Brown will be sidelined indefinitely because of a  
buttocks injury sustained a month ago when he was involved in a 
motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who rushed for 1,063 yards last year, is still bothered  
by a painful hematoma on the left side of his buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
	He was injured June 26 in Williamsport, Pa., when a car  
allegedly made a rolling stop at a stop sign and clipped the front 
wheel of the player's motorcyle. Brown needed about nine stitches 
to close a gash near his rectum caused by the incident.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Shootings Saddens Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- President Clinton today  
expressed sadness over the deadly shooting rampage in two Atlanta 
brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after arriving here for a summit on rebuilding the  
Balkans region, Clinton said he received updates on the Thursday 
shooting spree during a stop at a U.S. air base in Italy. The 
president declined to discuss possible causes, saying he did not 
yet know enough about the events to draw any conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our thoughts are primarily with the families of the victims  
and those who are struggling for their lives in the hospital,'' 
Clinton said. ``But in terms of what could have, should have been 
done and what this means for other issues, I think we have to wait 
until all the facts come in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said federal officials were assisting state and local  
authorities in their investigation. Nine people were killed and 12 
injured in the attack, one of the nation's worst workplace 
massacres. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, Mark O. Barton, 44, shot and killed himself as  
police cornered him at a suburban Atlanta service station. He was 
said to be upset over financial losses from day-trading stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's wife, son and daughter also were found dead in their  
home.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Mayor in Familiar Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- As the horror mounted and the manhunt for a mass  
murderer dragged on, Mayor Bill Campbell calmly told his city and a 
nation what he knew, what he didn't and sometimes how he felt. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an honesty Atlanta knows well. The two-term mayor is the  
city's most visible spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centennial Olympic Park bombing, a hostage crisis involving  
children, a high-wire rescue of a construction worker from a huge 
inferno -- Campbell has been there for all of them, front and 
center. He was there again Thursday after Mark O. Barton killed 12 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``From Colorado to Atlanta, these things occur. We do not know  
why,'' Campbell said after Barton committed suicide Thursday night. 
``We'll simply have to search our souls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Pray for our city,'' the Democrat said during a news  
conference that was nationally broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Campbell also handled spokesman duties for the  
police after an estranged boyfriend killed all but one member of an 
Atlanta family. He also made several appearances on local TV later 
when he visited the lone 11-year-old survivor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The depth of this tragedy is so overwhelming that it's hard  
for us to comprehend,'' Campbell said at the funeral. ``We come 
today to show our love and support for this family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, first elected in 1993, has made a habit of holding  
live news conferences soon after other high-profile incidents -- 
including the Centennial Olympic Park bombing and, more recently, a 
mass shooting that left all but one member of an Atlanta family 
dead last month. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a role that most cities delegate to a spokesperson or, in  
serious situations, a chief of police, though Police Chief Beverly 
Harvard was out of town Thursday. But Campbell's aides say he 
recognizes the need for leadership in such situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the mayor of the city, and when something like this  
happens, he needs to be here,'' said his spokesman, Nick Gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell remained soft-spoken and solemn but stayed very  
involved, pacing the scene as he received updates on his cell 
phone. It was, for him, a task that is growing far too familiar. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past two weeks, we've had two deranged people kill 17  
people, perhaps more, in this city,'' he said. ``I have no 
explanation for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The third black to hold the mayor's office in the history of the  
city, Campbell addressed the media after the city's three bombings, 
including one of an abortion clinic in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell has also been in the national spotlight for his ardent  
defense of the city's affirmative-action program and his suit 
against gunmakers, later outlawed by the Georgia General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cybersquatting Bill Clears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee approved  
legislation Thursday aimed at limiting so-called cybersquatting by 
people who register Internet domain names with the purpose of 
selling them later. 
</P>
<P>
	Domain names are the addresses computer users enter to access a  
particular Web site. They are sandwiched between ``www.'' and 
``.com,'' ``.net'' or ``.org.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some people have found a lucrative practice in registering Web  
addresses using the trademarks of famous companies in hopes of 
later forcing the companies to pay sizable amounts of money to buy 
the rights to the Internet locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation to limit the practice was sponsored by a  
bipartisan group including Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin 
Hatch, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Approved by voice vote and sent to the full Senate, the bill  
would allow trademark owners to recover statutory damages in cases 
where it is proven that a trademarked name was registered in bad 
faith by a person who intended to unfairly profit from its sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would allow trademark owners to seek the  
forfeiture, cancelation or transfer of an infringing domain name 
after satisfying the court that it has tried but was unable to 
locate the person who registered it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said many cybersquatters register domain names under  
aliases or otherwise provide false information, which makes it 
difficult for corporations and others to locate them. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would encourage registrars of domain names to work  
with companies to prevent cybersquatting. But it contains no 
criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said the practice harms the public by eroding consumer  
confidence and hurting businesses by tarnishing the ``goodwill 
value'' associated with their names. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the committee heard numerous tales consumer confusion  
stemming from the false registration of domain names. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, it learned of a cybersquatter who registered the  
names ``attphonecard.com'' and ``attcallingcard.com,'' allegedly to 
sell calling cards, and solicited personal information, including 
credit card numbers, Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other examples involved the Dell computer company and automaker  
Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1255.

<HEADLINE> House Supports Background Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House, easing its stand against toughening  
gun control laws, voted Friday to support background checks on all 
firearms sales at gun shows. The nonbinding vote came the day after 
a gunman killed nine people in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The action was on a resolution recommending that House  
participants in negotiations with the Senate support background 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks ago, while passing a juvenile crime bill, the House  
rejected gun control provisions adopted earlier by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate agreed earlier this week to begin negotiations with  
the House to resolve the differences between the bills passed by 
each chamber. But House leaders did not appoint its members to the 
House-Senate committee until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the House's earlier rejection of gun control provisions,  
it voted 305-84 for the nonbinding resolution recommending its 
negotiators support the requirement that background checks be 
conducted on all firearms sales at gun shows. Under current law, 
background checks are required only on sales by licensed dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution also calls for including measures to prevent  
violence in schools and ensuring that the legislation does not 
weaken existing gun regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the House Judiciary Committee's top  
Democrat, said the vote was a repudiation of the National Rifle 
Association, which has lobbied against new gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``With today's vote, more than 300 of my colleagues finally  
joined the majority of the Senate in showing the courage to take on 
the NRA and enact tough bans on criminal purchases at gun shows, 
the biggest single loophole in our nation's gun safety laws,'' 
Conyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was particularly important, he said, because it came a  
day after an office shooting that left nine people dead in Atlanta. 
Investigators say Mark O. Barton, an investor, shot nine people to 
death at two brokerage firms on Thursday after killing his wife and 
two children earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the tragedy should put more pressure on  
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this leadership doesn't act and doesn't pass common sense  
gun legislation, they are going to have to explain to the American 
public why the NRA has more influence over them than all the 
mothers and fathers and children of this country,'' said Rep. Nita 
Lowey, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said provisions in the  
House bill that would toughen penalties against teen-age criminals 
would help reduce school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This legislation will not solve every problem, but it will  
take steps to make our schools safer,'' he said in a statement. ``I 
hope our Democrat colleagues put the good of the country in front 
of partisanship as we proceed with this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats said they were pleased to see action on  
legislation that could result in tighter restrictions on gun 
ownership, but they still accused Republicans of obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's move. We are tired of seeing delay. We are tired of  
seeing stonewalling,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. ``We also 
realize and understand that they have dragged their feet on this, 
putting it off until the last week. I don't know what they're 
hoping for, because it's not going away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, in addition to requiring background checks on  
all firearms buyers at gun shows, would require dealers to provide 
safety devices with all handguns, ban importation of certain high 
capacity firearms clips and impose a lifetime prohibition of gun 
ownership by anyone convicted as a juvenile of a serious felony.

<HEADLINE>  Tripp Indicted on Wiretap Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Linda Tripp, whose secretly recorded  
phone conversations with Monica Lewinsky led to the impeachment of 
President Clinton, was charged with illegal wiretapping on Friday, 
making her the only major figure in the sex scandal to face a 
criminal charge. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury indicted Mrs. Tripp on two counts of breaking  
Maryland's wiretapping law. Each offense could carry up to five 
years in prison and a $10,000 fine if she were to be convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's spokesman, Philip Coughter, called the indictment  
``the most disgraceful, transparent campaign of politically 
motivated vengeance in recent American history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyers suggested Mrs. Tripp should be protected as a  
government whistleblower, and said they would challenge the state's 
authority to bring charges because she was given federal immunity 
by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr when she turned over the 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli waved off suggestions that  
the case would be viewed as politically motivated. ``I can't help 
how it will be seen. ... I think we've done our duty,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montanarelli, a Democrat appointed to his post in 1984, said he  
would handle the case himself. 
</P>
<P>
	After a yearlong investigation, the grand jury indicted Mrs.  
Tripp on one count of illegal interception, a charge stemming from 
a phone conversation taped on Dec. 22, 1997, after she was told by 
her lawyer that secret taping was illegal. In conversations taped 
that day, the two women discussed what they should say about Ms. 
Lewinsky's sexual relationship with Clinton in testimony they 
expected to have to give for Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit 
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp also was charged with disclosing the contents of that  
conversation to Newsweek magazine, which published a partial 
transcript of a Tripp-Lewinsky phone call on Feb. 2, 1998. A 
spokeswoman for Newsweek, Jan Angilella, said magazine officials 
would not comment on the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and representatives for Ms. Lewinsky also  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Tripp's more than 20 hours of recordings that  
launched the independent counsel investigation of Clinton's 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings of the two women's rambling and sometimes ribald  
conversations were released publicly by the House Judiciary 
Committee before the House voted to impeach Clinton for perjury and 
obstruction. He was acquitted last Feb. 12 after a Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's wiretap law, which is infrequently prosecuted,  
forbids taping phone conversations without the other party's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignorance of the law is a valid defense. But Mrs. Tripp, who  
recorded the calls in her Columbia, Md., living room, testified for 
Starr's grand jury that she taped several conversations in late 
1997 even after an attorney told her it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp will be allowed to arrange a time to surrender  
voluntarily, her attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sign of Mrs. Tripp at her home on Friday. No one  
answered a knock on the door and neighbors said they had not seen 
her for about a week. A spokesman at the Department of Defense, 
where she works, said she had not come to work since Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, 49, has said she began taping her friend's phone  
calls to protect herself because she was being pressured by Ms. 
Lewinsky to lie in Mrs. Jones' lawsuit against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky confided her sexual encounters with the president  
to Mrs. Tripp after the pair became friends while working together 
at the Pentagon. Ms. Lewinsky wanted Mrs. Tripp to deny knowledge 
of the relationship in an affidavit for Mrs. Jones' sexual 
harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp said Ms. Lewinsky also wanted her to lie about her  
knowledge of an alleged sexual advance by the president against 
White House volunteer Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr gave Ms. Lewinsky immunity from prosecution in return for  
her testimony against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg, who testified in Starr's  
investigation last November, said she had urged Mrs. Tripp to start 
taping. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp also talked with Ms. Goldberg about writing a  
tell-all book about her years at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration aide Bob Weiner -- who was questioned by  
Starr's team about his calls to a Democratic group that urged the 
state to investigate Mrs. Tripp -- said it was ``gratifying that the 
law may finally recognize her abuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Her violations of privacy were an affront to the meaning of  
friendship,'' Weiner said.

<HEADLINE> Injuries Mounting for Cowboys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- The first full-squad workout for the  
Dallas Cowboys was a costly one Friday as two likely starters for 
the preseason opener went down with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Right guard Mike Kiselak, playing with the first-team because of  
two other injuries, seriously damaged his left knee and defensive 
end Kavika Pittman broke several small bones in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Chan Gailey said Kiselak's injury is so bad that ``the  
only question is whether it's a season-ender.'' An MRI was 
inconclusive and he's been scheduled to undergo arthoscopic surgery 
Tuesday in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing Kiselak is yet another blow for a line that already is  
without starter Everett McIver and top backup Tony Hutson. 
</P>
<P>
	McIver tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee last  
November. He's expected to return around the season opener. His 
preseason replacement, Hutson, sprained the medial collateral 
ligament in his right knee Thursday and will be out two to four 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittman should be able to practice with a cast on in two to four  
weeks. Gailey expects him to be fully healed by the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittman's absence allows the Cowboys to give more playing time  
to Ebenezer Ekuban and Peppi Zellner, their top two draft picks, 
and recent signee Alonzo Spellman, who was out of football last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas opens the preseason Aug. 9 against the Cleveland Browns  
in the Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stocks Mixed / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today when  
investors shrugged off dollar-supportive comments by many Japanese 
officials. Tokyo share prices ended mixed after a lower start. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.26 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.42  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 115.40 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 8.06 points,  
or 0.05 percent, closing at 17,861.86. On Thursday, the average 
rose 290.01 points, or 1.65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, there was some end-of-the-month demand for  
dollars earlier in the session but the dollar later lost ground in 
Asia on speculative selling. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of comments by Japanese officials meant to bolster the  
dollar's value against the yen did not have the desired effect 
because they were not followed by any intervention by the Bank of 
Japan, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that Japan is carefully  
watching the foreign exchange market, though he said that recent 
dollar-yen moves reflect a weakening of the dollar rather than a 
strengthening of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other officials, Haruhiko Kuroda, vice finance minister  
for international affairs, said: ``An excessively strong yen is 
undesirable for Japan and Asian economies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback has been weak against major currencies in recent  
weeks, including the euro and yen, on expectations of an economic 
recovery in Japan and fears of inflation in the United States, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the Bank of Japan repeatedly bought dollars in  
an attempt to suppress the yen's surge and aid the nation's 
fledgling economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 115.05 yen and 115.85 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.46 yen, down  
from 123.56 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei index was weighted down by weak  
Japanese economic data, an overnight fall on Wall Street and a 
moderate strengthening of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's unemployment rate climbed to a record high 4.9 percent  
in June from 4.6 percent in May as many companies accelerated their 
restructuring, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Japan's jobless rate was high, dealers said this  
indicator is a lagging figure, adding that Thursday's 
stronger-than-expected 3.0 percent surge in seasonally adjusted 
industrial production for June was more significant. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 511.64  
million shares, compared with Thursday's turnover of 510.74 million 
shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers 621 to 586, with 102 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 11.20 points, or 0.76 percent, to 1,478.93. 
The TOPIX closed up 17.40 points, or 1.20 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.7850 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8050 
percent, driving its price up to 100.12 yen from 99.95 yen.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Ties Sosa With 38th Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire tied Sammy Sosa for the major  
league lead with 38 home runs and set a record for most homers in a 
five-year span when he hit one in the sixth inning of St. Louis' 
game against Colorado on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit a 1-0 pitch from Pedro Astacio into the right-field  
bullpen to lead off the sixth for his 11th homer in 15 games to cut 
the Rockies' lead over the Cardinals to 3-2. He has 257 homers the 
last five years, breaking the record he shared with Babe Ruth, who 
hit 256 from 1926-30. 
</P>
<P>
	The homer was the 495th of his career. He's also one away from  
tying his own record for most homers in four straight seasons. He 
hit 219 from 1995-98. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has hit 480 homers as a first baseman, tying him for  
second place on the career list with Jimmie Foxx. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has two career homers in 14 at-bats against Astacio,  
among the league leaders in homers allowed with 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit his 38th earlier in the day, connecting off Masato  
Yoshii of the New York Mets. He has 282 homers with the Cubs, tying 
Ryne Sandberg for the fourth-highest in team history.

her for about a week. Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a spokesman for the 
Department of Defense, said she had not come to work since Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Family spokesman Philip Coughter said Mrs. Tripp's attorneys are  
bringing on board Steve Kohn, a Washington attorney with experience 
in government whistle-blower cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and representatives for Ms. Lewinsky declined to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, 49, said she began taping her friend's phone calls  
to protect herself because she was being pressured by Ms. Lewinsky 
to lie in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky confided her sexual encounters with the president  
to Mrs. Tripp after the pair became friends while working together 
at the Pentagon. Ms. Lewinsky wanted Mrs. Tripp to deny knowledge 
of the relationship in an affidavit for the sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp said Ms. Lewinsky also wanted her to lie about her  
knowledge of an alleged sexual advance by the president against 
White House volunteer Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg, who testified in Starr's  
investigation last November, said she urged Mrs. Tripp to start 
taping. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp also talked with Ms. Goldberg about writing a  
tell-all book about her years at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached by phone in New York, Ms. Goldberg called Mrs. Tripp a  
``loyal government whistle-blower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now she will be able to have her day in court and tell her  
side of the story,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ``She has never been able 
to tell her side because she has always been under fear of 
indictment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration aide Bob Weiner -- who was questioned by  
Starr's team about his calls to a Democratic group that urged the 
state to investigate Mrs. Tripp -- said it was ``gratifying that the

	``Her violations of privacy were an affront to the meaning of  
friendship,'' Weiner said.

<HEADLINE>  Tripp Indicted on Wiretap Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Linda Tripp, whose secretly recorded  
phone conversations with Monica Lewinsky led to the impeachment of 
President Clinton, was charged with illegal wiretapping on Friday, 
making her the only major figure in the sex scandal to face a 
criminal charge. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury indicted Mrs. Tripp on two counts of breaking  
Maryland's wiretapping law. Each offense could carry up to five 
years in prison and a $10,000 fine if she were to be convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's spokesman, Philip Coughter, called the indictment  
``the most disgraceful, transparent campaign of politically 
motivated vengeance in recent American history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyers suggested Mrs. Tripp should be protected as a  
government whistleblower, and said they would challenge the state's 
authority to bring charges because she was given federal immunity 
by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr when she turned over the 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli waved off suggestions that  
the case would be viewed as politically motivated. ``I can't help 
how it will be seen. ... I think we've done our duty,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montanarelli, a Democrat appointed to his post in 1984, said he  
would handle the case himself. 
</P>
<P>
	After a yearlong investigation, the grand jury indicted Mrs.  
Tripp on one count of illegal interception, a charge stemming from 
a phone conversation taped on Dec. 22, 1997, after she was told by 
her lawyer that secret taping was illegal. In conversations taped 
that day, the two women discussed what they should say about Ms. 
Lewinsky's sexual relationship with Clinton in testimony they 
expected to have to give for Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit 
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp also was charged with disclosing the contents of that  
conversation to Newsweek magazine, which published a partial 
transcript of a Tripp-Lewinsky phone call on Feb. 2, 1998. A 
spokeswoman for Newsweek, Jan Angilella, said magazine officials 
would not comment on the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and representatives for Ms. Lewinsky also  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Tripp's more than 20 hours of recordings that  
launched the independent counsel investigation of Clinton's 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings of the two women's rambling and sometimes ribald  
conversations were released publicly by the House Judiciary 
Committee before the House voted to impeach Clinton for perjury and 
obstruction. He was acquitted last Feb. 12 after a Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's wiretap law, which is infrequently prosecuted,  
forbids taping phone conversations without the other party's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignorance of the law is a valid defense. But Mrs. Tripp, who  
recorded the calls in her Columbia, Md., living room, testified for 
Starr's grand jury that she taped several conversations in late 
1997 even after an attorney told her it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp will be allowed to arrange a time to surrender  
voluntarily, her attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sign of Mrs. Tripp at her home on Friday. No one  
answered a knock on the door and neighbors said they had not seen 
her for about a week. A spokesman at the Department of Defense, 
where she works, said she had not come to work since Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, 49, has said she began taping her friend's phone  
calls to protect herself because she was being pressured by Ms. 
Lewinsky to lie in Mrs. Jones' lawsuit against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky confided her sexual encounters with the president  
to Mrs. Tripp after the pair became friends while working together 
at the Pentagon. Ms. Lewinsky wanted Mrs. Tripp to deny knowledge 
of the relationship in an affidavit for Mrs. Jones' sexual 
harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp said Ms. Lewinsky also wanted her to lie about her  
knowledge of an alleged sexual advance by the president against 
White House volunteer Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr gave Ms. Lewinsky immunity from prosecution in return for  
her testimony against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg, who testified in Starr's  
investigation last November, said she had urged Mrs. Tripp to start 
taping.

<HEADLINE> Cops Lacked Evidence in '93 Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR BLUFF, Ala. (AP) -- Police always suspected Mark Barton was  
at the end of the bloody trail that led out the door of the travel 
trailer where his wife and mother-in-law were hacked to death in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton had the motive, they believed: a $600,000 life insurance  
policy on his wife and a girlfriend on the side. Investigators knew 
he had a temper and an opportunity to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barton denied he did it, and authorities lacked the one  
thing they needed to arrest him: proof he had ever been to the 
camper where Debra Barton and her mother, Eloise Spivey, were 
slain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have any witnesses who could put him there,'' said  
Danny Smith, an investigator with the Cherokee County district 
attorney's office. ``We didn't have any fingerprints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton shot and killed nine people in two Atlanta stock-trading  
offices on Thursday, injuring 13 others. Afterward, his wife and 
two children were found dead in their apartment. They had been 
beaten with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County, Ga., Barton  
acknowledged that the murders of his family were similar to the 
Alabama killings, in which police believe the victims were killed 
with a hatchet. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barton, writing that ``there's no reason for me to lie  
now,'' continued to deny committing the '93 killings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the Georgia rampage, Alabama authorities  
said Friday they were still troubled by the '93 killings but 
believed they did all they could. Barton was the only suspect ever 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of anything we could have done differently,''  
Smith said. ``We knew morally that he had done it, but we could not 
prove it legally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women were found dead on Sept. 5, 1993, inside a  
blood-splattered trailer at a campground along Weiss Lake. As many 
as 600 people were at the campground when the women were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found bloody footprints leading out the camper  
door, but the FBI laboratory could not identify the brand of the 
shoe, taking away one possible link to Barton. Police talked with 
everyone who was at the campground that day, but no one remembered 
seeing Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	Early tests on Barton's company car indicated the possible  
presence of blood around the front seat. But before police could 
analyze the spot again, Barton -- a chemist -- claimed to have 
spilled a soft drink in the vehicle, ruining any potential 
evidence, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another investigator involved in the case, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, said police first became suspicious of Barton after 
he gave ``rehearsed'' answers during an interview. He also refused 
a polygraph test. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only after that, the source said, that officers found out  
about the $600,000 insurance policy on Debra Barton that took 
effect less than a month before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe Barton, involved with another woman, came  
to Alabama to ask her for a divorce and she refused, prompting the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the insurance company, Investors Life Insurance of  
Nebraska, offered to pay the full amount of the policy, provided 
all the money went into a trust fund for the couple's two children. 
Barton refused and eventually settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records show the insurer paid $450,000 on the policy, with  
$150,000 of that going into trust for Barton's children and the 
remainder going to Barton and his lawyers. Michael Hauptman, 
Barton's criminal lawyer, who was not involved in the civil case, 
said he believed the lawyers got about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama authorities said they didn't know whether Barton's  
second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, was the woman he had been dating 
during his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	However, her ex-husband, David Lang, told the New York Daily  
News that she was, and he said he believes she helped Barton cover 
up his involvement in the slayings to collect the insurance policy. 
Lang did not return messages left by The Associated Press on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said that after Barton remarried, he would periodically  
call the investigator and ask why he was a suspect in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a game to him. He got mad at me one time because he  
couldn't convince me he didn't do it,'' Smith said. Once, Smith 
said, ``He told me that he would never go to jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton was good to his word. He committed suicide hours after  
the Atlanta rampage as they closed in on him.

	Atlanta Gunman Left Note Behind  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark O. Barton, the gunman who killed nine people  
at two brokerage firms Thursday, had lost roughly $105,000 in stock 
trading in less than two months, authorities said Friday. He left a 
note vowing revenge on those who had ``greedily sought my 
destruction.'' Barton's wife, son and daughter were found 
bludgeoned to death in the family residence. Thirteen also were 
wounded in the office attacks, with five still in critical 
condition tonight. Barton killed himself to avoid arrest.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed their $792 billion tax cut  
through the Senate Friday, courting a veto struggle this fall with 
President Clinton. The vote was 57-43 -- largely along party lines -- 
in favor of the GOP plan. Democrats claim the bill shortchanges 
Medicare and other domestic programs. The 10-year measure, which 
includes broad-based tax relief as well as provisions designed to 
address the so-called marriage penalty, would make it easier to 
accumulate retirement savings and pay for education.

killing at least nine people and injuring 30 others, officials 
said. At least seven of the wounded were soldiers, Gen. Eduardo 
Herrera, commander of the army's 4th Brigade based in Medellin, 
told Radionet radio. No group had claimed responsibility for the 
attack, but Herrera blamed Colombia's largest rebel army, the 
leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

Midwest has been hit hardest, with Missouri logging 29 heat-related 
deaths, Illinois 23 and Ohio 10. Temperatures neared 100 degrees 
Friday in many cities, and the heat index -- a measure of

Commissioner Susan Ness of the Federal Communications Commission 
called the ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ``a huge

<HEADLINE> Russia To Get $640 Million From IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will receive the first installment of a  
$4.5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund on Sunday, 
Russia's Finance Ministry said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the $640 million will be used to make a loan repayment to  
the IMF that falls due on the same day, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF loan deal, announced Wednesday, was an enormous relief  
for the government. It owes the IMF about $18 billion and has 
struggled to stay current on its debts to the fund since its 
economic meltdown last August. 
</P>
<P>
	That crash saw much-needed international lending grind to a halt  
and sent the economy into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF loan is Russia's first major credit since the August  
crash.

<HEADLINE> British Newspaper Deal Worth $1.98B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Trinity has won the battle for the Mirror Group,  
reaching a deal to acquire the publisher of the tabloid Daily 
Mirror for $1.98 billion in stock and cash 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, to be called Trinity Mirror, will be Britain's  
largest regional newspaper company, with 155 newspapers that have a 
weekly circulation of more than 15.3 million and a daily 
circulation of 2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merged group will have enhanced scale and financial  
strength providing a strong platform for future expansion,'' 
Trinity chairman Peter Birch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is expected to yield annual cost savings of $24  
million by the end of 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal appears to shut the door on a potential third bid for  
Mirror, by an ousted former chief executive of Mirror Group, David 
Montgomery, who said last week he was trying to arrange backing for 
an offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity will pay the equivalent of $4.34 per Mirror share, well  
above the roughly $3.20 offered by rival bidder Regional 
Independent Media. Trinity shareholders will own 48.4 percent of 
the new company, with Mirror investors holding 51.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity chief executive Phil Graf will become head of the new  
group, while Trinity's finance director, Mike Masters, will be 
responsible for regional newspapers. Mirror's head of national 
newspapers, Roger Eastoe, will keep that role in the new business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strategic fit between our two businesses enables us to  
build further on our market-leading positions,'' Mirror Chairman 
Victor Blank said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Stephen Byers approved  
the deal last week on condition that Trinity sell off its four 
newspapers in Northern Ireland, where Mirror Group already owns 
several titles. Byers said he was concerned that there needed to be 
a diverse ownership of newspapers in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition still needs approval from shareholders and  
British regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity's papers include the Western Mail, the Liverpool Echo  
and Daily Post and the Newcastle Journal. Mirror Group owns 
Scotland's Daily Record and Sunday Mail along with the Daily 
Mirror.

<HEADLINE> Neo-Nazi's Gun Permit Denial Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Police were within their rights to deny a  
handgun permit for an American neo-Nazi convicted in Germany of 
spreading hate propaganda, a judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lancaster County Judge Gale Pokorny rejected arguments by Gary  
Lauck that his German conviction could not be held against him 
because the material was disseminated from the United States and 
was protected by his right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Pokorny upheld the permit rejection because Lauck answered  
``no'' on the application when asked if he had been convicted ``in 
any court'' of a crime punishable by more than a year in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauck, 46, was one of the main suppliers of anti-Semitic and  
racist literature and Nazi paraphernalia to German fascists for two 
decades. He frustrated German authorities by churning out hate 
material from his home in Lincoln and sending it overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, he was arrested during a trip to Denmark, and he was  
later extradited to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	There he was convicted of inciting racial hatred and  
distributing pro-Hitler and anti-Jewish propaganda in violation of 
the German Constitution. Lauck spent about four years in prison and 
was deported by Germany this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pokorny suggested Lauck apply to the U.S. Treasury Department  
for an exemption to allow him to get a gun permit despite his 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt LeMieux, head of the Nebraska chapter of the American Civil  
Liberties Union, said he would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauck, who describes himself as a ``free speech advocate,  
publisher and mail-order consultant,'' has said he was using the 
gun permit issue to get the government to admit it sees him as a 
criminal, even though he has not violated American laws.

<HEADLINE> Pats' Woody, Katzenmoyer Reach Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The New England Patriots agreed Friday to  
contracts with their remaining two draft picks, first-rounders 
Damien Woody and Andy Katzenmoyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Woody, a Boston College center taken with the 17th pick of the  
draft, agreed to a contract estimated at $1.25 million a year for 
five years with a $3.85 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	That left the Patriots under the salary cap by $835,000 a year,  
but there was no confirmation that Katzenmoyer, the Ohio State 
linebacker chosen with the 28th pick, received that as part of a 
four-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots hope that Woody, a three-year starter in college,  
can start in place of Dave Wohlabaugh, who left for Cleveland as a 
free agent. Katzenmoyer also may see significant time in his first 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	New England also signed two free agents -- cornerback Nate Brooks  
of Miami and kicker Marcus Williams of Arizona State, who played 
with the Rhein Fire in NFL Europe. Williams had been in the Arizona 
Cardinals camp.

<HEADLINE> Ruiz Wins Pan Am Diving Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Mark Ruiz completed his final dive,  
and he knew it was a thing of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I saw the water go out, I said it was perfect,'' Ruiz  
said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	As he emerged from the pool, he pumped his fist.  
</P>
<P>
	``I usually don't get too excited,'' Ruiz said.  
</P>
<P>
	This was definitely a time for celebration.  
</P>
<P>
	With the dive, the next-to-last in the men's 3-meter springboard  
competition at the Pan American Games, Ruiz had 675.21 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The only diver remaining was his good friend and defending  
champion, Fernando Platas of Mexico. Platas, also the 1999 World 
Cup champion, needed nearly 78 points to win his second Pan Ams 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	His forward somersault with 2 1/2 twists from the pike position and  
a 3.4 degree of difficulty left him just short with 674.25 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women were shut out as Canada's Emilie Heymans and  
Blythe Hartley wound up 1-2 off the platform. 
</P>
<P>
	Also coming up short again was Cuba's powerhouse baseball team,  
which dropped its second straight, 8-1 to Canada. The United States 
beat Brazil 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Another world champion, the U.S. women's softball team, was  
unchallenged by Colombia as Danielle Henderson threw a perfect 
game, striking out 16 in seven innings. Lisa Fernandez went 3-for-3 
in the 9-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon sensation Alexandra Stevenson won her Pan Ams debut  
6-2, 6-0 over Miriam D'Agostini of Brazil. Teammate Lilia Osterloh 
advanced to the second round with a straight set victory over 
Cuba's Yoanny Montesnio. 
</P>
<P>
	The four players and two coaches ejected from Wednesday's  
Guatemala-Canada soccer match all received suspensions Thursday. 
Guatemalan coach Walter Clavieri and three players were suspended 
for the remainder of the games. Another Guatemalan player and 
Canadian coach Bruce Twamley each got one-game suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The soccer disciplinary committee said the three players  
suspended for the rest of the competition punched or kicked referee 
Richard Grady. Police had to rush in to protect Grady when other 
Guatemalan players threatened him. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's Joel Sanchez and Carlos Mercenario finished 1-2 in the  
men's 50-kilometer walk. Mercenario at first was disqualified 
because officials claimed he was given assistance along the course. 
The Mexicans appealed and the disqualification was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States remained atop the medals table with 48 golds,  
43 silvers and 31 bronzes for 122 overall. Canada has 77, with 23 
golds, and Cuba has 69, with 27 golds. 
</P>
<P>
	In winning his first major title, Ruiz made amends for a  
fifth-place finish in Wednesday night's 10-meter platform diving, 
won by Platas. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, the two won each other's best event.  
</P>
<P>
	``He took my gold, I've got to get his,'' Ruiz told his  
stepfather, Armando Velez, after the platform competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz' mother, Lydia Torres, who screamed herself hoarse during  
the springboard diving, said her son ``was very disappointed'' 
after the platform event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him he needed to rest,'' she said. ``I told him not to  
go to morning practice today. He has low blood sugar and he needed 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was around the pool too much yesterday. If he stays here  
all day with nothing to eat, he has no power. Today, he laid in bed 
for a while and was full of energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz showed his most energy on his final dive, a reverse 3 1-2  
somersault with a half twist from the pike position and a 3.5 
degree of difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges liked the dive so much they gave him 90.30 points.  
Platas' final dive was worth only 76.50 points. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother liked his gold medal so much she hugged and kissed  
him, and told him excitedly, ``You make me so proud ... what a 
beautiful gold medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What a relief to win the gold,'' said Ruiz, a native of Puerto  
Rico who came to the United States at 12 and lives in Orlando. ``I 
always had done well in big international meets, getting the bronze 
medal or fourth place, but I never had won the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here to get the gold. I knew I could do it.''  
</P>
<P>
	His final dive vaulted him from third place to first, ahead of  
Platas and Troy Dumais of Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of 17-year-old Canadians finished 1-2 in the women's  
platform diving. Emilie Heymans, the 1997 world junior champion, 
won and Blythe Hartley, the bronze medalist in the springboard 
competition, got the silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's expected dominance in baseball never materialized as  
Canada won the group at 4-0, the United States was second at 3-1 
and both defeated the world champions, who wound up third at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after losing 10-5 to the Americans, the listless Cubans  
fell to the hosts. The last time Canada beat Cuba in baseball was 
at the Intercontinental Cup in Edmonton in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``They looked like they didn't want to be here,'' said catcher  
Andy Stewart, who had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't count the talented, experienced Cubans out yet. They  
still made it to the quarterfinals and they can still win the gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cubans are a good team,'' cautioned Canadian manager Ernie  
Whitt. ``Don't let this victory fool you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States faces Panama, Canada plays Guatemala, Cuba  
takes on the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua plays Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The two teams that make the gold medal game qualify for the  
Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Already owning the second seed in Pool A, the Americans came out  
flat offensively against Brazil, winning behind the pitching of 
Ryan Anderson and Bobby Seay. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Anderson, known as the ``Little Unit,'' struck out  
nine in six innings. Seay came on in the eighth with runners at 
second and third and struck out pinch-hitter T.N. Kussano, then 
fanned two of three in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Hardtke homered for the U.S. team, which managed just five  
hits after getting 19 against Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe Indian Pharmaceutical Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Regulators are investigating whether a  
pharmaceutical company set up by an American Indian tribe illegally 
resold drugs obtained at a deep discount from the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pequot Pharmaceutical Network was created 10 years ago as a  
small health service for members of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe 
and their employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Today it is a $15 million business that handles 250,000  
prescriptions a year. About 70 percent of the business is in 
mail-order prescriptions shipped from the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug manufacturers have different price schedules for different  
customers. As the biggest buyer of pharmaceuticals in the world, 
the federal government gets the lowest price of all. That discount 
is passed on to tribes, as required by the Indian 
Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pequots cannot buy drugs at the discount rate and then  
resell them as part of an independent business venture, George 
Patterson of the Department of Veterans Affairs said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can only dispense medication (from the federal schedule)  
to Indians. ... If, in fact, they are doing otherwise, they're 
going to be asked to stop,'' Patterson said. ``If they don't stop, 
then we would have to pursue some sort of corrective action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said it was too early in the investigation to specify  
what penalties might be imposed, and noted there is no proof that 
the Pequots are taking unfair advantage of federal prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may want to go in there and take a look just to assure  
people everything is kosher,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal spokesman Arthur Henick says the company has a separate  
inventory for non-eligible patients, saying the tribe pays a higher 
rate -- similar to that paid by HMOs -- for those medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We operate under federal guidelines. Those pharmaceuticals are  
basically purchased at a competitive rate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmaceutical company is only a sideline business. The  
tribe's main source of revenue is the Foxwoods Resort Casino, which 
generates upwards of $1 million a day.

<HEADLINE>  13 More Major League Umps Purged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After spending their careers ejecting players,  
13 National League umpires found themselves tossed out. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unprecedented purge precipitated by a labor strategy that  
backfired, 13 NL umps lost their jobs Thursday, meaning one-third 
of major league umps will depart Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe West, famous for slamming pitcher Dennis Cook to the ground  
in 1990, and Eric Gregg, criticized for a wide strike zone in the 
1997 playoffs, were among those let go, management officials said, 
speaking on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hallion, suspended for three games earlier this month for  
bumping a player and coach, will be forced to leave, too, along 
with crew chiefs Frank Pulli and Terry Tata, who have each spent 
more than 25 years in the major leagues and worked four World 
Series apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are some of the finest umpires in the history of this  
game,'' union head Richie Phillips said. ``Terry Tata has worked 
many, many important games. What they're saying is that an umpire 
who has never even worked a spring training game in his life is 
more fit to umpire in the major leagues than Terry Tata. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the conduct of major league baseball is reprehensible  
and oppressive. What they've really done here is attempt to execute 
surrendered prisoners. I absolutely vow to fight to the death in 
this case, and I will never, ever rest until I right this wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine AL umpires were told Monday that their resignations were  
accepted. That means 22 of the 68 major league umpires are 
departing. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulli, 64, has been a member of the NL staff since 1972. He was  
planning to retire after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a slap in the face. This is what I deserve after 28  
years?'' Pulli said from Pittsburgh, where he was to work the 
Florida-Pirates game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to go to war,'' he said. ``This is the biggest favor  
they ever did for this union. These guys will come together, I 
guarantee you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many NL umpires were angry with commissioner Bud Selig and Sandy  
Alderson, the vice president of baseball operations in the 
commissioner's office, saying the moves were made over the 
objection of NL president Len Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a plan by Bud Selig and Sandy Alderson to break the  
union,'' NL umpire Steve Rippley said, adding that the firings have 
made him consider retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Many umpires spent the day wondering if they'd be kept or let  
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting since 6:30 this morning, calling people and  
getting phone calls,'' NL ump Dana DeMuth said in Los Angeles 
before the Dodgers played Cincinnati. ``And from that time on, our 
hearts have been jumping. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're standing here with our heads in a guillotine, and the  
blade is right here,'' he said, holding his hand behind his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	He survived, but also let go were Gary Darling, Bob Davidson,  
Bruce Dreckman, Bill Hohn, Sam Holbrook, Paul Nauert, Larry Poncino 
and Larry Vanover. 
</P>
<P>
	Ability, diversity and experience were among the factors used to  
make the decisions, several management officials said, all speaking 
on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has pushed to increase minority hiring in recent years  
and didn't want to decrease the percentage of minority umpires. 
Baseball also had to be careful not to accept the resignations of 
too many of the union's leaders, because that would open the sport 
to a charge of illegal retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips promised he will file a ``massive, massive unfair labor  
practice charge,'' and hoped to it by Monday. He cited a clause in 
the labor agreement barring ``discrimination or recrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL umpire Jerry Crawford, the union president, said the actions  
were ``illegal, reprehensible and immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 14, the day following the All-Star game, most umpires  
resigned effective Sept. 2, thinking the tactic would force an 
early start to negotiations for a new labor contract. The current 
deal expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than a dozen umpires refused to resign and baseball  
hired 25 replacements from Triple-A, effective Sept. 1. The umpires 
let go sent a letter Tuesday withdrawing the resignations, but 
baseball said it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, in anticipation of baseball's moves, umpires sued  
in federal court in Philadelphia. Their attempt to gain a 
restraining order was denied by U.S. District Judge Edmund V. 
Ludwig, but a hearing on the case will be scheduled after Aug. 12, 
Ludwig's office said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Candidates Comment on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	What the Republican candidates for the White House in 2000 are  
saying about the House and Senate tax cut bills: 
</P>
<P>
	LAMAR ALEXANDER   	
</P>
<P>
	National Political Director Brian Kennedy said Alexander likes  
aspects of both bills, but they don't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the first things he wants to do is triple the child tax  
credit to $8,000 and expand the definition of dependent to include 
care for elderly family members,'' Kennedy said. Alexander also 
wants to eliminate the marriage penalty and create tax incentives 
to encourage parents to save in education savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	GARY BAUER   	
</P>
<P>
	Bauer applauds both bills for the across-the-board tax cuts.  
</P>
<P>
	``I much prefer tax relief on the human side,'' Bauer said. ``I  
am in favor of a capital gains tax cut because I think it is 
important for the Republicans ... to have provisions that are aimed 
at family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer prefers the more sweeping marriage penalty provision in  
the Senate bill. ``It is ridiculous that there is any marriage 
penalty provision at all,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	PAT BUCHANAN   	
</P>
<P>
	Campaign spokesman Bob Adams said Buchanan favors the House  
bill. Buchanan was unavailable to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	GEORGE W. BUSH   	
</P>
<P>
	Bush will announce his own tax and economic plans later this  
year, said campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He believes the marriage penalty should be reduced,'' she  
said. ``He believes the death tax should be reduced. He also 
applauds the House and Senate for working to enact a sizable tax 
cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ELIZABETH DOLE   	
</P>
<P>
	Dole also plans to announce a tax package in the fall.  
</P>
<P>
	``She has no intention of getting involved in the minutiae of  
tax legislation'' now, said campaign spokesman Ari Fleisher. ``She 
is in favor of marriage penalty relief, death tax relief, and she 
has already said ... she would seek a 100 percent health care 
deduction for the self-employed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	STEVE FORBES   	
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who is in favor of a flat tax, thinks both packages are  
flawed, but far better than anything the Democrats would offer, 
said campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	If he were president, he would sign a House-Senate compromise,  
but ``he would prefer whatever moves closer to tax 
simplification,'' Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	ORRIN HATCH   	
</P>
<P>
	Hatch favors across-the-board income tax reductions, capital  
gains tax cuts and the elimination of estate taxes and the marriage 
penalty, said campaign spokesman Jeff Flint. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another priority (for Hatch) in terms of tax cuts would be  
anything that adds greater flexibility to retirement planning,'' 
Flint said. 
</P>
<P>
	JOHN McCAIN  
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he prefers the Senate bill because the marriage  
penalty is better addressed and the bill has more immediate 
benefits for middle-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But, McCain said, ``I am unhappy about the amount of special  
interest loopholes and benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DAN QUAYLE   	
</P>
<P>
	Quayle favors across-the-board tax cuts, but doesn't think the  
House and Senate cuts are deep enough, said campaign spokesman 
Jonathan Baron. Quayle has proposed a 30 percent tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, ``to phase (a tax cut) over 10 years is very long,  
and he has some concerns,'' Baron added.

<HEADLINE> Canada Upsets Cuba in Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- One day after a stirring victory over  
Cuba, the U.S. baseball team came out as flat as the prairie roads 
leading to the host city of the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	When they took the field against Brazil on Thursday night, the  
Americans already knew Canada had beaten Cuba 8-1, clinching the 
second seed in Pool A for the United States. Canada won the group, 
and world champion Cuba was third. 
</P>
<P>
	``We basically threw our hats out there today. We were flat and  
we knew it. We got to rebound and get ready for whoever we play 
next,'' American reliever Bobby Seay said after saving a 3-2 
victory over winless Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Pool play is now over, and it's single elimination time  
beginning Saturday with the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States needs victories Saturday over Panama and  
Sunday to make the gold medal game and qualify for the Sydney 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very emotional game yesterday,'' U.S. coach Buddy  
Bell said, looking back at a 10-5 victory over Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just got done playing Brazil, who some would argue is not  
the strongest team in the tournament. But again, it's just like 
hockey. You go up against a hot goalie you will have a tough 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil reliever Toni Nakashima was especially bothersome to U.S.  
hitters, giving up just two hits in 3 2-3 innings. The Americans, 
who had 19 hits in beating Cuba, managed only five overall. They 
scored the go-ahead run on Mike Neill's bases-loaded fielder's 
choice in the fifth on a double-play ball bobbled by the shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	``The left-hander they brought in was as good a pitcher as we've  
faced this whole tournament as far as command and mixing pitches. 
It's what you have to guard against,'' Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's victory over Cuba means the Americans will not have to  
play the Canadians or Cubans before Monday's finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They looked like they didn't want to be here,'' Canadian  
catcher Andy Stewart said of the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	Seay came on in the eighth with runners at second and third and  
struck out pinch-hitter T.N. Kussano, and then fanned two of three 
in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Hardtke homered for the United States in the first, but  
Brazil took a 2-1 lead in the second using a third-strike wild 
pitch, a throwing error by Neill and an RBI single by Victor 
Higuchi. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States tied the game in the bottom half when Brazil  
starter Douglas Assada fumbled a comebacker, allowing Neill to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil almost went ahead in the eighth, but Estevao Sato's long  
drive hit the top of the left field fence for a double instead of 
going over. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil finished 0-4 and is the only team in the nine-team  
tournament not headed for the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. starter Ryan Anderson, who at 6-foot-10 is known as the  
``Little Unit,'' struck out nine in six innings Thursday night in a 
game played in Stonewall, some 20 miles outside of Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Canada beat Cuba in baseball was at the  
Intercontinental Cup in Edmonton in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a rugged game at times, with Canada's Aaron Guiel  
flattening Cuban catcher Ariel Pestano twice and getting ejected. 
Guiel made no attempt to slide and appeared to deliver a forearm 
shiver to Pestano in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Players from both teams converged at home plate, but Guiel and  
Pestano were separated and no punches were thrown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was angry,'' Guiel said. ``I decided I was going to try and  
take a guy out on the infield or the catcher. I had to show them we 
would stand up for ourselves.''

<HEADLINE>  Heat Wave Death Toll Climbs to 73 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Hector Soto uses the shade to keep track  
of time this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m., the parking lot attendant escapes the heat in the  
shadow of a tree. When the patch recedes at noon, he follows it. An 
hour later, he relies on another temporary spot of cool by the 
guard house on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
	By 3 p.m. there's no place left to hide, and the black pavement  
feels like it's burning through his sandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start to get really dizzy,'' Soto said Thursday as the  
temperatures crept toward 90 degrees. ``You just try to sit still 
in the coolest place you can find and drink a lot of water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This summer's unrelenting heat has been sapping energy from  
outdoor workers, drying up crops and turning forests into kindling 
across Connecticut and elsewhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 73 deaths in 13 states have been blamed on the heat  
wave that has gripped much of country since July 19, as 
temperatures linger in the 90s and 100s. Missouri has the highest 
death toll at 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat was expected to last at least until today before a  
change in the jet stream brings cooler air from Canada to northern 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures reached the 90s from the Plains to the East Coast  
on Thursday, with the heat index -- a measure of temperature and 
humidity -- breaking 100 in many places. 
</P>
<P>
	To the north, the weather was even worse. It was 111 in Pierre,  
S.D., topping the record of 109 set in 1933. The temperature was a 
record-tying 104 in Bismarck, N.D., and an all-time high of 103 in 
Dickinson, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, a 7-year-old girl appeared to be the latest victim.  
Her body was found Thursday afternoon in her bedroom in the 
family's mobile home in Grove. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no air conditioning or fans, and the windows of the  
trailer were closed,'' said Dr. Robert Hopper, the acting medical 
examiner. ``It was hard to breathe just walking in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air conditioning has become a necessity for many trying to beat  
the heat. But for people whose jobs force them to stay outside, 
getting a steady stream of cool air is a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last summer you could work 10 hours a day with no problem,''  
said Angel Santos, a Hartford, Conn. landscaper. ``This year you 
can't even stay out for seven hours. My reward is going home, 
putting on the air conditioner and chilling the house to 65 
degrees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Greenfield, Wis., Scott Lewitzke, the landscape manager for  
Bluemel's Garden Center and Greenhouse, said the heat means less 
productivity for his workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys just work at a much slower pace,'' Lewitzke said. ``If  
you get 50 percent productivity, you're lucky. And you can't expect 
much more in the heat -- they'll pass out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Near Mamuelle, Ark., where temperatures rose above 100 Thursday,  
roadside vendor Carolyn Archer has closed down her vegetable and 
fruit stand early each day this week to avoid the afternoon heat. 
For the time when she is outside, she has tools to keep cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have an ice chest full of ice, water, juice and plenty of  
wash rags to dig down there to keep cool,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For people lucky enough to have access to fans and air  
conditioning, power companies urged them to conserve energy, 
fearing potential blackouts or brownouts due to consumer overload. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the Kentucky's largest utilities made a special plea to  
their largest customers. Both utilities set all-time peak-usage 
records for the fourth time since July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response has been very favorable,'' said Joel Reuter, a  
spokesman for LG&AMP;E Energy Corp., the Louisville-based parent of the 
two utilities. ``I think that people and industry in the Midwest 
understand that this gripping heat wave has put a tremendous amount 
of pressure on electrical utilities in the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was bothered by the heat. In Grand Rapids, Mich.,  
where temperatures reached 95, Jim Pikaart stood in the shade 
outside a coffee shop -- while sipping tea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where I'm from, it's been really hot and really dry. This is  
really nice and breezy,'' said the Summersville, W. Va., resident. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minnesota, it reached 98 degrees on Thursday, tying a record  
set in 1933. Still, Dana Buffie spent most of her day under the sun 
riding a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents don't understand, either,'' said the 26-year-old  
said. ``I think it's beautiful. I love being out in this weather -- 
blue skies, hot and people everywhere. I like to see bodies out, 
skin exposed, people's faces.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Urged on Airline Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government should act to increase  
competition within the airline industry but not in the way the 
Transportation Department plans to do it, says a new report to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study commissioned by the department, the National Research  
Council, said Friday that steps should include dropping flight 
restrictions at popular airports in New York, Chicago and 
Washington and creating special ``congestion fees'' that would 
raise extra money for gate and terminal construction. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the council said the federal government should end  
prohibitions against foreign investment in and ownership of U.S. 
airlines. Doing so ``could result in more seed money for start-up 
carriers, putting them in a stronger position to compete for 
customers,'' the council said in a statement issued with the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report stems from efforts by both the department and  
Congress to improve airline competition to send more flights to 
small and medium-size communities and to reduce air fares 
throughout the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, amid allegations that major airlines were squashing  
discount rivals, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater proposed 
guidelines to determine if airlines were engaging in unfair 
practices. The airlines panned the proposal and, after debate, 
Congress asked instead for a new assessment of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department had no immediate response to the  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	John Meenan of the Air Transport Association, a trade group  
representing the nation's major airlines, said the group had not 
yet seen the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Research Council is the principal operating arm of  
the National Academy of Sciences, which provides advice on science 
and technology under a congressional charter. The council last 
studied airline competition in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The new committee's 11 members include Alfred Kahn, a Cornell  
University economics professor who has been dubbed ``the father of 
airline deregulation'' for his work in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	In its report, the committee unanimously agreed that the  
Transportation Department's proposed competition guidelines were 
``flawed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1998, the department promised to block airline actions,  
taken in response to new competition, that officials deemed 
unreasonable. Such a policy, the committee said, ``could lead to 
regulations that would stifle competition more than encourage it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members split over remedies. Some favored having the  
department more aggressively enforce existing laws against tactics 
aimed solely at driving out competition. Others favored having the 
Justice Department take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said the Transportation Department should try to  
``steer air traffic away from the nation's busiest airports and 
toward secondary airports in major cities. ... A recommended tool 
to achieve this is a system that would charge airlines fees for 
using congested airports during peak periods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such fees, the committee said, would provide revenue for airport  
construction and reduce delays caused by overcrowded gates. New 
gates also would break the grip that dominant airlines have on 
existing gates. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said limits on takeoffs and landings in Chicago,  
New York and Washington airports, as well as a 1,250-mile limit on 
the length of flights to and from Reagan National Airport in 
Washington, are barriers to competition by new airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines also received criticism. The committee complained that  
carriers that give bonus commissions to travel agents who steer 
business to them can inhibit consumer access to the lowest fares. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said the Transportation Department should consider rules  
to govern how flights are displayed in computer reservations 
systems so every airline has an equal chance for business.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Ban Fruit Pesticide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is banning a pesticide sprayed  
on as much as 30 percent of the nation's apple crop and cutting 
back on the widespread use of another chemical for the control of 
insects on fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions, to be announced Monday by the Environmental  
Protection Agency, stem from fears that the pesticides can cause 
damage to the brain and nervous system, especially in young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials say this year's crop of apples and produce  
that have been sprayed with the chemicals are safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing to worry about,'' said Allen Jennings, director  
of the Agriculture Department's office of pest management policy. 
``I still plan on feeding my kids as many as they will eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EPA is acting under a 1996 law that requires it to reassess  
tolerance levels, or margins of safety, for hundreds of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials refused Friday to discuss their plans. Details  
of the restrictions remained under negotiation with the pesticide 
makers, industry and government sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said, however, that methyl parathion would be banned from  
use on all fruit and many vegetables, and growers probably will be 
required to use smaller amounts of azinphos-methyl. 
</P>
<P>
	Azinphos-methyl is used on 80 percent of the nation's apples and  
on a wide variety of other crops, from pears to cotton and sugar 
beets. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups, who contend the pesticides are dangerous,  
have been pushing for the restrictions for some time. They accused 
EPA of putting off decisions on other dangerous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is whether EPA has met its obligation to address  
the worst pesticides first. We think they've misled the public into 
believing that they have,'' said David Willinga, a senior scientist 
for the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Methyl parathion and azinphos-methyl are two of about 40  
pesticides known as organophosphates, which account for most 
pesticides used by American farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA must evaluate 10,000 uses of various pesticides under the  
Food Quality Protection Act. Tuesday is the deadline for the agency 
to have finished the first third of those. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups say no sound scientific basis exists for restricting  
the two pesticides. They fear the public will react by shunning 
this year's crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an irresponsible action by the agency to take this action  
now. The data they're using to make this assessment is not 
complete,'' said Adam Sharp, director of governmental relations for 
the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	A controversial portion of the 1996 law required EPA to  
compensate for incomplete scientific data about pesticide effects 
by using an additional margin of error of 10 times the current 
limit for cumulative exposures. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have alternative chemicals but they like to rotate  
pesticides to prevent insects from building tolerances to them, 
said Wally Ewart, vice president for scientific affairs with the 
Northwest Horticultural Council in Yakima, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we lose this material, and we lose some other materials,  
over time we will get to a point where we have a loss of control 
and the cost will go up,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Eagles, McNabb Agree to 7-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Donovan McNabb and the Philadelphia Eagles  
agreed to a seven-year contract worth as much as $54 million with 
incentives Friday night, ending contentious negotiations that were 
marred by racial accusations by his agent. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, the No. 2 pick in the draft, agreed to the deal and got  
on a plane to Philadelphia, where he was expected to sign it late 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Fletcher Smith, whose comments about race playing a role  
stalled the negotiations, said the deal does not include voidable 
years like deals signed by top quarterbacks Tim Couch, Peyton 
Manning and Ryan Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes an $11.3 million signing bonus and incentive clauses  
that would trigger higher salaries in the final three years of the 
deal -- a similar structure to the one running back Ricky Williams 
got from New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always said the voidable structure was a structure I was  
interested in getting, because it had been done for the other top 
quarterbacks,'' Smith said. ``If I could not get that structure, I 
would be happy with a contract that gave us the same kind of things 
as the voidable structure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line: While McNabb's total package could be worth  
more than Couch's $48 million, seven-year deal, it guarantees 
nothing more than a minimum salary beyond the fourth year if McNabb 
doesn't play in the first three. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy with the deal,'' Smith said. ``It's an attractive  
package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb missed his fifth day of practice Friday and second day of  
full-squad workouts. The first-round draft choice is slated to back 
up starting quarterback Doug Pederson for the Eagles, who were 3-13 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb will report to training camp at Lehigh University  
Saturday in time for the first day of full-squad workouts in pads. 
On Thursday, new coach Andy Reid stressed the importance of McNabb 
getting his contract resolved and reporting to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day, every practice, every rep he is missing, you can't  
get those back,'' Reid said. ``There's no price that you can put on 
those. Donovan needs to be here, and we want him here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eagles executive vice president Joe Banner said, ``Andy believes  
in Donovan very passionately. He wanted Donovan to be there, but he 
never lost faith in Donovan and was incredibly supportive of what I 
trying to do as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and the Eagles had been at an impasse over the structure  
of the final few years of the contract. The Eagles were against 
voidable years and a buy-back clause, and essentially won that 
showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the media focused on voidable years, although it  
was an important issue, it was not the only issue,'' Banner said. 
``We tried to come up with satisfactory tradeoff. Ultimately, that 
led to a package that probably isn't exactly what either of us 
wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations ceased for two days this week after Smith's  
comments about race playing a role in the talks aired on a cable 
television show. Smith cited white quarterbacks who got voidable 
contracts and a black quarterback, Steve McNair, who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	But the talks were salvaged when Smith, who is based in Chicago  
and has dealings with former NBA superstar Michael Jordan, flew to 
Philadelphia on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it would be more constructive if we worked face to  
face, rather than on the phone where there can be distractions,'' 
Banner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Banner acknowledged that the controversy affected the  
negotiations, both sides said they thought it was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given that the statement came out of my mouth, I never really  
felt that race was an issue to begin with,'' Smith said. ``It 
didn't interfere with the discussions, especially over the past two 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the contract includes 8-10 incentives. If any  
incentive is reached in any of the first three seasons, the 
escalated salaries in the final three years kick in. He named three 
of the incentives: 1,601 passing yards, 30 touchdowns and a 100 
quarterback rating. 
</P>
<P>
	If the escalators kick in, Smith said McNabb's salary would be  
``about 5 percent more'' than Couch's in the final three seasons.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stocks Mixed / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today when  
investors shrugged off dollar-supportive comments by many Japanese 
officials. Tokyo share prices ended mixed after a lower start. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.26 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.42  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 115.40 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 8.06 points,  
or 0.05 percent, closing at 17,861.86. On Thursday, the average 
rose 290.01 points, or 1.65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, there was some end-of-the-month demand for  
dollars earlier in the session but the dollar later lost ground in 
Asia on speculative selling. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of comments by Japanese officials meant to bolster the  
dollar's value against the yen did not have the desired effect 
because they were not followed by any intervention by the Bank of 
Japan, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that Japan is carefully  
watching the foreign exchange market, though he said that recent 
dollar-yen moves reflect a weakening of the dollar rather than a 
strengthening of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other officials, Haruhiko Kuroda, vice finance minister  
for international affairs, said: ``An excessively strong yen is 
undesirable for Japan and Asian economies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback has been weak against major currencies in recent  
weeks, including the euro and yen, on expectations of an economic 
recovery in Japan and fears of inflation in the United States, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the Bank of Japan repeatedly bought dollars in  
an attempt to suppress the yen's surge and aid the nation's 
fledgling economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 115.05 yen and 115.85 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.46 yen, down  
from 123.56 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei index was weighted down by weak  
Japanese economic data, an overnight fall on Wall Street and a 
moderate strengthening of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's unemployment rate climbed to a record high 4.9 percent  
in June from 4.6 percent in May as many companies accelerated their 
restructuring, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Japan's jobless rate was high, dealers said this  
indicator is a lagging figure, adding that Thursday's 
stronger-than-expected 3.0 percent surge in seasonally adjusted 
industrial production for June was more significant. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 511.64  
million shares, compared with Thursday's turnover of 510.74 million 
shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers 621 to 586, with 102 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 11.20 points, or 0.76 percent, to 1,478.93. 
The TOPIX closed up 17.40 points, or 1.20 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.7850 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8050 
percent, driving its price up to 100.12 yen from 99.95 yen.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Couple Adopts 10 Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Van and Shirley Hughes have soothed the pangs  
of empty-nest syndrome in a big, big way. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, both 52, have adopted 10 brothers and sisters who  
range in age from 4 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy, I'm grateful,'' said Frank, their new 17-year-old  
son. He called the Hugheses ``angels from above.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hughes family expansion, finalized by a court commissioner  
on Thursday, is believed to be one of the nation's largest sibling 
group adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody thinks we're crazy, but the pros outweigh the  
cons,'' Mrs. Hughes said. ``The children are the best things in my 
life. They're more blessings than trials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the children in April 1995 in a trash-strewn house  
in downtown Phoenix, living among rodents and fending for 
themselves after their mother abandoned them. 
</P>
<P>
	About that time, with their own two sons having moved out and  
married, the Hugheses decided to become foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, 3-year-old Maria arrived at their home. Twelve days  
later, Arizona child welfare workers asked the couple to take 
5-year-old Enrique and his 6-year-old brother, Juan. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more siblings -- 3-year-old Veronica and 2-year-old Donicio --  
came in January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The five older children regularly visited their siblings, and in  
June 1997, caseworkers asked the Hugheses if they wanted to take 
them all. 
</P>
<P>
	``My head told me `no,' but my heart told me `yes,''' said  
Hughes, who took early retirement from the Navy as a prerequisite 
for the mass adoption. ``They're brothers and sisters, and they 
belong together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room, the couple converted a garage and dining room to  
transform their home into one with six bedrooms, three bathrooms 
and 11 TVs. They receive $6,600 a month in state aid for the 
children, and Hughes works as a night watchman to help cover the 
family's $1,500 monthly grocery bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jane Hull lauded them for ``providing a new world full of  
love, support and safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said the 10 children are thriving, with many of them  
straight-A students and excelling in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should see us at Christmas,'' he said. ``It takes four  
hours to open presents, and that's just for the children. But you 
can't buy what we give to them, and we can't buy what they give to 
us.''

<HEADLINE> Belgium To Limit Meat Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Belgium has told the European Union it  
will severely restrict meat exports in August following more 
uncertainty about the extent of dioxin contamination of Belgian 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian government pledged to prohibit the export of  
livestock and meat products throughout the month unless it has been 
tested and declared dioxin free, said Gerry Kiely, agriculture 
spokesman for the European Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictions results from growing fears that the number of  
Belgian farms that used animal feed tainted with the cancer-causing 
chemical is larger that thought. ``Between now and the end of 
August we should have a definitive list of the (affected) farms,'' 
Kiely told reporters at EU headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium made its pledge after several EU nations at meeting of  
European veterinary experts Thursday complained they lacked clear 
information from about the scope of the country's dioxin problem 
and threatened to ban Belgian foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Some EU nations have already introduced new restrictions on  
Belgian imports following revelations in the past few days that the 
dioxin contamination, first uncovered in May, may have affected 
more farms than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the Belgian government said this week it will  
destroy tens of thousands of tons of stockpiled meat that cannot be 
certified as dioxin-free. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest export restrictions will tighten an export  
certificate system imposed in June by the EU Commission to allow 
Belgium to resume food sales banned because of the dioxin scare. 
</P>
<P>
	The current system lets Belgium issue export certificates to  
farms not linked to the feed company believed to be the sole source 
of the dioxin contamination. Through August all animals and animal 
products for export will have to be individually tested to ensure 
they are dioxin free. 
</P>
<P>
	Dioxin is believed to have entered the food chain through motor  
oil dumped in recycled cooking fat used in the production of animal 
feeds.

<HEADLINE> GOP Unable To Produce HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to put the issue of regulating health  
maintenance organizations behind them, Republicans are struggling 
to produce legislation that could keep their fractured party 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chances were looking increasingly dim Thursday. Leaders  
have said they need to come up with a bill this week if they want 
to take it to the House floor before they leave for an August break 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a 70-yard field goal,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., said after a closed-door meeting of House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP meeting was called to discuss health care, but with no  
plan to present to their members, the leaders spent most of the 
meeting talking about spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	With a thin majority in the House, and Democrats united against  
them, Republicans need virtually every GOP vote to pass a bill 
imposing new regulations on HMOs and other managed-care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a problem'' among Republicans, acknowledged Rep.  
Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., who chairs one of the House's health 
subcommittees and was in meetings for hours this week looking for a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans want a limited bill that would give patients  
new rights to appeal denials of care and some new power to see 
doctors, without giving them new rights to sue or removing a health 
plan's right to determine what care is medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	But a group led by Reps. Charlie Norwood of Georgia, Tom Coburn  
of Oklahoma and Greg Ganske of Iowa -- all health care providers 
before entering Congress -- is pushing for a more sweeping 
legislation, similar to the Democrats' approach. Together with 
Republicans who are generally moderate on social issues, they say 
they have anywhere from 20 to 60 Republicans who will vote with 
them if the issue goes to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., was working with Bilirakis and other  
leaders on Wednesday and Thursday, but they failed to produce a 
bill they believe could pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate already passed an HMO bill, voting mostly along party  
lines, but President Clinton has threatened to veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some House Republicans were talking to Democrats  
about joining in a bipartisan bill. Ganske said he met with 
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., Wednesday. And ``serious'' 
talks with other like-minded Republicans are ongoing, said Sue 
Harvey, a Gephardt spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can find a way to get to a bipartisan bill that we can  
pass, we're going to try to pass it,'' Gephardt told reporters. It 
would take only a handful of Republicans to join united Democrats 
and pass a bill Democrats favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's spokesman, John Feehrey, acknowledged that little  
progress had been and the issue may have to wait until the House 
returns in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a GOP working group -- coincidentally, led by Hastert  
before he became speaker -- came up with an HMO bill that narrowly 
passed the House. But when Hastert took over as speaker, he said he 
wanted the regular committees to write legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Norwood and others prevented Republicans on two separate  
committees from passing strict GOP legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bipartisan discussions were under way in the Commerce Committee,  
but early this week, Hastert asked a small group to come up with a 
bill that could be taken directly to the House floor. Hastert's 
backers said he wanted legislation on the floor before the August 
break, but Coburn, Ganske and others suspect that he didn't like 
what Commerce was likely to produce. 
</P>
<P>
	``His cover for months and months was 'well, you know, we'll  
just let the committee process do its job,''' Ganske said. ``But 
when it became obvious that we had the votes to bring out a good 
bill, all of a sudden, man, that just goes by the wayside.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Author Ponders Bailout Money By MARTIN FACKLER </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- What would you do with $60 billion?  
</P>
<P>
	For Japan's government last March, the answer was simple: bail  
out a bunch of bankers. That decision so outraged one of Japan's 
best-known writers that he has written an unusual book -- and his 
proposals are striking a chord with many readers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryu Murakami's latest book is actually more of a list: 122 other  
ways that the $60 billion could have been put to use. 
</P>
<P>
	And while it looks like a children's book, with its big,  
colorful illustrations and simple explanations, Murakami said its 
message is anything but childish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to give the public the information, in a very  
understandable format, so they can decide for themselves whether 
this was the best choice,'' Murakami told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, readers discover that a fraction of the money,  
about $7 billion, could teach all the illiterate children in 
developing countries how to read and write. 
</P>
<P>
	Add $6 billion, and you could also buy blankets for all the  
homeless children in those countries. And enough would still be 
left over to, say, clean up all the world's land mines for $33 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports fans learn that for $1 billion -- mere pocket change in  
the overall bailout scheme -- Japan could have bought the Chicago 
Bulls basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanciful as some of these ideas may be, Murakami said he hopes  
the book, entitled ``What Could That Money Have Bought?,'' will 
give readers a sense of just how big the sum is -- and get them 
thinking if it could have been better spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just think of what Japan could have done if its banks hadn't  
lost all that money,'' Murakami said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murakami is better known at home and abroad for his novels,  
which are often violent portrayals of disillusionment in modern 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	His first, ``Almost Transparent Blue,'' sold 1.4 million copies  
and won Japan's most prestigious literary award, the Akutagawa 
Prize. He has also branched into other media, directing the recent 
movie ``Tokyo Decadence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The illustrated book, a new departure for Murakami, sold almost  
30,000 copies in the week and a half since going on sale July 19. 
The publisher, Shogakkan, says 20,000 more are being rushed to 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Murakami said he happened upon the idea two years ago while  
reading in the newspaper about the collapse of a large Japanese 
brokerage. An article nearby reported on a buyout offer for British 
luxury automaker Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
	Murakami said he sat up in shock when he realized the money lost  
by the brokerage was enough to buy a company as famous as 
Rolls-Royce -- not once, but four times over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just blew up,'' he recalled. ``I hope my book draws the same  
reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he found most of the figures in the book by searching  
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Murakami said he is not against the bailout in principle.  
Japan's banks are saddled with bad loans made during the 
speculative surge in land prices in the 1980s. Fixing the problem 
is viewed as a crucial step in the attempts to revive an economy 
from the worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he believes Tokyo lawmakers handed the money to some  
of the world's largest companies without a proper explanation to 
the taxpayers, who must ultimately foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese leaders don't tell the public anything. They just  
expect the public to follow,'' he said. ``A modern country like 
Japan needs better information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it comes in the form of a children's book.

<HEADLINE> Reed May No Longer Fit in Buffalo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- First, Dominik Hasek. Next up may be  
Andre Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	These are unsettling times for Buffalo sports.  
</P>
<P>
	Reed, the Buffalo Bills' leading career receiver, is an expected  
holdout with training camp about to begin. His agent says he will 
retire if the team doesn't renegotiate his contract, release him or 
trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	Retirement now appears to lead the list.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's his only option,'' Jack Wirth said Friday, a day after  
Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek announced from the Czech 
Republic he will retire after next season. ``They said they won't 
trade him or release him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wirth said he last spoke with Buffalo general manager John  
Butler on Thursday, with no resolution in sight. Butler was not 
immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed was a no-show for two minicamps, including a mandatory one  
in June. He is to earn $1.3 million this season, leaving the 
35-year-old receiver underpaid next to comparable players. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed recorded his 12th season of 50 or more catches last year,  
which tied him with Jerry Rice for the NFL record. Rice makes $6 
million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wirth would not say how much money Reed is seeking. But the  
Bills signed 36-year-old quarterback Doug Flutie, tackle Jerry 
Ostroski and defensive back Ken Irvin for money well above what 
Reed is making. 
</P>
<P>
	In 14 seasons Reed has played more games than any player in team  
history. He is third in the NFL record book with 889 receptions and 
sixth in receiving yards with 12,559. He has caught a pass in 33 
consecutive games, the team's longest streak. He missed only one 
game last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills reportedly say they have no room under the salary cap  
for more money for Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they say it's the cap, they're lying,'' Wirth told The  
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed's departure could mean more playing time for second-round  
draft pick Peerless Price, set to sign a four-year contract with an 
$800,000 signing bonus this afternoon. Price is said to have fully 
recovered from a knee sprain in minicamp in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Moulds came on strong last year with a Pro Bowl season in  
which he broke the Bills' season record for receiving yards with 
1,368, breaking Reed's mark of 1,312 set in 1989. Moulds averaged 
20.4 yards per catch last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed had 63 catches for 795 yards and five touchdowns last year.

<HEADLINE> Locals Hope for Texas 'White House' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRAWFORD, Texas (AP) -- It's not just George W. Bush's bid for  
the White House that has residents abuzz in this one-stoplight 
town. The Republican presidential front-runner also has made a bid 
on a local ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulars at the coffee shop and gas station say they hope the  
Texas governor will follow the example of native son Lyndon B. 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president often returned to the LBJ Ranch near  
Johnson City and delighted in showing off the land to foreign 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that might be his intention. If that happens, it's  
something we could be proud of,'' said Randy Sherman, a Texas 
history teacher at Crawford High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush says he's interested in the property, about 90 miles  
southwest of Dallas, but won't say whether a closing date has been 
set. 
</P>
<P>
	A work team recently made a survey of the nearly 1,500-acre  
ranch and crews are researching whether Bush could build a private 
100-acre fishing lake on the land. That report will tell Bush 
whether he can build a stock tank on the property, which would be 
important to the avid fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many in the 700-resident town like the idea of Bush  
moving in, the sale will be bittersweet for Ken Engelbrecht, who 
has lived on the family homestead his entire life, farming the 
property and raising cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Engelbrecht said one reason the family is selling its holdings

	Stocks Close Lower; Dow Down 136.14  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks slid for a second straight session today,  
with the Dow Jones industrial average languishing behind other 
market indicators amid continuing concerns over rising interest 
rates. At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow was down 
136.14 points at 10,655.15, adding to a 180-point plunge yesterday. 
Broader market indexes were also lower, although their losses were 
much more moderate. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.49 to 
2,638.52. Shares extended their losses from a selloff yesterday 
sparked when the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index 
rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter, a bigger-than-expected 
jump. The figures are closely monitored by Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan.

	Personal Income Soars in June  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income galloped ahead  
faster than spending in June, the government said today. New home 
sales, meanwhile, rose 3.1 percent as buyers rushed to beat slowly 
rising mortgage rates. Both reports, economists said, were an 
outgrowth of a healthy U.S. economy, a low unemployment rate, a 
strong stock market and benign inflation. Neither report was 
expected to raise eyebrows at the Federal Reserve, which nudged up 
interest rates June 30 in a pre-emptive strike against inflation, 
economists said. The Commerce Department said personal income, 
which includes wages, interest and government benefits, rose a 
faster-than-expected 0.7 percent last month. It was the biggest 
income gain since a 0.9 percent rise in November and marked the 
first time since January that income growth outpaced the rise in 
spending.

	London Stock Exchange Makes Change

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Change is coming to the London Stock Exchange. The  
management board of Britain's largest stock market said today that 
it plans to end the LSE's 240-year status as a member-owned 
organization and transform it into a company controlled by 
shareholders. The proposal aims to make the exchange more 
competitive and efficient in an era of intensified electronic 
trading. Initial shareholders will be the exchange's 294 current 
members, but they will be able to sell their shares to third 
parties, including foreign investors. A next possible step is seen 
as listing itself as a publicly traded company.

	Feds Urged on Airline Competition  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government plan to crack down on predatory  
practices within the airline industry is flawed and the 
Transportation Department should take other steps to boost 
competition, says a report to Congress released today. The National 
Research Council, in a study commissioned by the department, said 
airline competition could be improved by dropping flight 
restrictions at popular airports in New York, Chicago and 
Washington, and by creating special ``congestion fees'' that would 
raise extra money for gate and terminal construction. In addition, 
the council said the federal government should end its prohibition 
against foreign investment in and ownership of U.S. airlines.

telephone companies SBC Communications and Ameritech. The decision 
removes one of the few remaining obstacles to completion of the 
Baby Bell merger, which has already been cleared by the Justice 
Department and Ohio state regulators. In a separate decision based 
on today's ruling, the Indiana court also said the Indiana Utility 
Regulatory Commission has no jurisdiction over the pending merger 
of Bell Atlantic and GTE. SBC stock was up 11/16 at 57 1/8 today; 
Ameritech was up 1 9/16 at 73 5/16.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Web sites in the United States and elsewhere  
devoted to the Falun Gong meditation group are coming under heavy 
electronic attack, managers of the sites said today, and at least 
one ``hacking'' attempt appears to trace back to a Chinese national 
police bureau in Beijing. Falun Gong has been banned in China, 
where communist authorities are engaged in an escalating crackdown, 
arresting adherents and confiscating publications and videos. Bob 
McWee, of Middletown, Md., a Falun Gong practitioner, said a site 
he maintains to promote the group, www.falunusa.net, has been under 
persistent electronic assault.

	EPA To Issue new Pesticides Rules

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is set to

fruit and vegetables. Some uses of methyl parathion will be banned, 
including its application on apples and other fruit, and 
azinphos-methyl also will be restricted, according to sources 
familiar with the EPA's plans. The action stems from concerns that 
the pesticides can cause nervous system damage, especially in young 
children.

North Korea. With no direct flights from anywhere in the outside 
world, it's not easy to get to the $180 million Seaview Casino 
Hotel in North Korea's Rajin economic free zone, which opens

<HEADLINE> Pebble Beach Golf Course Is Sold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The $820 million sale of one of the  
world's most famous golf courses to a group that includes actor 
Clint Eastwood, pro golfer Arnold Palmer and former baseball 
commissioner Peter Ueberroth was finalized Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The group agreed to buy the Pebble Beach Co. in June from the  
Lone Cypress Co., a subsidiary of Japanese golf resort operator 
Taiheiyo Club Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this transaction, Taiheiyo Club Inc. has fulfilled its  
commitment to return the crown jewel of golf in the United States 
to American hands,'' Taiheiyo Club president Shoichi Okochi said. 
``We are very proud to have had the opportunity to be a part of the 
history of Pebble Beach resorts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The selling price suggests Pebble Beach has recovered most of  
its value since Marvin Davis sold it in 1990 to Minoru Isutani for 
an estimated $850 million. Isutani sold it two years later to Lone 
Cypress for an estimated $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ownership group, which also includes former United  
Airlines executive Richard Ferris and the General Electric Pension 
Trust, will retain the Lone Cypress name. Bill Perocchi, a former 
executive with Doubletree Hotels and Promus Hotels, was named the 
company's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pebble Beach Golf Links, Spyglass Hill Golf Course, The  
Links at Spanish Bay and Del Monte Golf Course changed hands in the 
deal. Also included are The Lodge at Pebble Beach, The Inn at 
Spanish Bay and the 17-mile drive that winds through Pebble Beach 
and nearby Del Monte Forest. There are also plans to develop a new 
course and build 300 homes in Pebble Beach.

<HEADLINE> EEOC Investigating Morgan Stanley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Federal agency is investigating alleged gender  
discrimination at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, after an executive 
with the venerable firm filed a sex bias complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involving Allison Schieffelin, a veteran saleswoman,  
comes amid growing awareness of discrimination in venerable Wall 
Street firms. 
</P>
<P>
	In charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity  
Commission last year, Ms. Schiefflin claims she was passed over 
repeatedly for promotions, although less qualified men received 
them, court papers show. She also alleges that Morgan Stanley 
retaliated against her for trying to raise the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Jeanmarie McFadden called the charges  
``without merit.'' She said the company is ``firmly committed to 
the issue of diversity in the workplace'' and does not tolerate 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC took Morgan Stanley to Federal District Court in  
Manhattan on Wednesday, seeking a court order to force the company 
to turn over information about women's pay and promotion policies, 
Ms. Schiefflin's lawyer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC took the action because Morgan Stanley did not comply  
with a February subpoena seeking the data. A person close to Morgan 
Stanley, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the information 
sought by the EEOC was ``irrevelant'' to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is, at one level, the glass ceiling syndrome on Wall  
Street that everybody knows is there,'' said Ms. Schieffelin's 
lawyer, Wayne Outten. 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC supervisory trial attorney handling the case, Elizabeth  
Grossman, said her New York office has been receiving more 
discrimination complaints involving Wall Street. She didn't give 
any details. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court papers and Outten, Ms. Schiefflin was passed  
over for the position of managing director in 1996 and 1998. In 
March 1998, her boss told her that she probably would never be 
promoted to the position, Outten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outten said that Ms. Schieffelin planned to stay at the firm,  
and hoped that her action would result in her promotion to managing 
director. ``She's interested in trying to change the organization, 
have them present a level playing field for her and other women,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995, Ms. Schieffelin had complained in writing that her  
boss discriminated against women, Outten said. She had also filed 
internal sexual harassment charges that Outten said were handled 
properly by Morgan Stanley in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Her complaint to the EEOC also charges that Morgan Stanley tried  
to force the matter before an industry arbitration panel to prevent 
Ms. Schieffelin from filing a discrimination lawsuit. The New York 
Stock Exchange, however, rejected Morgan Stanley's attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	In a high-profile case against a Wall Street firm, eight women  
sued the nation's largest brokerage in February 1997 on behalf of 
the company's female financial consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	A settlement was reached in September 1998 allowing 2,900 women  
who worked at Merrill Lynch between January 1994 through June 1998 
to file discrimination claims to be heard by mediators. 
</P>
<P>
	In an internal memo distributed in early June, the company said  
acknowledged that some of the claims appear to have merit.

<HEADLINE> Aleutian Canada Geese Make Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is proposing to remove the  
Aleutian Canada goose from the threatened species list. 
</P>
<P>
	The migratory birds with the distinctive white neck bands, found  
on remote islands off the Alaska coast and in Oregon and California 
during winters, numbered just 790 in 1975, pushed to the brink of 
extinction by foxes introduced by fur farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	But removing foxes from the birds' nesting islands, protecting  
their migration habitat and relocating geese to more islands helped 
bring their numbers to about 32,000 today, the Fish and Wildlife 
Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This phenomenon is now back,'' Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt said at a news conference today. ``It's a wonderful 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The geese were defenseless when fur farmers and trappers  
introduced foxes to more than 190 islands in the birds' nesting 
range off Alaska as early as 1750. The fox introductions at the 
previously mammal-free islands hit their peak from 1915 to 1936, 
when fur demand was high. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists found no Aleutian Canada geese from 1938 through  
1962, but then discovered a remaining population on the rugged, 
remote Buldir Island in the western Aleutian Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The geese were declared an endangered species in 1967 under the  
Endangered Species Protection Act of 1966, a law that preceded the 
Endangered Species Act by seven years. Their status was upgraded 
from endangered to threatened in 1990 after geese populations 
reached 6,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the government proposal, the geese could be taken off the  
threatened species list in about a year, following a final comment 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Russia and Japan have a joint project to  
revive geese populations in the Kuril Islands off the coast of 
Russia. Eighty-six birds have been released at the islands so far 
and more releases are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed delisting six other  
species earlier this year. Only 27 species have been delisted since 
the Endangered Species Act was passed in 1973, and 16 of those 
disappeared or had been listed by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still 1,181 species listed under the Endangered  
Species Act, and 60 percent of those are plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials are citing another success in rescuing an  
endangered bird species. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will announce on or before Aug. 26 that it will  
remove the peregrine falcon from the endangered species list, said 
Robert Mesta, the national peregrine coordinator for the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service in Ventura, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 1998, there were an estimated 1,659 pairs of peregrines in  
the United States, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. Some 
experts predict as many as 3,000 pairs now exist, Mesta said. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers far surpass the goals set out when the birds were  
first added to the endangered species list in 1970. The recovery 
effort was intended to rebuild the population to 631 pairs, Mesta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pesticide DDT had depleted the population of peregrine  
falcons to 39 pairs in the continental United States in the 1970s. 
The population was eliminated in New England. Once the use of DDT 
was outlawed in 1972, the birds started to rebound.

<HEADLINE> China-Based Diplomat Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Dan Burton accuses the State and Justice  
departments of bungling an investigation of a former U.S. diplomat 
in Beijing who now refuses to answer questions about possible visa 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm absolutely furious,'' said Burton, R-Ind., after the  
Justice Department prevented the State Department's inspector 
general from discussing her office's 1996 investigation of former 
top consular officer William Parish. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general, Jacquelyn L. Williams-Bridgers, told the  
House Government Reform Committee on Thursday that any comment on 
the case could violate rules on grand jury secrecy since the 
investigation was conducted with the FBI as part of the inquiry 
into campaign finance abuses for which a grand jury was impaneled. 
</P>
<P>
	Parish also appeared but refused to answer questions, invoking  
the constitutional protection against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded the 5th Amendment despite testimony from Bonnie R.  
Cohen, under secretary of state for management, who told the 
lawmakers that Parish was aggressively investigated in 1996 and the 
inquiry ``did not reveal criminal wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the federal government ``aggressively pursued leads''  
in the case and found no need to take action against Parish. She 
said he ``performed in an excellent manner'' on visa duties in 
Washington where he was transferred during the investigation. 
Parish retired last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic fund-raiser Johnny Chung told the same congressional  
committee in May that Parish helped him get visas for dozens of 
Chinese. Chung said he ended his relationship with Parish after the 
president of a Chinese beer company asked him to deliver ``a 
shopping bag of money'' to the then-consular officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Parish, a 16-year State Department veteran, handled visa matters  
at the embassy in Beijing from 1994 to 1996. He retired last year 
after being transferred to State Department headquarters during the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said his staff found that foreigners are willing to pay  
up to $20,000 for a U.S. visa. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused the State Department of bumbling its investigation of  
Parish, destroying documents before reviewing them and failing to 
interview witnesses or subpoena bank records.

<HEADLINE>  Pitchers Sought As Deadline Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chuck Finley to the Indians? Kevin Appier to the Red Sox? Jesse  
Orosco back to the New York Mets? 
</P>
<P>
	Those possible deals, plus several others involving the New York  
Yankees, were shaping up as baseball approached its nonwaiver 
trading deadline at Saturday midnight EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, most teams were on the prowl for pitching.  
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte of the Yankees, Rolando Arrojo and Roberto  
Hernandez of Tampa Bay, Brad Radke and Mike Trombley of Minnesota, 
Arthur Rhodes and Orosco of Baltimore and Darryl Kile of Colorado 
were said to be available. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be shocked if we don't do something,'' Cleveland  
general manager John Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, looking at a potential playoff matchup with the  
Yankees, hoped to close a deal with Anaheim for Finley, 16-9 
lifetime against New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees also eyed Finley, along with Arrojo and Hernandez.  
Pettitte, who has struggled all season, seemed the most likely 
player to depart the World Series champions, with Houston, 
Philadelphia and Seattle interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had things presented to us, we've had offers made to  
us,'' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, the AL East-leading Yankees had enough prospects to  
swing a deal. Especially if it meant heading off the AL 
Central-leading Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Yankees, you do things short-term, anyway,'' manager  
Joe Torre said. ``You always want to win now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City was fielding a lot of offers for Appier, its  
longtime ace. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all likelihood, we will make a trade before Saturday  
night,'' Royals general manager Herk Robinson said. ``I can't tell 
you who it's going to be with. It's whoever wants him the most, I 
guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few deals have been made already.  
</P>
<P>
	In the last week, San Francisco got former World Series MVP  
Livan Hernandez from Florida, the Mets acquired Kenny Rogers from 
Oakland and Toronto got first baseman David Segui from Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday night, the Athletics tried to boost their  
wild-card chances by getting infielder Randy Velarde and pitcher 
Omar Olivares from Anaheim for three minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you compare apples to apples, just by numbers Omar was  
having a better year than Kenny,'' Oakland general manager Billy 
Beane said. ``Omar was on a wish list. We were trying to prepare 
ourselves for him in the week since we traded Kenny. We knew he was 
going to be moved, but we weren't sure when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, there was a flurry of activity on July 31 with more  
than 10 trades. 
</P>
<P>
	In the big deal, the Astros acquired Randy Johnson from Seattle.  
The Big Unit helped pitch Houston into the playoffs, but went 0-2 -- 
despite a 1.93 ERA -- against San Diego in the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last season, Texas got Todd Stottlemyre, Royce Clayton and  
Todd Zeile in separate trades with St. Louis and Florida, Los 
Angeles got Mark Grudzielanek and Carlos Perez, San Francisco got 
Ellis Burks and Baltimore got Juan Guzman. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, these late deals are made for minor leaguers or young  
major leaguers. And while such trades may seem one-sided at the 
time, often they look a lot different a year later. Consider the 
Cardinals' acquisition of powerful Fernando Tatis, along with 
Darren Oliver, from Texas for Stottlemyre, now in Arizona, and 
Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Sunday, trades can still be made. But from that point,  
players must pass through waivers, a tricky proposition at this 
time of year. With so many teams in contention, it's more and more 
unlikely a club would let a key player slip through to a rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Aug. 31, the last day a team can acquire a player and have  
him eligible for the postseason, San Diego got utilityman John 
Vander Wal from Colorado and Cleveland acquired infielder Joey Cora 
from Seattle for David Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were said to be looking at Orosco, the bullpen ace from  
their 1986 World Series team, and Rhodes. There was also a chance 
they might make a lesser move, perhaps trading someone like 
middleman Greg McMichael, to set a up a bigger deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, a hard-throwing lefty, was receiving plenty of interest.  
Earlier this week, he heard he might be going to Cleveland. On 
Thursday, he talked with Orioles owner Peter Angelos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I'd love to stay in Baltimore,'' Rhodes said. ``He  
said he'd love to keep me, too.''

<HEADLINE>  Pitchers Sought As Deadline Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chuck Finley to the Indians? Kevin Appier to the Red Sox? Jesse  
Orosco back to the New York Mets? 
</P>
<P>
	Those possible deals, plus several others involving the New York  
Yankees, were shaping up as baseball approached its nonwaiver 
trading deadline at Saturday midnight EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, most teams were on the prowl for pitching.  
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte of the Yankees, Rolando Arrojo and Roberto  
Hernandez of Tampa Bay, Brad Radke and Mike Trombley of Minnesota, 
Arthur Rhodes and Orosco of Baltimore and Darryl Kile of Colorado 
were said to be available. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be shocked if we don't do something,'' Cleveland  
general manager John Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, looking at a potential playoff matchup with the  
Yankees, hoped to close a deal with Anaheim for Finley, 16-9 
lifetime against New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees also eyed Finley, along with Arrojo and Hernandez.  
Pettitte, who has struggled all season, seemed the most likely 
player to depart the World Series champions, with Houston, 
Philadelphia and Seattle interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had things presented to us, we've had offers made to  
us,'' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, the AL East-leading Yankees had enough prospects to  
swing a deal. Especially if it meant heading off the AL 
Central-leading Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Yankees, you do things short-term, anyway,'' manager  
Joe Torre said. ``You always want to win now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City was fielding a lot of offers for Appier, its  
longtime ace. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all likelihood, we will make a trade before Saturday  
night,'' Royals general manager Herk Robinson said. ``I can't tell 
you who it's going to be with. It's whoever wants him the most, I 
guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few deals have been made already.  
</P>
<P>
	In the last week, San Francisco got former World Series MVP  
Livan Hernandez from Florida, the Mets acquired Kenny Rogers from 
Oakland and Toronto got first baseman David Segui from Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday night, the Athletics tried to boost their  
wild-card chances by getting infielder Randy Velarde and pitcher 
Omar Olivares from Anaheim for three minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you compare apples to apples, just by numbers Omar was  
having a better year than Kenny,'' Oakland general manager Billy 
Beane said. ``Omar was on a wish list. We were trying to prepare 
ourselves for him in the week since we traded Kenny. We knew he was 
going to be moved, but we weren't sure when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, there was a flurry of activity on July 31 with more  
than 10 trades. 
</P>
<P>
	In the big deal, the Astros acquired Randy Johnson from Seattle.  
The Big Unit helped pitch Houston into the playoffs, but went 0-2 -- 
despite a 1.93 ERA -- against San Diego in the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last season, Texas got Todd Stottlemyre, Royce Clayton and  
Todd Zeile in separate trades with St. Louis and Florida, Los 
Angeles got Mark Grudzielanek and Carlos Perez, San Francisco got 
Ellis Burks and Baltimore got Juan Guzman. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, these late deals are made for minor leaguers or young  
major leaguers. And while such trades may seem one-sided at the 
time, often they look a lot different a year later. Consider the 
Cardinals' acquisition of powerful Fernando Tatis, along with 
Darren Oliver, from Texas for Stottlemyre, now in Arizona, and 
Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Sunday, trades can still be made. But from that point,  
players must pass through waivers, a tricky proposition at this 
time of year. With so many teams in contention, it's more and more 
unlikely a club would let a key player slip through to a rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Aug. 31, the last day a team can acquire a player and have  
him eligible for the postseason, San Diego got utilityman John 
Vander Wal from Colorado and Cleveland acquired infielder Joey Cora 
from Seattle for David Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were said to be looking at Orosco, the bullpen ace from  
their 1986 World Series team, and Rhodes. There was also a chance 
they might make a lesser move, perhaps trading someone like 
middleman Greg McMichael, to set a up a bigger deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, a hard-throwing lefty, was receiving plenty of interest.  
Earlier this week, he heard he might be going to Cleveland. On 
Thursday, he talked with Orioles owner Peter Angelos.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans today pushed through a $792  
billion tax cut package that sets up a clear ideological showdown 
with the White House over how best to make use of projected 
government budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps the family and it helps the country,'' said the  
Senate Finance Committee chairman, William Roth, R-Del., author of 
the 10-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said he would veto any measure that  
closely resembles the Senate bill or a similar House measure 
because the tax cuts are too large and endanger the nation's 
economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 57-43.  
</P>
<P>
	More than one-third of the cut in the Senate bill would go to  
reducing the 15 percent bracket to 14 percent in 2001. That bracket 
would be expanded in 2005 to apply to taxable income of up to 
$47,050 on joint returns and $27,750 for single taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Allow married couples to file single returns on a combined form  
starting in 2005 as a way to deal with the so-called marriage 
penalty under which some couples pay more than they would if 
single. In 2001, the bill also would increase the standard 
deduction for married couples to $8,600. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Beginning in 2001, phase out inheritance tax rates that are in  
excess of 50 percent and increase the $1 million exemption to $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Raise the annual contribution limits to retirement accounts to  
$5,000 from the current $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerstone of the House plan, which also totals $792  
billion, is a 10 percent across-the-board cut in tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before the final vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., met with 
their top deputies to discuss the timetable for negotiations to 
resolve differences between the two bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it.  
That's what the fighting is all about,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the goal was to get the bill through the House and  
Senate by the end of next week, although it will probably be 
September, after the congressional August recess, before it is 
presented to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has stated repeatedly that he will veto the GOP plans on  
grounds they are too big, would take away money from needed 
spending for Social Security and other domestic programs and risk 
the nation's future economic stability. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rejected numerous attempts to amend the bill today,  
but accepted a proposal by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and 
other GOP conservatives that would speed up measures to reduce tax 
disadvantages for married couples. Other tax breaks in the bill 
would be delayed to offset the $6 billion cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taxing the fundamental institution that we build values  
around,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reminded Congress again Thursday that the bill faced a  
certain veto. In remarks before leaving for Europe, he said the 
``large and risky tax cut'' could carry America back ``to the dark 
old days of huge deficits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he would accept no tax cut greater than $300  
billion and only if it came after the future of Social Security and 
Medicare was secured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a veto threat but we've also got a responsibility to  
the American taxpayer,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, a 
member of the Senate Finance Committee that crafted the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists have forecast that the budget surplus would total  
nearly $3 trillion over the next decade, but the fight was over 
what to do with the non-Social Security surplus of approximately $1 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans said the bulk of that should be returned to  
taxpayers. Democrats said there was a real chance the forecasters 
were wrong, and that even if the surpluses were realized they 
should be used for debt reduction and needed spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bright-line test,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.  
``There is a radical difference in terms of what we stand for and 
what we fight for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Republicans, joined by six Democrats, rejected a  
Democratic alternative that would have limited the tax cut to $290 
billion. On Thursday, a $500 billion compromise bill that attracted 
moderates from both parties was withdrawn under pressure from party 
leaders. ``I don't think either of the two parties at this time is 
supportive'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who sponsored the 
alternative with Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Also defeated was a proposal by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
that the bill be altered to include funds to provide prescription 
drug benefits to Medicare recipients. ``Our plan presents a clear 
choice between prescription drug coverage for the elderly and 
unnecessary new tax breaks for the wealthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth promised action on the prescription drug issue in the fall,  
but ``we should not be pressured into simply accepting something 
that does require our most careful and studied attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the Republican side, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, sought  
changes to make the bill more compatible with the House version. 
Gramm's amendment, defeated on a procedural vote, would have 
eventually reduced all income tax rates by 10 percent, repealed 
estate taxes and eliminated the marriage tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Texan Republican Hutchison said the across-the-board cut  
was ``the fairest of all tax cuts,'' but Democrats assailed it as 
unfairly benefiting wealthier taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of the benefits would go to the 10 percent with  
the highest incomes, said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``It is a 
class warfare amendment and it should be trounced in a vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 percent tax rate cut included in the House bill was  
likely to be one of the major issues when the House and Senate meet 
to resolve differences. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1429.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed their $792 billion tax cut  
through the Senate on Friday, courting a classic veto struggle this 
fall with President Clinton and Democrats who claim the measure 
shortchanges Medicare and other domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 57-43 -- largely along party lines -- in favor of the  
GOP plan. The 10-year measure includes broad-based tax relief as 
well as provisions designed to address the so-called marriage 
penalty and make it easier to accumulate retirement savings and pay 
for education. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage was followed by the beginning of efforts at forging a  
quick House-Senate compromise. Congressional GOP leaders hope to 
speed the final measure through both houses next week, although it 
won't be sent to Clinton until after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave time for the GOP rank and file to trumpet the  
benefits of tax cuts during Congress' long August break. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it,''  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of projected 
federal surpluses. ``That's what this fighting is all about. We are 
determined to give working Americans the tax relief they are 
entitled to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wasted little time renewing his oft-stated veto threat.  
``The Republican tax cut is so large it would undo our fiscal 
discipline and imperil our prosperity,'' he said in a written 
statement. ``It would crowd out our commitments to pay down the 
debt, to save Social Security and to strengthen and modernize 
Medicare with a long overdue prescription drug benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure includes a reduction from 15 percent to 14  
percent in the lowest personal income tax bracket, effective in 
2001. Beginning in 2006, it would gradually shift some income 
currently taxed at 28 percent into that lower bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes provisions to reduce the marriage penalty, in  
part by slowly raising the standard deduction for married couples 
to double the amount allowed for individuals. Individuals currently 
may claim $4,300, and couples $7,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before final passage, the measure was amended to let  
investors exclude from taxes the first $1,000 in long-term capital 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, more students would be allowed to deduct the  
interest on their education loans; limits on deductible 
contributions to individual retirement accounts would rise 
gradually to $5,000, and there would be liberalized tax incentives 
for individual and corporate donors to charities. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would create a new deduction for the cost of  
long-term care insurance, and raise the estate tax exemption -- 
already scheduled to increase to $1 million -- up to $1.5 million in 
2007. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout three days of debate on the Senate floor, Republicans  
said their budget would set aside the vast bulk of projected 
surpluses for Social Security. The tax cuts, they stressed, would 
consume less than 24 cents of each dollar of predicted surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps the family and it helps the country,'' said Sen.  
William V. Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee and 
architect of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats and the president contended the GOP bill would dip  
into Social Security surpluses beginning in 2005, and leave little 
or nothing for other domestic programs. They also said that by 
providing tax cuts based on economic forecasts that might not 
materialize, the Republicans were risking a return to the days of 
large federal deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another riverboat gamble with the American economy,''  
said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., in an echo of the rhetoric used in 
the early 1980s when Republicans cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered with a smaller tax cut of $290 billion,  
which was rejected earlier in the week. Efforts to fashion a 
bipartisan compromise at $500 billion collapsed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A final compromise is still a possibility at year's end, but the  
immediate prospect is for a veto confrontation driven by competing 
readings of the electorate's wishes 15 months before the next 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who called their measure the Taxpayer Refund Act of  
1999, hope they can force Clinton to bend to their wishes on tax 
cuts, and say the president and other Democrats will pay a 
political price otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, believe they can frame the debate as a  
choice between risky, overlarge tax cuts on one side, and the fate 
of Medicare and other politically popular programs on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the three days of floor debate, both sides sought to  
shore up potential weaknesses in their position. For their part, 
Republicans parried Democratic claims about Medicare by pledging to 
address the issue of prescription drugs this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats abandoned Clinton's initial approach of targeted tax  
relief in favor of broad-based tax cuts, although on a far smaller 
scale than the GOP wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye on the 2000 elections, when eight first-term  
Republican senators will seek new terms, Democrats forced a series 
of politically charged votes, including one on a proposal to reduce 
the tax cut to make room for prescription drug benefits for 
Medicare recipients. The amendment failed. 
</P>
<P>
	On final passage, the bill was supported by 52 Republicans, Sen.  
Bob Smith, I-N.H., and Democrats Mary Landrieu and John Breaux of 
Louisiana, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Robert Torricelli of New 
Jersey. In opposition, there were 43 Democrats and two Republicans, 
George Voinovich of Ohio and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., outlined an ambitious schedule that calls for a compromise 
by Tuesday, with final votes in the two chambers by the end of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	There are numerous differences between the bills. One is a  
House-passed provision that calls for a 10 percent across-the-board 
income tax cut rather than the reduced income tax bracket the 
Senate approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott told reporters ``there's a lot of support'' among Senate  
Republicans for an across-the-board cut, adding, ``That is the 
fairest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will fall to Lott and Hastert to prod the chairmen of the  
tax-writing committees, Roth and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, to 
avoid prolonged haggling that would slow the broader GOP political 
strategy.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Decision in Code Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Friday upheld a  
district court ruling blocking the sale of an Avant! Corp. software 
program allegedly produced using copyrighted code belonging to 
Cadence Design Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. District Court issued a preliminary injunction blocking  
Avant! from selling its Aquarius software, based on the likelihood 
that Cadence would be able to prove it was produced with 
misappropriated code, and that the program infringed on the Cadence 
copyright. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the district  
court and upheld an injunction barring the sale of Aquarius, a 
program used to design computer circuits. Both companies make such 
software 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's ruling said the district court properly applied the law  
and had its own expert examine the software, then cited several of 
the ``strongest examples'' of duplication. Avant! argued that just 
56 lines of code were cited, calling that a very minimal 
duplication. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court said the district court ruling cited only  
the strongest examples, but did not say those were the only 
similarities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 9th Circuit decided that Judge (Ronald M.) Whyte was right  
in enjoining the sale of Aquarius,'' said Michael Page, one of the 
attorneys representing Cadence. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadence sued Avant!, claiming some former employees took the  
code with them when they left Cadence between 1990 and 1995 to join 
the company which later became Avant! 
</P>
<P>
	Page said the trial on that suit is scheduled for Oct. 12 in  
federal court in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	George Riley, attorney for Avant!, would not immediately  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Eddie DeBartolo Gives Up 49ers Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Eddie DeBartolo gave up his stake in the  
San Francisco 49ers on Friday, leaving the club in his sister's 
control and resolving a feud over the family's billion-dollar 
financial empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreement divides the assets of the Youngstown,  
Ohio-based Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. and allows DeBartolo and his 
sister, Denise DeBartolo York, to go their separate financial ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is signed, lawsuits filed by the siblings against  
each other will be dismissed, according to a source close to the 
negotiations. The suits, filed in federal court in Ohio, are on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Singer, a spokesman for the corporation, confirmed Friday a  
tentative deal had been reached. It still must be approved in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Rice, a spokesman for Eddie DeBartolo, said some details  
still needed to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may be close to an agreement but any announcements are  
premature at this moment,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative deal ends a messy battle between the DeBartolos  
that arose from Eddie DeBartolo's entanglement in a Louisiana 
gambling fraud scandal, which led to a guilty plea for failing to 
report a felony. He was also serving a year-long suspension imposed 
by NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue last March. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad occasion. We just have to move,'' 49ers general  
manager Bill Walsh said following the team's training camp workout 
in Stockton. ``We've all been observing and watching, and finally 
an agreement has been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The siblings owned equal shares of the corporation, which was  
the nominal owner of the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise DeBartolo York had said for some time that she wanted to  
divide the family holdings because she and her brother had 
radically different business philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, Denise Debartolo York and her  
husband, John York, now the 49ers executive vice president, have 
control of the team. The couple also retained three racetracks and 
the corporate offices and name. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's agreement, Eddie DeBartolo acknowledged owing the  
corporation $94 million. He received stock and real estate holdings 
and interest in some development projects, Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo, who is in the process of selling his Atherton home  
and moving to Florida, wasn't immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see this coming. All of us did,'' Walsh said. ``I wish  
Eddie well. There will be no changes except for tightening certain 
aspects of the business but certainly not shortchanging players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the deal kept the team in the family, it ends Eddie  
DeBartolo's 22-year association with the club. A flamboyant, 
demanding owner, DeBartolo was known as a free spender who lavished 
money on his players and expected championships in return. 
</P>
<P>
	The club won five Super Bowls with DeBartolo in charge, the last  
coming in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise DeBartolo York co-owned the team during most of that time  
but was a silent partner to her brother. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no plans to sell the club.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Yorks have always said that if they were to get the crown  
jewel of the corporation, and the 49ers are the crown jewel, that 
they would keep the team, and keep the team in San Francisco,'' 
Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was completed Friday during a telephone call with Judge  
Daniel Polster, a federal judge in Ohio, who held several hearings 
with the sides during the past two months and had urged them to 
settle. 
</P>
<P>
	Final court approval could take several months.  
</P>
<P>
	The NFL suspended DeBartolo through February 2000 and fined him  
$1 million for his role in a Louisiana gambling and bribery case. 
DeBartolo pleaded guilty to failing to report a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, York sued her brother in San Francisco, charging him  
with reneging on a $94 million debt to the family company and 
cutting an improper side deal with a prospective developer on a 
stadium-shopping mall project.

<HEADLINE> Suspect's Relatives Killed in 1993 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR BLUFF, Ala. (AP) -- Before his shooting rampage in Atlanta,  
Mark O. Barton already was regarded as a prime suspect in the 1993 
bludgeoning deaths of his wife and mother-in-law at an Alabama 
campsite. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton was never charged in the earlier killings, but he was  
``the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was,'' said 
Richard Igou, district attorney at the time of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise  
Powell Spivey, 59, both of Lithia Springs, Ga., were found at 
Riverside Campground on Weiss Lake in northeast Alabama. They had 
been staying in a camper without Barton during Labor Day weekend. 
The camper showed no signs of forced entry. 
</P>
<P>
	Current District Attorney Mike O'Dell said Thursday that  
authorities had a suspect in the case, but said he ``can't confirm 
or deny'' the suspect was Barton. O'Dell added that investigators 
made sure they kept up with Barton's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the killer dumped the older woman's purse and took  
two rings, but ignored other jewelry and an envelope containing 
$600. 
</P>
<P>
	The women had been beaten with a sharp instrument, Igou said.  
Mrs. Spivey's .32-caliber revolver lay on the kitchen counter. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton had also taken out a $600,000 life insurance policy on  
his first wife just before her death, and the company paid on the 
policy about a year later after he threatened to sue, said Maj. 
Phil Miller of the sheriff's department in Douglas County, west of 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, whose office was involved in the 1993 investigation  
because the victims were Douglas County residents, said the 
insurance policy ``was one of the reasons we were extremely 
suspicious of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before killing at least nine people in a shooting rampage in two  
Atlanta office buildings and then himself, police said, Barton also 
beat to death his wife, Leigh Ann, and two children at their 
apartment in suburban Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	In a note Barton left at the apartment, he denied any  
involvement in the 1993 slayings. The denial was in keeping with 
Barton's attitude since the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the Spiveys referred all phone calls Thursday to  
investigators. A few months after the slayings, Mrs. Spivey's 
husband, Bill, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that ``until 
the murders, Mark was the perfect son-in-law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Since then, we have cooled tremendously toward each other,''  
said Spivey, a retired Federal Aviation Administration supervisor, 
had said. He said Barton had refused to take a polygraph test. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lang, Ms. Barton's ex-husband, told the New York Daily  
News that he believes she helped Barton cover up Barton's suspected 
involvement in the slayings of Barton's first wife and 
mother-in-law to collect the $600,000 insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can tell you is: `What goes around comes around,''' Lang  
said. ``I feel terrible about what happened. But I can't say I'm 
surprised, knowing what I know about the two of them.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Rise to 18-Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Higher demand for crude oil has helped push  
U.S. gasoline prices to their highest levels in 18 months, and they 
could go higher because of the ongoing OPEC production cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists on the West Coast have been hit even harder thanks to  
a series of refinery explosions that created a supply crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the average price of gasoline at the pump has risen  
more than 5 cents to $1.267 cents a gallon since early July, 
according to the California-based Lundberg Survey. Since February, 
when the average price dipped below $1, prices have risen 26.9 
cents a gallon nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices could continue upward during August as more Americans  
take to the road for vacations and weekend outings, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're right in the middle of the driving season and the  
economy is strong. People are driving around, taking vacations. 
There is more upward pressure,'' said Alvin Silber, an analyst with 
Herzog Heine Geduld. 
</P>
<P>
	``But remember, it's a very seasonable product. When you pass  
Labor Day and kids go back to school, normally that leads to a 
decline in demand and the price almost invariably starts declining 
at the pump,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Production cuts were announced by the Organization of the  
Petroleum Exporting Countries and other big oil producers in 
February. To the surprise of many analysts, OPEC countries have 
stuck to their quotas and a worldwide glut of crude oil that pushed 
prices down to historic lows during 1998 and early 1999 is 
disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, demand for both crude oil and refined gasoline  
is increasing, especially in Asia where countries are emerging from 
the economic crisis that began two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the price of key grades of crude oil worldwide has  
nearly doubled since the OPEC cuts went into effect, said Fadel 
Gheit, an analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``OPEC's death has been greatly exaggerated in the last three or  
four years,'' said Gheit. ``Obviously, these people woke up one day 
and said enough is enough and we'll put our foot down and show 
people we are still here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In California, prices have been further influenced by a series  
of refinery problems. An explosion forced Mobil Corp. to cut 
production at its Torrance refinery on Wednesday. The company's 
Richmond plant was damaged in a July 10 blast and has not resumed 
full production. 
</P>
<P>
	Production is lagging at an Exxon refinery in Benicia and a  
Tosco plant in Avon has been shut down since March because of 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet another production slowdown is on the way. Typically, August  
is the month when U.S. refineries retool to produce winter gasoline 
blends and ramp up production of heating oil for the winter season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't suggest that the increase in gas prices is going  
to abate,'' Silber said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a July 23 Lundberg Survey that ranked 66 U.S. cities  
according to gasoline price, Western cities held the top 18 
positions. San Francisco led the list, followed by Reno, Nev., 
Portland, Ore., and Sacramento. The only cities east of Denver to 
make the top 20 were Cincinnati and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The run-up follows one of the oil industry's worst-ever slumps.  
Between October 1997 and February 1999, overproduction and weak 
demand dropped the price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude 
from nearly $21 to $11 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	The downturn forced big oil companies to lay off thousands of  
workers around the world and was a key factor in leading some 
companies, including Atlantic Richfield Co., Amoco Corp. and Mobil 
Corp., to seek mergers with larger competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If oil prices had remained at the January level for six more  
months, I would say the majority of independent oil producers would 
have been out of business by now, and more companies would have 
been forced to seek merger protection,'' Gheit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at today's prices, gas remains a bargain, Gheit said. When  
adjusted for inflation, prices are at their lowest level since 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no guarantee the upward swing will continue, he added.  
If prices remain high, U.S. and European oil companies will 
increase production to boost the crude supply. And OPEC will be 
pressured to boost its output if high crude prices begin to fuel 
inflation in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is really balanced very tentatively. One or 2  
million barrels can tip the balance either way,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Martha Stewart Plans Stock Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Martha Stewart has the perfect complement to  
your stock portfolio: shares in her company. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, the doyenne of domestic detail, plans a $100 million  
stock sale in Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., according to 
documents filed Thursday with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart would retain control of the company, which had $180  
million in revenue and a net profit of $23.8 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's principal vehicle is the monthly magazine Martha  
Stewart Living, but its television merchandising and Internet 
businesses have experienced strong growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it may use $42 million of the proceeds to buy  
out the remaining 6.2 percent stake held by Time Warner, an initial 
backer of Stewart's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the documents say a 5 percent stake in the company will be  
sold for $25 million to Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Buyers, a 
venture capital firm in San Francisco. The firm will also have the 
right to 15 percent of any publicly traded class of stock issued in 
an Internet business for an additional $21 million.

<HEADLINE> Brown, Hlede traded to Starzz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The struggling Detroit Shock traded  
forward Cindy Brown and guard Korie Hlede to the last-place Utah 
Starzz on Thursday for forward Wendy Palmer and center Olympia 
Scott-Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we needed additional post help in terms of both depth  
and strength to have a more defensive presence going into the home 
stretch,'' Shock coach Nancy Lieberman-Cline said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was completed shortly before the league's 8 p.m. EDT  
trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, an original member of the Starzz, is averaging 8.4  
points a game this season after averaging 15.8 last year. Her 
rebounding average has also decreased from 6.6 to 4.2. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott-Richardson started the season on the injured list after  
the birth of her first child and was activated July 12. She has 
played in four games and had a season-high nine points and seven 
rebounds Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who has started all 21 games for the Shock, is averaging  
6.9 points and 5.4 rebounds a game. Last year she averaged 11.3 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hlede, the fourth overall pick in the 1998 draft, is averaging  
8.8 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit has lost three in a row and is 1 1/2 games behind New York  
in the Eastern Conference.

<HEADLINE> Navy Has Backlog of Burials at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy will be sending a flotilla of ships  
to sea in a rush program to eliminate a backlog in burials at sea. 
The backlog was brought to light by the Navy's prompt burial of 
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	After the well-publicized burial off the Massachusetts coast  
July 22, the Navy fielded complaints from families who have 
deceased loved ones awaiting burial at sea, a privilege of sailors, 
veterans, their spouses and dependent children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy has 52 sets of remains in storage awaiting burial, some  
for several months, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, 
said Thursday. All but three of those are in storage at Portsmouth 
Naval Medical Center, Va. The rest are at Navy facilities on the 
West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. J.P. Reason, commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, ordered  
immediate action to eliminate the backlog after he learned of it, 
Quigley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was completely unacceptable to him and he's working very  
hard to remove that backlog,'' Quigley said. ``Everyone involved in 
that would admit that this was not done very well and there's no 
really good reason for having that backlog there in the first 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The burials of Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and  
her sister Lauren Bessette occurred a day after their bodies were 
found in the waters off Martha's Vineyard, Mass., following the 
July 16 crash of Kennedy's private plane. Asked why the burials 
were handled without delay, Quigley said it was a case of an 
``unusual circumstance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The destroyer USS Briscoe was at sea off the East Coast as the  
search for the Kennedy plane was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the ability to be timely in that request, that was  
the decision that was made to send her north to accomplish the 
burials of those three at sea,'' Quigley said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 10 ships will be involved in relieving the backlog of  
sea burials by Aug. 6. The only remains that won't be buried by 
then will be those for which families have requested a later date 
or set other special conditions, such as a specific burial location 
requiring more time, Quigley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy said that no ships will be sent to sea just for burials  
but will conduct the ceremonies while deployed for other missions. 
The Navy blamed the backlog on several factors, including a reduced 
fleet and increased demands on remaining ships to participate in 
various operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sailors, retired Navy officers and enlistees, their spouses and  
dependent children are entitled to burial at sea. With special 
approval, as in the Kennedy case, others may also receive Navy 
burial rites at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The service is free, although family members must prepare either  
a casket or cremated remains in containers that fit Navy 
specifications. Unlike in the Kennedy case, family members are not 
allowed to attend the rites, according to Navy Capt. Ryland Dodge 
of the Navy's Bureau of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of the remains the Navy buries at sea are  
cremated. The Navy handles about 500 burials at sea each year.

<HEADLINE> Woodstock Rape Reports Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Rape counselors and crisis intervention  
workers say they treated far more sexual assault victims than the 
four reported to police during the Woodstock '99 festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are investigating reports of rapes during the  
three-day concert, attended by an estimated 225,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Lattimore, emergency services director of the Rome office  
of the American Red Cross, said she and her staff treated multiple 
victims of sexual assaults. Rosemary Vennero, crisis service 
director of the YWCA of Mohawk Valley, said her organization's rape 
crisis center had counseled four sexual assault victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oneida County Rape Crisis Center on Thursday reported that  
two other teen-age girls have come forward with allegations that 
they were raped. State Police Capt. John Wood said investigators 
were braced for additional reports of sexual assaults because 
victims typically do not come forward immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Vennero said readily available drugs and alcohol, inattentive  
security and other factors for creating an atmosphere conducive to 
sexual assault -- ``I mean anything from groping, touching and 
molesting to rape and sodomy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the alleged rapes occurred in a mosh pit 30 yards away  
from the stage, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosh pits are a place where concertgoers, usually boys and young  
men, hurl their bodies against each other in a release of 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman said she was ``bodysurfing'' in the crowd when she was  
pulled into the pit, molested by two men and raped by another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to the congestion of the crowd, she felt that if she  
yelled for help or fought, she feared she was going to be beaten,'' 
a state police investigation report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock promoters Michael Lang and John Scher said they could  
not confirm the rapes had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, indeed, these reports are true, it is despicable,'' said  
Woodstock spokeswoman Ilene Marder. 
</P>
<P>
	The rape reports represented more bad publicity for the  
festival, meant to evoke the 1969 Woodstock and its ``peace and 
music'' theme. Fans rioted and burned property at the concert as 
the festival came to a close on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Court Reporter Contracts Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Some court reporters enter contracts with insurers  
and large corporate defendants that give those litigants an 
advantage in court, according to study released Friday by a 
consumer advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by the Foundation for Taxpayers and Consumer Rights  
indicates that though court reporters are supposed to be impartial 
observers, they often provide special services to insurers and 
other companies with whom they have long-term contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The services include providing uncertified, rough-draft  
transcripts to the insurer and counsel; completing ``Witness 
Information Sheets'' that give the companies otherwise confidential 
witness information, such as Social Security numbers; and producing 
summaries of depositions that are not available to other parties in 
a case. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also says that the insurers and corporate defendants  
can get as much as 40 percent off market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Harold P. Naughton has introduced a bill that bans  
long-term contracts between insurers and interested parties in 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Golden, executive director of the 32,000-member National  
Court Reporters Association, said he hadn't seen the Foundation for 
Taxpayers and Consumer Rights report, but supports Naughton's bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-term contracts have arisen out of market demand for  
court reporters services. But even if their motivations are 
innocuous, court reporters are obligated to eliminate even the 
appearance of impartiality, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Preserving impartiality is our business,'' Golden said.

<HEADLINE>  Panama's US Army Headquarters Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT CLAYTON, Panama (AP) -- The United States' long goodbye to  
Panama neared an end Friday with the formal departure of the 
regional U.S. Army headquarters, leaving only a few hundred 
soldiers until the Panama Canal is handed over at year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your 88-year mission here is done,'' Marine Gen. Charles E.  
Wilhelm, the head of the U.S. Southern Command, told a closing a 
ceremony at Fort Clayton's Soldier's Field parade ground. ``You can 
report with pride -- Mission accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Command, the administrative head for all branches  
of the U.S. military in the region, moved out of Panama in 1997. 
But Friday's ceremony marked the exit of the regional headquarters 
of the U.S. Army, which had the largest presence in Panama. That 
headquarters moves to Fort Buchanan in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	As Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares looked on and a  
bagpiper played ``Auld Lang Syne,'' a color guard dressed in tan, 
1910-style U.S. uniforms and bearing Springfield rifles turned over 
flags to another color guard dressed in modern camouflage uniforms 
and carrying M-16 rifles. The modern guard then marched out the 
gates of Fort Clayton, past U.S. and Panamanian flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Philip R. Kensinger Jr., the commander of U.S. Army  
South, said the troops were saying goodbye to Panama -- ``and in 
doing so, holding our heads high with the knowledge that Panama and 
the region have been better for our presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thick gray clouds and a brisk rain began to fall soon after the  
ceremony ended, a reminder of the tropical downpours that helped 
the Army train millions of soldiers in tropical jungle warfare over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 31, the United States turns the canal over to Panama,  
ending a relationship between the two countries that began with 
Panama's birth as a nation in 1903. The first U.S. soldiers 
permanently assigned came in 1911 to guard construction efforts of 
the Panama Canal, which was opened in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
	Today fewer than 1,000 U.S. military personnel remain in Panama,  
largely based at Corozal, just south of Clayton, near the Pacific 
entrance of the canal. They are steadily departing week by week. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the mid 1990s, more than 10,000 U.S. troops were based in  
Panama. At the height of the U.S. presence, during World War II, 
about 65,000 U.S. troops were based in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1977 treaty signed by President Jimmy Carter and  
Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos, the United States has gradually 
been turning over its 453,000 acres of holdings in the Canal Zone 
and military bases. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. negotiations to maintain an anti-drug base in Panama fell  
through, but Perez Balladares told reporters after the ceremony 
that he expected the United States and Panama to continue 
cooperating against drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have many objectives in common to complete,'' he said.  
``Especially those that unite us, like the fight against drug 
trafficking and crime.''

	Until the mid 1990s, more than 10,000 U.S. troops were based in

<HEADLINE> Firms Fined $28M in Age Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An insurance brokerage and employee benefits  
firm will pay $28 million to settle government claims that it 
discriminated by making members of its board of directors retire at 
age 62. 
</P>
<P>
	The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Thursday that  
Johnson and Higgins Inc. had agreed to settle a 1993 lawsuit filed 
by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and Higgins, which had 7,000 workers nationwide,  
allegedly enforced a mandatory retirement policy before it was 
acquired by Marsh &AMP; McLennan Companies Inc. two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Perlmutter, vice president of public affairs for Marsh &AMP;  
McLennan, said the company was ``pleased to have this matter behind 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said there was no such policy at Marsh &AMP; McLennan, which  
employs 50,000 people in more than 100 countries in insurance 
services, investment management and consulting. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will be divided among 13 retired Johnson and Higgins  
directors, with $100,000 going to the EEOC to cover the costs of 
the suit.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Nazi Defends Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Alleged Nazi death camp guard John Demjanjuk  
asked a federal judge today to dismiss the government's latest 
attempt to strip him of his U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk, in a response to the government's May 19 motion in  
U.S. District Court, said the second effort amounted to double 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Demjanjuk, in a motion personally filed by his son, John  
Demjanjuk Jr., and son-in-law and family spokesman, Ed Nishnic, 
said the government had displayed bad faith in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous court sanctions against government actions in its  
Demjanjuk investigation were inadequate and the citizenship removal 
effort should be dismissed, Demjanjuk's motion said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In sum, we simply lack the means to defend Mr. Demjanjuk due  
to the prejudicial and deliberate delay caused by the government,'' 
John Demjanjuk Jr. and Nishic said in an affidavit accompanying 
Demjanjuk's motion. 
</P>
<P>
	John Russell, a Justice Department spokesman, said the  
government would respond in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, the Justice Department's Office of Special  
Investigation filed a civil complaint to strip the 79-year-old 
Demjanjuk of his citizenship and said he had ``participated in the 
process by which thousands of Jews were murdered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, the retired auto worker was sentenced to die in Israel  
after being convicted as the notorious death-camp guard ``Ivan the 
Terrible.'' But he won freedom five years later when evidence 
indicated he was a victim of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was criticized by a U.S. appellate court for  
``reckless'' withholding of evidence that might have cleared 
Demjanjuk in the Ivan the Terrible case.

<HEADLINE> A's Gets Velarde, Olivares in Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Moving to stay in the playoff chase, the  
Oakland Athletics strengthened their pitching and offense by 
acquiring right-hander Omar Olivares and slugging infielder Randy 
Velarde from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the Angels received three minor leaguers from the  
A's. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly helps us out in the rotation, and the  
organization has always been a big fan of Velarde. It gives us 
another right-handed bat, and we just think he's a fit,'' A's 
general manager Billy Beane said. ``Olivares has arguably been one 
of the top 10-12 guys in the league in terms of ERA and he's a 
solid major league starter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Velarde was hitting a team-high .306 for the Angels and was tied  
for the team lead with 115 hits. He also has nine homers and 48 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivares, one of the Angels' most reliable starters, was 8-9  
with a 4.05 ERA in 20 starts. He led the team in wins and was tied 
for second in the league with three complete games. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were expected to join Oakland by tonight.  
</P>
<P>
	Both will be free agents after the end of this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate everything Randy and Omar have done for the  
Angels,'' Angels general manager Bill Bavasi said. ``Randy has 
worked extremely hard to get his game back to the level he demands 
of himself, and his numbers this season reflect that. Omar did some 
great things for us last season in a variety of roles, and this 
season has been one of our most consistent starters. However, at 
this point in time we need to make some moves for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beane said the deal for two veterans sends a message that the  
second-place A's were not conceding anything last weekend when they 
dealt away pitching ace Kenny Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, who went to the Mets for a pair of minor leaguers, will  
be a free agent at the end of the season and had said he wouldn't 
return to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Beane said Rogers was traded while Oakland could still get  
something for him, and that anyone who thought it signaled the 
start of the dismantling of the A's had misread the club's 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't throwing in the towel when we traded Rogers,''  
Beane said. ``We did have a plan. We had an idea of what we wanted 
to do. The club has played well. Hopefully, this will give us a 
little shot of adrenaline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The A's must make roster space for the additions and drop one of  
the current pitchers from the rotation, but Beane declined to 
discuss the affected players because they hadn't been notified yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Beane did suggest the club could make another deal before  
Saturday's trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've still got some ideas, some things we're still talking  
about,'' Beane said. ``We're still running through some things 
internally. We're trying to improve our club for the short term and 
the long term, if possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels acquired right-hander Elvin Nina and outfielders Jeff  
DaVanon and Nathan Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
	DaVanon and Nina were playing for the A's Double-A affiliate at  
Midland. 
</P>
<P>
	DaVanon was hitting .341 with 11 homers and 59 RBIs, while Nina  
was 3-2 with a 4.80 ERA in seven games, including four starts at 
Midland. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes was batting .313 with 12 stolen bases in 35 games at  
Single-A Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Jeff and Nathan, we feel we have added some much needed  
speed to our system. Both have had success in that area in a 
relatively short time. Elvin is a young man with a live arm and a 
good mix of pitches,'' Bavasi said.

<HEADLINE> Paraplegic Climbs Calif. Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- The first paraplegic  
climber to scale El Capitan reached the top of the 3,200-foot peak 
again, hoisting himself up 6 inches at a time along a more 
difficult route. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Wellman, 39, of Truckee, has had only partial movement in  
his legs since a 1982 climbing accident. The first paraplegic to 
scale El Capitan 10 years ago, he tackled the tougher ``Nose'' 
route this time, reaching the top about 8 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pushed long and hard and knew we could nail it down if we  
made a final big push to the top,'' Wellman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellman and climbing partner Mike Corbett, 45, started their  
ascent July 19, loaded down with 250 pounds of supplies. Wellman 
hoisted himself up by doing pull-ups on a special T-bar system. 
</P>
<P>
	Their goal was to reach the top in seven days, which would have  
put them on the summit July 26 -- 10 years to the day after their 
1989 feat. But strong winds and difficult horizontal traverses 
slowed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellman said his message to the disabled was ``to climb whatever  
mountain that is the barrier in their life. And that can be 
anything.''

<HEADLINE> CEO of Eastwind Airlines Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Eastwind Airlines, a struggling low-fare  
carrier based in Greensboro, has fired its chief executive officer 
and two other senior managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwind announced Thursday that Terry V. Hallcom has been  
relieved of his duties as president and chief executive officer 
effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice presidents Scott Glasser and Michael Kopay also were asked  
to leave, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwind said it retained airline industry professionals Mort  
Beyer &AMP; Agnew as management consultants to restructure the company, 
a spokesman said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwind officials were not immediately available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Eastwind announced that it had suspended service to  
Boston, Pittsburgh and St. Petersburg, Fla., acknowledging that it 
had tried to expand too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwind continues to serve Orlando, Fla., Philadelphia and  
Trenton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwind has been criticized several times in recent months for  
poor service, including long flight delays, cancellations and 
double billing. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Eastwind received approval from federal regulators  
to expand its fleet from five to seven airplanes.

<HEADLINE> Senate Readies for Vote on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican bill to cut taxes by $792  
billion, after dodging numerous attempts to alter or shrink it, 
headed today for passage in the Senate and the larger obstacle of a 
promised presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the final vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert and top GOP tax writers met to discuss 
strategy over what could be a prolonged battle with the White House 
over the final size and shape of the tax cut. First, the House and 
Senate also have to resolve differences in their two bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said they hope to reach a deal with the House and finish  
voting by the end of next week, when Congress leaves for its August 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it.  
That's what the fighting is all about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP majority was expected to give solid backing to the  
10-year plan that would reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 14 
percent, ease the so-called marriage penalty, reduce estate taxes 
and increase IRA contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
	First though, they accepted, 98-2, an amendment by Sen. Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and other GOP conservatives that would 
speed up measures to reduce tax disadvantages for married couples. 
Other tax breaks in the bill would be delayed to offset the $6 
billion cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taxing the fundamental institution that we build values  
around,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	With passage, GOP leaders intended to move quickly to resolve  
differences with a House-passed bill that would reach the same $792 
billion level of tax relief through different kinds of cuts. The 
bill, however, was not expected to be sent to the president until 
September, giving both supporters and opponents a chance to press 
their case during the August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton reminded Congress again Thursday that the bill  
faced a certain veto. In remarks before leaving for Europe, he said 
the ``large and risky tax cut'' could carry America back ``to the 
dark old days of huge deficits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he would accept no tax cut greater than $300  
billion and only if it came after the future of Social Security and 
Medicare was secured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a veto threat but we've also got a responsibility to  
the American taxpayer,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, a 
member of the Senate Finance Committee that crafted the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists have forecast that the budget surplus would total  
nearly $3 trillion over the next decade, but the fight was over 
what to do with the non-Social Security surplus of approximately $1 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans said the bulk of that should be returned to  
taxpayers. Democrats said there was a real chance the forecasters 
were wrong, and that even if the surpluses were realized they 
should be used for debt reduction and needed spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bright-line test,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.  
``There is a radical difference in terms of what we stand for and 
what we fight for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Republicans, joined by six Democrats, rejected a  
Democratic alternative that would have limited the tax cut to $290 
billion. On Thursday, a $500 billion compromise bill that attracted 
moderates from both parties was withdrawn under pressure from party 
leaders. ``I don't think either of the two parties at this time is 
supportive'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who sponsored the 
alternative with Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Also defeated was a proposal by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
that the bill be altered to include funds to provide prescription 
drug benefits to Medicare recipients. ``Our plan presents a clear 
choice between prescription drug coverage for the elderly and 
unnecessary new tax breaks for the wealthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., promised action  
on the prescription drug issue in the fall, but ``we should not be 
pressured into simply accepting something that does require our 
most careful and studied attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the Republican side, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, sought  
changes to make the bill more compatible with the House version. 
Gramm's amendment, defeated on a procedural vote, would have 
eventually reduced all income tax rates by 10 percent, repealed 
estate taxes and eliminated the marriage tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Texan Republican Hutchison said the across-the-board cut  
was ``the fairest of all tax cuts,'' but Democrats assailed it as 
unfairly benefiting wealthier taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of the benefits would go to the 10 percent with  
the highest incomes, said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``It is a 
class warfare amendment and it should be trounced in a vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 percent tax rate cut included in the House bill was  
likely to be one of the major issues when the House and Senate meet 
to resolve differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 14 percent and increase  
the number of people eligible for that tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provide relief to married couples who are pushed into a higher  
tax bracket because of their combined incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase allowable contributions to retirement funds.  
</P>
<P>
	--Provide deductions for health insurance costs and long-term  
care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase the eligible income limits for student loan interest  
deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Repeal estate tax rates in excess of 50 percent and, in 2007,  
increase the $1 million exemption to $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1429.

<HEADLINE>  Greene Just Misses 100-Meter Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Maurice Greene ran one of the fastest  
100 meters ever Friday, surging from the blocks and winning in 9.87 
seconds at the DN Galan Grand Prix meet. 
</P>
<P>
	With almost no wind, Greene was just eight-hundredths of a  
second off the world record he set last month in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just thrills me how well I'm running at the moment,''  
Greene said. ``This is a special stadium, a special meet. But it 
was not even close to a perfect race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Johnson had a far rougher day. The double Olympic  
champion in 1996 abandoned the 400-meter race after about 100 
meters, apparently pulling a right thigh muscle. Jerome Young of 
the United States won in 44.64. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the way I would have wanted to win with Michael  
having to pull out,'' Young said. ``But a win is a win. I just 
concentrated on my own race and I never was aware that Michael 
stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson left the stadium without comment and with a bandaged  
right thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones was unchallenged in the women's 200, leading from  
start to finish. The American's time of 22.07 was .05 off the 
stadium record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think my race was anything special this evening,''  
Jones said. ``I felt very good coming off the turn of the bend, but 
I can't point to any other part of the race other than that which 
stands out in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to prize and appearance money, Greene earned a  
diamond valued at $10,000 for breaking his Olympic Stadium record 
of 9.90 set last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Obadele Thompson of Barbados was second in 9.96 and Greene's  
training partner Jon Drummond third in 10.04. Dennis Mitchell, 
another American, finished fourth in 10.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Ato Boldon of Trinidad, one of Greene's training partners, did  
not enter because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without Ato here to push me, I am particularly pleased with  
how I stepped up my game and pushed myself to this sort of time,'' 
Greene said. ``With Ato in the race, the competition would have 
been even stiffer and then who knows what might have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon was timed in 9.86 in Athens, the fifth-fastest time in  
history, when Greene broke the world record. 
</P>
<P>
	Merlene Ottey, the 39-year-old veteran from Jamaica, finished  
second to Jones in 22.24. Inger Miller of the United States was 
third in 22.50. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was my first race this year 200 against Merlene and  
frankly every race against her is a keen contest,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludmila Engquist was impressive in her first race since being  
diagnosed with breast cancer, taking the women's 100 hurdles in 
12.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Jackson, the world-record holder from Britain, beat two  
Americans to win the men's 110 hurdles in 13.12 
</P>
<P>
	Engquist, who is undergoing chemotherapy, edged Melissa Morrison  
of the United States by one-hundredth of a second in excellent 
conditions before a sellout crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the whole of Sweden was with me today and with that  
kind of support I knew I couldn't fail,'' said Engquist, a former 
Russian citizen who competes for Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic champion three years ago in Atlanta, Engquist  
recently returned from training in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my fans are responsible for this win,'' Engquist said.  
``They have kept going with me throughout my illness and the 
crowd's reaction was just so amazing even before the race 
started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Jewell of the United States, was third in 12.73.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark Crear, who's fastest this year in 12.98, was second behind  
Jackson in 13.13, with Tony Dees third in 13.36. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the last few weeks I have been trying to concentrate on  
being Colin Jackson and to forget my weaknesses,'' Jackson said. 
``This was one of my best performances here in Stockholm. 
Especially my start was good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Koskei of Kenya won the men's 3,000 steeplechase in  
8:10.71 and Maria Mutola of Moazmbique won the women's 800 in 
1:57.12.

<HEADLINE> Tripp Wiretap Indictment Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- As the yearlong grand jury  
investigation of Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings drew to a 
close, the state prosecutor appeared at the courthouse today, 
refusing to say whether he would seek an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's attorney, Joseph Murtha, was preparing for the  
possibility of an indictment on wiretapping charges. He said, 
however, he had not been notified by state prosecutors that charges 
were imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Murtha asked that if Mrs. Tripp is indicted, she  
be allowed to surrender voluntarily, rather than being arrested at 
her Columbia, Md., home. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard County State's Attorney Marna McLendon scheduled a press  
conference about the Tripp investigation for this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Family spokesman Philip Coughter said Mrs. Tripp's legal team  
will hold a news briefing after McLendon finishes. Coughter also 
said Mrs. Tripp's attorneys are bringing on board Steve Kohn, a 
Washington attorney with experience in government whistle-blower 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the grand jury to hopefully come to some  
conclusion,'' Maryland state prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli, who 
has been presenting evidence in the probe to a Howard County grand 
jury, said as he entered the county courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp secretly tape-recorded telephone calls she had with  
Monica Lewinsky, triggering the biggest crisis of Clinton's 
presidency. But Mrs. Tripp's taping may have violated Maryland's 
wiretap law. 
</P>
<P>
	If Mrs. Tripp is indicted, she would become the only central  
figure in the Lewinsky affair to face criminal charges. Clinton was 
acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial on charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	A peripheral figure in the investigation, Julie Hiatt Steele,  
was prosecuted for obstructing prosecutor Kenneth Starr's probe of 
Clinton. But the jury deadlocked on the charges and Starr elected 
not to retry the case. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Tripp's tape recordings, which she supplied Starr's  
office under a grant of immunity from prosecution, that started the 
investigation of the president and led to his impeachment in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's federal immunity does not protect her in a state  
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland law forbids anyone from intercepting phone  
conversations without the other party's consent. Wiretapping is 
punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for 
each offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignorance of the law is a valid defense. But Mrs. Tripp  
testified for Starr that she taped several conversations in late 
1997 even after an attorney told her it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, 49, said she began taping her phone calls because  
she was being pressured by Ms. Lewinsky to lie in the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment case against the president. Ms. Lewinsky, who 
became friends with Mrs. Tripp when they worked at the Pentagon, 
wanted Mrs. Tripp to deny knowledge of a sexual relationship 
between Clinton and the former White House intern.

<HEADLINE>  Greene Just Misses 100-Meter Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Maurice Greene ran one of the fastest  
100 meters ever Friday, surging from the blocks and winning in 9.87 
seconds at the DN Galan Grand Prix meet. 
</P>
<P>
	With almost no wind, Greene was just eight-hundredths of a  
second off the world record he set last month in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just thrills me how well I'm running at the moment,''  
Greene said. ``This is a special stadium, a special meet. But it 
was not even close to a perfect race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Johnson had a far rougher day. The double Olympic  
champion in 1996 abandoned the 400-meter race after about 100 
meters, apparently pulling a right thigh muscle. Jerome Young of 
the United States won in 44.64. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the way I would have wanted to win with Michael  
having to pull out,'' Young said. ``But a win is a win. I just 
concentrated on my own race and I never was aware that Michael 
stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson left the stadium without comment and with a bandaged  
right thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones was unchallenged in the women's 200, leading from  
start to finish. The American's time of 22.07 was .05 off the 
stadium record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think my race was anything special this evening,''  
Jones said. ``I felt very good coming off the turn of the bend, but 
I can't point to any other part of the race other than that which 
stands out in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to prize and appearance money, Greene earned a  
diamond valued at $10,000 for breaking his Olympic Stadium record 
of 9.90 set last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Obadele Thompson of Barbados was second in 9.96 and Greene's  
training partner Jon Drummond third in 10.04. Dennis Mitchell, 
another American, finished fourth in 10.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Ato Boldon of Trinidad, one of Greene's training partners, did  
not enter because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without Ato here to push me, I am particularly pleased with  
how I stepped up my game and pushed myself to this sort of time,'' 
Greene said. ``With Ato in the race, the competition would have 
been even stiffer and then who knows what might have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon was timed in 9.86 in Athens, the fifth-fastest time in  
history, when Greene broke the world record. 
</P>
<P>
	Merlene Ottey, the 39-year-old veteran from Jamaica, finished  
second to Jones in 22.24. Inger Miller of the United States was 
third in 22.50. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was my first race this year 200 against Merlene and  
frankly every race against her is a keen contest,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludmila Engquist was impressive in her first race since being  
diagnosed with breast cancer, taking the women's 100 hurdles in 
12.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Jackson, the world-record holder from Britain, beat two  
Americans to win the men's 110 hurdles in 13.12 
</P>
<P>
	Engquist, who is undergoing chemotherapy, edged Melissa Morrison  
of the United States by one-hundredth of a second in excellent 
conditions before a sellout crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the whole of Sweden was with me today and with that  
kind of support I knew I couldn't fail,'' said Engquist, a former 
Russian citizen who competes for Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic champion three years ago in Atlanta, Engquist  
recently returned from training in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my fans are responsible for this win,'' Engquist said.  
``They have kept going with me throughout my illness and the 
crowd's reaction was just so amazing even before the race 
started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Jewell of the United States, was third in 12.73.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark Crear, who's fastest this year in 12.98, was second behind  
Jackson in 13.13, with Tony Dees third in 13.36. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the last few weeks I have been trying to concentrate on  
being Colin Jackson and to forget my weaknesses,'' Jackson said. 
``This was one of my best performances here in Stockholm. 
Especially my start was good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Koskei of Kenya won the men's 3,000 steeplechase in  
8:10.71 and Maria Mutola of Moazmbique won the women's 800 in 
1:57.12.

<HEADLINE> Driver Waltrip To Retire Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Darrell Waltrip, a three-time Winston Cup  
champion, will retire as a driver following a farewell tour in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	His retirement will be announced Thursday during the opening day  
of practice and qualifying for the Brickyard 400 at the 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip was not available for comment today, but personal  
representative Keith Waltz told The Associated Press the 
announcement will be ``no surprise to anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When Darrell signed that two-year contract, he said that would  
probably be it,'' he said. ``Darrell will announce his plans for 
next year and for his future at the press conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip signed a two-year contract last December with team  
co-owners Travis Carter and Carl Haas to drive the No. 66 KMart 
Ford Taurus in NASCAR's top stock car series. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, who also owns a team that fields cars for Jimmy Spencer  
in the Winston Cup series, said, ``Darrell hasn't made any secret 
of his plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, 52, of Franklin, Tenn., leads all active Winston Cup  
drivers with 84 career victories but has not won a race since 
Darlington in September 1992. He finished 25th at last week's 
Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway and is 38th in the season 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip sold his team last year after owning it for eight years,  
citing sponsor disputes and other financial reasons. At the time, 
he said the 1999 season would be his last. He changed his mind when 
approached by Carter and KMart about a two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to do everything in our power to make sure  
Darrell goes out with a bang at each and every race,'' crew chief 
Phillipe Lopez told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip has indicated a desire to enter broadcasting after  
retiring. He has done race commentary for The Nashville Network.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Y2K Expert Predicts Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Don't expect the Year 2000 technology problem  
to disappear after Jan. 1. President Clinton's top Y2K expert said 
failures could extend well beyond New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Although John Koskinen predicts there will be a national ``sigh  
of relief'' in the early hours of Jan. 1, he also anticipates 
scattered electronic failures over the first days, weeks and even 
months of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000  
Conversion, said in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press 
that some failures may not become obvious until the end of January, 
the first time after the date rollover that consumers review their 
monthly bank statements, credit-card bills and other financial 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't evaporate until after that,'' Koskinen said.  
``Clearly, this is more than a January 1 problem.'' But he also 
slightly hedged his predictions: ``None of us are really going to 
know until after January 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unless repaired, some computers originally programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year will not work properly 
beginning in 2000, when those machines will assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Some computer systems may shut down quickly with obvious  
failures, and others may gradually experience subtle problems or 
degraded performance that may take weeks to notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more difficult problem will be where the system looks like  
it's doing it correctly but it's doing it all wrong,'' Koskinen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some failures won't be recognized until the work week starts  
Monday, Jan. 3, as employees return to their offices and turn on 
their computers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Repaired computers also will need to recognize 2000 as a leap  
year, even though most years ending in ``00'' don't need to adjust 
for Feb. 29, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A new $40 million Information Coordination Center being  
organized down the street from the White House will operate until 
March, sharing information about failures with states, federal 
agencies, corporations and foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen urged people to prepare for possible trouble as they  
might for a winter storm or a hurricane: Buy flashlights and 
batteries, keep enough cash, food and water for several days and 
make copies of financial and medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also cautioned against stockpiling supplies, which could  
lead to local shortages, or draining bank accounts, which could 
strain the nation's financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get a couple hundred million Americans doing anything  
differently, we're going to create economic problems,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An AP poll this month found most Americans don't expect major  
problems, but nearly a third plan to stock up on food, water and 
other supplies. About one-quarter of Americans planned to withdraw 
cash in case of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen predicted the most widespread problems will occur in  
developing nations that were slow to begin repair work. He named 
certain regions that recently suffered financial problems, 
including Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Russia. But he 
acknowledged that parts of Africa, Central America, South America 
and the Caribbean also were likely to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, some of the developing countries of the world are  
going to have some difficulties,'' he said, adding that only 25 to 
30 of the world's nations were well prepared. ``Many more countries 
are going to have problems than not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department will begin issuing travel advisories in  
September for U.S. citizens about which countries to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen also disclosed that the government will consider  
evacuating American citizens from countries with widespread 
failures. He said each U.S. ambassador will make that decision.

<HEADLINE> Airline Passenger Sues Continental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The airline passenger accused of slamming an  
airline worker to the ground sued Continental Airlines on Friday, 
charging that poor training caused airline workers to be violent to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	John C. Davis Jr., 29, of Fredericksburg, Va., said the fight  
July 22 at Newark International Airport caused him great pain and 
anguish. His suit claims the airline training causes workers ``to 
be violent and hostile towards their customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' lawyer, Anthony J. Pope, said an airline worker pushed  
Davis' wife when she tried to go catch a child who had run ahead, 
and that the worker grabbed Davis by the neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Police cited witnesses who said Davis struck gate agent Angelo  
Sottile, 50, before throwing him headfirst onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sottile broke two neck bones and spent eight days in the  
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was arrested and charged with aggravated assault. He was  
released on $50,000 bail. Pope said Sottile was not sued because 
Continental is responsible for its employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental called the lawsuit ``a complete perversion of the  
facts.''

<HEADLINE> Domestic Partners To Get Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court Friday refused to  
exempt airlines from the city ordinance requiring companies to 
offer benefits to employees' domestic partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals means the  
airlines must begin Monday to offer bereavement leave, family 
medical leave and spousal flight discounts to San Francisco 
domestic partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, United Airlines announced it would offer benefits  
to domestic partners of employees and retirees elsewhere in the 
country beginning next May. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts,''  
said Deputy City Attorney Marc Slavin. ``But it's gratifying that 
they have finally come around to the conclusion that offering equal 
benefits makes good business sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city law, which took effect in 1997, requires companies  
doing business with the city to offer the same benefits to 
employees' domestic partners as they do to employees' spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a federal judge directed the airlines to comply with  
portions of the law for their employees in San Francisco, although 
she exempted the companies from the ordinance's pension and health 
benefits requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines appealed the decision, asking for a temporary  
exemption during the appellate process. Friday's ruling rejected 
that request. The appeal is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we have said from the very outset, this case has never been  
about gay and lesbian rights,'' said United Chairman and CEO James 
Goodwin. ``What we oppose -- and what we will continue to oppose -- 
are local municipalities intruding upon the federal domain by 
attempting to legislate the employee benefits package of companies 
like airlines doing business nationwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United employs 20,000 people in San Francisco.

	Senate Passes Tax Cut Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans today pushed through a $792  
billion tax cut package that sets up a showdown with the White 
House over how best to make use of big budget surpluses. The vote 
was 57-43. ``It helps the family and it helps the country,'' said 
the Senate Finance Committee chairman, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., 
author of the 10-year plan. President Clinton has said he would 
veto any measure that closely resembles the Senate bill or a 
similar House measure because the tax cuts are too large and 
endanger the nation's economic well-being.

hammer blows, then pulled the bedcovers to their chins and tucked 
their favorite toys beside them. The note did not directly discuss 
yesterday's slayings at the two brokerage firms, but did refer to 
greedy people. ``I don't plan to live very much longer, just long 
enough to kill ... the people that greedily sought my 
destruction,'' he wrote.

	Tripp Indicted on Wiretap Charge

<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- A grand jury indicted Linda Tripp  
today for secretly taping her phone conversations with Monica 
Lewinsky, charging she broke Maryland wiretapping laws. Mrs. Tripp 
becomes the only central figure in the Lewinsky scandal to face 
criminal charges. State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli said the 
grand jury indicted Mrs. Tripp on one count of illegal interception 
of a phone conversation on Dec. 22, 1997, after her lawyer 
allegedly told her the taping was illegal. The other count is for 
allegedly disclosing the contents of that conversation to Newsweek

prosperity and freedom to struggling Balkan countries and build a 
Europe ``at long last undivided, democratic and at peace.'' The 
summit of nearly 40 nations underscored the isolation of 
Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic, blamed for four wars that killed 
more than 250,000. ``I do not believe that we should give 
reconstruction aid to Serbia as long as it rejects democracy and as 
long as Mr. Milosevic is in power,'' President Clinton said. ``We

appeared to have been working when the aircraft plunged into the 
ocean, The National Transportation Safety Board said today. The 
board also said that Kennedy had received a weather forecast via

six to eight miles visibility. No weather warnings were issued to 
other pilots flying Kennedy's route.

	Personal Income Soars in June

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income galloped ahead  
faster than spending in June, the government said today and new 
home sales rose 3.1 percent as buyers rushed to beat slowly rising 
mortgage rates. Both reports, economists said, are an outgrowth of 
a healthy U.S. economy, a low unemployment rate, a strong stock 
market and benign inflation. Neither report is expected to raise 
eyebrows at the Federal Reserve, which nudged up interest rates 
June 30, economists said. But financial markets are jittery about 
the possibility of further rate increases.

<HEADLINE> Reds 7, Giants 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Denny Neagle went through eight months, seven  
starts and two stints on the disabled list before finally getting a 
win for the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle gave up three solo homers -- two by Barry Bonds -- but the  
Reds used a big first inning and a couple of solo homers of their 
own to beat the San Francisco Giants 7-4 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 103 degrees downtown at the first pitch, and the humidity  
made it feel like 111 degrees on Cincinnati's hottest day since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle (1-3) gave up six hits and struck out five as he held out  
in the heat for 5 2-3 innings and 95 pitches. The left-hander was 
rushed back from his latest minor league rehab stint and activated 
off the disabled list Friday to help an injury-thinned rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Reds got Neagle from Atlanta last Nov. 10 in a  
five-player deal that included Bret Boone, they figured he'd become 
their No. 1 starter. Instead, he spent two stints on the disabled 
list with shoulder weakness and went 0-3 in six starts from April 
21 to May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Neagle's first since last Sept. 26 with Atlanta.  
Appropriately, it came against the Giants -- Neagle is 10-1 career 
against San Francisco, including 8-0 in his last 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, one of three Giants who got contract extensions before  
the game, hit solo homers in each of his first two at-bats, but the 
Giants couldn't overcome a four-run first inning off Mark Gardner 
(3-9). 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Larkin had three hits and Mike Cameron and Eddie Taubensee  
hit solo homers as the Reds got their sixth victory in seven games. 
Cincinnati improved to a season-high 17 games over .500 at 59-42. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring the first two batters in the first, Gardner hit  
Sean Casey, walked Greg Vaughn, gave up an RBI single to Larkin and 
then walked Taubensee and Aaron Boone to force in another run. 
Chris Stynes followed with a two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron led off the second with his 12th homer and Taubensee hit  
his 11th homer off Gardner with two outs in the fifth for a 7-3 
lead. Gardner has given up 21 homers, the most on the Giants' 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	After Gabe White gave up an RBI double to Stan Javier with one  
out in the San Francisco ninth, Scott Williamson came in and got 
the final two outs for his 15th save. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, the Giants agreed to a four-year contract with  
first baseman J.T. Snow, who was eligible for free agency after the 
season. They also exercised Bonds' option for 2001 and Jeff Kent's 
option for 2002, keeping both of them under contract for another 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds homered in each of his first two at-bats, his second  
multihomer game of the season and the 35th of his career. He has 
hit 26 homers in Cincinnati, the second-most by a visiting player. 
Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt hit 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Aurilia also homered off Neagle, who has allowed 11 homers  
in 31 innings this season. With the win Friday, Neagle's earned run 
average shrunk from 8.17 to 7.55. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Bonds is 13-for-37 career off Neagle with five homers. ...  
Aurilia's homer was his 16th, leaving him one shy of the San 
Francisco record for a shortstop. Darryl Spencer hit 17 in 1958. 
... Gardner gave up 29 homers last season, ninth-most in the NL. 
... Reds second baseman Pokey Reese had more tests on his bruised 
left hand Friday that found no fracture. He was hit by a pitch last 
Monday and hasn't played since. ... Steve Parris, who was scratched

<HEADLINE> Singing Carter Family Member Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Anita Carter, who sang and played  
stand-up bass with the famed country music act the Carter Sisters, 
is dead at 66. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger sister of June Carter Cash and sister-in-law of  
Johnny Cash had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for several 
years. She died at her home Thursday. The cause of death was not 
immediately known, said Lou Robin, Cash's manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sister (Anita) had the greatest voice of anybody in this  
town, absolutely the prettiest voice,'' June Carter Cash said in an 
interview with The Associated Press earlier this year. ``She was 
perhaps the greatest stand-up bass player, except for when her 
arthritis made her stop playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recording sessions by the original Carter Family -- A.P. Carter,  
his wife, Sara, and his sister-in-law Mother Maybelle Carter -- in 
the 1920s marked the beginning of the country music industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Ina Anita Carter was born March 31, 1933, in Maces Spring, Va.,  
one of three daughters of Maybelle and her husband, Ezra Carter, a 
brother of A.P. who sometime played with the trio. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita and sisters June and Helen performed with the Carter  
Family as children, and then with their mother as Mother Maybelle &AMP; 
the Carter Sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Old standards of the Carter Family, such as ``Wildwood Flower''  
and ``Keep on the Sunny Side,'' were later staples of the Carter 
Sisters' repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita's soprano made her the featured singer, while June was a  
gifted comedian and Helen was considered the best overall musician. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carter Sisters joined the Grand Ole Opry radio show in 1950,  
opened shows for Elvis Presley and joined the Johnny Cash show in 
1961. June married Cash in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	On her own, Anita Carter scored a No. 2 hit in 1951 with ``Down  
the Trail of Achin' Hearts.'' She also hit duets with Hank Snow and 
Waylon Jennings, and recorded albums of folk songs in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Carter has been on the record charts in recent years:  
Carlene Carter, June's daughter from a prior marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 70, June Carter Cash is the last surviving Carter Sister.  
Helen Carter died last year. Their mother died in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita Carter is also survived by a daughter and a son.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Company Recalls Hams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- A pork and beef processor and distributor  
is recalling 130 pounds of ham products that might be contaminated 
with bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dearborn Sausage Co. products being recalled are whole and  
half spiral hams with glaze packets and red netting, produced July 
20 with the company brand label. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on a sample from  
the company's slicing room found the bacteria, listeria 
monocytogenes, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria bacteria can cause fever, headaches, nausea and can  
lead to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Dearborn Sausage decided to recall all products processed in the  
slicing room on the day the sample was taken. None of the product 
lot from which the sample was drawn was shipped, and of remaining 
products, the company has recovered all but the 130 pounds of ham. 
</P>
<P>
	Recall products have lot numbers of H56194B, G76196A and  
H56194A.

<HEADLINE> Laura Bush Campaigns for Husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Flying solo for the first time on the  
campaign trail, Laura Bush says one of her husband's big strengths 
is that he satisfies a yearning from voters for politicians who 
``won't embarrass them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think that's something Americans are interested in now,''  
Mrs. Bush, the wife of Texas governor and GOP presidential hopeful 
George W. Bush, said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	She was stressing character themes in her public appearances in  
Iowa, and repeated it during the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's the core theme,'' she said. ``I think  
Americans want somebody who they do trust, who they feel like won't 
embarrass them, but instead will make them proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Bush, who interrupted a family vacation in  
Kennebunkport, Maine, for the campaign swing, also pleaded for 
privacy. She conceded that virtually every move the Bush family 
makes will come under the glare of scrutiny, but argued for limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, I hope we'll have some privacy,'' she said.  
``I think the American people think their leaders ought to have a 
little privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Bush has been active on her husband's behalf in Texas  
and has traveled the country with him, she was on her own for the 
first time in a two-day swing through the state where precinct 
caucuses launch the presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	She pledged to keep an active campaign schedule, but said it  
will be limited by having twin daughters entering their senior year 
in high school. ``Because we have two girls who are seniors who 
will have a very busy year with school and college applications, 
I'll be at home, but I'll also campaign,'' Mrs. Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her daughters should be exempt from public scrutiny  
because they won't be part of the campaign. ``I think everyone 
understands that our daughters aren't running for office,'' she 
said. ``They won't be campaigning with us and we won't be using 
them in television ads, for instance. They want a private life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush said the decision to make the run was made easier by  
the couple's experience during former President Bush's term. ``One 
thing that really reassured us about George running for president 
is we've seen a family in the biggest job as parents,'' she said. 
``We know that we had a private family life with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush said her role would be as surrogate, not an adviser.  
``We don't really talk about politics that much,'' she said. ``Like 
every family we talk about our children, our plans for the 
weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The character issues that were her focus draw a less-than-subtle  
contrast with sex scandals that have rocked the Clinton White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has represented Texas with dignity and honor,''  
Mrs. Bush said. ``I'd love to see him do the same thing for our 
nation in its highest office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After speaking with activists, Mrs. Bush, a former elementary  
school teacher, went to an inner-city elementary school, where she 
read to second-graders and chatted with fifth-graders, underscoring 
the theme of her visit. 
</P>
<P>
	In her speeches, Mrs. Bush talked about education, but the most  
interest was in what she called ``our partnership,'' which hasn't 
gotten heavy public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marrying him was apparently the smartest political move that I  
ever made, not bad for somebody who didn't know anything about 
politics,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> SBC-Ameritech Merger Clears Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana Supreme Court ruled Friday that  
state regulators have no jurisdiction over the merger between 
telephone companies SBC Communications and Ameritech. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision removes one of the few remaining obstacles to  
completion of the Baby Bell merger, which has already been cleared 
by the Justice Department and Ohio state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate decision based on Friday's ruling, the Indiana  
court also said the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission has no 
jurisdiction over the pending merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission and Illinois regulators  
are still reviewing the proposed purchase of Ameritech by SBC -- a 
deal that would create a company with 57 million telephone lines, 
or about 30 percent of the U.S. local phone business. 
</P>
<P>
	In late June, FCC staff members said they would recommend  
letting the merger proceed after SBC and Ameritech agreed to firm 
commitments on fostering competition in local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling against Indiana's regulatory agency, which the  
companies criticized for waiting a year before trying to intervene, 
also may dissuade Nevada regulators from pursuing their own 
separate investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a negotiating team for the Indiana commission  
suggested the merger be rejected because it would not bring lower 
phone rates to customers and could stifle competition in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio-based SBC and Chicago-based Ameritech contend the  
merger would lead to more choices in phone service in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In their tentative agreement with the FCC, the companies pledged  
to launch service in 30 major markets and cut the rates they charge 
rivals wanting to lease telephone access lines in existing SBC and 
Ameritech territories. If the terms aren't met, the merged company 
will face up to $2.2 billion in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies said Friday's ruling moves the merger ahead,  
but a consumer group said the decision leaves state regulators with 
little power to protect customers from utility consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana court said the Indiana regulatory commission made  
compelling arguments for the state's interest in a pre-merger 
investigation, but that there's no law empowering the agency to 
conduct one or block the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may well be that it is more efficient in protecting the  
interests of the citizens of our state for the commission to have 
power to disapprove a shift in control of a utility, rather than 
simply power to regulate the utility after its ownership is 
transferred,'' said the majority opinion by Justice Ted Boehm. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, those arguments are for the General Assembly, not  
this Court or the Commission,'' the opinion said.

<HEADLINE> WWII Letter Warned of Nazi Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The death notices appeared in German  
newspapers in suspicious numbers in the fall of 1940, twenty-two in 
two weeks, and the families placing them used strikingly similar 
phrases about the fates of their loved ones, patients in mental 
asylums. 
</P>
<P>
	``After days of uncertainty we received the unbelievable news of  
the sudden death of my beloved wife, the mother of our little 
Christa,'' said one. 
</P>
<P>
	``After anxious uncertainty, I received from Grafeneck in  
Wurttemberg the unbelievable news that my beloved husband, our dear 
son-in-law and brother-in-law, the glass handicraftsman ... closed 
his dear eyes forever,'' said another. 
</P>
<P>
	On they went, ``unbelievable'' deaths after periods of  
``uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their bewildered sorrow, these families were uncovering a  
Nazi horror. They were signaling to fellow citizens that terrible 
acts were going on in the sanitariums of southern Germany. The U.S. 
vice consul in Leipzig, Paul Dutko, understood what was happening 
and cabled superiors. 
</P>
<P>
	But recently declassified documents do not show anything was  
done about that warning and others in the months before Germany's 
``euthanasia'' programs became undeniably known and the full weight 
of the Holocaust descended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Details so far gathered concerning these notices give them a  
'Frankenstein' setting; their attendant circumstances, described in 
this despatch, are fantastic and gruesome,'' Dutko wrote in his 
October 1940 cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Opinion has been expressed that incurable mental patients of  
Germany are being eliminated in this manner to reduce mouths to 
feed and that this is but a beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Documents found in the National Archives by the Simon Wiesenthal  
Center, a Los Angeles research organization named after the famed 
Nazi hunter, point to a series of early communications by U.S. 
officials about Nazi Germany's systematic killing of its own 
mentally ill or deformed citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	In one German letter, an anonymous correspondent wrote to NBC in  
New York saying thousands of mental patients were being killed 
monthly in southern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurry, the correspondent wrote, ``and with your expressions of  
horror prevent further murders!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Humanity will thank you.''  
</P>
<P>
	The letter ended up a month later in high offices of the War  
Department, along with a U.S. military intelligence officer's 
written opinion that the correspondent was right. But again no 
evidence of further action was found in the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Historians are divided on whether the United States could have  
saved many victims of asylum killings before entering the war in 
December 1941, either by sending diplomatic protests to Berlin or 
by disclosing what it knew earlier and mobilizing public opinion 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Los Angeles center, said  
Thursday a strong condemnation from the United States ``would have 
possibly changed Hitler's approach to how much he could get away 
with. ... Hitler may not have been able to put across his Final 
Solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington knew early in 1940 that Germany was deporting Jews to  
Poland and did not believe they were going to labor camps as 
claimed, Hier said. But officials decided not to protest because 
they did not want to drag the United States into war. 
</P>
<P>
	Hier said the same attitude apparently prevailed when evidence  
of asylum murders came in, before the publication of eyewitness 
reports in the summer of 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspicions about what was going on in asylums spread through  
much of Germany, in part because even Catholics were being 
cremated, despite opposition to cremation by bishops. 
</P>
<P>
	The asylums would cremate the bodies before the families were  
notified of the deaths, then give them the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko in his cable wrote about the ``dark and deep secrecy  
surrounding the Castle of Grafeneck,'' one of the asylums secured 
by the Black Guard -- Hitler's notorious SS. 
</P>
<P>
	Delivery trucks would drive away at breakneck speed, he said.  
Leipzig was awash with fears fed by the death notices in the three 
local papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A feeling of horror and complete insecurity has begun to set  
in.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Overhauling Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NBC is putting more ethnic diversity in  
its new and returning series, partly in response to criticism of 
the major broadcast networks for a nearly all-white slate of new 
fall shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be totally disingenuous to stand up here and say we  
did this totally on our own,'' NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa 
said Thursday, acknowledging the effect of complaints from the 
NAACP and others. 
</P>
<P>
	The network said it is working with actor-writer Keenen Ivory  
Wayans and producer Yvette Lee Bowser (``Living Single'') to 
develop a pair of sitcoms that will feature black characters. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayans' show was described as ``Not the Bradys,'' featuring an  
interracial marriage and the resulting merged family. 
</P>
<P>
	Several planned cast additions involve minority actors: Sherri  
Shepherd on ``Suddenly Susan''; Jesse L. Martin on ``Law &AMP; Order'' 
and Michelle Hurd on its spinoff, ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims 
Unit''; Darryl Theirse on ``Jesse'' and Michael Michele and Ming-Na 
Wen on ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Michele (``Homicide: Life on the Street'') will play a  
second-year resident, while Ms. Wen is reprising her role from the 
medical drama's first season as Dr. Deb Chen. Joining them will be 
Maura Tierney (``NewsRadio'') and Goran Visnjic. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Alda (``M-A-S-H'') and Rebecca DeMornay (``Risky  
Business'') will guest star in several ``ER'' episodes, while 
recurring character Dr. Romano (Paul McCrane) is now a regular. The 
series returns Thursday, Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC, more vulnerable since losing ``Seinfeld,'' also is  
overhauling shows to improve ratings and try to maintain its 
top-ranked position. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Ms. Shepherd, ``Suddenly Susan'' will add Eric Idle  
(``Monty Python''), Rob Estes (``Melrose Place'') and Currie Graham 
as the magazine the characters work for becomes a sports 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
	``Veronica's Closet'' is losing Ron Silver and bringing aboard a  
new adversary for Veronica (Kirstie Alley): Silver's young widow. 
The series, which has failed to capitalize on its stellar Thursday 
slot behind ``ER,'' is moving to Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both ``Veronica's Closet'' and ``Jesse'' are getting new  
producers. The latter also is adding Kevin Rahhm (``Everything's 
Relative'') as a cast member. 
</P>
<P>
	``West Wing,'' a new series set in the White House and  
criticized as having an unrealistically all-white cast, will add a 
black actor in a recurring role, said NBC Entertainment President 
Garth Ancier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa said the network ``should have done a better job'' in  
creating racially diverse shows. Diversity is good business for the 
network, he said, because NBC-owned stations in big cities draw 
more ethnic viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's new schedule will debut the week of Sept. 20.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel OKs Meat Price Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers and ranchers will be in a better  
bargaining position with the nation's big meatpackers under 
legislation moving through the Senate to require the companies to 
report the prices they pay for livestock, backers of the bill say. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, approved unanimously by the Senate Agriculture  
Committee Thursday, would preempt a flurry of new state laws aimed 
at soothing angry producers who think they are being squeezed by 
packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation is being prepared in the House.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day for a lot of livestock producers,'' said  
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation will give producers ``the tools they need to  
make informed marketing decisions,'' said John McNutt, president of 
the National Pork Producers Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department would collect and publish the data,  
and could start a similar program for sheep. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue had languished for years because of strong opposition  
from the packing industry until pork prices collapsed last winter 
and five states, led by South Dakota, passed their own reporting 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge recently upheld South Dakota's reporting  
requirement, which took effect July 1, but struck down a section in 
the law that forbids packers from paying different prices for the 
same quality livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri followed South Dakota in  
enacting reporting laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The price-reporting issue stems from a larger concern by many  
farmers and ranchers about a steady stream of agribusiness mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the livestock and poultry industries, four large firms in  
each sector slaughter four out of five beef cattle, three out of 
four sheep, three out of five hogs and half of all chickens, 
according to a recent University of Missouri study. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., cautioned that the reporting  
requirement could backfire on producers. The data will give packers 
a better idea of what their competitors are paying for livestock 
and the result could be lower, not higher, prices, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	If that happens, Congress would have to reconsider the law, said  
Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D. The Senate measure would expire in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers won a provision in the legislation that would prevent  
USDA from charging them for the cost of the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that process fewer than 125,000 cattle or 100,000 hogs  
would be exempt from disclosing their pricing.

<HEADLINE> Hoffa: Union Will Police Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teamsters President James P. Hoffa is asking  
the Justice Department to let the union police itself against 
organized crime in its ranks after a decade of federal supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for a fresh review of this,'' Hoffa said.  
</P>
<P>
	The union will adopt a new code of conduct to be enforced from  
within, Hoffa announced Thursday. Also, the Teamsters have hired a 
former federal prosecutor to investigate whether mob influences 
still remain 10 years of government supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are vestiges of organized crime, we're going to find  
them and we're going to ferret them out,'' said Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa won the Teamsters' presidency and was sworn in in March  
after promising to root out corruption and seek an end to federal 
oversight that the union agreed to in 1989 in order to avoid 
racketeering charges brought by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter, dated June 16, to Deputy Attorney General Eric  
Holder, Hoffa said he believes that the Teamsters can demonstrate 
that there is no longer a need for federal intervention in their 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the  
Southern District of New York who is the Justice Department 
official in charge of Teamsters oversight, said that her office had 
replied to Hoffa's letter inviting union officials to set a date to 
meet with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to meeting and working with the new leadership  
of the IBT (International Brotherhood of Teamsters) to ensure that 
the progress under the consent decree continues,'' said White's 
spokesman, Marvin Smilon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Paff, a national organizer for Teamsters for a Democratic  
Union, a faction that opposed Hoffa's election, said the union's 
recent campaign finance scandal should be taken as proof that some 
federal oversight is still needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa's election to the Teamsters' presidency last year came  
after his loss to incumbent Ron Carey in 1996 was set aside when 
investigators found that Carey's campaign had improperly benefited 
from donations the union made to third-party political 
organizations. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Giants' Sehorn Under Microscope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Stung by criticism from teammates and his  
coach, New York Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn on Friday defended 
his decision to rehabilitate his surgically repaired right knee on 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it offended somebody, I really don't care because they are  
not the people I have to worry about while rehabing,'' Sehorn said 
after the Giants' first training camp practice. ``I'm the person I 
have to worry about. If everybody likes me and I can't play 
football, it does me a lot of good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also know this, if I can play football again, no one will  
care what I did in the offseason,'' the 28-year-old added. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn's status for this season is one of the big question marks  
as the Giants look to rebound from an 8-8 season that saw them miss 
the playoffs a year after winning the NFC East. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn's absence was a part of that fall. One of the NFL's best  
cover corners, he missed the year after tearing a knee ligament 
returning a kickoff against the New York Jets in an exhibition game 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
	While many have wondered whether he would be able to regain the  
form that allowed him to intercept six passes in 1997 and to 
usually take an opponent's top receiver out of the offense, there 
have been other concerns in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Unidentified teammates were quoted as being upset that Sehorn  
worked out on his own in California and criticized him for being a 
loner who didn't get along with everyone. They were also upset he 
didn't participate with them in the offseason workout program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last time I checked, I wasn't a loner. I just do my own  
thing,'' Sehorn said. ``I don't see that as a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even coach Jim Fassel was upset that Sehorn missed voluntary  
workouts at Giants Stadium during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn took the blame for that one with an excuse. He was in the  
process of going through a divorce with his wife, Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments from teammates hurt though, particularly ones  
attributed to defensive end Michael Strahan about missing the 
offseason workouts. The two have since met and things are OK, 
Sehorn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that frustrated me was seeing myself getting  
beaten up for getting myself in shape on my own,'' Sehorn said. ``I 
wasn't healthy and I had to do something different. I have the 
confidence in my ability that I was doing what was best for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn's rehabilitation plan involved hiring personal strength  
and running coaches as well as a nutrition consultant. Most of his 
free time he spent alone. He returned to camp bigger and stronger, 
weighing in at 219 pounds, four pounds above the team's target 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn only worked out on a limited basis on Friday. He strained  
a hamstring running last week and Fassel does not want to push him 
until he is ready. It is expected that he will practice next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn understands that it's more important to be ready for  
Sept. 12, the season opener at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, he knows he has to prove himself again on the  
field. He's done it working out on his own, and the knee had 
responded well. In games, opposing receivers will dictate his 
movements and that cannot be simulated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I can play,'' Sehorn said. ``I just have to do it to  
answer the questions in my own mind, as well as everybody else's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if Sehorn does, no one will question the other areas of his  
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go 8-8 and have a lot of problems, there is a whole  
lot of things written about that aren't football related,'' Sehorn 
said. ``When you go 12-4 and go the playoffs and do well, people 
leave those things alone.''

<HEADLINE> Hawks Said To Trade Smith, Gray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Hawks will trade all-star guard Steve  
Smith and backup Ed Gray to the Portland Trail Blazers for guards 
Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is likely to be announced Monday as the NBA trading and  
free-agency period begins, the newspaper said in early Saturday 
editions. The earliest the trade can be announced is Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Atlanta doesn't really want to get rid of Steve, but for  
someone like him they would be able to get two starters,'' Smith's 
agent, Charles Tucker, was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has career averages of 17.4 points, 3.9 rebounds and 4.1  
assists, and Gray averages 6.2 points, 1.2 rebounds and 0.8 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson averages 17.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 3.9 assists.  
Rider's figures are 18, 4 and 2.8, but he is among the most heavily 
fined and suspended players in the NBA. He was suspended three 
games last season and 12 overall during three seasons in Portland 
for violations ranging from flagrant fouls to spitting on fans. 
</P>
<P>
	By trading Smith, 30, the Hawks would end a commitment of $36  
million over the next four seasons to a player who missed 14 games 
last season with bruised knees. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider, 28, will make $5.4 million next season in the final year  
of a $25.5 million rookie contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 29, will get $3 million over the next two seasons.  
Gray, 23, was Atlanta's first-round draft pick out of California in 
1997.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Show New Stem Cell Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Master cells taken from mouse embryos were  
used to repair spinal and brain cells in rats in what researchers 
say is a step toward treating nerve disorders, such as multiple 
sclerosis, by growing new tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published today in the journal Science, researchers  
say they guided the evolution of embryonic stem cells from mice 
into mature nerve cells that transplanted into rats. The new nerve 
cells then grew an insulating material that the rats lacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have shown that you can make olgiodendrocytes and  
astrocytes (two types of nerve cells) from embryonic stem cells'', 
said Dr. Ronald D.G. McKay, a molecular biologist at the National 
Institutes of Health and co-author of the study. ``This approach 
could be used for a number of diseases,'' including Parkinson's and 
multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	The olgiodendrocytes and astrocytes grown from stem cells were  
put into rats with a genetic disease that blocks formation of the 
nerve insulating material called myelin. The rats' disorder is the 
rodent equivalent of a human myelin disorder called 
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that the transplanted cells caused myelin  
to grow around the nerve fibers in the rats. McKay said that by 
starting with mouse embryonic stem cells, researchers had a 
biological marker that enabled them to prove that the new myelin 
growth in the rats originated from the transplanted mouse cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of myelin is a key part of several neurological  
diseases, particular multiple sclerosis. In MS, the body attacks 
and destroys myelin, causing a crippling loss of nerve function. 
</P>
<P>
	``A considerable amount of science has to be generated before it  
can be used in humans with multiple sclerosis, but this holds great 
promise,'' said Dr. Ian D. Duncan of the University of Wisconsin, a 
co-author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Reingold, a vice president for science at the National  
Multiple Sclerosis Society, said the study is ``intriguing and 
exciting'' because it showed stem cells could be used to grow new 
myelin. But he cautioned that the myelin disorder in the rats is 
different from multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to keep the perspective that these are not human cells  
they are playing with,'' Reingold said. ``One can hope that a 
similar (technique) will be applicable to human stem cells'', but 
that has yet to be proven, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reingold also said that even though the researchers showed that  
the transplanted cells grew new myelin, it is not clear if this 
improved the function of the nerves themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	McKay said the most important element of the study is that it  
advances the fundamental understanding of how to cause embryonic 
stem cells to mature into specific types of cells that may then be 
useful in treating patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have shown that you can take embryonic stem cells and make  
them brain stem cells and that it is really quite simple,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Embryonic stem cells arise early after conception and are the  
ancestral cells for all of the body's tissue, such as muscle, bone, 
nerves, skin and blood. Experts believe if researchers can learn 
how to direct stem cells to make specific types of cells then it 
may be possible to replace diseased tissue with new growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new study, McKay and his colleagues demonstrated they can  
direct the stem cells to grow specific types of nerve cells and 
that these cells, in turn, will grow new nerve tissue when they are 
transplanted into rats. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first study showing that embryonic stem cells can  
be used for brain and spinal cord repair in an animal model of a 
human neurological disease,'' Dr. Oliver Brustle, a University of 
Bonn researcher and first author of the paper, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next trick,'' said Duncan, ``will be to get human  
embryonic stem cells to do the same thing. If they do, then 
potentially those cells could be use for grafting into patients 
with myelin disease'' such as MS. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of human embryonic stem cells remains an unresolved  
ethical controversy. For now, federal funding of human embryo 
research is forbidden by law. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately funded researchers have grown a cell line that  
originated from human embryos and have made such cells and have 
made them available to other researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Harold Varmus, head of the National Institutes of Health,  
has announced that he believes these cells can be used in federal 
research. Varmus has been supported by the Clinton Administration, 
but many in Congress oppose human embryo research.

<HEADLINE>  Atlanta Gunman Kills 12 People, Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Authorities are grimly piecing together what they  
know about Mark O. Barton, the 44-year-old father, investor and 
former murder suspect who walked into two Atlanta brokerages and 
killed nine people. 
</P>
<P>
	Some questions may never be answered: Barton sped away after the  
shooting rampage, driving to a suburb where he killed himself 
Thursday evening as police closed in. Authorities later said he had 
killed his wife and two children before committing one of the worst 
workplace massacres in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people were injured, some by bullets and others by their  
frantic attempts to avoid the killer. Seven remained in critical 
condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, both buildings where the shootings happened were  
open. Someone left a bouquet of spring flowers -- red carnations, 
yellow chrysanthemums and white daisies -- outside each with a card 
that said, ``I'm so sorry. God bless you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the building where the first victims were killed, Allegiance  
Telecom sales manager Eric Blaier was already at work but took a 
break to sip a Diet Coke and gaze at the TV satellite trucks parked 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the game of telecom sales, it's business as usual,'' said  
Blaier, who works on the same floor where four victims were killed. 
``Unfortunately true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation on a motive has centered on Barton's work as a day  
trader, investors who dabble in risky, moment-by-moment changes in 
the stock market, which dropped sharply Thursday. But Barton's 
family was slain earlier in the week and company officials said he 
hadn't traded since April at the firm where five of his victims 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea what caused Mr. Barton to begin shooting,''  
Mayor Bill Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clues may be found in notes left with the bodies of his family.  
Police have not disclosed their contents, except to say that they 
had found a list indicating Barton had intended to kill at least 
three more people. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting rampage -- the third in the Atlanta area in little  
more than two months -- and the ensuing manhunt stunned the city of 
3.1 million and quickly captured national attention. It was the 
latest in a grisly wave of mass slayings at schools and workplaces, 
and President Clinton today expressed sadness at the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, dark-haired and 6-foot-4, was wearing khaki shorts when  
he walked into the Momentum Securities brokerage at the Two 
Securities Centre building in the trendy Buckhead section of 
Atlanta about 3 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were dead within minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a lot of blood in the hallway,'' said Chris Carter, 32,  
who works on the building's third floor. ``There was a trail of 
blood leading from one end of the hallway to the other.'' It wasn't 
immediately clear what relationship Barson had with the Momentum 
firm, if any. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton then walked across a busy six-lane road and into the  
All-Tech Investment Group, a day trading firm in the Piedmont 
Center building where he had been a client. Five died there. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, who was carrying a pistol in each hand, at one point  
reportedly said: ``I hope this doesn't upset your trading day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton came into the office ``and after speaking with our branch  
manager, suddenly stood up and for no reason opened fire on the 
manager and his secretary,'' Jai Ramoutar, director of All-Tech, 
said in a statement released from the company's headquarters in 
Montvale, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man then went into our main trading room and began  
indiscriminately shooting the customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nell Jones, 53, a day trader at All-Tech, said she was sitting  
at her computer when she heard shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting outside the door when he exited, so I was the  
first person to look into his eyes,'' Ms. Jones told WSB-TV. ``He 
was someone who was very calm and determined, no feelings. The 
bullet missed me and then he turned to shoot at other people, so I 
was able to escape,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the victims were shot with 9 mm and .45-caliber  
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next five hours, the mayor and police did not know where  
Barton was and SWAT teams and helicopters swarmed Buckhead to look 
for him. Police told workers to stay in their offices and lock the 
doors; some huddled in their cubicles four hours after the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put the furniture up against the door and barricaded  
ourselves in,'' said Morgan Lyle, 51. ``We had no idea what was 
going on so we just got really quiet and tried to stay calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About five hours after the shootings, Barton showed up at Town  
Center Mall in Atlanta's northwest suburbs, where he approached a 
woman in the parking lot, said Cobb County police spokesman Dana 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was able to run away and contact security,'' he said  
today. ``What his intentions were with her is a still part of the 
investigation.'' He wasn't sure if she recognized him from news 
reports or was afraid because of something he had said or done. She 
contacted mall security, and around the same time, someone else 
also spotted Barton's dark green minivan. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were alerted and began chasing Barton up Interstate 75.  
The chase ended when Barton shot himself as police cornered him at 
a service station in Acworth, 30 miles northwest of Atlanta and 
roughly five miles from the mall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pulled over, and then killed himself,'' Campbell said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Barton's 27-year-old wife, Leigh Ann, and  
children, 11-year-old Matthew and 7-year-old Elizabeth Mychelle, 
were found in their home in Stockbridge, 16 miles southeast of 
Atlanta. Police said they had been bludgeoned to death perhaps as 
long as two days before the office shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's bodies were in their beds, with sheets pulled up  
to their necks and towels around their heads so only their faces 
showed, said Jimmy Mercer, police chief in Henry County. Mrs. 
Barton's body was in a closet. 
</P>
<P>
	A handwritten note was left on each body and a  
computer-generated note left in the living room explained ``why he 
did what he did,'' Mercer said. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's first wife -- the mother of the children who were slain  
this week -- and mother-in-law were bludgeoned to death in 1993 in 
Cedar Bluff, Ala. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was,''  
said Richard Igou, the district attorney at the time of the 
killings. The current prosecutor declined to say whether Barton was 
still a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton worked as a chemist before he began trading stocks,  
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had swings up and down,'' said the mayor. ``He apparently  
was concerned about losses, at least expressed that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech requires each day trader to put up at least $50,000 in  
equity to open an account. To cope with the stress, the company 
employs a psychotherapist to help traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is still reeling from earlier shootings, including a  
domestic dispute July 12 that left seven people dead. In May, a 
15-year-old student shot six students in nearby Conyers, none 
fatally.

did what he did,'' Mercer said. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's first wife -- the mother of the children who were slain  
this week -- and mother-in-law were bludgeoned to death in 1993 in 
Cedar Bluff, Ala. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was,''  
said Richard Igou, the district attorney at the time of the 
killings. The current prosecutor declined to say whether Barton was 
still a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton worked as a chemist before he began trading stocks,  
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had swings up and down,'' said the mayor. ``He apparently  
was concerned about losses, at least expressed that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech requires each day trader to put up at least $50,000 in  
equity to open an account. To cope with the stress, the company 
employs a psychotherapist to help traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is still reeling from earlier shootings, including a  
domestic dispute July 12 that left seven people dead. In May, a 
15-year-old student shot six students in nearby Conyers, none 
fatally.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The gunman who killed nine people at two  
brokerage firms had lost roughly $105,000 in stock trading in less 
than two months and left a note vowing revenge on those who had 
``greedily sought my destruction,'' authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton, a chemist turned day stock-trader, walked  
Thursday into the office of two brokerage firms where he traded and 
fired randomly at traders and employees. Nine died and 13 were 
wounded, with five still in critical condition Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, he killed himself as police pulled over his van. In  
the van, police found the two guns used in the shooting, two 
additional handguns, 200 rounds of ammunition and two pairs of 
handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, son and daughter were found bludgeoned in the family  
residence. In his note, left in the apartment and released Friday 
by police, he said he wanted to spare his children a ``lifetime of 
pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton also denied killing his first wife and mother-in-law in  
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton had taken out a $600,000 life insurance policy on his  
first wife two months before she was killed. Authorities said 
Barton was the prime suspect in the bludgeoning of Debra Spivey 
Barton and Eloise Powell Spivey at an Alabama campground, but he 
was never charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason for me to lie now,'' he wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	Barton settled with the insurance company for $450,000,  
according to federal court records. Of that, $150,000 was to be 
held by Barton for his children. 
</P>
<P>
	After the rest was divided among Barton's lawyers and his  
children's temporary guardian, Barton was left with about $194,000. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Barton had used the insurance money to  
begin his stock-trading career. In a client profile Barton 
submitted to one of the brokerages, he claimed a net worth of 
$750,000 that excluded his residence, and an annual income of 
$85,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the note found with the bodies, he referred to an  
overpowering fear that drove him to murder, but contained no 
references to his recent financial losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Momentum Securities said Barton traded at the  
Atlanta office for a total of 15 days beginning June 9, and the 
trading resulted in an approximate $105,000 loss. All-Tech 
Investment Group would not release any details of his trading. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest loss -- $20,000 -- occurred Tuesday, according to a  
brokerage source that demanded anonymity. Authorities say they 
believe he killed his wife Tuesday and his children on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wake up at night so afraid, so terrified that I couldn't be  
that afraid while awake. It has taken its toll,'' Barton wrote. ``I 
have come to hate this life and this system of things. I have come 
to have no hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He killed his family by hitting them with a hammer while they  
slept and holding them underwater in the tub to make sure they 
wouldn't wake up. Later, he tucked the children's bodies into bed 
with their favorite toys. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's note focused mostly on his 11-year-old son, Matthew,  
and 7-year-old daughter, Mychelle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I killed the children to exchange them for five minutes of  
pain for a lifetime of pain,'' he wrote. ``I forced myself to do it 
to keep them from suffering so much later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dave M. Davis, a forensic psychiatrist and director of the  
psychiatric clinic at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta, said Barton's 
letter indicates he was severely depressed and paranoid. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we have these multiple murderers, who are quite different  
from serial killers, they tend to kill people like themselves,'' 
Davis said, noting Barton killed other stock traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton was worried that his mental problems would be passed on.  
</P>
<P>
	``The fears of the father are transferred to the son. It was  
from my father to me and from me to my son,'' he said. ``I had to 
take him with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The notes, written on Thursday, also said: ``I don't plan to  
live very much longer. Just long enough to kill as many of the 
people that greedily sought my destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting spree in Atlanta's Buckhead commercial  
district, Barton fled to the city's northern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	He shot himself in the head when he was cornered by police about  
five hours after the manhunt began. 
</P>
<P>
	The bizarre letter left an image of a person far different from  
the doting father and Boy Scout volunteer that neighbors described. 
He did homework with his son and stayed up late playing video games 
with his children. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors were shocked to see his photo all over TV Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Sabrina Stowers, a former neighbor in Morrow, said Barton never  
seemed stressed, even though he worked in the pressure-cooker world 
of day trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton drove Matthew and Ms. Stower's son, Brian, to Boy Scouts  
every Tuesday, she said. And he would play video games with the 
boys during sleepovers, always getting them to school on time the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Woerner, principal of McGarrah Elementary School in Morrow,  
said Barton was active and concerned with his children's education. 
Despite their mother's murder, the children never exhibited 
emotional problems, Woerner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Hauptman, Barton's former criminal lawyer, said the  
gunman was a knowledgeable chemist who could have taken even more 
lives than he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``While this thing is tragic, I don't think the city realizes  
how lucky we are,'' Hauptman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With his extensive knowledge of chemistry and the availability  
of chemicals on the open market, he could have walked into that 
building with a homemade bomb sufficient to blow up the whole 
building.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Drops 136.14 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks sank for a second straight  
session Friday, languishing behind broader market measures, as 
worries about higher interest rates sapped enthusiasm for highly 
priced stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 136.14 points to close at  
10,655.15, adding to a 180-point plunge Thursday. It was the lowest 
close since June 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip index tumbled 255.81 points, or 2.3 percent, for  
the week and dropped 2.9 percent for the month of July. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indexes posted more moderate losses. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 fell 12.31 to 1,328.72, and the Nasdaq composite index 
dipped 1.52 to 2,638.49. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes only the blue-chips count, and if you measure by the  
Dow, it's another lousy day for the market,'' said Barry Hyman, 
senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. Still, the Dow 
is up 16.2 percent so far this year, well above the modest 
expectations of analysts when the year began. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's selloff was an extension of a slump sparked Thursday  
when the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index rose 1.1 
percent in the second quarter, a bigger-than-expected jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said the data, closely monitored by Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan, could encourage the Fed to raise interest 
rates when its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets on 
Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed raised interest rates in June and has signaled its  
willingness to do so again in an effort to contain inflation. In 
the meantime, Wall Street players are carefully watching all fresh 
economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday offered a full plate of new figures that provided the  
impetus for more selling. A report from the Commerce Department 
showed that Americans' personal income surged in June and outpaced 
spending, but the nation's savings rate remains near a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Commerce Department said sales of new  
single-family homes rebounded in June, rising 3.1 percent, better 
than forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the National Association of Purchasing Management's  
Chicago branch reported that manufacturing activity in that region 
of the country area accelerated at a faster-than-expected pace in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond markets, already retreating before the figures came out,  
fell further on the news. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 
6.10 percent from 6.07 percent late Thursday. On Thursday, the rise 
in yields was even steeper. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks continued to slide Friday under the threat of  
higher rates. Dow components American Express tumbled 6 13/16 to 
131 3/4 and J.P. Morgan dropped 2 3/4 to 127 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bond investors are already jittery and when you give them an  
excuse to sell, they sell,'' said Anthony O'Bryan, a market analyst 
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``And when bonds are down, 
that throws a wet blanket on the financial sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the prospect of a second interest-rate increase hit the  
market last week, investors have gravitated away from many highly 
priced stocks, which may become less appealing when rising 
borrowing costs begin cutting into corporate profits. General 
Electric has slid 9.1 percent from its July 19 close of 120 to 109 
Friday, following a drop of 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``That drop is disconcerting,'' said Hyman. ``You don't want to  
see a bellwether Dow stock weaken like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers were mostly lower Friday, dragged down by  
DaimlerChrysler, which lost 5 7/16 to 72 1/8. The company posted flat 
earnings on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's decline overshadowed strength in some lesser-known  
Nasdaq stocks. Lam Research, a maker of equipment used to build 
circuits on computer chips, rose 9 to 55 3/8 after reporting earnings 
that topped Wall Street analysts' estimates. Also, the Russell 2000 
index of smaller companies rose 3.19 to 444.77. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 875.77 
million shares, compared with 903.57 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 4.74 to 626.07, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.64 to 788.23. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average slipped 0.05 percent.  
European indexes mostly rose, as Germany's DAX index gained 1.0 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 1.9 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 closed 1.8 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> WWII Letter Warned of Nazi Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The death notices appeared in German  
newspapers in suspicious numbers in the fall of 1940, twenty-two in 
two weeks, and the families placing them used strikingly similar 
phrases about the fates of their loved ones, patients in mental 
asylums. 
</P>
<P>
	``After days of uncertainty we received the unbelievable news of  
the sudden death of my beloved wife, the mother of our little 
Christa,'' said one. 
</P>
<P>
	``After anxious uncertainty, I received from Grafeneck in  
Wurttemberg the unbelievable news that my beloved husband, our dear 
son-in-law and brother-in-law, the glass handicraftsman ... closed 
his dear eyes forever,'' said another. 
</P>
<P>
	On they went, ``unbelievable'' deaths after periods of  
``uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their bewildered sorrow, these families were uncovering a  
Nazi horror. They were signaling to fellow citizens that terrible 
acts were going on in the sanitariums of southern Germany. The U.S. 
vice consul in Leipzig, Paul Dutko, understood what was happening 
and cabled superiors. 
</P>
<P>
	But recently declassified documents do not show anything was  
done about that warning and others in the months before Germany's 
``euthanasia'' programs became undeniably known and the full weight 
of the Holocaust descended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Details so far gathered concerning these notices give them a  
'Frankenstein' setting; their attendant circumstances, described in 
this despatch, are fantastic and gruesome,'' Dutko wrote in his 
October 1940 cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Opinion has been expressed that incurable mental patients of  
Germany are being eliminated in this manner to reduce mouths to 
feed and that this is but a beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Documents found in the National Archives by the Simon Wiesenthal  
Center, a Los Angeles research organization named after the famed 
Nazi hunter, point to a series of early communications by U.S. 
officials about Nazi Germany's systematic killing of its own 
mentally ill or deformed citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	In one German letter, an anonymous correspondent wrote to NBC in  
New York saying thousands of mental patients were being killed 
monthly in southern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurry, the correspondent wrote, ``and with your expressions of  
horror prevent further murders!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Humanity will thank you.''  
</P>
<P>
	The letter ended up a month later in high offices of the War  
Department, along with a U.S. military intelligence officer's 
written opinion that the correspondent was right. But again no 
evidence of further action was found in the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Historians are divided on whether the United States could have  
saved many victims of asylum killings before entering the war in 
December 1941, either by sending diplomatic protests to Berlin or 
by disclosing what it knew earlier and mobilizing public opinion 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Los Angeles center, said  
Thursday a strong condemnation from the United States ``would have 
possibly changed Hitler's approach to how much he could get away 
with. ... Hitler may not have been able to put across his Final 
Solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington knew early in 1940 that Germany was deporting Jews to  
Poland and did not believe they were going to labor camps as 
claimed, Hier said. But officials decided not to protest because 
they did not want to drag the United States into war. 
</P>
<P>
	Hier said the same attitude apparently prevailed when evidence  
of asylum murders came in, before the publication of eyewitness 
reports in the summer of 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspicions about what was going on in asylums spread through  
much of Germany, in part because even Catholics were being 
cremated, despite opposition to cremation by bishops. 
</P>
<P>
	The asylums would cremate the bodies before the families were  
notified of the deaths, then give them the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko in his cable wrote about the ``dark and deep secrecy  
surrounding the Castle of Grafeneck,'' one of the asylums secured 
by the Black Guard -- Hitler's notorious SS. 
</P>
<P>
	Delivery trucks would drive away at breakneck speed, he said.  
Leipzig was awash with fears fed by the death notices in the three 
local papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A feeling of horror and complete insecurity has begun to set  
in.''

<HEADLINE> Checo Placed on DL by Dodgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Robinson Checo, whose first start following  
his minor league recall was shortened to five innings because of a 
strained groin, was placed on the 15-day disabled list Friday by 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is retroactive to Thursday. The Dodgers recalled  
right-hander Matt Herges to take Checo's spot and shifted reliever 
Antonio Osuna from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day DL. 
</P>
<P>
	Checo, who allowed one run and three hits in his 9-1 victory  
Wednesday night over Cincinnati, was moved into the starting 
rotation when Carlos Perez was demoted to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Herges, 29, is getting his first promotion to the majors after  
seven-plus seasons in the minors, where he was 35-43 with a 4.53 
ERA. He was 8-3 with a 4.59 ERA in 20 starts this season at 
Triple-A Albuquerque, and has been in the Dodgers' organization 
since signing with them as a free agent in June 1992.

<HEADLINE> Orthodox Christians Call For Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- One of the largest Orthodox Christian churches  
in the United States called Friday for all North Americans who 
share the faith to unite under one leadership body, regardless of 
ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the Orthodox Church in America adopted a statement  
made Thursday by the church's presiding bishop, who called for an 
end to a ``status quo'' in which the roughly 15 Orthodox churches 
of different ethnic origins share beliefs but not leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a missionary church we are not permitted to repeat the  
mistakes of the past associated with ethnic identities,'' said 
Metropolitan Theodosius, the head of the Orthodox Church in America 
since 1977, in a speech at the church's national convention. ``Our 
doors are open to all people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first Orthodox Christians came to North America in 1794 when  
Russian missionaries arrived in Kodiak, Alaska. They lost central 
leadership in 1917 when Bolsheviks in the Russian revolution 
arrested Moscow's Orthodox Christian patriarch and stopped funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the religion is so splintered that some cities, like  
Pittsburgh, have six different branches representing different 
ethnicities. There are about 4 million Orthodox Christians in the 
United States, one-quarter of whom belong to the OCA, made up of 
Bulgarian, Rumanian, Russian and Syrian churches. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Friday isn't likely to be controversial with  
other branches of the church. Leaders from all North American 
branches passed a resolution in 1994 calling for central 
leadership. But the church's spiritual leader, Archbishop of 
Constantinople Bartholomew, rejected the idea.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Gunman Eluded Police for 5 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- As police rushed in to Securities Centre  
responding to calls of gunfire and four possible deaths, the man 
they were seeking was across the street ready to kill again. 
</P>
<P>
	While police investigated the carnage in the first building,  
Mark O. Barton walked calmly past a guard and murdered five more 
people in another part of the office complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, while nearly every officer in Atlanta was looking for him,  
Barton walked to his minivan and drove out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	As police scoured every inch of the office buildings in a  
painstaking search, Barton was already in Atlanta's northern 
suburbs, trying to steal a getaway vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	He would elude police for five hours before killing himself when  
cornered at a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how he got away,'' Police Chief Beverly Harvard  
said Friday, a day after Barton completed a bloody rampage that 
also included the deaths of his wife and two children in 
Stockbridge just south of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did everything exactly as it should have done, and the  
officers did an excellent job, especially when it came to response 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how Barton carried his two handguns, a 9 mm Glock  
and a Colt .45, as he walked around Buckhead -- a commercial 
district north of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The original call from the first round of shooting at Securities  
Centre came into police at 2:56 p.m., Ms. Harvard said, and the 
first officer was on the scene within four minutes. After surveying 
the Momentum Securities office, he called for backup, and one of 
those responding officers heard the shots from across the street at 
Piedmont Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just getting off his motorcycle,'' Harvard said. ``That  
initial call came over at 3:07 p.m., so there wasn't a lot of time 
that had passed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officer ran to the building, but somehow Barton had already  
left the first-floor office All-Tech Investment Group and escaped 
in his minivan. Police, thinking he was still inside, began a long 
search of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to remember that it was the end of the business  
day,'' Ms. Harvard said. ``And we are talking about Piedmont 
Avenue, one of the busiest streets of the city. There were a lot of 
people coming and going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since police didn't know that Barton had left, they had to  
secure both buildings and the surrounding area, looking for the 
gunman as well as those who locked themselves in offices for 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The search didn't stop until about 8 p.m., when a detective  
heard that Cobb County Police had found Barton heading north on 
Interstate 75. Soon after, Barton pulled over and killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of the office buildings -- where Barton was a frequent  
customer -- had unarmed guards in the lobbies. Piedmont Center, the 
second building, had security cameras, but they were not constantly 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	And during business hours, customers and employees can come and  
go unimpeded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Barton was a regular client, and one of those people who  
would have never been stopped,'' said Magnes Welsh, spokeswoman for 
Jones Lang Lasalle, the Chicago firm that manages Security Centre. 
``There was nothing unusual about his arrival at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such arrangements are not unusual among such office buildings,  
said Joseph Ricci, spokesman for the American Society for 
Industrial Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``For that building, that may have been adequate, especially if  
it didn't have agencies that were high threat risks,'' Ricci said. 
``There is no way to prevent someone with artillery, even if there 
is an armed guard there. If someone has the will, there isn't much 
to stop them.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel Calls Census Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-led House Appropriations  
Committee fought off Democrats Friday and insisted on calling the 
2000 Census an emergency, underlining the GOP's continuing struggle 
to pay for next year's spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	On successive party-line votes, the committee held fast to its  
prior decision to label as an emergency expense the $4.5 billion 
cost of the constitutionally ordained head count. That designation 
lets Congress ignore legally required spending limits and pay for 
an item with the anticipated federal surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight came as the panel used a voice vote to approve a $37.7  
billion measure financing the departments of justice, state and 
commerce for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A fight also loomed over a separate $94 billion measure  
financing veterans, housing, environmental and space programs, 
which also have received veto threats. That bill would cut 
Clinton's $13.6 billion proposal for NASA's budget by 10 percent 
and trim his plans for public housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the subcommittee that wrote  
the justice, state, commerce bill, said removing the census' 
emergency tag and squeezing its costs into the rest of the bill 
would ``create a crisis.'' He said it would force layoffs of FBI 
agents and closures of 80 U.S. embassies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said the emergency designation was  
only the latest in which Republicans were using budget techniques 
and estimates manufactured by ``the Wizard of Oz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obey's efforts first to remove the emergency label for the  
entire $4.5 billion, and then for a portion of it, lost by 30-26 
and 32-26. 
</P>
<P>
	White House advisers have threatened a veto by President Clinton  
because the bill cuts his requests for hiring police officers, 
legal aid for the poor, U.S. participation in international 
organizations and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also voted 29-23, mostly along party lines, to  
reject an amendment by Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., that would have 
lifted partially the four-decade Cuba trade embargo by allowing 
U.S. sales of food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	To help pay for a separate, $300 billion measure financing  
health, labor and education programs, Republicans are considering 
another budget gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
	They would delay some federal Medicaid payments to the states  
from late September 2000 into early October, said aides speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	That timing shift would push the expenditure out of the books of  
fiscal 2000 and into 2001, allowing Republicans to claim savings 
next year of several billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Wants Alien Appeals Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California will join in asking a  
federal court to halt appeals of a voter-approved ban on schooling 
and other public benefits for illegal immigrants, ending the 
state's efforts to revive the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement was reached between Gov. Gray Davis and other  
parties involved in the legal challenge during mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the agreement on Thursday, Davis said much the  
proposition's aims area already covered by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have resolved a divisive wedge issue in a way that is fair  
to the voters, the constitution and the law,'' said Davis, a 
Democrat who also opposed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations did not include supporters of Prop. 187, which  
was approved in 1994 by a 59 percent margin. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the voters who voted for Proposition 187 were without a  
voice in the litigation,'' said Sharon Browne, a lawyer for those 
who drafted the proposition and opposed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to save Proposition 187 began with Davis' predecessor,  
Pete Wilson. The Republican governor appealed after a federal judge 
ruled most of the ballot measure unconstitutional last year. Rather 
than deciding whether to drop or pursue the appeal, Davis sent the 
matter to federal mediation after taking office. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson told the Los Angeles Times that the mediation process was  
``like negotiating with yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prop. 187 sought to exclude illegal immigrants from public  
schools and from other social services including non-emergency 
health care, and required state and local officials and service 
providers to report suspected illegal immigrants to federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Some laws that mirror its provisions were in place long before  
the divisive ballot measure, and others were inspired by it. 
</P>
<P>
	The only part of Proposition 187 left intact is a provision  
imposing tougher penalties on those who sell or use false 
identification documents to hide their true citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer has until Sept. 30 to  
approve or reject the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Alternative Uses of Drugs Noted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. plans to take advantage of a  
federal ruling that allows drug company representatives to show 
doctors medical articles describing alternative uses for 
medications. Wednesday's ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Royce 
C. Lamberth, of Washington, D.C., could lead to more so-called 
``off-label'' use of drugs and expand treatment options for 
patients. Eli Lilly said yestersday it will start instructing its 
2,855-person U.S. sales force to take advantage of the widened 
marketing opportunities offered by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth's decision comes in a long-running freedom-of-speech  
lawsuit against the U.S. Food &AMP; Drug Administration. In his 16-page 
ruling, the judge called an argument by FDA lawyers 
``preposterous'' and termed one FDA requirement on drug companies 
``constitutional blackmail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Lilly was told it had to retrain its sales  
force to stop promoting its osteoporosis drug, raloxifene 
hydrochloride, as a cancer-prevention medication. U.S. District 
Judge John G. Koeltl said the drug maker could not rely solely on a 
study of its own to promote the cancer-fighting effects of the 
drug, marketed as Evista. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth's ruling applies only to peer-reviewed articles in  
medical journals and textbooks. Companies still aren't allowed to 
hand out their own brochures or make verbal sales pitches for 
off-label drug uses.

<HEADLINE> Dominator To Bid NHL Farewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Three months after losing the  
Great One, hockey is now preparing to bid farewell to the 
Dominator. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominik Hasek, whose acrobatic saves made him the NHL's top  
goalie of the 1990s, will play one more season for the Buffalo 
Sabres before retiring and returning to the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is tired of the limelight and wants his two children,  
9-year-old Michal and 4-year-old Dominika, to grow up in his 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided to retire because of my friends and my family,''  
Hasek said Thursday. ``When Michal turns 18, it will be his 
decision whether he becomes an American or a Czech boy. But now, we 
want both kids to live with us in the Czech Republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek's announcement came one day after Barry Sanders stunned  
the NFL by announcing his retirement. Wayne Gretzky, Michael Jordan 
and John Elway also retired recently, meaning five of the best team 
athletes in the world retired or announced plans to quit in the 
same year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it will be difficult to replace somebody of the  
caliber of Dominik Hasek,'' said Sabres assistant general manager 
Larry Carriere, who flew to Prague for the news conference. ``But 
he gave us the opportunity to plan ... our future a year in 
advance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo owner John Rigas said the city was blessed'' to have  
Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buffalo has had the experience of watching an extraordinary  
human being,'' Rigas said. Next season ``should be a year of 
celebration because Dominik has certainly earned that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans, media and Czech hockey players hailed Hasek's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``With all the economic and social troubles this country is  
going through, it's incredible that someone so rich wants to come 
back and live here,'' hockey fan Jitka Heksova said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek's decision was front-page news in all Czech newspapers  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Czech star Jaromir Jagr of the Pittsburgh Penguins, who  
also wants to return home when his playing days are over, said he 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's done the best thing for him and for his family,  
although he's in such great shape that he could play for another 
ten years, '' Jagr told Czech TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has earned millions of dollars, won Olympic gold and  
earned five trophies as the NHL's top goalie. But he won't miss the 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attention I've received is overwhelming,'' Hasek said.  
``It's something I don't enjoy at all. It's time to step back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman held out hope that the 34-year-old  
goalie would continue playing after next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish him well and we wish he could change his mind,''  
Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek said he first started thinking about retirement nine  
months ago and met with Sabres' management about it. He and his 
wife made the final decision to quit just before the playoffs, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite struggling much of last season with a groin injury.  
Hasek helped the Sabres reach the Stanley Cup finals, where they 
lost to Dallas in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, known for flopping to the ice to block shots and even  
releasing his stick and grabbing for the puck with two hands, was 
paid $7 million last season. Only Patrick Roy of the Colorado 
Avalanche, who made $7.5 million, had a higher salary among 
goalies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has two years remaining on his contract, $7 million for  
the upcoming season and $7.5 million for 2000-01, and the club 
holds an option at $9 million for the following season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have enough money to live a nice life, not only for me but  
for kids and wife,'' Hasek said. ``If somebody offered me $25 
million to play one more year, I wouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was the NHL's most valuable player in 1997 and 1998, but  
his career highlight came at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, 
Japan. He led the Czechs to the gold medal with a performance that 
made him a national hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo acquired Hasek in 1992 in a trade from Chicago, where he  
was a backup to Ed Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to the NHL in January 1990 after the fall of the Iron  
Curtain. It took him three years to make his big breakthrough, and 
his years as a backup left him contemplating a return to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he is getting ready to retire. And unlike some top athletes  
who quit and then return, Hasek has no plans to play again after 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I take off my equipment for the last time, that's going  
to be forever,'' Hasek said.

<HEADLINE> Mets Still Seek First Complete Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets' pitching staff is closing in  
on a mark of futility, although it hasn't affected them at all in 
the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	No Mets pitcher has thrown a complete game this season. In fact,  
Mets pitchers haven't had a complete game since Al Leiter did it 
last Sept. 4 -- a string of 124 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' streak is the second-longest stretch ever, 16 short of  
the record set by the Anaheim Angels in 1998-99. And yet, the major 
league leaders in complete games -- the Philadelphia Phillies and 
the Baltimore Orioles with 11 each -- are in third and fourth place, 
respectively, in their divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	In this era of high-octane offenses, specialized relievers and  
pitch-count paranoia, the Mets are proving complete games don't 
really matter. They are in second place in the NL East, a half-game 
behind the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a better record than they do,'' Mets general manager  
Steve Phillips said recently when asked whether it mattered that 
Baltimore had 11 more complete games than his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	It is starting to matter for the Mets' pitchers, who are growing  
weary of answering questions about their inability to pitch nine 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get sick and tired that we don't have a complete game,''  
said Leiter, who had four last year, but hasn't gone past the 
eighth inning this season. ``There are other teams that have one. 
But when you just have the goose egg up there, it's something to 
write about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, every other team has at least one. And Curt Schilling  
and Randy Johnson have eight each. The closest the Mets came was an 
8 1-3-inning performance by 40-year-old Orel Hershiser on June 29 
against the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no difference nor any sense for me to worry about  
that,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said Sunday after pulling 
Leiter with a 5-1 lead after eight innings. ``He threw 130 pitches. 
I didn't want him to throw 150 just to get the complete game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using the bullpen every game has taken its toll on Mets  
relievers, who average more than 3.1 innings per game. Even though 
they are second in the majors with a 3.26 ERA, Phillips is 
concerned enough about possible burnout that he is aggressively 
looking to deal for another reliever before Saturday's trade 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets aren't the only team struggling to complete what they  
started. In recent years, the complete game has gone the way of the 
scheduled doubleheader and the 1-0 pitchers' duel. They just aren't 
many anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, 21 percent of starts resulted in complete games, and  
Phil Niekro led the majors with 23. The next year, with Billy 
Martin at the helm, the Oakland Athletics completed 94 games and 
had three pitchers with more than 20. Through Wednesday, only 4.3 
percent of starts have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	There are many reasons for the change. Perhaps most important is  
the use of specialized relievers. Most managers would prefer to use 
a fresh reliever in late innings than let a tiring starter face a 
batter for a third or fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formula for success used to be five starters, a setup man  
and a closer,'' Rangers pitching coach Dick Bosman said. ``That 
formula has changed. Now you hope for five maybe six or seven 
innings out of the starter and match up the rest of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bullpen specialists aren't the only factor limiting complete  
games. With the proliferation of statistics and medical technology, 
managers are realizing the effects high pitch counts can have on a 
pitcher's performance and health. 
</P>
<P>
	And with more runs scored meaning more batters, and more patient  
hitters and smaller strike zones meaning more pitchers per at-bat, 
pitch counts are rising and managers are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	After Cubs phenom Kerry Wood blew out his elbow following a  
rookie season when he topped 121 pitches four times in five starts, 
other managers have taken heed. The Tigers refuse to let Jeff 
Weaver top 110 pitches, sometimes to the detriment of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't sacrifice the future for right now,'' Tigers manager  
Larry Parrish said. ``Some people are thinking I don't want to win. 
I feel like I want to win more than anybody. I'm the guy that it 
affects the most.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Army Accused of Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia (AP) -- Human rights activists today  
accused the Indonesian military of massacring 51 villagers, whose 
bodies were found in two mass graves and in a ravine in the 
northern province of Aceh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those massacres show us the cruelty and barbarism that has  
been perpetrated again and again,'' human rights activist Muhamad 
Dahlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Villagers in Beutong village, about 90 miles southeast of  
Lhokseumawe, found 31 bodies in two separate graves, and another 20 
bodies in a ravine on Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The military has stepped up its crackdown against separatist  
rebels in oil-rich Aceh province. So far this year the insurgency 
has left nearly 300 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Widagdo, a district military commander, said government  
soldiers killed 31 armed guerrillas during an assault on a rebel 
base on July 23. However, he said there were no other casualties. 
Widagdo, like many Indonesians, uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups have expressed outrage at the killings,  
saying those killed were ordinary villagers. Witnesses said 
soldiers gathered villagers and marched them into the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Antara news agency put the death toll at 52 people  
with five other people still missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Indonesian government established an independent  
commission to investigate human rights abuses in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the formation of this commission will reduce the  
number of human rights violations in Aceh,'' said Justice Minister 
Muladi. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah Saleh, a lawyer sympathetic to the rebels, helped lead  
the excavation of the graves. He said he found the body of a 
relative in one of the graves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The corpses looked like porridge,'' Saleh said. His relative  
had been accused by the Indonesian military of being a rebel 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, clashes were reported between rival Christians and  
Muslims in central Maluku province, about 1,450 miles east of 
Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital worker Malik Selang said several people were injured on  
the island of Saparua, just south of Maluku's main island of Ambon. 
</P>
<P>
	According to military officials, 15 people have been killed in  
communal violence on Ambon since last Saturday and another 109 
people have been seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital workers in the area put the death toll higher, saying  
at least 51 people have died in street fighting in the area in the 
last week.

<HEADLINE> Gwynn, McGwire Eye Milestones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Baseball fans in St. Louis, who witnessed  
history last season, may get a double dose of the same in the 
coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire and the Tony Gwynn are on the doorstep of career  
milestones. McGwire, who set a major league record with 70 home 
runs last season, hit his 38th Friday night and needed five more to 
reach 500 for his career. And Gwynn was just nine hits short of 
3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Monday, the San Diego Padres and Gwynn come to town  
for four games. McGwire, who witnessed Dave Winfield's 3,000th hit, 
is looking forward to seeing Gwynn join the club. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also tried to downplay both accomplishments, although  
his recent history shows that when he gets close to a special 
number the homers start coming in bunches. He had homered 11 time 
in 15 games, sprinting to become the 16th player in history in the 
500 club, much like he ended last season with five homers in three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not historic, it's just a milestone,'' he said. ``He'll  
get 3,000 hits, it's inevitable, and I'll get 500 homers. It's 
going to happen someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa was hoping both wouldn't happen  
on the same day, which would steal a little thunder from both 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a what-if thing,'' La Russa said. ``But I don't think  
the odds of that are too good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire is giving himself every chance to do it for the home  
fans, in front of whom he had homered 69 times in 153 career games. 
He has no plans to take any games off in the homestand, despite 
frequent triple-digit heat the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just had a day off yesterday,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals fans have a lot better chance to witness Gwynn's  
historic hit. Only 21 players have reached 3,000 hits and Gwynn 
would become the first National League player to reach 3,000 in 20 
years -- the last being the Cardinals' Lou Brock in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might get it this weekend,'' McGwire joked. ``The chances  
are really good that it'll happen here. He has a lot easier shot of 
getting nine hits over six home runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's so confident of it, he's thought ahead to the series  
and decided against a milestone pow-wow with Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just talk to him at first base after his 3,000th hit,''  
McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn has won eight National League batting titles, tied with  
Honus Wagner for most in league history and one more than Stan 
Musial won in his Cardinals career. Musial, with 3,630, ranks 
fourth in the 3,000-hit club. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire gave fans at Busch Stadium a lifetime's worth of  
memories last season when he swatted several of the most historic 
home runs. Those included No. 61, which tied Roger Maris' 
37-year-old record, No. 62, which broke it, and No. 70 in his final 
at-bat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball that McGwire hits for No. 500 is expected to have  
considerable value, recalling the excitement over last season's 
historic home run balls. Comic book creator Todd McFarlane spent 
$3.2 million to acquire the 70th homer ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The 500-home run club includes Henry Aaron, Babe Ruth, Willie  
Mays, Frank Robinson, Mel Ott, Jimmie Foxx -- but no Cardinals. 
Musial hit 475 home runs in his career.

<HEADLINE> Irvine Confident for German GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOCKENHEIM, Germany (AP) -- Eddie Irvine has good reason to be  
confident for the German Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	He drove his Ferrari to the second-fastest time over two  
practices Friday, beaten only by Italy's Jarno Trulli in a 
Prost-Peugeot. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine is trying to become the first Ferrari driver to win the  
championship in 20 years. He trails defending champion Mika 
Hakkinen by two points in the Formula One drivers' standings and 
will take the lead by winning the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine held the fastest time most of the day, until Trulli beat  
it by a half second with new tires late in the afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine's performance was spoiled by a wild spin out of a curve.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was my fault that I spun and then the engine cut out,'' the  
British driver said. ``It was a shame because the car was going 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine became Ferrari's No. 1 driver when Michael Schumacher  
broke his leg at the British GP three weeks ago. In his first race 
as the new team leader, Irvine won the Austrian GP last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel under less pressure here,'' Irvine said. ``Now I am  
more confident and content and I hope that will come through in my 
driving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.2-mile Hockenheim course is one of the fastest on the  
circuit, with long straightaways that should favor the powerful 
engines of McLaren-Mercedes cars driven by Hakkinen and David 
Coulthard. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard had the fourth-fastest time, but Hakkinen was only  
10th. Hakkinen won last year's race ahead of Coulthard. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard, who bumped into Hakkinen in the first lap in Austria,  
said he was trying to get a feel for the car on the fast circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	By knocking Hakkinen off the course in Austria, Coulthard may  
have cost McLaren a victory. Coulthard finished second there and 
Hakkinen was third. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Mika's mind and my mind will be sharpened at the start of  
the race if we are close to each other,'' Coulthard said. ``But 
it's finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard said the McLarens may not be so dominant this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at a year ago, we had a bigger, better package  
than we do this year,'' he said. ``Having a lot of power and a lot 
of speed is only one part of the lot. It's still important to go 
through the whole complex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trulli was timed in 1 minute, 45.677 seconds, .548 seconds ahead  
of Irvine, whose best lap of 1:46.225 came in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like this circuit very much since I drove here a lot in  
Formula Three and in six races, I won six times,'' Trulli said. 
``It is good for the morale to start the weekend in this way.''

	Note Surfaces From Atlanta Killer  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark O. Barton, the gunman who killed nine people  
at two brokerage firms yesterday, had lost roughly $105,000 in 
stock trading in less than two months, authorities said today. He 
left a note vowing revenge on those who had ``greedily sought my 
destruction.'' Barton's wife, son and daughter were found 
bludgeoned in the family residence. Also in the note -- left in the 
family's apartment -- Barton denied killing his first wife and 
mother-in-law in 1993. In the van with his body, police found the 
two guns used in the shooting, two additional handguns, 200 rounds 
of ammunition and two pairs of handcuffs.

	Heat Wave Death Toll Climbs to 91  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The heat wave gripping much of the nation has  
been linked to at least 91 deaths in 17 states since July 19. The 
Midwest has been hit hardest, with Missouri logging 29 heat-related 
deaths, Illinois 23 and Ohio 10. Temperatures neared 100 degrees 
today in many cities, and the heat index -- a measure of temperature 
and humidity -- rose past 110 in several places. It was 104 degrees 
in Louisville, Ky., and 102 at the Little Rock, Ark., Air Force 
Base. 

</P>
<P>
	Senate Passes Tax Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed their $792 billion tax cut  
through the Senate today, courting a veto struggle this fall with 
President Clinton. Democrats claim the measure shortchanges 
Medicare and other domestic programs. The vote was 57-43 -- largely 
along party lines -- in favor of the GOP plan. The 10-year measure, 
which includes broad-based tax relief as well as provisions 
designed to address the so-called marriage penalty, would make it 
easier to accumulate retirement savings and pay for education.

	NTSB: JFK Jr. Plane Functioned OK  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane apparently was  
functioning properly when it slammed into the ocean, but the 
weather may have been worse than a forecast Kennedy had received, 
the government said today. The National Transportation Safety 
Board, in its first update in a week on its investigation of the 
July 16 crash that killed Kennedy, his wife and her sister, said 
about 75 percent of the wreckage has been recovered from the waters 
off Martha's Vineyard, Mass. The wreckage shows no sign of 
in-flight breakup or fire, and the engine appeared to have been 
working fine at the time of the crash.

	Tripp Indicted on Wiretap Charge  
</P>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Linda Tripp, whose secretly recorded  
phone conversations with Monica Lewinsky led to the impeachment of 
President Clinton, was charged by the state of Maryland today with 
illegal wiretapping, making her the only major figure in the sex 
scandal to face a criminal charge. A grand jury indicted Mrs. Tripp 
on two counts of breaking Maryland's wiretapping law. Each offense 
could carry up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine if she 
were to be convicted.

	Morocco King To Follow Dad's Reforms

	RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- Morocco's new king said today he will  
honor his late father by continuing his free market reforms and by 
seeking peace in the region. In his first address to this North 
African nation since assuming the throne July 23 after the death of 
his father, Hassan II, the king said he wanted to continue to build 
a free and open country. He said one of his priorities would be to 
continue to improve Morocco's human rights record.

	House Panel Eases Proposed NASA Cut  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Appropriations Committee voted today  
to ease proposed cuts in NASA's budget but left the space agency 
well short of what President Clinton wants for next year. NASA's 
extra $400 million was part of an effort by majority Republicans to 
bolster support for a massive $92 billion measure financing 
veterans, housing, space and environment programs for the coming 
fiscal year. The panel also boosted spending for veterans' health 
care by $700 million, responding to pressure from veterans' groups.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks slid for a second straight session today,  
with the Dow Jones industrial average languishing behind other 
indicators amid concerns over interest rates. The Dow ended down 
136.14 points at 10,655.15, adding to a 180-point plunge yesterday. 
On the NYSE, advancers led decliners 1,495-1,445. The Nasdaq was

</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The New York Mets overcame Sammy Sosa's major  
league-leading 38th home run and rallied to beat the Chicago Cubs 
10-9 today. Rickey Henderson, with the game tied 8-8, hit a leadoff 
homer in the sixth off Kyle Farnsworth (2-4) to help lead the Mets 
to their 14th win in 18 games. John Olerud added a key insurance 
run with a solo homer off Rick Aguilera in the ninth.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Portrait of Atlanta Gunman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A father who loved to play with kids. An easy-going Scout  
master. A churchgoing man who worked all day at his computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton shattered the gentle images held by some of his  
former neighbors in a burst of gunfire at two office buildings in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, 44, who ran a chemical consulting business out of his  
home before becoming a securities day trader, shot himself to death 
in his minivan as police closed in on him Thursday. Earlier, he 
opened fire at two brokerage firms, killing nine workers and 
wounding a dozen more. 
</P>
<P>
	As police combed Atlanta looking for him, they made a grisly  
discovery: the bodies of Barton's second wife, and his son and 
daughter from a previous marriage, all bludgeoned to death with a 
blunt instrument in the two days before the office shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, who had split up with his wife, Leigh Ann, 27, earlier  
this year, had been living with his two children, 11-year-old 
Matthew and 7-year-old Elizabeth Mychelle, in Morrow, a suburb 
south of Atlanta. Over the July 4th weekend, the three of them 
moved to nearby Stockbridge to live in Mrs. Barton's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton had lived in Morrow for about a year, renting a neat  
two-story house in a modest residential neighborhood, said 
Christine Johnson, who lived two doors away. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Johnson said Barton seldom left his house and was always at  
work on his computer. When he did go out, it was to walk around the 
neighborhood for exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept to himself,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``If he drove by in  
his van he threw his hand up. But that was about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another neighbor, Sabrina DeFreese Stowers, said Matthew was  
best friends with her son Brian, 13. It was Barton who persuaded 
the shy Brian to join the Scout troop he helped run. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just too mild-mannered,'' said Ms. Stowers, a postal  
worker. ``Nothing bothered this man. ... He just seemed like he 
didn't have a violent bone in his body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A good conversationalist, they once discussed their mutual  
liking of chemistry. Barton had either studied chemistry or held a 
chemistry degree, Ms. Stowers recalled. She had also met Mrs. 
Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seemed like the ideal couple. He was an attractive guy. A  
nice guy,'' she said. ``I didn't know he was a psycho.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian, who had recently spent the night at the Bartons' home in  
Stockbridge, said the elder Barton was playful. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just like me or Matthew,'' the boy said. ``He would  
play basically anything we would play, like we would show him 
something on the Internet that we found, like games, and he would 
help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brian's grandmother, Marsha Jean DeFreese, said Barton  
``looked odd to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought something's weird about this man.''  
</P>
<P>
	Barton grew up in Sumter, S.C., according to people living near  
Barton's widowed mother. He didn't visit often, but he did attend 
his father's funeral several years ago, said Alice Mathis, who 
lives across the street from Gladys Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	To Cindy Northcutt, who lived on the same street as Barton, the  
man ``always seemed preoccupied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He had other things on his mind,'' she said. ``He didn't seem  
friendly at all. He was making an effort to have something to do 
with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors in Morrow said Mrs. Barton was active in the Girl  
Scouts. On Wednesday, she was expected at an outing, but never 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Barton's first wife, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and her  
mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, were bludgeoned to death with a 
sharp instrument at a campground in northeast Alabama. Authorities 
said Barton was the prime suspect, but he was never charged. Barton 
eventually got custody of their two children. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months after the slayings, Mrs. Spivey's husband told the  
Atlanta Journal-Constitution that ``until the murders, Mark was the 
perfect son-in-law.''

<HEADLINE> Browns Sign Free-Agent QB Thad Busby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns, looking for another  
quarterback after John Dutton broke his foot in training camp this 
week, signed free-agent quarterback Thad Busby on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Busby was signed by San Francisco as an undrafted free agent  
last year but was cut during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Busby, 24, was the Atlantic Coast Conference offensive player of  
the year in 1997 at Florida State. He ranks fourth in school 
history with 411 completions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutton, who was competing for the team's third-string  
quarterback spot, broke a bone in his left foot during drills and 
will be in a cast for four weeks.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Y2K Expert Predicts Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Don't expect the Year 2000 technology problem  
to disappear after Jan. 1. President Clinton's top Y2K expert said 
failures could extend well beyond New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Although John Koskinen predicts there will be a national ``sigh  
of relief'' in the early hours of Jan. 1, he also anticipates 
scattered electronic failures over the first days, weeks and even 
months of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000  
Conversion, said in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press 
that some failures may not become obvious until the end of January, 
the first time after the date rollover that consumers review their 
monthly bank statements, credit-card bills and other financial 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't evaporate until after that,'' Koskinen said.  
``Clearly, this is more than a January 1 problem.'' But he also 
slightly hedged his predictions: ``None of us are really going to 
know until after January 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unless repaired, some computers originally programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year will not work properly 
beginning in 2000, when those machines will assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Some computer systems may shut down quickly with obvious  
failures, and others may gradually experience subtle problems or 
degraded performance that may take weeks to notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more difficult problem will be where the system looks like  
it's doing it correctly but it's doing it all wrong,'' Koskinen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some failures won't be recognized until the work week starts  
Monday, Jan. 3, as employees return to their offices and turn on 
their computers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Repaired computers also will need to recognize 2000 as a leap  
year, even though most years ending in ``00'' don't need to adjust 
for Feb. 29, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A new $40 million Information Coordination Center being  
organized down the street from the White House will operate until 
March, sharing information about failures with states, federal 
agencies, corporations and foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen urged people to prepare for possible trouble as they  
might for a winter storm or a hurricane: Buy flashlights and 
batteries, keep enough cash, food and water for several days and 
make copies of financial and medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also cautioned against stockpiling supplies, which could  
lead to local shortages, or draining bank accounts, which could 
strain the nation's financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get a couple hundred million Americans doing anything  
differently, we're going to create economic problems,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An AP poll this month found most Americans don't expect major  
problems, but nearly a third plan to stock up on food, water and 
other supplies. About one-quarter of Americans planned to withdraw 
cash in case of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen predicted the most widespread problems will occur in  
developing nations that were slow to begin repair work. He named 
certain regions that recently suffered financial problems, 
including Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Russia. But he 
acknowledged that parts of Africa, Central America, South America 
and the Caribbean also were likely to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, some of the developing countries of the world are  
going to have some difficulties,'' he said, adding that only 25 to 
30 of the world's nations were well prepared. ``Many more countries 
are going to have problems than not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department will begin issuing travel advisories in  
September for U.S. citizens about which countries to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen also disclosed that the government will consider  
evacuating American citizens from countries with widespread 
failures. He said each U.S. ambassador will make that decision.

<HEADLINE> Payton Buys Part of Arena Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- While he waits for a liver transplant, Walter  
Payton is concentrating on his two great loves: family and 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL great still makes occasional appearances, but he spends  
much of his time lately getting son Jarrett ready for college. The 
younger Payton, a running back like his father, will play for the 
University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've enjoyed watching him prepare for his freshman football  
season, since good old dad here has a little bit of experience in 
that area,'' Payton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Payton became a part-owner of an Arena Football  
team when Chicago was awarded an expansion squad for the 2001 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months ago, he announced he has a serious liver disease and  
needs a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am feeling as good as can be expected for someone who needs  
a transplant,'' he said. ``I have good days and bad days. I am in 
good spirits regardless -- following doctors orders and getting lots 
of rest, which is a challenge in and of itself when you are 
accustomed to the pace I am used to keeping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's career rushing leader announced in February he has  
primary sclerosing cholangitis, a rare liver disease that can only 
be treated with a transplant. He was placed on the transplant list 
a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton's Chicago AFL team, which doesn't have a name yet, will  
begin play in the spring of 2001 and brings the number of teams in 
the indoor football league to 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football has always and will always play a large role in my  
life,'' Payton said. ``I have become involved with AFL due to the 
fact that it has become a mature league and I saw enormous 
opportunity, especially for the Chicago market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league also announced Thursday that its minor league will  
begin next May. Those teams will be in: Birmingham and Huntsville, 
Ala.; Greenville, S.C.; Jacksonville, Pensacola and Tallahassee, 
Fla.; Norfolk, Richmond and Roanoke, Va.; Oklahoma City and Tulsa, 
Okla.; Little Rock, Ark.; and the Quad Cities in Illinois and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Shreveport, La., and Fort Myers, Fla., will get minor league  
teams in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to grow the game of football at the grass roots  
level,'' AFL commissioner David Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton is a member of the Chicago Bears' board of directors, and  
has said in the past he'd like to be the NFL's first black owner. 
His ownership of the AFL team won't prevent that if something comes 
up in the future. 
</P>

	The NFL purchased an option in the AFL earlier this year, and  
Baker would like NFL owners to run future AFL teams. Saints owner 
Tom Benson is already involved, and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and 
Patriots owner Robert Kraft also have expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, though, Payton will focus on his AFL team. He's not  
sure yet what he'll do, but he wants an active role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the Chicago team will not be playing until 2001, there  
is plenty of time to determine exactly what role I might play,'' he 
said. ``I anticipate, health permitting, to be involved in areas 
such as player personnel.''

<HEADLINE> Religious Leaders Eye Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A minister who represents 300,000 United  
Methodists in northern Georgia called for tighter regulations on 
guns Friday in the aftermath of the Atlanta office shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Moses Woodruff of Atlanta acknowledged that a  
``combination of things'' drove Atlanta gunman Mark O. Barton to 
kill, but he said the problem was ``exacerbated by access to 
guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other religious leaders made similar calls to toughen the  
nation's gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taught in Leviticus 19, `Do not profit by the blood of  
your neighbor,''' said Rabbi David Saperstein, who leads a 
religious coalition working for nationwide gun controls. The group 
includes the Roman Catholic Church, mainline Protestant 
denominations and Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	A prominent clergyman who opposes gun controls, the Rev. Richard  
Land of the Southern Baptist Convention, predicted that proponents 
of tighter regulations will use Thursday's deaths ``to whip up 
hysteria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such arguments, he said, won't be effective with his  
constituency, the nation's largest group of Protestants. Since 
Littleton, most conservative Protestants have tended to blame the 
media for the nation's violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of us grew up in a region where guns were as natural a  
thing as lawn mowers,'' he said. ``The problem is not the guns but 
what people are doing with the guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, he cited Barton, who killed his wife and children  
with a hammer before shooting nine people. Barton, he said, was a 
disturbed man who ``would have killed whether he had access to guns 
or not.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Still Seek First Complete Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets' pitching staff is closing in  
on a mark of futility, although it hasn't affected them at all in 
the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	No Mets pitcher has thrown a complete game this season. In fact,  
Mets pitchers haven't had a complete game since Al Leiter did it 
last Sept. 4 -- a string of 124 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' streak is the second-longest stretch ever, 16 short of  
the record set by the Anaheim Angels in 1998-99. And yet, the major 
league leaders in complete games -- the Philadelphia Phillies and 
the Baltimore Orioles with 11 each -- are in third and fourth place, 
respectively, in their divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	In this era of high-octane offenses, specialized relievers and  
pitch-count paranoia, the Mets are proving complete games don't 
really matter. They are in second place in the NL East, a half-game 
behind the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a better record than they do,'' Mets general manager  
Steve Phillips said recently when asked whether it mattered that 
Baltimore had 11 more complete games than his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	It is starting to matter for the Mets' pitchers, who are growing  
weary of answering questions about their inability to pitch nine 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get sick and tired that we don't have a complete game,''  
said Leiter, who had four last year, but hasn't gone past the 
eighth inning this season. ``There are other teams that have one. 
But when you just have the goose egg up there, it's something to 
write about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, every other team has at least one. And Curt Schilling  
and Randy Johnson have eight each. The closest the Mets came was an 
8 1-3-inning performance by 40-year-old Orel Hershiser on June 29 
against the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no difference nor any sense for me to worry about  
that,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said Sunday after pulling 
Leiter with a 5-1 lead after eight innings. ``He threw 130 pitches. 
I didn't want him to throw 150 just to get the complete game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using the bullpen every game has taken its toll on Mets  
relievers, who average more than 3.1 innings per game. Even though 
they are second in the majors with a 3.26 ERA, Phillips is 
concerned enough about possible burnout that he is aggressively 
looking to deal for another reliever before Saturday's trade 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets aren't the only team struggling to complete what they  
started. In recent years, the complete game has gone the way of the 
scheduled doubleheader and the 1-0 pitchers' duel. They just aren't 
many anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, 21 percent of starts resulted in complete games, and  
Phil Niekro led the majors with 23. The next year, with Billy 
Martin at the helm, the Oakland Athletics completed 94 games and 
had three pitchers with more than 20. Through Wednesday, only 4.3 
percent of starts have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	There are many reasons for the change. Perhaps most important is  
the use of specialized relievers. Most managers would prefer to use 
a fresh reliever in late innings than let a tiring starter face a 
batter for a third or fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formula for success used to be five starters, a setup man  
and a closer,'' Rangers pitching coach Dick Bosman said. ``That 
formula has changed. Now you hope for five maybe six or seven 
innings out of the starter and match up the rest of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bullpen specialists aren't the only factor limiting complete  
games. With the proliferation of statistics and medical technology, 
managers are realizing the effects high pitch counts can have on a 
pitcher's performance and health. 
</P>
<P>
	And with more runs scored meaning more batters, and more patient  
hitters and smaller strike zones meaning more pitchers per at-bat, 
pitch counts are rising and managers are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	After Cubs phenom Kerry Wood blew out his elbow following a  
rookie season when he topped 121 pitches four times in five starts, 
other managers have taken heed. The Tigers refuse to let Jeff 
Weaver top 110 pitches, sometimes to the detriment of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't sacrifice the future for right now,'' Tigers manager  
Larry Parrish said. ``Some people are thinking I don't want to win. 
I feel like I want to win more than anybody. I'm the guy that it 
affects the most.''

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Saturn Owners Gather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) -- Richard and Joan Stover had so much  
fun at the first Saturn ``homecoming,'' a rain-soaked, 
mud-splattered affair five years ago, they had to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a family reunion,'' said a smiling Mrs. Stover, who wore  
a ``This is Saturn Country'' T-shirt and carried a red umbrella to 
ward off the intense sun as they listened to a doo-wop band Friday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stovers, who drove up from Fort Pierce, Fla., in their new  
``homecoming edition'' sedan, were among thousands streaming into 
Spring Hill for two days of plant tours, test drives, parades and 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 44,000 attended the last homecoming and as many as  
60,000 were expected this weekend, paying $40 per adult and $15 for 
every child over 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn hopes the event will help jump-start the ``different kind  
of car company,'' a General Motors subsidiary that has seen an 
erosion in customer satisfaction, declining sales and labor strife 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Saturn dropped to No. 6 after four years in the top  
slot of the J.D. Power and Associates annual survey of customer 
sales satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn chairman and president Cynthia Trudell acknowledged this  
was a blow for a company that touts its customer loyalty and 
``no-haggle'' selling practices, but said she doesn't believe 
dealers were putting pressure on customers because of slumping 
sales and dealer profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what's most exciting about homecoming,'' she said. ``It  
gives us an opportunity to talk directly to our customers to find 
out,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks spent a lot of time looking for relief from the sunny  
skies and 101-degree heat, seeking shade under camera platforms to 
set up blankets in front of a stage, using spray bottles connected 
to fans to spray a cool mist on their faces and arms, and draining 
free coolers of ice water before midday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only corporation in America that does this kind of  
thing,'' said Marie Wilcox of Indianapolis as she stood in line to 
get on a bus for a tour of the plant nestled among the rolling 
hills of this small Middle Tennessee town. ``To see firsthand how 
the car is made, that's pretty awesome.''

<HEADLINE> Indians' Ramirez in Car Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTLAKE, Ohio (AP) -- Cleveland Indians outfielder Manny Ramirez  
was involved in a minor four-car accident Thursday night but no one 
was hurt or cited in the accident. It wasn't clear whether Ramirez 
was driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Capt. Guy Turner said today that he had few details on  
the accident. Two vehicles were towed but no one was hurt and no 
ambulance was dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear whether the 27-year-old Ramirez was driving or a  
passenger, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred along a two-lane road where construction  
crews have been installing sidewalks. Turner said it was unlikely 
the crew was working after dark when the accident occurred in this 
upscale suburb 10 miles west of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the accident must await the completion of an approved  
report by the investigating officer, who was due back on duty for 
the evening shift today, Turner said. He said he could not provide 
information from the officer's notes at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez is hitting .325 and leads the AL with 106 RBIs.

<P>
	WESTLAKE, Ohio (AP) -- Cleveland Indians slugger Manny Ramirez  
escaped injury when his car was hit from the rear in a four-car 
chain-reaction accident. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was hurt or cited in the Thursday night accident, police  
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Roche, prosecutor in this Cleveland suburb, was reviewing  
the case to decide whether to file charges. Police Capt. Guy Turner 
ruled out alcohol as a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said Ramirez had stopped behind a car waiting to turn  
left across traffic when his auto was hit from the rear. Ramirez 
then got pushed into the first car. 
</P>
<P>
	The front two cars, including Ramirez's, could be driven away  
but the rear cars had to be towed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez was hitting .325 and leading the American League with  
106 RBIs entering Friday night's game.

<HEADLINE> Boxing Officials Sue NJ Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Two female boxing officials are suing the  
New Jersey athletic commissioner, saying their civil rights were 
violated because they were refused licenses to work in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxing judge Lynne Carter and referee Velma Garrick filed the  
lawsuit in U.S. District Court, charging that Commissioner Larry 
Hazzard discriminated against them because of their gender. The 
lawsuit, which also names the State Athletic Control Board, alleges 
that Hazzard refused to renew Carter's license for 1997 and refused 
to grant Garrick a license in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazzard declined to comment on the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $75,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Carter became the first black female boxing judge in New Jersey  
in 1982 and Garrick has been a referee at more than 50 professional 
matches. Both are licensed in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither women was given a hearing before being denied their  
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also charges that Hazzard and the control board's  
decision caused the two women pain and emotional distress.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Open, Optimism Abounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- The future is now for the only NFL team  
that has never won a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a message repeated over and over by the New Orleans  
Saints' hierarchy on the first day of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, if I had told you the Falcons would be in the Super  
Bowl, you would have laughed,'' general manager Bill Kuharich said 
Thursday. ``This year, we're the team that will make believers of 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints' dedication to proving Kuharich right could be seen  
in their offseason workouts, which were the most successful in the 
history of the franchise, with 98 percent of the players 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys understand that our chance is now, not three years  
from now,'' coach Mike Ditka said. ``The bottom line in this 
business is winning. The bottom line for me is winning. I didn't 
win my first two years. If I don't win this year, I shouldn't be 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans, which has not had a winning season in seven years,  
was 6-10 in each of Ditka's first two seasons. Yet when Ditka 
introduced Ricky Williams to a crowd of fans following the draft 
and pronounced his team playoff bound, nobody snickered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe everything he says,'' said Williams, who predicted  
at least a trip to the playoffs. ``This is a good team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Heisman Trophy winner isn't able to carry the Saints, he  
should at least give it a big boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka, who still dreams of the days when Walter Payton was  
carrying the football for him, believes Williams is from the same 
mold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this kid is the real thing,'' Ditka said. ``I don't  
think anything bothers him except not doing his job and not 
winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is to get the football to Williams at least 20 times a  
game -- something the Saints have not done for other running backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamar Smith, last year's leading rusher, had only 138 carries --  
an average of eight a game -- and 457 yards. The Saints have not had 
a 1,000-yard rusher in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, people are going to try to stack the line and stop  
Ricky,'' offensive coordinator Danny Abramowicz said. ``We have to 
find a way to stop that and get the ball to him anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abramowicz believes that Williams can wear down opposing  
defenses if he is given enough opportunities. He also believes that 
Williams can be used as a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints, who ranked 28th in the NFL in offense last season  
and dead last in rushing, also signed left guard Wally Williams, 
coupling him with Pro Bowl tackle William Roaf and leaving former 
No. 1 pick Kyle Turley in his natural position at right tackle to 
stabilize the line. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans traded their No. 2 pick for wide receiver Eddie  
Kennison, counting on his speed to provide a deep threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``People talk about us giving up all our picks to get Ricky,''  
Kuharich said. ``But that's misleading. It's not as if we have only 
one new player from last year. We've been active in getting people 
we need and keeping the good players we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Billy Joe Hobert, who missed all of last season with  
a ruptured right Achilles' tendon, is the starter going into 
training camp. Although Hobert has only a 3-2 record as a starter, 
Ditka has enough confidence in him and backups Billy Joe Tolliver 
and Danny Wuerffel to pass on acquiring Jeff George, Warren Moon, 
Neil O'Donnell and Eric Kramer via free agency, or trading for Jim 
Harbaugh or Brad Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only worry I have about that position is someone getting  
hurt,'' said Ditka, who has started four different quarterbacks in 
each of his first two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense had a hard time last year, partially because it was  
on the field for most of every game. This year, Ditka said that 
should not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the work we've done has been on the offense. That's  
probably not fair, but I don't think the defense needed as much 
work,'' Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints on Thursday re-signed safety Sammy Knight, who led  
the team with six interceptions last year. Knight agreed to a 
five-year deal worth $9.225 million. 
</P>
<P>
	They also acquired veteran corner back Ashley Ambrose, counting  
on his cover skills to beef up the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
                               *Rams    	
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams have reportedly offered holdout running back  
Marshall Faulk a seven-year contract worth $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But his agent, Rocky Arceneaux, opposes a seven-year deal unless  
the Rams guarantee they won't make Faulk a franchise or transition 
player after four years. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	Alonzo Spellman, out of football since the Chicago Bears  
released him in 1998 following several bizarre episodes, has agreed 
to a contract with the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Spellman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said the defensive lineman  
accepted a one-year contract for the veteran minimum of $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Bengals    	
</P>
<P>
	Carl Pickens, the leading receiver in Bengals history, will sit  
out the season if the team doesn't trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	As Cincinnati prepared to open training camp in Georgetown, Ky.,  
Pickens was working out in Atlanta. His agent, Steve Zucker, said 
the receiver won't play for the Bengals this season. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Panthers    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Robert Daniel will miss the season after fracturing a  
disc in his neck during a blocking drill. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery to fuse the two vertebrae between the disc will be  
performed next week after the swelling goes down. Recovery is 
expected to last three to four months, but the team said he should 
be able to play next season. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Mike Peterson, the Colts' second-round draft pick,  
ended his holdout and joined the team at training camp in 
Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts didn't announce terms of the agreement, but his agent  
said Peterson agreed to a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Jaguars    	
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jays Honor Cito Gaston, Joe Carter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Cito Gaston and Joe Carter were given a permanent  
place in Toronto Blue Jays' history Friday night, as the team added 
their names to the Level of Excellence, the highest award bestowed 
by the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston and Carter joined Dave Stieb and George Bell as the only  
Blue Jays to receive the honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston managed the Blue Jays to two World Series championships,  
four division titles and a franchise-record 681 wins. Carter, the 
franchise career leader with 203 home runs, won the 1993 World 
Series against Philadelphia with a homer in the bottom of the ninth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	After Carter and Gaston received a three-minute standing ovation  
upon being introduced, a video tribute was played and both spoke 
briefly before the Blue Jays' game against the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the great moments in my career, the World Series-winning  
homer, the All-Star games, happened in Toronto,'' Carter said. ``I 
couldn't have asked for a better place to play, and I feel very 
honored to join the level of excellence with my good friend, and I 
think one of the game's best managers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston, who said recently he could have received more credit for  
the Blue Jays' success, thanked the fans for the way he was 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still live here. I love it here,'' Gaston said. ``I want to  
thank the fans and the organization. You've treated me like 
family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays unveiled commemorative signs as Gaston and Carter  
received another standing ovation. They also threw out the 
ceremonial first pitches.

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Dawson Not Ready To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- As players 10 years younger barely made it  
through a succession of sprints Friday on the first day of the 
Pittsburgh Steelers' camp, Dermontti Dawson cruised through them 
with little effort. 
</P>
<P>
	At 34, an age at which many offensive linemen are on their last  
legs both competitively and career-wise, Dawson apparently hasn't 
lost a step. Or his edge on the rest of the NFL's centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's the motivation that comes with being a nearly  
unanimous pick for the All-Pro team the last couple of years -- 
exactly the kind of drive that Barry Sanders, another player at the 
top of his game, couldn't muster. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders retired this week from the Detroit Lions while still in  
the upper echelon of NFL running backs, with Walter Payton's NFL 
rushing record in sight and millions of dollars remaining on his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	To Dawson, the urge to compete, and to make money, remains too  
strong to step away from a game he still dominates as few NFL 
players do at any position. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of money,'' said Dawson, who will make $2.9 million  
in base salary this year and $3 million in 2000. ``When those 
paychecks start coming in, it's hard to walk away from that much 
money. Where else am I going to have the chance to make that much 
money in my lifetime? 
</P>
<P>
	``But you've got to have a passion for this game to enjoy it, to  
play it, and I still do. Maybe Barry didn't have that passion left 
in him,'' Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers' play dropped off precipitously last year as a team  
that fell four points short of reaching the Super Bowl in the 1997 
season finished 7-9, their first losing record since 1991. But if 
there was any drop-off in Dawson's play, it wasn't apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's so consistent and so durable,'' coach Bill Cowher said.  
``Week in and week out, he's there. He plays at a very high level 
and certainly he has been recognized as one of the very best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as quarterback Kordell Stewart struggled nearly all season,  
creating even more pressure on the Jerome Bettis-led running game 
to produce, Dawson constantly fought off double teams to create 
running room up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	As his 11th NFL season approaches, Dawson realizes he is much  
closer to the end of his career than the beginning. But that end is 
not yet in sight, especially for a player who someday may join the 
center he succeeded, Mike Webster, in the Pro Football Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 34, which is old in football years, so it's a year-to-year  
thing with me right now,'' he said. ``The first and foremost thing 
is to get through this year, then I'll hope to make it through next 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 season would be the last under his current contract,  
and Dawson has not yet ruled out playing beyond then, even though 
he would be 36 in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it happens, it happens,'' he said. ``As long as the  
Steelers want me here, that's the key. But when the time comes, 
I'll know.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Urges Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, eyeing a Senate run  
in New York, said Friday that the shooting rampage in Atlanta 
demonstrates the need for stronger gun-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it does once again urge us to think hard about what we  
can do to make sure that we keep guns out of the hands of children 
and criminals and mentally unbalanced people,'' the first lady said 
as she emerged from a breakfast stop at an Elmira restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that the Congress would take action on the  
legislation that is now pending before it as soon as possible,'' 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who has stepped up her calls for tougher  
gun-control laws since the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., 
earlier this year, said she hopes ``we will come together as a 
nation and do whatever it takes to keep guns away from people who 
have no business with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is on a summer-long ``listening tour'' of New York  
as she considers running for the Senate seat being vacated next 
year in New York by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	A potential opponent on the Republican side, New York City Mayor  
Rudolph Giuliani, is also a strong advocate for gun-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, an Atlanta-area man killed nine people in the city  
and later killed himself. Authorities said Mark Barton also killed 
his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control can be a touchy issue for politicians in  
traditionally Republican upstate New York, where Mrs. Clinton is 
traveling this week. In Elmira on Thursday, she noted that most gun 
owners are responsible people. 
</P>
<P>
	At a campaign event in Bath, Mrs. Clinton said she is ``more and  
more excited about the prospect'' of running for the Senate and is 
``very committed to following through on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She scoffed at an editorial in Friday's Wall Street Journal  
predicting she would skip the race and maybe find a job easier to 
win, such as head of the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton told reporters that the Senate seat ``is the only  
job I'm interested in right now and the only job that I'm 
pursuing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton she wanted ``to spend more time  
listening to the people of New York'' before announcing her 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls have shown Mrs. Clinton's once hefty lead over  
Giuliani vanishing. She now either trails or runs even against him 
in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she felt the mayor was taunting her by traveling to  
Arkansas this week to dramatize the fact that she's never lived or 
worked in New York, Mrs. Clinton said she was ``not going to 
comment on anyone else's campaign tactics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wading into a controversial area for politicians, the first lady  
did say that while sexual abstinence must be stressed in combatting 
teen pregnancies, especially with young teen-agers, ``we should 
also answer children's questions honestly'' about contraception and 
other issues involving sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost tragic that we have to think about this in terms  
of very young teen-agers, but the fact is whether we like it or 
not, we do,'' she said. ``We have very young teen-agers who are 
often taken advantage of by older boys or men, who don't know how 
to protect themselves, who don't know how to fend off those 
advances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady also said she favored legislation that would  
require involuntary commitment for the mentally ill in some cases.

<P>
	DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- Twenty people were injured, some  
critically, after a car slammed into the back of a tour bus and 
caused it to tip over, ejecting several passengers, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened about 10 p.m. Friday on Interstate 355 in  
suburban Chicago, said Master Sgt. Luis Tigera of the Illinois

	The car's driver was among the injured. At least 15 people were  
taken to local hospitals. Six had life-threatening injuries, said 
Sue Sullivan, a nursing supervisor at Good Samaritan Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear where the 20-seat bus was from and where it was  
headed.

<HEADLINE> A's Gets Velarde, Olivares in Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Moving to stay in the playoff chase, the  
Oakland Athletics strengthened their pitching and offense by 
acquiring right-hander Omar Olivares and slugging infielder Randy 
Velarde from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the Angels received three minor leaguers from the  
A's. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly helps us out in the rotation, and the  
organization has always been a big fan of Velarde. It gives us 
another right-handed bat, and we just think he's a fit,'' A's 
general manager Billy Beane said. ``Olivares has arguably been one 
of the top 10-12 guys in the league in terms of ERA and he's a 
solid major league starter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Velarde was hitting a team-high .306 for the Angels and was tied  
for the team lead with 115 hits. He also has nine homers and 48 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivares, one of the Angels' most reliable starters, was 8-9  
with a 4.05 ERA in 20 starts. He led the team in wins and was tied 
for second in the league with three complete games. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were expected to join Oakland by tonight.  
</P>
<P>
	Both will be free agents after the end of this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate everything Randy and Omar have done for the  
Angels,'' Angels general manager Bill Bavasi said. ``Randy has 
worked extremely hard to get his game back to the level he demands 
of himself, and his numbers this season reflect that. Omar did some 
great things for us last season in a variety of roles, and this 
season has been one of our most consistent starters. However, at 
this point in time we need to make some moves for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beane said the deal for two veterans sends a message that the  
second-place A's were not conceding anything last weekend when they 
dealt away pitching ace Kenny Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, who went to the Mets for a pair of minor leaguers, will  
be a free agent at the end of the season and had said he wouldn't 
return to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Beane said Rogers was traded while Oakland could still get  
something for him, and that anyone who thought it signaled the 
start of the dismantling of the A's had misread the club's 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't throwing in the towel when we traded Rogers,''  
Beane said. ``We did have a plan. We had an idea of what we wanted 
to do. The club has played well. Hopefully, this will give us a 
little shot of adrenaline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The A's must make roster space for the additions and drop one of  
the current pitchers from the rotation, but Beane declined to 
discuss the affected players because they hadn't been notified yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Beane did suggest the club could make another deal before  
Saturday's trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've still got some ideas, some things we're still talking  
about,'' Beane said. ``We're still running through some things 
internally. We're trying to improve our club for the short term and 
the long term, if possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels acquired right-hander Elvin Nina and outfielders Jeff  
DaVanon and Nathan Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
	DaVanon and Nina were playing for the A's Double-A affiliate at  
Midland. 
</P>
<P>
	DaVanon was hitting .341 with 11 homers and 59 RBIs, while Nina  
was 3-2 with a 4.80 ERA in seven games, including four starts at 
Midland. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes was batting .313 with 12 stolen bases in 35 games at  
Single-A Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Jeff and Nathan, we feel we have added some much needed  
speed to our system. Both have had success in that area in a 
relatively short time. Elvin is a young man with a live arm and a 
good mix of pitches,'' Bavasi said.

<HEADLINE> China Sect Claims Sites Under Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Web sites in the United States and elsewhere  
devoted to the Falun Gong meditation group are coming under heavy 
electronic attack, managers of the sites said Friday, and at least 
one ``hacking'' attempt appears to trace back to a Chinese national 
police bureau in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong has been banned in China, where communist authorities  
are engaged in an escalating crackdown, arresting adherents and 
confiscating publications and videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob McWee, of Middletown, Md., a Falun Gong practitioner, said a  
site he maintains to promote the group, www.falunusa.net, has been 
under persistent electronic assault. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, McWee said his Web server was  
undergoing a continuous ``denial-of-service'' attack, a common 
Internet tactic used to overwhelm a computer with repeated 
electronic requests -- like a telephone ringing nonstop to block 
other callers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, someone tried to gain access to the server,  
pretending to be a legitimate webmaster, and in the process left an 
Internet address, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to hack my machine from theirs. And they can't do  
that without revealing their'' Internet address, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The address McWee said was left behind is registered with the  
Asia Pacific Network Information Centre, a public registry service 
for Internet addressees. According to the service, there are two 
phone numbers in Beijing listed with that address. 
</P>
<P>
	When The Associated Press called the numbers, a person who  
answered the phone identified them as belonging to the Public 
Security Ministry. A telephone operator at the ministry said they 
belonged to its Internet Monitoring Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry officials and spokesmen refused to comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	McWee registered a complaint about the hacking attempt with the  
Maryland state police's computer crimes division. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Pete Piringer said that because the attack did  
not succeed in getting access to McWee's server, there did not seem 
to be a crime committed. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. government agency saw an indirect sign of the attacks.  
</P>
<P>
	A network engineer at the U.S. Department of Transportation  
contacted McWee when they noticed his server was contacting one of 
their computers unasked, according to Everett Dowd, deputy director 
of telecommunications of the Information Technology Operation at 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
	McWee said this was because the denial-of-service attack sent  
requests to his server with forged return addresses, one of which 
happened to be the department's server. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators of other Web sites devoted to the movement also  
said they had been attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Li Shao, in Nottingham, Britain, said the site he maintains was  
hacked into Monday. What he called Chinese ``government 
propaganda'' was placed on some pages, while others were deleted. 
</P>
<P>
	Jillian Ye, of Toronto, Canada, who maintains two sites, said  
that beginning one or two months ago, her server began going down 
almost every day. The problems got progressively worse, until she 
recognized the symptoms of an attack and moved the sites to a more 
secure server. 
</P>
<P>
	In their barrage of criticism of Falun Gong, Chinese state media  
have cited the group's Internet presence as proof that it was 
well-organized and not just harmless meditation buffs. 
</P>
<P>
	A government ban on Falun Gong publications passed after the  
group was outlawed includes electronic publications. Nearly all of 
Falun Gong Web sites in China have been shut down since the ban was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	China's communist leaders banned the Falun Gong movement last  
week, accusing it of trying to develop political power. Falun Gong 
leaders have denied any political ambitions and denied they 
organized protests that erupted two weeks ago after authorities 
reportedly arrested leading members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong, founded by Li Hongzhi, who now lives in the United  
States, draws on martial arts, Buddhism and Taoism. The group says 
its goals are physical and mental fitness and high moral standards, 
and denies that it is either a religion or a political movement.

<HEADLINE> Fees To Subsidize School Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A federal program that adds fees to telephone  
bills to subsidize cheaper Internet hookups for schools and 
libraries was largely upheld by a federal appeals court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Susan Ness of the Federal Communications Commission  
called the ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ``a huge 
win for America's children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Vice President Al Gore, whose support led opponents of the  
program to dub it ``the Gore tax,'' also applauded the decision as 
``a victory for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling was not a total victory  
for the FCC, which implements the program and defended it in court 
arguments here in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the FCC can only assess the fees on interstate  
telecommunications services, not in-state services. That means the 
FCC will have to rethink its formula for collecting money to 
support the Internet program. 
</P>
<P>
	But other key elements of the program, including provisions for  
funding the wiring of schools and allowing Internet service 
providers to benefit from the subsidies, were upheld. 
</P>
<P>
	Several telecommunications companies and utility regulating  
agencies had challenged various aspects of the ``universal 
service'' Internet program. For example, the telephone companies 
complained that the program allows Internet providers such as 
America Online, which does not have its own telephone circuits, to 
benefit disproportionately. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the FCC approved a $2.25 billion allocation for the  
program, but members disagreed over how much it will cost 
consumers. Some said it could add more than $20 to phone bills, 
while others said it would work out to roughly $4.

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Emil Andres, who drove in nine Indianapolis  
500 races in the 1930s and '40s, died July 20. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Andres began his racing career at Evanston (Ill.) Motor  
Speedway. He drove stock cars in 1932 and sprint cars in 1933 and 
made his debut at Indianapolis in 1936 with an 18th-place finish. 
He missed the 1937 race but was 29th, 30th, 12th and 30th in the 
four races before the Speedway was shut down for World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to racing in 1946, when he recorded his best finish  
at Indianapolis, fourth. He drove in three more races at Indy, then 
retired after his final race at Milwaukee in 1950.

<P>
	The Carter Sisters joined the Grand Ole Opry radio show in 1950,  
opened shows for Elvis Presley and joined the Johnny Cash show in

	HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) -- Raymond C. Kennedy, the former publisher of  
the Hudson Register-Star and a local business and civic leader, 
died Thursday. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, Kennedy returned from military service and became  
publisher of the Register-Star, which his family owned and 
operated. 
</P>
<P>
	He held that position until 1985, when he sold the newspaper to  
the Park Newspaper Group. The newspaper is now owned by the Johnson 
Newspaper Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy purchased the Chatham Courier in nearby Chatham in 1968,  
and served as chairman until he sold it in 1985.

<P>
	In 1969 and 1970, Kennedy served as the youngest president of  
the New York State Publishers Association. He also served two 
separate terms as president of the New York State Associated 
Dailies, in 1973 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	For many years, he served on the Government Relations Committee  
of the American Newspaper Publishers Association.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Malachi Brendan Martin, a former priest and  
close associate of Pope John XXIII who went on to write thrillers 
about the Roman Catholic Church, died Tuesday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was a Jesuit priest during the era of the Second Vatican  
Council in the early 1960s, when the Church adopted liberal 
policies aimed at broadening its appeal. Disillusioned by the 
reforms made by the Jesuits, the Irish-born Martin requested a 
release from his vows, and moved to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice a Guggenheim Fellow, Martin's books ranged from a seminal  
work on the Dead Sea Scrolls to the best selling ``Hostage to the 
Devil,'' published in 1976, and billed as a real-life account of 
the possession and exorcism of five Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The Encounter,'' his 1970 study of Judaism, Christianity  
and Islam, Martin said history showed Christians were willing to 
act in un-Christian ways in order to further Christianity, leading 
to a result he termed catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
	His other books included 1978's ``The Final Conclave,'' and  
``The Pilgrim,'' published in 1964 under the pseudonym Michael 
Serafian.

president, died today after a 2 1/2-year battle with colon cancer, 
officials said. She was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Ling ``passed away peacefully'' at the city-state's National  
University Hospital, the office of President Ong Teng Cheong said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ong, who himself was diagnosed with cancer, earlier this month  
said he would not run for a second six-year term in upcoming 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, married in 1963, were both trained as architects and  
have two sons and a grandson, said a spokesman for the Ministry of 
Information and the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ong, 63, has been through two rounds of chemotherapy for  
lymphoma during his term. He has said his wife's illness was one of 
the reasons behind his decision not to seek re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's president has limited powers over civil service  
appointments, government and statutory board budgets, and internal 
security.

Tuesday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Oil of Olay beauty cream, Clearasil acne medicine  
and Vicks and Nyquil cold remedies grew under his leadership from a 
company that had $75 million in revenue in 1957 to one with $1.2

Richardson Foundation, created by his father. He also served as 
chairman of the Greensboro-based Center for Creative Leadership 
from 1972 to 1994. The nonprofit center trains business and 
government leaders from around the world.

<HEADLINE> Saints' Roaf Still Unsatisfied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- William Roaf comes from a family that  
treats overachieving as ordinary. There's a lot to live up to when 
your father is a dentist and your mother is a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	That expectation of greatness is part of the reason Roaf isn't  
satisfied even after five straight trips to the NFL Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Orleans Saints' 37-59 record since the big Louisiana  
Tech tackle was a No. 1 draft pick in 1993 is another reason for 
Roaf's dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought we'd go this long without winning,'' Roaf said  
after wrapping up a second straight 6-10 season. ``It's really 
frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his NFL career, Roaf has had a string of personal  
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1993 and 1996, Roaf had a string of 57 straight starts.  
He has started five straight Pro Bowls, the only player in Saints 
history with such a run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I can go another four or five years and go to the  
Hall of Fame,'' Roaf said. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd rather trade the Pro Bowl for a Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants that,'' he said. ``Everyone thinks they'll  
make it before they quit. I feel that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roaf, the nearest thing the Saints have had to a star the past  
few years, once again believes New Orleans is on the way up -- in 
part because of their newest celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to have a very good year,'' he said. ``I  
think the addition of Ricky Williams is going to be positive. 
Offensively, we'll hold our own and the defense was already playing 
real good football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roaf describes his job as simple.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guard the blind side of the quarterback and make sure he  
doesn't get tackled, and I open up holes for the running back,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds simple, but it has proven difficult over the past few  
years when the Saints running game has ranked dead last in the 
league and the offense as a whole wasn't far from that, 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the Saints have beefed up Roaf's side of the line  
with Wally Williams, a seven-year pro who was the Baltimore Ravens' 
franchise player prior to the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that combination is going to be as tough as it gets,''  
offensive coordinator Danny Abramowicz said. ``I've heard the talk 
that Willie has slumped some lately, but don't believe it. I think 
he's still the best in the league in that spot. Now with Wally in 
there, they should be the dynamic duo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Williams, the Heisman Trophy running back who  
set 20 records while at Texas, has coach Mike Ditka even more 
dedicated to the running game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky's a great football player,'' Ditka said. ``We've got  
other great backs who can run, but there's nobody in the world that 
you run in the National Football League without help. We've got to 
get him all the help we can. So I would say the ball is in their 
court. The offensive line will shoulder the responsibility of being 
the backbone of our offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roaf is accustomed to responsibility. His parents saw to that a  
long time ago. As a youngster, he worked as a page for then-Gov. 
Bill Clinton in the Arkansas Capitol in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in seventh grade, and I was a good student,'' Roaf said.  
``My parents knew President Clinton, who was governor then, and 
they were asking for kids from around the state. We mostly ran 
errands and brought messages to the Capitol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although his mother wasn't completely sold on his being a  
professional football player when he graduated from college, she's 
come around. 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents just always wanted us to do the best we could at  
whatever we did,'' Roaf said. ``They drilled that into us and 
that's what I try to do.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Mulls More Olympic Hearings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The IOC's top congressional critic is  
considering a second set of hearings into Olympic reforms in the 
wake of the Salt Lake bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Friday that Sen. John McCain could schedule a  
followup to an April session of the Senate Commerce Committee, 
during which he and other lawmakers criticized the International 
Olympic Committee for creating a ``culture of corruption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator McCain is thinking about scheduling another hearing,''  
Commerce Committee spokeswoman Pia Pialorsi said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the Arizona Republican met this week with  
representatives of OATH, an Olympic athletes' group created in 
response to the scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's winning bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is concerned about various aspects of the Olympics raised  
by athletes in this week's meeting,'' Pialorsi said. 
</P>
<P>
	No date for a possible hearing had been set, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that a mid-October date  
had been tentatively set, with items for discussion to include 
congressional review of Olympic reforms, athlete participation in 
the IOC and anti-doping measures in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000, which is directing the panel's internal changes, is  
scheduled to hold its final meeting Oct. 29-30 and make proposals 
for a special IOC general assembly in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hybl, the U.S. Olympic Committee president and an IOC 2000  
member, said the USOC would cooperate with any Senate hearings ``in 
a positive and affirmative way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's committee has pending legislation that would strip the  
IOC's tax-exempt status in the United States, limit the tax 
deductions of IOC sponsorships and -- most forcefully -- direct all 
U.S. TV rights fees to the USOC rather than the IOC, depriving the 
international panel of its single biggest revenue source. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing last spring, the Arizona Republican said IOC  
leaders, including president Juan Antonio Samaranch, had allowed a 
corrupt system to flourish and must become more accountable to 
fans, athletes and sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that the IOC should adopt the recommendations of a  
USOC-sponsored probe headed by George Mitchell, but agreed with the 
former Senate majority leader to wait until the international panel 
concluded internal reform plans, scheduled for the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview last month, McCain said he would stick with  
Mitchell's request, even though he remained concerned about the 
IOC's actions and criticized Samaranch for failing to communicate 
with his committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, other critics of the IOC have issued  
increasingly positive reviews of the reform plans. Mitchell said in 
June that it appeared the committee was making progress, and 
earlier this month the vice chairman of his inquiry panel, former 
White House Chief of Staff Ken Duberstein, said the IOC ``seemed 
committed to the process of reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000, meanwhile, has said it would recommend adoption of all  
of the Mitchell commission's proposed changes, including term 
limits for members, membership for athletes and open financial 
records.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Cuts TE Gedney After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals have cut tight end  
Chris Gedney, who underwent surgery to remove his colon July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Gedney said he was shocked by the team's move because he was  
counting on the team's support as he underwent further surgery and 
mounted a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk about family and loyalty and it just came out of the  
blue,'' Gedney said Friday in a telephone interview from his home 
in Phoenix. ``You just feel abandoned without any rhyme nor reason 
to it because it's not a cap issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals general manager Bob Ferguson said Gedney, the leading  
pass catcher among Cardinals tight ends the last two seasons, was 
waived because he failed his physical. Initially, the Cardinals 
declined to further explain their decision. 
</P>
<P>
	But later in the day, Ferguson said the move was made based on  
the organization's failure to be convinced that Gedney is likely to 
play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a major surgery and he's going to have another one,''  
Ferguson said. ``To say what he's going to be doing next year is a 
little tough for us, so this is the way we decided to go. ... I 
don't believe that in his best interest he should play football 
anymore. This is a major, major thing, and we can't predict what's 
going to happen to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gedney said he was told of the decision in a three-minute  
telephone conversation with Ferguson after the physical was 
conducted at Cardinals headquarters in Tempe on Thursday. Ferguson 
didn't explain why the decision was made, Gedney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, by the time it sunk in, I was off the phone with him  
and just kind of sat in the kitchen bewildered,'' Gedney said. 
</P>
<P>
	By cutting Gedney, the Cardinals get another $600,000 to use  
under the salary cap, money sorely needed as the team attempts to 
sign its two first-round draft picks and resolve contract 
differences with wide receiver Rob Moore and defensive tackle Mark 
Smith. But Ferguson said money was not a factor in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals could have placed the tight end on the  
non-football illness or injury list and wouldn't have had to pay 
him anything, but he still would have been a member of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Gedney said his doctors remain confident that he will be able to  
play in the NFL again. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to my doctors, who rank as the world's best, the  
likelihood of me playing the game again is extremely high,'' Gedney 
said. ``Has anybody ever done it? No. But nobody has ever had 
testicular cancer and won the Tour de France until now either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Jake Plummer said the players are disappointed that  
Gedney had to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you think as a football player what would happen if  
anything happened to you?'' Plummer said. ``He's a great football 
player and a great example for a Cardinal, to represent this 
organization.''

<HEADLINE> Is Lions' Rivers the Next Sanders? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- Ron Rivers was feeling the heat  
Friday, and not just the steamy kind that greeted the Detroit Lions 
on the first day of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	With Barry Sanders' retirement announcement, Rivers comes to  
camp as one of the Lions' hopes for a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders shocked the football world Wednesday by announcing he  
was getting out after 10 years, even though he is only 1,458 yards 
shy of breaking Walter Payton's NFL career rushing record of 16,726 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans are clinging to the notion that Sanders will change his  
mind and return. Rivers doesn't have that luxury. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does, that's fine and dandy,'' said Rivers, who admitted  
he had trouble sleeping the night before. ``I have to take care of 
myself. If he doesn't come back, then what? See, I have to get 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has a long way to go.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite being Fresno State's career rushing leader with 3,743  
yards, and despite setting the Bulldogs' season rushing record with 
1,542 yards in 1993, Rivers has been largely ignored by the NFL. 
Even with those kinds of numbers, nobody drafted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers signed as a free agent with the Lions in 1994, but spent  
most of that season on their practice squad. He was activated for 
only one game, but didn't touch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Life's like that when you're the backup to Barry Sanders.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the next four seasons, Rivers never carried the ball more  
than 29 times. His career NFL numbers show him with 85 carries for 
427 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder he's not sleeping well.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I think he's fine,'' Lions coach Bobby Ross said. ``Like  
anything, I think it's just the anticipation of starting camp. But 
I can see how Ron would be a little more excited. The spotlight's 
on him a little more than he's used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the first workout, the Lions also took a look at rookie  
Sedrick Irvan, a fourth-round draft pick out of Michigan State who 
rushed for over 1,000 yards each of his last three seasons in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all in this together,'' Rivers said. ``I'll help Sedrick  
any way I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Schmidt, the Lions general manager, said the club  
continues to look for veteran tailback help elsewhere -- either by 
trade or by picking up a free agent. Schmidt said, however, he 
didn't expect to sign anyone soon. 
</P>
<P>
	That left players to try to put the best face possible on a  
difficult situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron Rivers is definitely more energetic,'' quarterback Charlie  
Batch said. ``He knows he's the No. 1 guy. We have a lot of 
confidence in him, and I know he'll get the job done.''

<HEADLINE> NTSB: JFK Jr. Plane Functioned OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane apparently was  
functioning properly when it slammed into the ocean, but the 
weather may have been worse than a forecast Kennedy had received, 
the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board, in its first update in  
a week on its investigation of the July 16 crash that killed 
Kennedy, his wife and her sister, said about 75 percent of the 
wreckage has been recovered from the waters off Martha's Vineyard, 
Mass. The wreckage shows no sign of in-flight breakup or fire, and 
the engine appeared to have been working fine at the time of the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also said Kennedy received a weather forecast via  
the Internet for his flight from Fairfield, N.J., to the Vineyard. 
The report, issued at 6:30 p.m., or about two hours before takeoff, 
was for good visual-flight-rule conditions, with visibility of six 
to eight miles. 
</P>
<P>
	No weather warnings were issued to pilots flying Kennedy's  
route, which took him over the Long Island Sound along the southern 
coast of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, pilots who had flown over Long Island Sound that  
evening reported after the accident that the in-flight visibility 
over the water was significantly reduced,'' the safety board's 
statement said. ``Interviews of those pilots will continue.'' 
Witnesses reported a haze in the darkening summer sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her  
34-year-old sister Lauren Bessette, were flying Kennedy's 
single-engine Piper Saratoga when it crashed about 7 1/2 miles 
southwest of the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple had intended to drop off Miss Bessette on the island  
before flying to Cape Cod to attend for the wedding of Kennedy's 
cousin Rory, youngest child of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, at 
Hyannis Port, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	After a five-day search, the bodies of the three victims were  
recovered from 116 feet of water, still strapped into their seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board, which is investigating the accident, said the  
Navy salvage ship USS Grasp raised about 75 percent of the plane. 
Among items taken from the water was a primitive recording device, 
which was destroyed by the impact with the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage was handed over to investigators and subsequently  
taken to a secure hangar at the Coast Guard Air Station on Cape 
Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage included about 80 percent of the left wing, 60  
percent of the right wing, the engine and the propeller, as well as 
the cockpit instrument panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The propeller ``indicated the presence of rotational damage,''  
which would indicate it was still spinning when the plane crashed. 
Radar tapes show the plane was traveling about 185 mph before it 
began its plunge about 9:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The engine was sent to Williamsport, Pa., for examination by its  
manufacturer, Textron Lycoming. The propeller was transferred to a 
facility near Dayton, Ohio, for examination by Hartzell Propeller. 
Both inspections were conducted under supervision of the safety 
board, as is standard practice, and the parts have since been 
returned to Cape Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	``No evidence was found during the examinations of conditions  
that would have prevented either the engine or the propeller from 
operating,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said the aircraft's Global Positioning System unit and  
selected cockpit instruments will be sent for examination to its 
laboratory in Washington. The radios, meanwhile, have been carried 
to their manufacturer, Allied Signal, in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said investigators have learned that Kennedy had  
about 300 hours of flying experience, not including his time in the 
Saratoga, which he bought in April. Kennedy received his pilot's 
license in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB has said it hopes to complete its investigation in six  
to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Adm. James  
M. Loy, the Coast Guard commandant, paid tribute to those who 
``stretched themselves to their limits'' in the search for the 
Kennedy plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from more than a dozen federal, state and local  
police and rescue agencies accepted commendations for their efforts 
in a ceremony at a Coast Guard command center in Boston.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Nazi Warning Letters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from correspondence by U.S. officials, German citizens  
and an unknown informant on Nazi Germany's ``euthanasia'' programs 
-- written months before the systematic killing of mentally ill and 
deformed citizens became widely known: 
</P>
<P>
	--''After weeks of uncertainty, I received the unbelievable news  
of his sudden death and cremation.'' Death notice in a German 
newspaper by the family of an asylum patient. A rash of family 
notices about ``unbelievable'' asylum deaths raised suspicion among 
German citizens and U.S. diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
	--''The dark and deep secrecy surrounding the Castle of  
Grafeneck, entrance to which is strictly forbidden to all except 
the Black Guard man on duty, gradually led the local inhabitants to 
become uneasy and suspicious.'' Cable from the U.S. vice consul in 
Leipzig, Paul Dutko, to the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, concerning the 
Grafeneck mental asylum. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Inspired by LeMond's Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After watching Greg LeMond's triumphant ride on  
the Champs-Elysees in 1989, Lance Armstrong knew the Tour de France 
was in his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole country watched and that did wonders for  
cycling in America,'' said Armstrong, who has overcome testicular 
cancer to win cycling's premier race. ``That was the first time I 
thought and dreamed about the Tour de France.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, appearing on ``Late Night with David Letterman'' on  
Friday, has been on a whirlwind schedule of appearances in New 
York, making the rounds of television talk shows and a tour of the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	LeMond nearly died after being shot in a hunting accident in  
1987. Despite being written off by the cycling world, LeMond won 
his second and third Tour titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, the 1993 world road race champion and winner of two  
stages of the Tour de France (1993 and 1995), learned in October 
1996 that he had testicular cancer. Doctors gave him a 50-50 chance 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that's pretty bad, but at least it's not 2-98,'' he  
said. ``So many people are told they have no chance at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in the hospital, Armstrong was dropped by the French team  
Cofidis. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said it was not possible for Lance Armstrong to return,''  
he told Letterman. ``He'll never race again. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I decided to come back and I was looking for a team, all  
of the European teams said it's not possible, he'll never race 
again and never be the champion he was before. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I do come back and return to the highest level and I'm  
leading the Tour de France and trying to win the Tour de France, 
what do the Europeans say? They say it's not possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was dogged by rumors during the three-week race that  
his success was helped by banned substances. The International 
Cycling Union said tests on Armstrong had shown traces of 
corticosteroids, but this was traced to a skin cream he was using 
with a doctor's OK. 
</P>
<P>
	The rumors came from ``a few isolated journalists,'' said  
Armstrong, who joked that he must have had ``performance-enhancing 
chemotherapy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of the 2,000 journalists, there were a handful of people  
who never cover cycling,'' he said. ``All they wanted to do was 
cover a scandal.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 85.17; Nasdaq Down 0.64 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *PM-Wall Street 3pm,0485    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower today, with the Dow Jones  
industrial average languishing behind other market indicators amid 
continuing concerns over rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was down 85.17 at 10,690.61,  
adding to a 180-point plunge Thursday. The blue-chip index fell as 
much as 126 points earlier this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indexes were also lower, although their losses  
were moderate. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 9.01 at 
1,332.02. The Nasdaq composite index was down 0.64 at 2,639.37, 
wavering between positive and negative territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares tumbled broadly Thursday after the Labor Department said  
its Employment Cost Index rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter, a 
bigger-than-expected jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say the data, closely monitored by Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan, could encourage the Fed to raise interest 
rates when its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets on 
Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed raised interest rates in June and has signaled its  
willingness to do so again in an effort to contain inflation. In 
the meantime, Wall Street players are carefully watching all fresh 
economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	The selling continued today after Commerce Department reported  
that Americans' personal income surged in June and outpaced 
spending, but the nation's savings rate remains near a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report today, the Commerce Department said sales  
of new single-family homes rebounded in June, rising 3.1 percent to 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 929,000 units, better than 
forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the National Association of Purchasing Management's  
Chicago branch reported that manufacturing activity in that region 
of the country area accelerated at a faster-than-expected pace in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond markets, already retreating before the figures came out,  
fell further on the news. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 
6.11 percent from 6.07 percent late Thursday. It was the second 
straight day that yields have risen sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks continued to slide today under the threat of  
higher rates. Dow components American Express fell 5 13/16 to 132 3/4 
and J.P. Morgan dropped 2 7/16 to 128 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bond investors are already jittery and when you give them an  
excuse to sell, they sell,'' said Anthony O'Bryan, a market analyst 
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``And when bonds are down, 
that throws a wet blanket on the financial sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 551.90 million 
shares at late afternoon, down from 620.76 million shares at the 
same time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.95 at 627.86, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.89 at 785.48. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.75 to 442.33.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stock, Futures To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's stock exchange and futures exchange  
have agreed to a merger plan, a cornerstone of the government's 
market reform program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong will hold 70 percent of the  
merged entity, while the Hong Kong Futures Exchange will own 30 
percent, acting Financial Secretary Rafael Hui said. 
</P>
<P>
	A feud over how much each exchange would own had threatened the  
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders will vote on the deal in September, while  
legislation will be taken up in the legislature by year's end, 
paving the way for completion of the merger in early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hui said he expected shareholders to pass the plan, but the  
government would pursue merger and reform through ``other means'' 
if they voted it down. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Asian financial crisis dealt a severe blow to Hong  
Kong's financial markets and exposed some of their noncompetitive 
problems last year, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang announced in 
March that the two exchanges and several associated entities would 
merge to create a more open market.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. McCain Prefers Traditional Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AIKEN, S.C. (AP) -- Cindy McCain told a crowd of veterans Friday  
that if her husband, John, is elected president, ``We won't ever do 
anything to embarrass the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McCain stood in for her husband at the start of a South  
Carolina campaign swing. McCain, an Arizona Republican, was held up 
in Washington for the Senate's vote on a $792 billion GOP tax cut 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-year-old former schoolteacher and mother of four talked  
about her husband's military service and how she would want him in 
charge if her children serve in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a full-time mother,'' she said, adding that her top goal  
is to ``raise decent children'' who, she hopes, will serve in the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand what it means to serve,'' she said. ``And we  
won't ever do anything to embarrass the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't talk about campaign issues, leaving that to the  
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always taken a more traditional role in the campaign,''  
she said in an interview with The Associated Press. But she's not 
critical of political spouses who take a more active role in policy 
like Hillary Rodham Clinton. ``That's their choice,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McCain serves on the board of her family business, a beer  
wholesale operation, but doesn't work there on a daily basis. Her 
first priority has been raising her children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made the choice to stay at home,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	If McCain wins the White House, she said that as first lady she  
would focus on issues like child health care, adoption and 
encouraging youth volunteerism. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McCain lives with her children in Arizona and the senator  
commutes there on the weekend. She said that was a ``quality of 
life'' decision made for her children. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she has been touched by the public's strong reaction to  
McCain when they hear about his military record and 5 1/2 years in a 
North Vietnamese prison. 
</P>
<P>
	She attributes his personal strength to a strong and dynamic  
mother who raised him while his father was serving in the Navy.

<HEADLINE> Middlesex Drive Wins at Saratoga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Middlesex Drive led throughout  
Friday to score a neck victory in Saratoga's feature, the 41st 
running of the $150,000 Grade II Bernard Baruch Handicap for horses 
3-years-old and older. 
</P>
<P>
	Tangazi was second in the field of nine, a half-length before  
Comic Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather then chance being caught in traffic, Shane Sellers sent  
Middlesex Drive to the lead early and, despite being hard pressed 
throughout, the 4-year-old colt by Pine Bluff-York Woods stuck it 
out for the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Middlesex Drive carried 117 and Shane Sellers 1 1/8 miles in 1:46.2  
on the firm Mellon Turf Course to earn $90,000 for C. Steven 
Duncker with his second win in five starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner returned $5.70, $3.30 and $2.40. Tangazi paid $4.30  
and $2.80, and Comic Strip was $2.70.

<HEADLINE> Tour de France Drug Tests Negative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- All the cyclists in the Tour de  
France passed their drug tests, world cycling's governing body said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Cycling Union said it tested riders during  
every stage of the three-week race and there were no positive 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	The showcase event was won by Lance Armstrong, whose remarkable  
comeback from cancer was dogged by suggestions in the French media 
he was aided by banned drugs. He was found to have taken an 
approved prescription skin cream for saddle sores. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, appearing on ``Late Night with David Letterman'' in  
New York on Friday, said the accusations came from ``a few isolated 
journalists.'' He joked that he must have had 
``performance-enhancing chemotherapy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of the 2,000 journalists, there were a handful of people  
who never cover cycling,'' he said. ``All they wanted to do was 
cover a scandal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 Tour de France was rocked by a drug scandal that nearly  
forced the race to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The cycling union also did blood tests on all the riders on the  
first day of racing and tested individual teams on other days to 
measure the level of red blood cells, or hematocrit. 
</P>
<P>
	High levels might indicate that riders have taken the banned  
hormone EPO. There is no test for EPO but riders with a hematocrit 
level above 50 percent must rest two weeks because the level is 
considered dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the tests were within the levels fixed by UCI, and we are  
pleased to note that the levels tended to fall during the course of 
the race. This is totally natural,'' the organization said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cycling body also took breath samples from all riders to  
test for PFC, hemoglobin that speeds oxygen intake. The results are 
not yet available.

<HEADLINE> Indians Sign Catcher Levis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Catcher Jesse Levis, who asked Tampa Bay to  
release him earlier this week, signed a contract Friday for the 
remainder of this season with the Cleveland Indians, who traded him 
away in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Levis, the Indians designated catcher Pat  
Borders for assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Levis spent the first seven years of his career in the Indians'  
organization before being traded before the 1996 season. This 
season he spent time in Triple-A Durham and Double-A Orlando in the 
Devil Rays' minor league system. When he became a free agent on 
July 15, Levis' contract allowed him to ask Tampa Bay to let him 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland was where he wanted to be.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know all the coaches,'' Levis said. ``They know me. They  
know my ability and there's a comfort level there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levis spent last season with the Milwaukee Brewers, but was  
limited to just 22 games after undergoing shoulder surgery to 
repair a rotator cuff. He batted .351 in 22 games -- 13 at catcher -- 
and had four RBIs for the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians manager Mike Hargrove said Levis gives his team a  
``different look'' behind the plate while Cleveland awaits catcher 
Sandy Alomar's return from the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar has been out since May 17 after undergoing surgery on his  
left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Borders was signed to a minor league contract before the season  
and was recently called up by the Indians after beginning the year 
at Triple-A Buffalo. The 36-year-old hit .300 with three RBIs in 
six games.

<HEADLINE> No Charges in Death of Wrestler Hart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Criminal charges will not be filed in  
the death of professional wrestler Owen Hart, who fell to his death 
during an aerial accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson County prosecutor Robert Beaird said Friday there is no  
basis for an involuntary manslaughter charge against the rigging 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a charge requires that there be a substantial and  
unjustifiable risk of death, that the risk was disregarded and that 
the disregard was a gross deviation from what a reasonable person 
would do under the circumstances,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, known as The Blue Blazer, fell from a cable May 23 while  
being lowered into the ring at a World Wrestling Federation event 
at Kemper Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old wrestler fell 78 feet when his harness release  
opened early. The impact ruptured Hart's aorta, and he bled to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's widow and children filed a wrongful death lawsuit in June  
against the WWF, the city and 11 others. The lawsuit contends the 
device that the 230-pound Hart wore the night of the accident was 
grossly inadequate.

<HEADLINE> Asset Allocation Still Crucial / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market has hit record highs, inflation  
remains under control and interest rates are low, so who needs to 
bother with asset allocation? 
</P>
<P>
	After all, a number of investors had managed to amass nice  
little nest eggs over the past year or so by putting everything in 
just a few baskets, like blue-chips and technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	While that may be true for some, investment advisers stress that  
asset allocation -- the process of developing a diversified 
portfolio by mixing different assets in varying proportions, or 
putting your eggs in different baskets -- shouldn't be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, more and more advisers have been pointing out the  
importance of asset allocation these days, even as times remain 
good for the economy. That's especially true now as the stock 
market undergoes some volatility, particularly in the technology 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are investing long-term for college expenses or  
retirement, the single most important thing you can do is to make 
sure you understand basic asset allocation,'' money manager Jim 
Jorgensen of Orinda, Calif., noted in his July investor newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over time stock or mutual fund selection is much less  
important than proper asset allocation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Elkin, a money manager and accountant from  
Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., agreed, citing a recent study lead by 
Roger Ibbotson, a Yale University professor and chairman of 
Ibbotson Associates, which provides data on historic market 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at 10 years of monthly returns for 94 balanced  
mutual funds (funds which have both stocks and bonds), and 10 years 
of quarterly returns for 58 pension funds. The result: Asset 
allocation -- rather than individual stock and bond selection -- 
accounted for about 90 percent of the period-to-period variability 
of a portfolio. And that, of course, means earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asset allocation is still the unquestioned driver of portfolio  
performance (and) ... is the only reason the average investor makes 
any money investing,'' Elkin wrote in his July newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	But tell that to the average investor who has seen many Internet  
stocks soar through the stratosphere over the past year and the Dow 
Jones industrial average, which is comprised of large ``blue-chip'' 
companies, march through record territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you proposed multiple asset classes (to clients), you felt  
pretty beat up,'' said Eleanor Blayney, a partner in Sullivan, 
Bruyette, Speros &AMP; Blayney, a McLean, Va., portfolio management 
firm. ``The only thing that worked in 1998 was a rifle -- if you 
just aimed at the biggest stock or the most glamorous stock, you 
did the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The basic allocation plan used by Wall Street brokers is known  
as the ``robot approach,'' which consists of placing 55 percent of 
assets in stocks, 35 percent in bonds and 10 percent in 
cash-equivalent savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciding just how much to allocate into stocks, bonds, cash, or  
other assets, though, usually depends on numerous factors -- like 
one's risk exposure, time horizon, cash-flow needs and tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	Often times, asset allocation plans change with age.  
</P>
<P>
	Jorgensen suggests those ages 20 to 40 should have long-term  
growth as their investment goal and put at least 85 percent of 
their money in stocks or stock funds, with the rest in bonds and 
cash. Those ages 40 to 50 should have at least 75 percent in 
stocks, 50 to 65, 60 percent in stocks, and 65 and older ``keep 
what you need in bond or income funds to provide monthly income 
(and) ... what's left over ... should continue to be invested in 
the stock market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blayney focused on the importance of asset allocation for  
retirees during the July annual convention of the Institute of 
Certified Financial Planners in Dallas. She said they often insist 
on sticking with lower-risk assets, such as bonds or money-market 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be a very exasperating time,'' she said. ``They all  
say, 'Do not spend the principal.' What they may mean is: Don't 
drop below the balance I brought in ... don't spend the gains from 
appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
	``(But) some retirees outlive their money in retirement. You  
have to reach for higher returns. A retiree may need more equities 
than we may have thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blayney thinks stocks should make up between 50 percent and 75  
percent of an average retiree's investment portfolio, an amount 
some money managers may dispute as too high. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of a person's stage in life, asset allocation should  
be a concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``How you allocate your investments in stocks, bonds and savings  
accounts is more important than what and when you buy or sell along 
the way,'' Jorgensen said. ``The good news is that it's relatively 
easy to allocate your assets. The bad news is that if you don't 
allocate your assets properly as soon as you can, you may cut your 
retirement nest egg significantly.''

<HEADLINE> Suns Sign Top Pick Shawn Marion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns signed first-round draft pick  
Shawn Marion on Friday to a four-year deal worth just under $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The salary was the most allowed for Marion, the No. 9 pick  
overall, under the NBA's collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Marion played forward in his only season at UNLV,  
but the Suns expect him to be a shooting guard, matching his 
athletic skills and speed with point guard Jason Kidd's ability to 
run the court. Marion is not known as a great outside shooter, 
though the Suns believe that can improve over time. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion is playing for the Suns' entry in the Salt Lake City  
Summer League. He scored a team-high 23 points and grabbed 11 
rebounds in the team's loss 89-82 loss to Houston Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion averaged 18.7 points and 9.3 rebounds at UNLV, shooting  
.529 from the field.

<HEADLINE> Community Rallies To Preserve Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARNOLDS PARK, Iowa (AP) -- One by one, the children walked across  
the band shell stage and emptied the contents of their piggy banks. 
</P>
<P>
	They sacrificed their little life savings to preserve the pride  
of Arnolds Park -- an amusement park of the same name that has 
charmed residents and visitors since 1889. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't a dry eye in the house,'' said Stephen Kennedy,  
unofficial chairman of the Save the Park committee. 
</P>
<P>
	People here in northwest Iowa were devastated when they heard  
last month that a developer had plans to buy the park property to 
build condominiums, a hotel and shops. 
</P>
<P>
	``All heck broke loose,'' said Kennedy, curator of the Iowa  
Great Lakes Maritime Museum in Arnolds Park. ``We went right to 
war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The museum's board of directors decided to try to buy the park.  
The developer, Don Dunham of Sioux Falls, S.D., gave them a 
deadline: raise $5.5 million by Aug. 1. If they fail, the current 
owner, Chuck Long of Sergeant Bluff, is to go forward with the deal 
and sell to Dunham. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents have organized bake sales, lemonade stands, a  
cable-access telethon, golf outings and T-shirt sales. And with the 
help of some deep-pocketed donors, they are optimistic they'll 
reach their goal. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Thursday, park backers had raised $4.5 million and were in  
negotiations for $2 million in state tourism money. 
</P>
<P>
	The park opened in 1889 on Lake Okoboji, a summer playground  
near the Minnesota line for the rich and middle-class of Des 
Moines, Sioux Falls and Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	Barely a quarter-mile square, all its attractions can be seen in  
a leisurely two-minute walk. But the cool breeze coming off the 
lake, the tall oak trees providing shade and the 1927 wooden roller 
coaster make Arnolds Park incomparable to the modern variety, its 
fans say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a priceless piece of Americana,'' said Jim  
Futrell, editor of the National Amusement Park Historical 
Association's newsletter. The association lists Arnolds Park as the 
oldest operating amusement park west of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	The country used to be filled with parks in rural resort areas.  
Futrell said only three remain: Arnolds Park, Indiana Beach in 
Monticello, Ind., and Conneaut Lake Park in Conneaut Lake, Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's piggy banks netted $750. Retailers have set  
donation jars next to cash registers, and volunteers sell T-shirts 
at Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	Several businesses have donated a day's earnings to the cause.  
For the last 52 years, the O'Farrell Sisters cafe has never been 
open on a Sunday. Until July 18, when a pancake breakfast raised 
$2,900. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody realized how much the park meant,'' said  
Cheri O'Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
	No one expected the town to raise $5.5 million in a month from  
bake sales and pancake breakfasts. Organizers knew they had to 
target wealthy donors, and they quickly got two anonymous $500,000 
contributions. Several $100,000 donations followed. Of the money 
collected, $2.9 million has come from donations of $5,000 or 
greater. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know some of those people would be thinking, `Why should we  
support this if the local people don't support it?' Well, they 
don't have that excuse,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the developer is a little bewildered that anyone  
would want to buy a park that has lost money for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never occurred to me,'' Dunham said.  
</P>
<P>
	By coincidence, Gov. Tom Vilsack is scheduled to visit this  
Sunday -- the Aug. 1 deadline -- to dedicate a new building at the 
maritime museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``That speaks volumes to me,'' Kennedy said. ``If I was the  
governor, I wouldn't come here the day we're going to lose a 
110-year-old park.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe Indian Pharmaceutical Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs  
is investigating whether an Indian tribe's multimillion-dollar 
pharmaceutical company illegally resold prescription drugs it 
bought at a deep discount from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	George T. Patterson, the executive director of the VA's National  
Acquisition Center, said Friday the Mashantucket Pequot tribe can 
only sell drugs it bought at the discount rate to Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, in fact, they are doing otherwise, they're going to be  
asked to stop,'' Patterson said. ``If they don't stop, then we 
would have to pursue some sort of corrective action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted, however, that there is no proof that tribe is taking  
unfair advantage of its federal discounts. The tribe denies 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may want to go in there and take a look just to assure  
people everything is kosher,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug manufacturers have different price schedules for different  
customers. For example, hospitals typically get a lower price than 
drug store chains. As the biggest buyer of pharmaceuticals in the 
world, the federal government gets the lowest price of all. 
</P>
<P>
	That discount is passed on to tribes, as required by the Indian  
Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pequot Pharmaceutical Network started 10 years ago as a  
small health service for members of the tribe and their employees. 
Today it is a $15 million business that handles 250,000 
prescriptions a year. About 70 percent of the business is in 
mail-order prescriptions shipped from the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal spokesman Arthur Henick said the company has a separate  
inventory for non-Indian patients and pays a higher rate -- similar 
to that paid by HMOs -- for those medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We operate under federal guidelines,'' he said. ``Those  
pharmaceuticals are basically purchased at a competitive rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmaceutical company is a sideline business to the tribe's  
main source of revenue -- the Foxwoods Resort Casino, which 
generates upwards of $1 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about the drug company arose when a Washington, D.C.,  
law firm representing drug makers wrote Patterson last month, 
expressing concern about a proposed contract between the state of 
Connecticut and the tribe to cover 85,000 elderly and disabled 
Medicaid patients.

<HEADLINE> Gerber Drops Bioengineered Suppliers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUMMIT, N.J. (AP) -- Gerber, the nation's largest maker of baby  
food, is dropping suppliers who use genetic engineering in their 
corn and soybean products. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by Gerber parent Novartis AG of Switzerland follows a  
request from the environmental group Greenpeace for information on 
the company's use of bioengineered products. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was evaluating their use before then, said Al  
Piergallini, president and CEO of Novartis' North American consumer 
health division, based in Summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want a mother to buy our product and have no concerns,''  
Piergallini said Friday. ``We've always tried to figure out if 
there were any concerns that troubled those people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis expects that by the end of September it will no longer  
be using corn and soybeans that have been genetically altered to be 
resistant to pests and weedkilling chemicals, said spokeswoman 
Katherine King. 
</P>
<P>
	Such ingredients account for about half of 1 percent of Gerber's  
ingredients, and are used mainly in dry cereal, Ms. King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerber produces 5.5 million jars per day and has annual  
worldwide sales of $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace fears possible health risks associated with  
genetically engineered foods, though Novartis officials said they 
still believe their existing Gerber products are safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis said it was turning to other suppliers anyway, and is  
taking its changes a step further by adding a new promise to try to 
use only organic -- pesticide- and herbicide-free -- ingredients in 
Gerber products. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other baby-food makers, H.J. Heinz Co. of Pittsburgh and  
Poway, Calif.-based Healthy Time Natural Foods, have made similar 
product changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't specifically pressure from any group,'' Heinz  
spokesman Jack Kennedy said. ``It's really a matter of consumer 
preference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz products worldwide are virtually free of altered  
ingredients, with the exception of those sold in the United States, 
which are now being examined to determine which suppliers need to 
be changed, Kennedy said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He could not say when products free of such ingredients would be  
on the shelves, but did not think it would change the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis also does not expect any price change, Ms. King said.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said that, so far, it  
has found no particular health problems with genetically modified 
agricultural products, concluding that they ``are as safe as other 
foods in the grocery store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But European fears of genetic engineering have led to a trade  
dispute over importing of U.S. agricultural products. The British 
Medical Association has expressed concerns about possible ill 
health effects from bioengineered ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace makes no particular claims that genetically modified  
foods are dangerous to humans or the environment, arguing simply 
that the health risks are unknown.

<HEADLINE> Texas Probing Possible Hate Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EMORY, Texas (AP) -- Authorities aren't sure whether the killing  
of H.W. Walker -- a black man allegedly tied to a tree and burned by 
a white teen-ager -- was a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's family believes it was. So does the NAACP, which  
persuaded federal authorities to investigate. But to some of the 
1,000 people living in Emory, a hate-crime designation doesn't make 
any difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see how someone that age could do something like that  
to an older person. I was always brought up to respect my elders,'' 
said Lexia Alexander, the cashier at an Emory drug store. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if this is not a hate crime, killing someone and just  
leaving them there to rot like that is terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker was reported missing in early May and his charred remains  
were discovered June 2. A 16-year-old suspect was arrested the next 
day and remained in custody Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP officials believe the young man had ties to an area hate  
group called the Day Walkers. But authorities also are 
investigating whether Walker was killed for money -- he had cashed a 
Social Security check the day he was last seen -- or as the result 
of a drug deal. Walker's family strongly denies he was a drug user. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford is investigating whether to treat  
the killing as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were contacted by the NAACP, and they gave us information  
that led them to believe this was a hate crime,'' he said. ``We 
think there's enough there to warrant a full investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas County medical examiner's office said today that an  
autopsy on Walker had not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Glenn, head of the Greenville chapter of the National  
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he believes 
more than one person was involved because Walker was a big man and 
the suspect is relatively small. 
</P>
<P>
	``The area law enforcement and many people are hell-bent on not  
calling this a hate crime,'' Glenn said. ``But the fact is, it 
probably was and the police just stopped investigating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents of rural Rains County, about 50 miles east of  
Dallas, would like nothing more than for the attention to end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real sorry this took place in our county,'' said Allen  
Stuart, the local justice of the peace. ``We've never had this kind 
of bad publicity before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But publicity is just what others are seeking. The victim's  
sister, Daisy Walker Robinson, says she and her family have had 
little cooperation from local law enforcement in their attempts to 
get information on what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here today because we need answers and we want  
justice,'' she said at a news conference Thursday. ``No human being 
is supposed to be burned and chained the way he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, a black man was dragged to his death behind a pickup  
truck in Jasper, in eastern Texas. Three white men were charged in 
his slaying. One was convicted of murder earlier this year and 
sentenced to death; the other two are awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Town Gets Dancing Reprieve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND, Va. (AP) -- Terry Boggs knows of no finer way to end the  
work week than to put on cowboy boots and dance to his favorite 
country tunes. Thanks to a court ruling that struck down this 
town's ban on dancing, Boggs and other boot-scooters can now boogie 
the night away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the greatest dancer in the world, but I like to  
unwind,'' Boggs, a 49-year-old trucker, said after dancing one warm 
July night at the Golden Pine Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone in this town of about 1,000 in the southwestern  
Virginia mountains shares Boggs' sentiment. Church and town leaders 
see public dancing as something to be tightly restricted, lest it 
lead to cheatin' hearts and ruined marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancing was effectively banned in Pound for 18 years -- until  
June 29, when a federal judge struck down the dance ordinance as 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Glen Williams ruled that the case amounted  
to an unconstitutional restriction of free expression reminiscent 
of ``Footloose,'' the 1984 movie about teens rebelling against a 
small town's ban on dancing. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the ruling, couples in cowboy hats and boots have turned  
out in droves to kick up their heels at the Golden Pine. 
</P>
<P>
	It was William Elam, owner of the Golden Pine, who took the Town  
Council to court over its dancing strictures. He grew weary of 
explaining to out-of-town patrons why they couldn't get down at his 
night spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would get mad and a lot of them would flat out refuse to  
sit down,'' Elam said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's ordinance banned dancing in any place open to the public  
that did not first obtain a dance hall permit from the Council. 
Supporters of the ordinance said it was a way of cracking down on 
the bad behavior associated with dancing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's bound to be trouble when you mix drinking, country  
music and dancing,'' said Danny Stanley, the only member of the 
five-person Council who would consent to an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Permit seekers had to apply in writing. The law forbade the  
Council from issuing a permit ``to anyone who is not a proper 
person, nor to a person who is not a person of good moral 
character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one was ticketed for dancing -- and no one ever received a  
permit. Until Elam and the Golden Pine came along, nobody had 
sought one, said town attorney Gary Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
	Elam applied about a year ago, but withdrew the application out  
of fear that it would be rejected. More than 200 people had showed 
up at a Council meeting to oppose Elam's application. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Elam hired a lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	``We got the court ruling on Wednesday and we were dancing on  
Friday,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Council is rewriting its ordinance more narrowly to pass  
constitutional muster. Town building inspectors also say the Golden 
Pine does not meet the state's fire code for dance halls and could 
close him down because of it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the other bars in town are watching closely.  
Pound is near a dry Kentucky county, and the nearest dance club is 
20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking a wait-and-see approach right now,'' said Genetta  
Boggs, owner of the Candlelight Restaurant, which serves alcohol. 
``If it turns out that dancing is legal, we'll have to do whatever 
it takes to compete.''

<HEADLINE> Utah Radioactive Waste Removal Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A huge pile of uranium mill tailings near the  
Colorado River in Utah is a ``radioactive time bomb'' that must be 
moved to protect drinking water for Nevada, Arizona and Southern 
California, a water official told lawmakers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal regulators said the 10.5 million tons of radioactive  
and toxic waste near Moab, Utah, don't pose a significant threat to 
the Colorado River drinking water used by about 25 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	The waste pile was left over from more than two decades of  
uranium processing, mostly by the now-bankrupt Atlas Corp., which 
ended in 1984. The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission has 
approved the company's plans to cover the pile with clay and rock, 
and is working on plans to treat contaminated underground water 
that flows from the waste 750 feet to the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics including Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, who represents the  
area, say leaving the waste in place is too dangerous. A flood, 
earthquake or other disaster could send millions of tons of it into 
the river, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	Cannon and Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., have introduced  
parallel bills in the House to force the federal government to move 
the waste to a plateau 18 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting that idea are Utah officials and the Metropolitan  
Water District of Southern California, which draws from the 
Colorado River to help provide drinking water for the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel there is no choice but to move it,'' said Mark  
Beuhler, the district's water quality director. ``There is nothing 
like radioactive material in their drinking water to make the 
public upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a ticking radioactive time bomb,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Moving the waste would cost more than $100 million, say the NRC  
and Atlas, while the company estimates capping the waste would cost 
about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money should not be driving this; it should be public  
health,'' Beuhler argued, noting that water treatment plants cannot 
remove uranium, which has been proven to cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	However, NRC and Environmental Protection Agency officials said  
water treatment plants downstream from the Atlas site have not 
detected unsafe levels of any toxin from the waste pile. 
</P>
<P>
	And Joe Holonich of the NRC said the toxic groundwater flowing  
from under the waste pile will continue to do so even if the waste 
is removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like a faucet you can turn off,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The large volume of water in reservoirs such as Lake Mead is  
enough to safely dilute waste from the Atlas site, said Holonich 
and Max Dodson of the EPA. The leaking mill tailings adds ``a 
sliver of uranium to a large amount of uranium that's already in 
the river from upstream'' uranium deposits and abandoned mines, 
Holonich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC is concerned that there is no plan to treat the  
underground contaminated water at the site, Holonich said. And the 
EPA is worried that Atlas' plan for a $5 million cleanup fund won't 
even cover the cost of capping the waste pile, Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's still no reason to move the waste, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gun-rights advocates gathering Friday  
for a collector's show here said no amount of gun control could 
have stopped Mark Barton from the massacre in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a madman,'' Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of  
National Rifle Association, said at the association-sponsored show. 
``If you try to confiscate all the guns from the good people, the 
crazies and the criminals will still find a way to get 'em.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, an investor, fatally shot nine people at two brokerage  
firms on Thursday after killing his wife and two children earlier 
in the week. The office victims were shot with 9 mm and .45-caliber 
handguns before Barton committed suicide. One of his guns was 
legally registered; authorities are unsure of the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings came one day before the NRA -- working with a local  
gun collectors group -- opened a three-day show in Kansas City 
devoted to rare and antique firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 350 merchants spread thousands of guns and wartime  
memorabilia across their tables. Buyers filled out identification 
forms, which merchants fed over the telephone to the 
``Insta-Check'' background check system. Some transactions took 
only minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control advocates called for the NRA to cancel the show,  
citing the Atlanta killings and labeling the Kansas City show the 
NRA's biggest since the Littleton, Colo., shootings that left 15 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	After those shootings at Columbine High School, the NRA scaled  
back its annual convention in Denver in late April and canceled its 
gun show there. 
</P>
<P>
	``These shows are an attempt to make respectable a point of view  
that is finding less and less favor among Americans,'' said Naomi 
Paiss, a spokeswoman for Handgun Control Inc., in Washington. 
``Every unnecessary massacre makes people more and more aware that 
this country is paying for some people's love affair with guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few among Friday's visitors to the convention were willing to  
even talk about gun control, though formal discussions on gun 
rights were planned for Saturday, with a seminar and update from 
the NRA's legislative arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gun control is a much-overworked subject, and the laws that  
are on the books are not being obeyed and, in most cases, are not 
being enforced,'' said Frank Gow, a retired Tulsa, Okla., gun shop 
owner who now sells antique firearms at shows once a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's insanity from the start. If someone, who hasn't done  
something before, decides to do something, how do you stop them? By 
taking all the rights away from everybody else? That hardly seems 
to be fair,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's discussions are expected to center on the 2000  
elections and efforts to promote laws allowing concealed weapons, 
NRA officials said. Missouri voters rejected such a law earlier 
this year.

competition on the luxury car front at home and in Europe, is 
expected to exercise its option to take full ownership of Swedish 
automaker Saab Automobile AB within the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lord knows, they need some luxury brands,'' analyst Gary  
Lapidus of Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. said Friday. ``It's as simple 
as that. Everyone agrees that Saab is probably best-served by being 
100 percent-owned by General Motors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM bought a 50 percent stake and management control of Saab in  
December 1989 for $600 million and made a $100 million investment 
in Saab's operations. Since then, Saab has lost money every year 
except 1994 and 1995, though it's on target to break even this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, GM has six months from Sunday to exercise its  
option to buy the remaining half of Saab from Swedish holding 
company Investor AB. GM president G. Richard Wagoner Jr. said this 
week that a decision will most likely come later this year rather 
than sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations with Investor add to GM's already full plate of  
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, the No. 1 automaker is trying to reverse its long,  
steady slide in market share. Like other global automakers, GM's 
also patiently waiting for a turnaround in the potentially huge 
growth markets of Asia and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	It's negotiating new national contracts and trying to avoid  
strikes with the United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers 
unions. And it's appealing an astonishing $4.9 billion 
product-liability verdict returned by a Los Angeles jury earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure on GM to expand its presence in the highly  
profitable luxury vehicle market has increased since rival Ford 
Motor Co. bought Sweden's other automaker, Volvo, earlier this 
year. No. 2 Ford's luxury lineup now includes four makes: Lincoln, 
Volvo, Jaguar and Aston Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	By being fully under GM's control, Saab will benefit from  
sharing manufacturing, distribution, research and development 
resources with the world's largest automaker. GM has invested 
relatively little in Saab over the past decade because of the 
half-ownership situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Once it gains full control, GM's expected to expand Saab's  
modest model lineup that now consists of only two primary models: 
the 9-3 coupe and sedan and the 9-5 sedan and wagon. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's big luxury division, Cadillac, has been struggling to  
maintain market share in the United States and has had little 
success getting Europeans to buy its cars. Cadillacs are perceived 
as too big with too soft a ride for European tastes. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts agree GM will find it easier to develop a global  
strategy for Cadillac and Saab if it has full ownership of the 
Swedish automaker. But some argue that GM is too far behind other 
automakers to expect much from Saab, at least in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's a lot of growth opportunity for Saab,  
primarily because Saab has waited too long to start to broaden its 
lineup,'' said independent analyst Susan Jacobs, who studies the 
luxury market. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs argues that Saab's quirky cars appeal to a rather narrow  
niche of U.S. luxury buyers she calls ``young affluents,'' a group 
that she sees shrinking over the next decade. The luxury market 
here already is becoming more concentrated among 50-and-older 
drivers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saab is not a strong enough brand to easily move upmarket to  
grab older affluents,'' she said. ``And they don't have the product 
lineup to bring in younger, twenty-something buyers, the kind that 
Audi targets with its A4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac, meanwhile, is trying to reposition itself from the  
other direction; it's typical buyer is in the 60s or 70s. Ford is 
in the same dilemma with Lincoln and Volvo. Lincolns appeal to 
older drivers, Volvo to those in their 30s and 40s. Both are 
developing new models aimed at the market in between. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lincoln already is there with some product to carve out of  
position for itself in 45- to 65-year-old category,'' Jacobs said. 
``It's ahead of Cadillac in doing that and Volvo will be ahead of 
Saab. Volvo will get an SUV sooner than Saab, and there's more 
potential for Volvo to get a minivan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's little doubt that Investor would like to shed Saab: The  
conglomerate's recent strategy has been to focus more on industries 
that hold the promise of bigger profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a question at what price,'' Lapidus said.  
</P>
<P>
	Though the 1989 deal reportedly set a fixed price for the  
remaining half of Saab, the deal still is subject to negotiation in 
light of changes in currency-exchange rates and Saab's recent 
financial improvement.

<HEADLINE> Jags' Coach Focuses on Mental Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- No sunglasses. No kneeling. No sitting  
on your helmet. All those rules are passe compared to the newest 
directive at Camp Coughlin 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	No laterals.  
</P>
<P>
	Any player who laterals the ball during Jaguars training camp  
will be fined. It's one way coach Tom Coughlin is trying to send 
the message that mental mistakes, like the one that crippled 
Jacksonville in its playoff game at New York last season, will not 
be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be more attention to detail at this camp than  
ever before,'' Coughlin said. ``More attention paid to assignments, 
assignment errors, penalties, that sort of thing. As far as 
pressure for people to perform well, we will never let up from a 
mental standpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While offsides penalties and missed assignments can slowly chip  
away at a team's effectiveness, the kind of mistake the Jaguars 
made in last year's 34-24 playoff loss to the Jets can end a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through the second quarter, safety Chris Hudson, who is  
no longer with the team, intercepted and returned the ball into 
Jets territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Inexplicably, he tried to lateral to a teammate. The ball  
bounded around and was recovered by the Jets. New York stayed on 
offense, drove for a touchdown and controlled the ball for more 
than 14 minutes of that decisive second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mental errors are one reason we haven't been able to get to  
the next level,'' Coughlin said. ``More players are aware of that. 
They have to work among themselves and put peer pressure on people 
in order to not be a mistake or error guy. The more that happens, 
the better off we're going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By moving some of the focus to the mental side, several players  
have noticed a subtle downshift in the amount of physical toil they 
endure in Coughlin's camp, once known as the toughest in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the team won't practice in full pads until next  
Monday, letting four practices go by in shells and shorts. Coughlin 
isn't as stringent about a rules list that bordered on ridiculous 
five years ago, when discipline was the best way to find out who 
could play for his first-year expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	And Coughlin hasn't totally dismissed shortening some practices  
if the temperatures, which have been in the high 90s for two weeks, 
don't let up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real surprising,'' said cornerback Dave Thomas, who has  
been present for all five Jaguars camps. ``The first year we 
started, we're in Wisconsin, it's 103 degrees out and we're in full 
pads every day. I'd say there's a big contrast from then to now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Mark Brunell says he's noticed a difference, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if easy is the word,'' Brunell said. ``But I'd  
say we're being smart the first two days. We're not going to go 
right out there and kill ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any slackening on the field is being made up for in the meeting  
rooms. Coughlin said the Jaguars faced too many 2nd-and-12 
situations last year for a team with 11 victories. He wants to 
eliminate the illegal procedure penalties that cause them. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the defense has to learn a new system with new  
terminology under coordinator Dom Capers. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Coughlin wants to give the players plenty to work on.  
And he doesn't think the new structure will diminish his reputation 
as a drill sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a gentler Tom,'' Coughlin said. ``I don't know who  
came up with that one. We've just adjusted accordingly. The mental 
part of camp will be just as tough as any camp, just as demanding 
as any camp we've had.''

<HEADLINE> Architect Learned Stonework on Nile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Long before Richard Morris Hunt designed the  
pedestal for the Statue of Liberty and others for statues in 
Washington, he learned something about stonework as one of the 
first Americans nearly 150 years ago to view the ruins of ancient 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the American Architectural Foundation opens ``A Voyage of  
Discovery,'' a show devoted to Hunt's pioneering trip, taken from 
more than 15,000 of his drawings and records in its files. Hunt 
depicted Egypt in lively colored sketches -- fruit vendors and snake 
charmers, rather than crumbling walls and columns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of his drawings show how interested he was in the way  
stones were put together,'' said William Stapp, the exhibit's 
curator. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt, 28 at the time, made the trip from Europe with three young  
American friends. He had spent nearly 10 years in Europe and was 
the first American admitted to the architectural section of the 
Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the leading French art school. 
</P>
<P>
	The 555-mile jaunt up the Nile River took seven weeks in a  
passenger sailboat called a dehabeah, the largest of its type. They 
got as far as Philae -- a major sightseeing center. The next day 
they turned around and took another month to get back to Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a kind of early frat party,'' Stapp said in an  
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Hunt's drawings, early photographs taken on waxed  
paper by younger brother and lawyer Leavitt Hunt, who had made a 
similar trip a year earlier, help illustrate the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Egyptian architecture had little influence on Hunt, who Stapp  
said felt much more comfortable when he reached Greece after 
traveling through today's Israel, Jordan and Syria. He returned to 
the United States the next year, and one of his first jobs was to 
help enlarge the Capitol. Later he designed the pedestal for the 
nearby statue of President James Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt also designed the U.S. Naval Observatory, now the vice  
president's official residence. When he finished the 154-foot 
pedestal for the Statue of Liberty in 1886, it was the world's 
largest single concrete structure. 
</P>
<P>
	His reputation as one of the foremost U.S. architects of the  
1800s comes in large part from mansions built for the wealthy of 
the ``gilded age'' toward the end of the century. Among them are 
Cornelius Vanderbilt's summer cottage called The Breakers, at 
Newport, R.I., and George Washington Vanderbilt's Biltmore Estate 
near Asheville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	----------	 
</P>
<P>
	``A Voyage of Discovery: the Nile Journal of Richard Morris  
Hunt'' will be on view through Jan. 2, 2000 at the Octagon House, 
where president James Madison lived after British troops burned the 
White House in 1814. Admission is $3 for adults, $1.50 for 
children, students and seniors.

<HEADLINE> GOP Unable To Produce HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to put the issue of regulating health  
maintenance organizations behind them, Republicans are struggling 
to produce legislation that could keep their fractured party 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chances were looking increasingly dim Thursday. Leaders  
have said they need to come up with a bill this week if they want 
to take it to the House floor before they leave for an August break 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a 70-yard field goal,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., said after a closed-door meeting of House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP meeting was called to discuss health care, but with no  
plan to present to their members, the leaders spent most of the 
meeting talking about spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	With a thin majority in the House, and Democrats united against  
them, Republicans need virtually every GOP vote to pass a bill 
imposing new regulations on HMOs and other managed-care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a problem'' among Republicans, acknowledged Rep.  
Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., who chairs one of the House's health 
subcommittees and was in meetings for hours this week looking for a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans want a limited bill that would give patients  
new rights to appeal denials of care and some new power to see 
doctors, without giving them new rights to sue or removing a health 
plan's right to determine what care is medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	But a group led by Reps. Charlie Norwood of Georgia, Tom Coburn  
of Oklahoma and Greg Ganske of Iowa -- all health care providers 
before entering Congress -- is pushing for a more sweeping 
legislation, similar to the Democrats' approach. Together with 
Republicans who are generally moderate on social issues, they say 
they have anywhere from 20 to 60 Republicans who will vote with 
them if the issue goes to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., was working with Bilirakis and other  
leaders on Wednesday and Thursday, but they failed to produce a 
bill they believe could pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate already passed an HMO bill, voting mostly along party  
lines, but President Clinton has threatened to veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some House Republicans were talking to Democrats  
about joining in a bipartisan bill. Ganske said he met with 
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., Wednesday. And ``serious'' 
talks with other like-minded Republicans are ongoing, said Sue 
Harvey, a Gephardt spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can find a way to get to a bipartisan bill that we can  
pass, we're going to try to pass it,'' Gephardt told reporters. It 
would take only a handful of Republicans to join united Democrats 
and pass a bill Democrats favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's spokesman, John Feehrey, acknowledged that little  
progress had been and the issue may have to wait until the House 
returns in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a GOP working group -- coincidentally, led by Hastert  
before he became speaker -- came up with an HMO bill that narrowly 
passed the House. But when Hastert took over as speaker, he said he 
wanted the regular committees to write legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Norwood and others prevented Republicans on two separate  
committees from passing strict GOP legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bipartisan discussions were under way in the Commerce Committee,  
but early this week, Hastert asked a small group to come up with a 
bill that could be taken directly to the House floor. Hastert's 
backers said he wanted legislation on the floor before the August 
break, but Coburn, Ganske and others suspect that he didn't like 
what Commerce was likely to produce. 
</P>
<P>
	``His cover for months and months was 'well, you know, we'll  
just let the committee process do its job,''' Ganske said. ``But 
when it became obvious that we had the votes to bring out a good 
bill, all of a sudden, man, that just goes by the wayside.''

	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- A Paraguayan human rights group Friday  
called on the United States to make public its files on former 
dictator Alfredo Stroessner. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Almada, president of the Asuncion-based group Moral  
Tribunal Against Impunity, urged the U.S. government to declassify 
whatever paperwork the American embassy compiled during 
Stroessner's 34-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be the only way of totally knowing the violations and  
crimes committed by Stroessner,'' Almada said. 
</P>
<P>
	Almada said he hoped the release of the documents could help  
with his group's efforts to bring the 85-year-old former general to 
justice. Stroessner, who lives in exile in neighboring Brazil, 
ruled Paraguay until 1989.

	Environmental prosecutor Elmer Lizardo said men have given  
chainsaws to more than 100 peasants so they can cut wood to export 
to the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loggers, who are protected by some government officials  
and politicians, have been operating in the zone for six months 
with modern communication equipment and dozens of men armed with 
AK-47 rifles,'' he said.

	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's health minister Friday praised the Clinton  
administration's decision to let a drug company with U.S. offices 
work with Cuban researchers on tests for a meningitis vaccine for 
possible future use in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision ``is a just move in favor of children, the  
principal victims of this illness,'' Health Minister Carlos Dotres 
told Cuba's Prensa Latina news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline Beecham obtained approval last week from the U.S.  
Treasury Department to test the vaccine against meningitis B. The 
approval is an exception to the 37-year-old U.S. trade embargo 
against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline is a British firm but its testing laboratories are  
owned by a U.S. subsidiary subject to the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine, developed in 1989 in Havana, is 83 percent  
effective, say Cuban investigators. Cuba has sold the vaccine in 
Latin America. Under this new agreement, the vaccine could also be 
sold in the United States and Europe.

	SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- The Chiapas state  
legislature has approved a law granting greater autonomy to Indian 
communities -- a key issue raised by Zapatista rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was passed Thursday over the objections of  
opposition legislators, who say the government is still failing to 
meet its commitments under a 1996 preliminary accord with the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace talks collapsed shortly after the agreement was signed,  
with the Zapatistas accusing the government of not meeting its 
obligations. The rebels staged a brief uprising in January 1994 in 
the name of Indian rights and greater democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law passed Thursday, Indian communities would be  
allowed to follow their traditions in choosing their local 
government leaders and would have authority to punish those who 
violate their laws.

<HEADLINE> Car Bomb Kills 4 in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A powerful car bomb ripped through the  
Medellin offices of the army's anti-kidnapping squad Friday, 
killing at least four people and injuring 20 others. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb, a truck packed with at least 100 pounds of explosives,  
went off at 3:15 p.m. in a residential neighborhood of Medellin, 
155 miles northwest of the Bogota, said Medellin police spokesman 
Haten Dasuki. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear whether the dead were soldiers or  
civilians, or both. The blast leveled the offices of the 
anti-kidnapping squad known by its Spanish initials, GAULA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a powerful bomb, like the ones that went off during  
Pablo Escobar's time,'' Dasuki said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1980s, Colombia's second-largest city was constantly  
rocked by bomb explosions, as the now-defunct Medellin cocaine 
cartel, led by Pablo Escobar, waged a terrorist campaign against 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Local television images showed the shattered facades of at least  
a half dozen houses, and vehicles flipped onto their sides by the 
blast -- the second explosion in Medellin in less than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 19, a Renault sedan packed with explosives was set off  
by suspected leftist rebels in front of the offices of a large 
cement company. There were no deaths, but a night watchman was 
injured.

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Pledge Balkan Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- President Clinton and the  
leaders of some 40 nations pledged today to push economic and 
democratic reforms for the war-torn Balkans in the hopes of 
creating an undivided Europe ``where war becomes unthinkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The stability pact for Southeast Europe was launched to ensure  
the horrors this city suffered in recent years will definitely 
belong to the past,'' said Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari at a 
conference in this city that's a symbol of war and recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stability pact envisions a Europe at long last undivided,  
prosperous and free -- a Europe where war becomes unthinkable,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued a statement stressing that NATO's victory in  
Kosovo will be hollow without a concerted international effort to 
bolster Balkan nations economically. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot say our job is finished when refugees are returning  
to shattered lives,'' Clinton said. ``The transformation and 
integration of this region cannot be achieved piecemeal, one 
province, one country, one crisis at a time. ... The pace will 
certainly vary but we have to move forward together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the session closed, Clinton spoke to Serb, Muslim and  
Croat students who will attend high school together this fall. 
Their school was heavily damaged in the Bosnian war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to build the peace. The war is over,'' Clinton told  
the cheering students, who climbed on chairs to get a better view 
as he arrived. ``We have to build a better peace for Bosnia and all 
of Southeast Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the one-day summit, the major powers committed to help  
poor Balkan nations move beyond ancient ethnic hatreds that have 
torn the region many times since World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders endorsed a pact to promote a healthier future for  
the Balkans. Goals include creating mature democracies and vibrant 
market economies, combating corruption and organized crime and 
preventing fresh wars and refugee crises. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of the economic assistance should go to Serbia as long  
as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is in power, Clinton said, 
hoping the conference would further isolate Milosevic and show Serb 
people their best hopes lie with a new leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret that we were not able to invite the Federal Republic  
of Yugoslavia to be present today,'' a closing statement from 
Clinton and the other leaders said. The leaders appealed to 
Serb-led Yugoslavia ``to embrace democratic change and work 
actively for regional reconciliation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders also offered incentives to Montenegro, Serbia's  
western-leaning junior partner in the rump Yugoslav federation. The 
summit participants ``will consider ways of making the republic of 
Montenegro an early beneficiary of the pact and reaffirm their 
support of all democratic forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton pointed to progress in rebuilding Sarajevo as an example  
of a Balkans comeback. ``We have a lot more to do, but those who 
are overly critical should come here to see,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed creating a Southeast Europe Trade Initiative  
that would grant duty-free status to many of the region's exports 
to the United States, including footwear, glass products and ball 
bearings. The initiative would cost the United States between $50 
million and $80 million over five years in lost tariff collections. 
The administration intended the duty-free trade privileges as a 
challenge for the European Union to do more in the area of trade 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is needed now is that we show in practice the solidarity  
that all who have been participating here have shown,'' Ahtisaari 
said after the sessions ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahtisaari and others said the turbulent region was ready for  
democratic change after a decade of ethnic conflict that most 
recently prompted the 78-day NATO bombing over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having won the war, we have got to win the peace,'' British  
Prime Minister Tony Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	In prepared remarks, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said  
the Stability Pact needed Yugoslavia to be truly successful. But, 
he added: ``It would be a disservice'' to the Yugoslav people ``if 
we now strengthen the regime in Belgrade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be the first to welcome this great country within a  
modern Europe...'' once there is a democratic Yugoslavia, French 
President Jacques Chirac said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic, under indictment as a war criminal, was not invited.  
His political opponents were. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians urged a relaxation of a U.S.-backed ban on all but  
humanitarian aid to the Yugoslavia government because of its 
central position within the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin said the world should  
not punish 10 million Yugoslavians by linking aid to Milosevic's 
continued rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not happy with the strict linkage to Milosevic,'' he  
said he told other leaders, but he had no ``serious apprehensions'' 
about signing the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Bodo Hombach, Balkan coordinator for the European Union,  
emphasized the benefits of the Stability Pact. ``Regional 
cooperation is the key theme,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ante Jelavic, one of Bosnia's presidents, said the gathering of  
leaders ``will undoubtedly be motivation for further development of 
democracy, protection of human rights, confidence, stability and 
peace in the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in an earlier meeting with Bosnia's three presidents,  
Jelavic, Zivko Radisic, and Alija Izetbegovic, praised their 
efforts to restore peace and begin economic reforms. Since he last 
came to Sarajevo in December 1997, he said a lot of the city had 
been rebuilt following four years of Serb shelling. ``It doesn't 
even look like the same place I visited two years ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 international peacekeepers were deployed to protect  
the leaders. Numerous streets were closed to traffic, and most 
businesses were closed. On roads from the airport, residents were 
directed to stay off their balconies. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the intense security, a gunshot rang out as Croatia's  
president, Franjo Tudjman, was entering the city. A NATO spokesman, 
Lt. Commander David Scanlon, said the round was apparently fired 
accidentally by a peacekeeper's weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Scanlon said the firing was under investigation and may have  
been caused by mechanical failure. No one was injured.

<HEADLINE>  NASA Has Shuttle Fuel Leak Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A loose pin shot out of one of space  
shuttle Columbia's engines moments before liftoff last week and 
probably caused the ship's hydrogen fuel leak, NASA said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The gold-plated, 1-inch pin is the chief suspect, but the space  
agency was continuing its investigation to be certain nothing else 
was to blame, said Bill Gerstenmaier, a senior shuttle manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia leaked hydrogen fuel all the way to orbit last Friday.  
The shuttle, commanded by Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, was 
carrying five astronauts and the world's most powerful X-ray 
telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	A larger leak could have caused the damaged engine to shut down  
and forced NASA's first female commander to attempt an 
unprecedented emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers believe the force of engine ignition 6 1/2 seconds before  
liftoff knocked the pin from a tube and down through the combustion 
chamber of the right main engine. The pin -- which was serving as a 
plug in a damaged oxygen-injection line, and resembled a tapered 
nail -- likely slammed against the nozzle. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the pin would have been traveling at well above Mach 1,  
which is the speed of sound. Engineers have yet to determine its 
precise speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The pin would not have created the three small holes found in  
three side-by-side hydrogen-circulating tubes inside the nozzle. 
Rather, it would have weakened the stainless steel tubes so much 
that they could no longer hold pressure and consequently ruptured, 
Gerstenmaier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The holes were discovered in the right engine nozzle immediately  
after Columbia landed Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerstenmaier said the damage -- if it was, indeed, caused by the  
pin -- was on ``the high side'' for such a small object. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's right engine had two of these pins jammed into  
oxygen-injection tubes as plugs, to keep the liquid oxygen from 
entering the damaged lines. The other pin held. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a rudimentary repair -- plugging damaged oxygen-injection  
tubes -- is not uncommon in older shuttle engines like this one. 
It's the first time, however, that a plug came loose during flight, 
said George Hopson, head of NASA's shuttle main engine program. Of 
the newer engines, only one is plugged. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerstenmaier said it's too soon to know whether the problem will  
delay the next space shuttle flight, a radar-mapping mission by 
Endeavour in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really need some more time to look at this and see what the  
implications are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broken nozzle tubes have been sent for analysis to  
Rocketdyne in Canoga Park, Calif., where the engines are made. 
</P>
<P>
	Technicians, meanwhile, will search the launch pad in an attempt  
to find the missing pin, which is seven-eighths of an inch long and 
one-eighth of an inch in diameter. It may well be in pieces, 
shattered by the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack,''  
Gerstenmaier said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's oldest space shuttle also sustained a momentary short  
circuit five seconds after liftoff, which knocked out the prime 
computers for two of the three main engines. Technicians hope to 
locate the electrical short in the next few days.

<HEADLINE> Old National Bancorp Buying ANB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Old National Bancorp is buying ANB Corp.  
for $212.4 million in stock, the companies announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	ANB shareholders would receive 1.25 shares of Old National for  
each share of ANB they hold. The deal, which must be approved by 
shareholders and regulators, is expected to close early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of ANB's $784 million in assets will bring Old  
National's total assets to approximately $7.7 billion, and ANB's 24 
offices will give Old National a total of 143 in Indiana, Illinois 
and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	ANB is the holding company of American National Bank and Trust  
Co. of Muncie, Peoples Loan &AMP; Trust Bank of Winchester, and Farmers 
State Bank of Union City, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Old National said it expects to reduce the combined operating  
expenses of the two bank holding companies by 20 percent next year. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it would take a one-time, after-tax charge to 1999  
earnings of approximately $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Risinger, Old National's chairman and chief executive, said  
the company will make Muncie the home of the headquarters for its 
eastern Indiana region. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect ANB to join us without a hitch, just as 38 other  
financial institutions have done since we embarked on the merger 
trail in 1985,'' Risinger said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Offers Plan for Cutting Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Refusing to cede the issue to the  
Republicans, Vice President Al Gore proposed a more modest tax cut 
Friday aimed at helping middle-class families pay for education and 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential candidate called the $792 billion  
GOP plan rolling through Congress ``reckless, unaffordable and 
fundamentally unfair.'' Any tax cut, he said, must be fiscally 
responsible, fair and targeted to working families. He said he 
envisioned a tax cut in the range of $250 billion to $295 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proposed a new ``401(j)'' program for educational expenses  
that, similar to the current 401(k), would allow families and 
employers to contribute up to $2,500 a year that can be saved and 
withdrawn tax-free. He would give families earning up to $40,000 an 
extra dollar of tax relief for every $2 they contribute. 
</P>
<P>
	To address the tax code's ``marriage penalty,'' a Republican pet  
peeve, Gore proposed doubling the standard deduction for all joint 
filers and increasing the amount a low-income couple can earn and 
still receive the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed making permanent the tax credit for private  
business' research and development expenses. And, like President 
Clinton, advocated the creation of Universal Savings Accounts, 
allowing individual tax-free retirement savings. Gore didn't say 
how he would pay for the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	By arguing for narrow tax relief, Gore hoped to lock himself  
into a debate with GOP front-runner George W. Bush without offering 
any plan so deviant from Clinton's policies that it would alter the 
current course of economic prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't squander the surplus and also keep our economy  
strong. You can't have your cake and eat it, too. Come to think of 
it, it sounds a little like 'compassionate conservatism,''' Gore 
said, poking at Republican presidential front-runner George W. 
Bush's campaign slogan. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he would fight to ``keep our prosperity going''  
without punishing those who are doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative to his plan is a GOP plan that would ``repeat  
the trickle-down tragedies of the past, with a risky, $3 trillion 
tax scheme,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson said Gore  
was trying to ``reinvent'' his record. ``The last time candidate 
Gore promised a tax cut -- during the 1992 campaign -- he turned 
around and socked families with the largest tax increase in 
American history,'' Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a  
Washington think tank allied with Clinton, said Gore's tax plan was 
designed to hold together the coalition that twice elected Clinton 
-- middle-class suburbanites plus the Democratic party's traditional 
urban base. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Gore campaign clearly wants to start setting the terms of  
the policy debate after several weeks of unflattering stories of 
disarray within the campaign,'' Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reference to Bush and Democratic presidential rival Bill  
Bradley, Gore said, ``I believe that it is time for all who seek to 
lead the world's most powerful economy to stand up and be 
counted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Bradley adviser Anita Dunn said the former New Jersey  
senator would not be rushed into outlining a tax policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not been running a campaign that makes its plans in  
reaction to what the vice president's camp does,'' Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Through 18 years in the Senate, and as a chief architect of the  
1986 tax overhaul, Bradley has stood for ``the lowest possible rate 
for the most American workers, with the fewest loopholes and the 
least amount of corporate welfare and special-interest tax breaks 
in the code,'' Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan-based Republican pollster Bob Teeter said it made no  
sense -- especially this early in the 2000 campaign -- for Gore to 
put out a tax-cut plan while the White House is waging a tax battle 
with congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sounds to me like Gore, who's behind and losing some  
ground to Bradley, is lunging around for a strategy,'' said Teeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax cuts are a Republican issue that would naturally be won by  
Bush, Teeter added. 
</P>
<P>
	But surveys show that with the economy healthy, voters are not  
as interested in tax cuts as improving education and health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Carrick, a California-based Democratic consultant, said  
Gore's early pro-tax-cut talk could still buttress his record 
against charges in next year's general election that he is a 
tax-and-spend liberal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he's doing is more an immunization thing rather than a  
real opportunity for voters to rally around the cause of this 
particular collection of tax cuts,'' Carrick said.

<HEADLINE> Waltrip Retiring From Racing in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Darrell Waltrip is set to retire from NASCAR racing, but not  
before a farewell tour in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time Winston Cup champion still leads active Winston  
Cup drivers with 84 victories. But he has not won a race in seven 
years and is struggling to remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip and team sponsor Kmart will announce the move Thursday  
during the opening day of practice and qualifying for the Brickyard 
400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	His final season apparently will be modeled after the recent  
retirement tours of Richard Petty, Mario Andretti and Bobby Rahal, 
all of whom tied their farewells to marketing campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip was not available for comment Friday, but personal  
representative Keith Waltz told The Associated Press the 
announcement will be ``no surprise to anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip signed a two-year contract with team co-owners Travis  
Carter and Carl Haas last fall. At the time, he said it would be 
his last as a driver and the 2000 season probably would include 
some kind of goodbye to the fans, depending on his sponsor's 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darrell hasn't made any secret of his plans,'' said Carter,  
who also owns a team that fields cars for Jimmy Spencer in the 
Winston Cup series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be finishing on his own terms and that's a good thing  
for anybody,'' said Phillipe Lopez, Waltrip's crew chief. ``He'll 
finally be able to do some other things besides being at race 
tracks just about every week. Family is very important to Darrell 
and he'll be able to spend more time at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is just at a point where he wants to see and do other  
things in life, 
</P>
<P>
	The charismatic driver from Owensboro, Ky., and a longtime  
resident of Franklin, Tenn., has not won since the Southern 500 in 
Darlington, S.C., in 1992. He finished 25th at last week's 
Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway and is 38th in the season 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip owned and drove for his own team for eight years, but  
sold it in 1998 because of financial problems and disputes with 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, he said 1999 would be his last season as a driver,  
but he changed his mind when Carter and Haas offered him the 
two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip has done race commentary for The Nashville Network and  
has said he might want to enter broadcasting after leaving racing.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A loose pin in an engine likely  
caused hydrogen fuel to leak during space shuttle Columbia's launch 
last week, NASA said today.

<P>
	Engineers believe the force of engine ignition 6 1/2 seconds before

combustion chamber, said Bill Gerstenmaier, a senior shuttle

<P>
	Gerstenmaier cautioned that the pin is the leading suspect. A  
couple more weeks of analyses will be needed to verify exactly what 
happened; the broken tubes have been sent to Rocketdyne in Canoga

</P>
<P>
	``This is still a work in progress,'' Gerstenmaier told  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia, carrying five astronauts and the world's most powerful  
X-ray telescope, leaked hydrogen fuel all the way to orbit last 
Friday. About 5 pounds of hydrogen seeped out of the three holes 
each second of the 8 1/2-minute climb to orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	If there had been more holes and therefore more leakage, the  
engine could have shut down and NASA's first female space 
commander, Eileen Collins, may have faced an unprecedented 
emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
	The holes were discovered in the right engine nozzle immediately  
after Columbia landed Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE>  Dan Marino Reports for 17th Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- It's a Miami Dolphins tradition, like the  
pre-game invocation, Don Shula tributes and a lousy running attack. 
When Dan Marino reports to training camp, cameras cluster around 
his locker and he speaks optimistically about the team's chances of 
winning the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual ritual was repeated Friday. Marino is 0-for-16, walks  
with a limp and could easily opt for the hottest trend in 
professional sports -- retirement. But he'd rather try again for an 
NFL title. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why you're playing -- to have a chance to win a  
championship,'' he said. ``My position is no different from anybody 
else in this locker room. If it is different, they probably won't 
be here long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He turns 38 in September, so the ritual -- like Marino -- may be  
on its last legs. But he's back for his 17th training camp, and the 
way things are going around the NFL, that's big news. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Sanders retired this week at age 31. John Elway quit in  
April at 38. But while they can start working on their Hall of Fame 
speeches, Marino will stick with a familiar refrain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody on the team is real excited,'' he said. ``This is  
the time of year you have to be. We just have to work hard and turn 
it loose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino admits this could be his last chance. Despite poor  
mobility because of nine operations on his knees, right ankle and 
right Achilles' tendon, he has started 44 consecutive games. But he 
realizes retirement could be a sack away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to play as long as I possibly can, but who knows?''  
Marino said. ``At this point in my career you have to take it one 
year at a time. You never know what your health situation and 
circumstances around the team are going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Elway's retirement, Marino is the lone active quarterback  
remaining from the esteemed Class of 1983. Todd Blackledge quit in 
1989, Tony Eason in 1990, Ken O'Brien in 1993 and Jim Kelly in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Each was a first-round draft pick. Only Elway won an NFL title.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins lost in the Super Bowl in 1984, Marino's second  
season, and haven't been back since. Jimmy Johnson touts this 
year's team as by far the best in his four years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last couple of years we've had more talent and higher  
expectations,'' Marino said. ``We'll just have to see what 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Marino's 47-page biography in the Miami media guide notes, he  
holds 25 NFL passing records, including career marks for touchdowns 
(408), yardage (58,913) and completions (4,763). 
</P>
<P>
	His right arm shows few concessions to age. Last year, despite  
Johnson's efforts to emphasize the run over the pass, Marino ranked 
seventh in the NFL in touchdowns (23) and yardage (3,497). 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really see any letup,'' said receiver Tony Martin, who  
was with the Dolphins in 1990-93 and rejoined them this year. 
``He's still throwing the ball with a lot of velocity and still has 
that quick release, and you still have to get your head turned 
around if you don't want it knocked off. He's telling the receivers 
all the time, `I want to see your head spin around like Linda Blair 
in `The Exorcist.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Throwing footballs is still fun, but Marino admits the drudgery  
of training camp becomes more difficult each year. He stood in the 
hot sun for four hours Friday, occasionally taking a snap and often 
looking bored. 
</P>
<P>
	Practice finally ended, and Marino walked swiftly off the field,  
hoping he's headed for the Super Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Gwynn, McGwire Eye Milestones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Baseball fans in St. Louis, who witnessed  
history last season, may get a double dose of the same in the 
coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire and the Tony Gwynn are on the doorstep of career  
milestones. McGwire, who set a major league record with 70 home 
runs last season, needs six more to reach 500 for his career. And 
Gwynn is just nine hits short of 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals began a seven-game homestand Friday night with a  
game against Colorado. Beginning Monday, the San Diego Padres and 
Gwynn come to town for four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 15 players have hit 500 or more homers. McGwire would have  
to go on a spurt to make it during the homestand, but he's been 
hitting them in bunches lately, with 10 homers in his last 15 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals fans have a better chance to witness Gwynn's historic  
hit. Only 21 players have reached 3,000 hits. Gwynn would become 
the first National League player to reach 3,000 in 20 years -- the 
last being the Cardinals' Lou Brock in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn has won eight National League batting titles, tied with  
Honus Wagner for most in league history and one more than Stan 
Musial won in his Cardinals career. Musial is also a member of the 
3,000 hit club. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire gave fans at Busch Stadium a lifetime's worth of  
memories last season when he swatted several of the most historic 
home runs. Those included No. 61, which tied Roger Maris' 
37-year-old record, No. 62, which broke it, and No. 70 in his final 
at-bat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball that McGwire hits for No. 500 is expected to have  
considerable value, recalling the excitement over last season's 
historic home run balls. Comic book creator Todd McFarlane spent 
more than $3 million to acquire the 70th homer ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The 500-home run club includes Henry Aaron, Babe Ruth, Willie  
Mays, Frank Robinson, Mel Ott, Jimmie Foxx -- but no Cardinals. 
Musial hit 475 home runs in his career, the most by a player who 
wore a Cardinals uniform.

	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- For the second time this year, the  
United States upset Germany, the European champion. And this time, 
it wasn't in a lowly exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans didn't even use some of their top players.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're very happy with the result,'' U.S. coach Bruce Arena  
said after Friday night's surprising 2-0 win, which put the 
Americans in the semifinals of the FIFA Confederations Cup. ``We 
prepared well, and we had a great game. I'm proud and satisfied

<HEADLINE> Bengals Camp Opens Without Pickens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GEORGETOWN, Ky. (AP) -- The Cincinnati Bengals opened training  
camp Friday without star receiver Carl Pickens or either of the 
team's top two draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the absences were expected, however. Pickens said he will  
sit out this season and give up his $3.5 million salary, rather 
than play for the Bengals again. Quarterback Akili Smith and 
cornerback Charles Fisher have not come to terms with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Craig Yeast, the fourth-round draft pick from  
Kentucky, will get a tryout as a punt returner, coach Bruce Coslet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see how much he can handle,'' Coslet said.  
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, the Bengals' career leading receiver, was at home  
hoping to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's living in Atlanta, working out every day, staying ready,  
waiting for something to happen,'' his agent Steve Zucker said 
Thursday. ``If it doesn't, he's prepared to retire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the third overall pick in this year's draft, was in San  
Diego while his agent tried to bridge a philosophical gap with the 
Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Mike Brown wants Smith to accept an  
incentive-laden deal like the one that running back Ricky Williams 
got from New Orleans. Agent Leigh Steinberg is looking for a deal 
along the lines of the one quarterback Tim Couch got from 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, there's been no progress made since draft day,''  
Steinberg said. ``In recent years, we've had a very positive 
negotiating relationship, so this has been a real surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two players, guard Ken Blackman and linebacker Tom Tumulty,  
failed their pre-camp physicals and were placed on the 
active-physically unable to perform list. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are recovering from knee surgery and will have another  
chance to pass. Until then, they count against the team's 80-man 
roster and could be activated for practice upon passage of the 
physical.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Eyes IRL Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Scott Sharp, a victory short of becoming the  
first Indy Racing League driver to win five times in his career, 
isn't getting many surprise packages. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's good, because he doesn't want any. The 1996 IRL  
co-champion is hoping for a carryover of momentum from a victory 
two weeks ago at Atlanta Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``You expect the car to roll off the truck fast,'' Sharp said  
Friday after he was third-fastest of 23 cars in practice for the 
MBNA Mid-Atlantic 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp will defend his race title Sunday, when the IRL cars  
tackle difficult Dover Downs International Speedway for the second 
time. A win would break his tie with reigning Indianapolis 500 
champion Kenny Brack and the retired Arie Luyendyk. 
</P>
<P>
	Earning that victory might be difficult, considering the  
practices of IRL points leader Scott Goodyear and Eddie Cheever. 
</P>
<P>
	``The track was very fast, and much better than it was last  
year,'' said Goodyear, whose lap of 182.315 mph was fastest of the 
day. ``We ran in some close contact and the car seems OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was somewhat of a relief to Goodyear, the only two-time  
winner on the circuit this year. He had to make a change early into 
the morning practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car we initially came here to run, unfortunately, I had  
problems with it,'' he said. ``It didn't feel right on the first 
two or three warmup laps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pitted twice, making chassis adjustments both times to his  
Aurora-powered G Force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked for things and couldn't find them, so we had to put  
the backup car out, and only got about 10 minutes in the early 
session,'' he said. ``But things went well in this last session, 
and we're quite pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He should be, insisted Cheever, the wisecracking 1998  
Indianapolis 500 champion. Standing within earshot of Goodyear -- 
whose fastest lap was clocked in 19.746 seconds -- Cheever couldn't 
resist needling him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spent a few laps running behind Scott,'' he said. ``Once  
again, he's found a way to circumvent the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the car to beat.''  
</P>
<P>
	Cheever's Infiniti-powered Dallara wasn't far behind. He got  
around in 19.773, at 182.066. Sharp was just four-thousandths of 
second slower, clocking a fast lap of 182.030. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being one of just two drivers on the lead lap last year  
at Dover, and his move in Atlanta to second place in the series 
standings, Sharp wasn't sure he would be so good again on The 
Monster Mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you address each weekend as a brand new start,'' he  
said. ``Yet I don't think the team could be coming in here with a 
better frame of mind coming off Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speed was contagious for Kelley Racing on a hot, humid  
afternoon. Sharp's teammate, Mark Dismore, was fourth, turning a 
lap of 181.938. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth was the Dallara-Aurora of rookie points leader John  
Hollansworth Jr., who went 181.378. 
</P>
<P>
	With rules changes reducing rpms from 10,500 to 10,000 and the  
temperature expected to be close to 100 degrees -- making the track 
slicker -- no qualifying record is expected Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Stewart, now the rookie sensation of the NASCAR Winston Cup  
circuit, went 185.204 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars were more stable that a year ago, when bumps in the  
surface -- hardly a factor for the heavier NASCAR machines -- wrought 
havoc to the field. Only 10 of 22 cars were running at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The high spots have been milled down, and there were no major  
complaints about the track. Greg Ray, whose rear wing came loose, 
was the lone near casualty in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	His Dallara got sideways, but he saved it from hitting the wall.  
</P>
<P>
	``The big man up there helped me out,'' Ray said.  
</P>
<P>
	Eliseo Salazar received multiple fractures when he hit the wall  
in practice last year, and missed the final six races. Robby Unser 
broke his foot, and Steve Knapp wound up with a concussion from a 
rash of crashes that took eight cars from that race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The track is a lot nicer than last year,'' said Jeff Ward, who  
as the eight-place finisher in 1998 wasn't so sure that was good 
for him. ``I didn't have any trouble with it last year, but this 
will probably help some of the guys whose cars didn't get the right 
setup.''

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Soars in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income galloped ahead  
faster than spending in June, the government said Friday. New home 
sales, meanwhile, rose 3.1 percent as buyers rushed to beat slowly 
rising mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports, analysts said, reflected a healthy U.S. economy,  
including benign inflation. But jitters on Wall Street continued. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 136.14 points -- after 
dropping 180 points on Thursday -- while other indexes were off 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of the government reports was expected to cause new  
alarm bells at the Federal Reserve, which nudged up interest rates 
June 30 in a pre-emptive strike against inflation, some economists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there was continuing concern among investors that the  
reports, along with one by the National Association of Purchasing 
Management's Chicago branch that manufacturing activity in that 
region accelerated at a faster-than-expected pace in July, would 
make it more likely that the Fed would raise rates again soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has told Congress the  
central bank would raise rates if higher inflation seems a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, stocks tumbled after the Labor Department said its  
Employment Cost Index rose a bigger-than-expected 1.1 percent in 
the second quarter, the largest gain since 1991. Closely watched by 
Greenspan, the index is considered the best measure of changes in 
wages and benefit costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's personal income report showed an acceleration in the  
broader area of the money people are taking in. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said personal income, which includes  
wages, interest and government benefits, rose a 
faster-than-expected 0.7 percent last month. It was the biggest 
gain since a 0.9 percent rise in November and marked the first time 
since January that income growth outpaced the rise in spending. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, income rose 0.3 percent, while spending went up 0.6  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A June surge in farm income, stemming from federal subsidy  
payments to farmers, was the major boost to overall income growth. 
Still, excluding these payments, income would have gone up 0.5 
percent, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Americans tempered their spending somewhat.  
Spending went up just 0.3 percent in June, a little less than many 
analysts had expected. That too was the smallest increase since 
November, when spending rose 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are still in a buying mood but not as aggressive,''  
said Gary Thayer, chief economist with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists attributed the moderation in spending to a number of  
factors including a recent rise in interest rates and a decline in 
mortgage refinancing. People who refinance homes end up with extra 
money which leads to higher spending, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ``does not force the Fed to do anything right away,  
but it does keep the inflation hawks circling'' because consumer 
spending is still strong, said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic 
Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	Because consumer spending has outpaced incomes repeatedly, the  
nation's savings rate -- saving as a percentage of after-tax income 
-- has set a string of record lows this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the savings rate was minus 1.0 percent, better than the  
record low of negative 1.4 percent set in May. 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for the negative savings rate, economists say, is  
that the strong stock market is boosting Americans' net worth and 
making them feel more comfortable about dipping into savings to pay 
for the spending spree. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, sales of new single-family homes rose in  
June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 929,000 units, better 
than forecast, the Commerce Department said. In May, new-home sales 
fell 4.1 percent to 901,000 units, not so bad as the government 
previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite rising interest rates, home sales have remained strong  
because home buyers are rushing to lock in current interest rates 
in the fear that rates might climb higher,'' said Merrill Lynch 
economist Karen Dexter. 
</P>
<P>
	The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage this  
week was 7.70 percent, up from 7.52 percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in sales pushed prices up as well. The median price  
for a new home -- meaning half of all homes sold in June for less 
and half for more -- rose 4.7 percent to $157,000, up from May's 
median price of $149,900. June's price was the highest since 
February's record of $159,900. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people buy homes, they also buy things to put into  
them,'' said Vitner. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on nondurable products, such as food and fuel,  
increased 0.4 percent in June, less than the 0.5 percent increase 
the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	But spending on durable goods -- big-ticket manufactured items  
expected to last at least three years, such as washing machines and 
cars -- was flat in June, following a sharp, 2.2 percent gain in 
May.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Sign Culpepper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Daunte Culpepper, signed by the  
Minnesota Vikings on Friday, says he is ready to back up Randall 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	Culpepper, the Vikings' first-round draft choice out of Central  
Florida, will join his new teammates at Vikings training camp in 
Mankato, Minn., next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I'm ready to go,'' the quarterback said Friday after the  
team announced his signing. ``I'm just very thankful, glad and 
blessed that we got all this business part out of the way before 
training camp started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of his contract were not released. WCCO-TV reported  
Culpepper signed a five-year contract worth about $2 million a year 
with a $5 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Culpepper, the 11th overall selection, said he is comfortable  
playing behind Cunningham, who led the Vikings to the NFC title 
game against Atlanta last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I feel it's a situation that I'm not expected to go  
out and play early. What I'm expected to do, is go out and learn 
and work hard, which I really don't have a problem doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the 36-year-old Cunningham a great guy, a great  
teacher and a great football player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think with that combination of things, I'll be fine working  
with him,'' he said. ``He's shown me a lot already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings' selection of the 6-foot-4, 262-pounder was the  
first time the team used a first-round pick on a quarterback since 
taking Tommy Kramer out of Rice in 1977.

<HEADLINE> Prince Drops Suit Against Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Artist formerly known as Prince has dropped  
his lawsuit against Uptown magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers say the nonprofit fan-written and -produced publication  
has agreed that, among other things, it will no longer publish 
discographies of bootlegs of The Artist's recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chanhassen, Minn.-based musician also wants Uptown to stop  
using the unpronounceable symbol that he adopted in 1993 in place 
of his name. Uptown officials said they had been using the symbol 
``out of respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement guarantees Uptown's First Amendment rights, and  
the right to freely comment on The Artist's music -- unreleased and 
released -- as it has since it was first launched as a fanzine in 
Sweden in 1991.

<HEADLINE> No Charges in Death of Wrestler Hart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Criminal charges will not be filed in  
the death of professional wrestler Owen Hart, who fell to his death 
during an aerial accident, Jackson County Prosecutor Robert Beaird 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart -- also known as The Blue Blazer -- was killed May 23 when he  
fell from a cable as he was being lowered into the ring at a World 
Wrestling Federation show. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, 34, fell 78 feet when the quick release on his harness  
opened early. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaird said his review of Kansas City police investigation files  
showed there was no basis for a criminal charge of involuntary 
manslaughter against the rigging coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's widow and children filed a wrongful death lawsuit in June  
against the WWF, the city and 11 others they believe are 
responsible for Hart's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Hart said she was ``outraged and repulsed'' that the WWF  
continued the show after her husband's dead body was removed from 
the ring before 17,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends that the device that the 230-pound Hart  
wore the night of the accident was grossly inadequate for the 
stunt.

<HEADLINE> Rhymes Hit With Paternity Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Trevor George Smith, better known as rap  
star Busta Rhymes, has been sued by a woman who claims he is the 
father of her child. 
</P>
<P>
	Jill Miskelly, 25, filed the paternity suit earlier this month.  
</P>
<P>
	She claims the child, Mariah Elizabeth Miskelly, is Smith's, the  
result of a night they spent together in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A paternity test showed that the chances are 99.996 percent that  
Smith is Mariah's father. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Smith started voluntarily making child support  
payments of $1,250 a month, but Miskelly's attorney said that was 
not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina law typically calls for child support to be set  
in proportion to a parent's income.

<HEADLINE>  Titans To Turn Kearse Loose on QBs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The first time a college teammate saw a  
shirtless Jevon Kearse stretch out his arms, he thought of a 
pterodactyl. 
</P>
<P>
	Taunted by an assistant coach during a Tennessee Titans minicamp  
drill, Kearse easily outraced his fellow defensive linemen and 
scooped up not just one, but all three cones with one hand. His 
speed left coaches nearly speechless. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-round draftee nicknamed ``The Freak'' for his physical  
abilities is being counted on by the Titans to play just one 
position quick enough to revive a dormant pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will get the job done,'' he promises.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he picks it up real quick to help out his coach,'' said  
Jim Washburn, hired as the Titans' new defensive line coach in the 
offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 Kearse, who has 4 percent body fat on his 265-pound  
frame, had 16 1/2 sacks in three seasons at Florida, including 7 1/2 in 
1998, splitting time between outside linebacker and end. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee drafted Kearse with the 16th pick in April convinced  
that he can gain about 10 pounds and still retain his speed. Coach 
Jeff Fisher has slotted him at left end, planning to turn him loose 
on opposing quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans desperately need someone to pile up some sacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Only Chicago and Cincinnati had fewer sacks than Tennessee's 30  
in 1998. Kenny Holmes, the team's No. 1 pick in 1997, has yet to 
pile up the sacks expected of him. In two seasons, he has 9 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans also feature some new tackles in veterans Jason Fisk  
and Mike Jones and rookie John Thornton in an attempt to stiffen 
the pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
	But it all starts with Kearse, who now is working in training  
camp learning how to play on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's never really rushed the passer a great deal,'' Washburn  
said. ``You can see him go through a thought process instead of 
just reacting. It's a pretty drastic change from stand-up 
linebacker to a guy down over 300-pounders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kearse hasn't had to think much up until now. He earned his  
nickname at Florida when coaches quickly realized he was too quick 
and big to play safety and switched him to linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	That was where he picked up his nickname due to an 86-inch arm  
span and hands that stretch 12 inches from thumb to pinkie. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got arms as wide as a pterodactyl and hands as big as  
Andre the Giant,'' said offensive lineman Zach Piller, a teammate 
both at Florida and now with the Titans. ``I've seen him vertical 
jump 40 1/2 inches and run a 4.40 on grass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To play every down, Kearse also must improve his defense against  
the run. Washburn isn't too worried after seeing him do something 
in that pursuit drill he hadn't seen in his 23 seasons as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was phenomenal to see a big guy run that fast. But what  
we've got to do is translate all that good athletic ability and 
speed into playing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Kearse is eager to learn and is ready for the  
pressure being heaped on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it. I love to have people depend on me,'' Kearse said.

<HEADLINE> Jets Surrounded by Optimism, Urgency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- After coming within one bad quarter of  
the Super Bowl last season, the New York Jets opened training camp 
Friday hoping they'll take the next step in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets began two-a-day practices in the sweltering heat at  
Hofstra University, their first time on the field since the Denver 
Broncos erased New York's 10-0 lead with 20 straight third-quarter 
points en route to a 23-10 victory in the AFC Championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jets coach Bill Parcells hopes his players focus on the  
accomplishments of last season's 12-4 campaign as they open camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``To go down the stretch like we did last season, that matures  
your team,'' Parcells said of the Jets' five-game winning streak to 
end the regular season, that included wins at Miami and Buffalo. 
``If there's one thing we can carry over from last season, that 
would be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Parcells was all business on the first day, reminding  
his team about their much tougher schedule, warning veterans that 
they still had a lot to prove and even cutting a player, 
second-year defensive end Terry Day, after he arrived at camp out 
of shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first month of the season is pretty important,'' said  
Parcells of the schedule that has the Jets facing New England, 
Buffalo, Washington, Denver and Jacksonville in their first five 
games. ``I told the team that I wouldn't put the whole season on 
it, but we're playing four playoff teams and we could dig a hole 
for ourselves real quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets' heightened optimism comes with heightened pressure.  
After adding safety Steve Atwater and tight end Eric Green in the 
offseason, and with the retirement of the Broncos' John Elway, New 
York is a favorite to emerge from the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
	But Parcells made it clear that every player needs to be focused  
on winning jobs and not the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to see something from everyone,'' he said. ``At some  
point during training camp, if you're a veteran, you need to show 
me you can still do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One potential headache for Parcells are the legal difficulties  
of offensive tackles Jumbo Elliott and Jason Fabini, who were 
arrested along with Cincinnati lineman Matt O'Dwyer after a bar 
fight on Long Island three weeks ago. Elliott and Fabini were 
charged with several misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't condone it, and depending on what happens with the  
judicial system, we'll take our own action, but I'm going to let 
this play out,'' Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott chose not to discuss the incident in depth.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worrying about it,'' Elliott said. ``I'm worrying  
about concentrating on football, and having a great year, and 
helping the team get into the playoffs. I think everybody feels bad 
about the whole thing. It's one of those things that happened, it 
was very fast, but I don't want to go into any detail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said he was encouraged by the Jets' depth at  
linebacker, and for a few hours, he even had a Hall of Fame 
linebacker in camp. Lawrence Taylor, who will be inducted into the 
Hall on Aug. 7 in Canton, Ohio, stopped by at the beginning of 
practice for a visit with his former Giants coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the greatest player I've ever coached,'' Parcells said.  
``I have a tremendous relationship with him and continue to do so. 
I know I wouldn't be here without guys like him and a few others. 
He's like one of my own children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Cox, competing for playing time at linebacker with a crowd  
that includes Mo Lewis, Marvin Jones, James Farrior, Chad Cascadden 
and Roman Phifer, said the Jets will be viewed differently by 
opponents this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we won last year, we have to understand that no one's  
going to hand us anything,'' Cox said. ``Now we're the hunted. 
Teams are going to come in saying this is the team we have to beat 
for the AFC Championship.''

<HEADLINE> Stephens Cut by Steelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- Offensive tackle Jamain Stephens reported to  
the Pittsburgh Steelers' training camp out of shape. Now he's out 
of work -- and, for now, star running back Jerome Bettis is out of 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after Stephens couldn't complete a series of 40-yard runs  
on a 94-degree day, the Steelers on Friday night cut the 1996 
first-round draft choice, who started 10 games at right tackle last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers also got a jolt when Bettis, who has rushed for  
more than 1,000 yards in each of the last three seasons, reported 
to camp with an undisclosed left knee injury. He was injured 10 
days ago while working with track coach Bob Kersee in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis is expected to be ready for the Sept. 12 opener against  
Cleveland, but the Steelers still placed him on the list for 
players with non-football related injuries. He will miss some 
practice time, but the Steelers are not yet certain how long he 
will be sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens may have been the first Steelers player of note to be  
cut on the first day of camp. Coach Bill Cowher clearly was 
disgusted when linebacker Levon Kirkland almost pleaded with 
Stephens to finish a series of 14 40-yard runs -- known as gassers -- 
that every other player completed. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, Cowher and director of football operations  
Tom Donahoe decided Stephens had to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were several factors involved in Jamain Stephens'  
release,'' Cowher said Friday night. ``It was obvious he lacked the 
commitment to compete in this camp. I had no choice but to release 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, Cowher sent the message that, coming off a 7-9  
season and a five-game losing streak, the Steelers cannot tolerate 
complacent players. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours before, with the on-field temperature at a steamy  
St. Vincent College practice field hitting 138 degrees, a visibly 
spent Stephens barely completed the series of dashes that were run 
a minute apart. 
</P>
<P>
	He jogged through several runs, then plopped down on a Gatorade  
cooler, his white T-shirt soaked with sweat. He wanted to skip his 
final few runs, but the other Steelers wouldn't leave the practice 
field until the 330-pound right tackle finished. 
</P>
<P>
	With Kirkland standing over him, yelling words of encouragement,  
the 1996 first-round draft pick finally struggled off his makeshift 
seat and ran -- it was more of a brisk walk -- one more 40-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of guys struggled, but we run as a team -- and die as  
a team,'' safety Lee Flowers said. ``You want guys you can rely on 
and who won't give up even if it's 110 degrees. That 7-9 team you 
saw last season? That wasn't us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers considered cutting Stephens before last month's  
minicamp to create some room under the salary cap, and Friday's 
performance hastened his departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly isn't where he was last year,'' Cowher said.  
``It's disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Stephens gone and former starter Justin Strzelczyk out for  
the season with an injured knee, Anthony Brown, rookie Kris Farris 
and Chris Conrad will compete at right tackle. Brown is a former 
Cincinnati Bengals backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher also was disappointed with first-round draft pick Troy  
Edwards, the former Louisiana Tech wide receiver who also appeared 
out of shape. By the end of his sprints, he was finishing 10 yards 
behind the other four players in his group.

<HEADLINE> First Lady More Excited About Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATH, N.Y. (AP) -- Prospective Senate candidate Hillary Rodham  
Clinton says she is ``more and more excited about the prospect'' of 
running and is ``very committed to following through on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming about as close as she's come to declaring her candidacy  
since forming her Senate exploratory committee on July 6, Mrs. 
Clinton said at a ``listening event'' at a Bath library Friday that 
she was ``having a very good time'' on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady scoffed at an editorial in Friday's Wall Street  
Journal predicting she would skip the race and perhaps find an 
easier job to win, such as head of the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm interested in pursuing this very exciting possibility of  
considering a run for the Senate from right here in New York and it 
is the only thing I'm interested in and I get more excited about it 
every day,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters after talking to local 
residents about their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only job I'm interested in right now and the only job  
that I'm pursuing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton refused to say flatly that she was in  
the race to stay and maintained that she wanted ``to spend more 
time listening to the people of New York'' before announcing her 
candidacy. But she also said she was ``very committed to following 
through on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls have shown Mrs. Clinton's once-hefty lead over her  
strongest potential Republican rival, New York City Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani, vanishing. She now either trails him or is running even 
in the polls with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton refused, as she has in the past, to directly attack  
Giuliani. Asked if she felt the mayor was taunting her by traveling 
to Arkansas this week to dramatize the fact that she's never lived 
or worked in New York, she said she was ``not going to comment on 
anyone else's campaign tactics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wading into a controversial area for politicians, the first lady  
did say that while sexual abstinence must be stressed in combatting 
teen pregnancies, especially among young teen-agers, ``we should 
also answer children's questions honestly'' about contraception and 
other issues involving sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost tragic that we have to think about this in terms  
of very young teen-agers, but the fact is whether we like it or 
not, we do,'' she said. ``We have very young teen-agers who are 
often taken advantage of by older boys or men, who don't know how 
to protect themselves, who don't know how to fend off those 
advances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is on a summer-long ``listening tour'' of New York  
as she considers running for the Senate seat being vacated next 
year by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	She was winding up her latest foray into New York with a  
discussion of farm issues at Cornell University in Ithaca. She 
returns to the state next week for visits to Jamestown, the 
Buffalo-Niagara Falls area and Rochester.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Women Hoopsters Beat Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Only the outcome brought any  
satisfaction for the U.S. women's basketball team in its Pan 
American Games opener. 
</P>
<P>
	In a game long on effort but short on style, reserves Amy Herrig  
and Michelle Marciniak gave Team USA the lift it needed to get past 
Argentina 63-55 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just OK,'' said Marciniak, a former Tennessee standout.  
``It was by no means acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The young Americans, most of whom have little international  
experience, shot only 39 percent and committed 24 turnovers. They 
trailed by a point at halftime and led by only three midway through 
the second half before finally grinding down the Argentines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just not playing good basketball right now,'' said coach  
Nell Fortner, who had just 13 days to get her team ready and 
substituted constantly trying to find the right combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to start executing better, we've got to play smarter  
defense,'' she said. ``I think we will, but we've got to start 
doing it soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herrig made 11 of 12 free throws while scoring 15 points and  
grabbing nine rebounds. Marciniak scored 13 points and made her 
presence felt early. Entering the game at 15:46 of the first half, 
Marciniak twice grabbed a rebound and drove the length of the court 
for baskets to inject some life into a struggling offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of pent-up energy,'' Marciniak said. ``I get  
really anxious sitting on the bench, so when I get in there, I want 
to make something happen. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's 
bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Far more satisfied with their effort were the American men in  
water polo. By beating Cuba 11-7, they earned the only available 
berth in the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Humbert of Lodi, Calif., playing with a fever of 101,  
scored five goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week hasn't been a lot of fun. We had to quarantine all  
the sick guys,'' Humbert said. ``We've had a lot of coughing, nasal 
congestion and headaches. We've come through some adversity and 
this feels good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada beat the U.S. women 8-6 for the gold medal, building a  
3-0 lead and holding on. It was the third straight loss to Canada 
for the Americans. Waneek Horn-Miller scored a hat trick for the 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	Michele Smith had a perfect game into the seventh inning for the  
U.S. women's softball team. But she couldn't match teammate 
Danielle Henderson's perfecto of Thursday, yielding a hit to the 
Netherlands Antilles in a 5-0 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Things were bad at the track, on the hockey field and on the  
volleyball court for the United States. Still, the United States 
lengthened its lead in the medals count. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans have 62 golds, 59 silvers and 38 bronzes for 159  
overall. Canada is at 28-29-38 for 95, with Cuba at 32-27-28 for 
87. 
</P>
<P>
	No American won on the final night of track and field, while  
Cubans took five of the 10 events. High jumper Javier Sotomayor won 
his fourth Pan Ams gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spectacular ... fantastic,'' Sotomayor said. ``This is  
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so great were U.S. relay teams, which were blanked. Jamaica  
had the year's fastest time in the men's 1,600 and women's 400 
relays. 
</P>
<P>
	When Argentina's men beat the United States 4-1 in field hockey,  
it ended any chances of the Americans qualifying for the Olympics. 
And there'll be no medal for the men's volleyball team, which was 
knocked out when it lost to Venezuela 25-21, 28-26, 25-22. The U.S. 
women could win a bronze, but their shot at gold ended with a 
three-set sweep by Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Things went better in the ring on the opening night of boxing.  
</P>
<P>
	Flyweight Jose Navarro of Los Angeles started off with a 14-4  
decision over Carlos Valcarcel of Puerto Rico in the new format of 
four two-minute rounds. Welterweight LeChaunce Shepherd of 
Milwaukee, Wis., dominated Isaac Caballero of Nicaragua, stopping 
him in the first round. Caballero received three standing-8 counts 
to end the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first bout is always the hardest,'' Shepherd said. ``I was  
a little anxious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans did win the premier rowing event, the men's eight with  
cox. The U.S. team took control at 500 meters and won by nearly 
three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a big move about three minutes into the race and that  
sealed it,'' said Nick Anderson of Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	An official from the International Baseball Association told  
several reporters that two Cuban baseball players had defected. But 
Canadian immigration officials and sources close to the Cuban team 
said the official was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball continues Saturday with the quarterfinals. The United  
States plays Panama and needs to win that game and its semifinal 
match to secure a berth in the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The other baseball quarterfinals are Canada vs. Guatemala, Cuba  
vs. the Dominican Republic, and Nigaragua vs. Mexico.

<HEADLINE> `Scared Straight!' Is Remade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOODBRIDGE, N.J. (AP) -- Kevin Stout came to East Jersey State  
prison 22 years ago. Convicted murderers spit profanities in his 
face, pushed him around and told him never to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, you couldn't have told me nothing,'' said Stout,  
who was 15 when he became one of the earliest participants in the 
Lifers' Program, which, first documented in the film ``Scared 
Straight!,'' is meant to keep juvenile delinquents like him out of 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He came back to the same prison three years later, a murderer  
and robber, in for life. For years, he kept away from the Lifers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he woke up one day and thought, ``I don't want anybody to  
be like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stout, 37, is one of a new group of Lifers who appear in  
``Scared Straight! '99,'' an MTV remake of the gritty documentary 
that shocked the world in 1979 with convicts' expletive-filled, 
intimidating tirades about life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	This ``Scared Straight!,'' which airs Sunday at 10 p.m. EDT, has  
a new cast of prisoners (those from 1979 are either dead, released 
or transferred), new delinquents, and, since this is MTV, a rock 
soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV recruited Arnold Shapiro to make the sequel for an ongoing  
anti-violence campaign. Shapiro, who produced the original film, 
won an Academy Award for best documentary as well as an Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hesitant at first to take on the new project, worried  
about confusion with another ``Scared Straight!'' film he produced 
for UPN that aired in April. 
</P>
<P>
	But he realized he could reach a generation too young to  
remember the original film, while re-creating the tense 
confrontation between young criminals and the hardened convicts who 
want to stop them before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is this great television, but it's great sociology,''  
Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	History appears to repeat itself for much of ``Scared Straight!  
'99.'' Twelve boys, ages 12 to 17, walk in cocky and walk out 
shaking, vowing never to return after convicts scream about prison 
rape, filth and lack of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see the stars at night. I ain't seen the stars in 20  
years,'' one prisoner screams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will eat you alive,'' warned ``Crazy Chris, the Nightmare  
Man,'' who is serving a double life sentence for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	But while they are younger -- the youngest delinquent in the 1979  
film was 15 -- these kids seem a bit tougher. Not one shed a tear. 
</P>
<P>
	And the inmates are louder, a bit over-the-top and, if possible,  
more profane than in 1979. (MTV plans to air the expletives uncut, 
with warnings.) 
</P>
<P>
	When a bald, muscular inmate grabs the smallest 12-year-old in  
the group and screams, ``Look at me, little boy. What ... you doing 
in my house today?'', it's powerful. But not as powerful as an 
inmate who brought a kid to tears in 1979 by quietly, methodically 
explaining how he'd like to rip out one of his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50,000 youths have come through ``Scared Straight!'' since  
it was founded 23 years ago. Officials say they can't track success 
rates because juvenile crime records are confidential. Shapiro 
found that 15 of his original 17 delinquents from 1979 stayed 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1999 film, 10 out of 12 stayed clear of arrests for three  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	But some criminologists say the program doesn't work. Rutgers  
University's Jim Finckenauer conducted a study that showed that 
some delinquents reoffend at a higher rate after going through 
``Scared Straight!'' The inmates' brash performances may actually 
encourage some of the youths, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message, verbally, to them is don't be like me,''  
Finckenauer said. ``But at the same time there's this undercurrent 
of here's a guy who really got his act together, knows who he is, 
tough guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Youths who participated in MTV's special said the two-hour visit  
changed them. 
</P>
<P>
	A counselor took Brian Potanovic, 17, of Yonkers, N.Y., to  
prison after he was arrested for graffiti vandalism. Asked on film 
what he would do if he knew he wouldn't get caught, Potanovic said, 
``Kill everyone I had a beef with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a screening of the film at the prison earlier this month,  
Potanovic appeared chastened, smiling for cameras and politely 
fielding questions from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a bad kid,'' he said, ``and I don't intend coming back  
here anytime soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one of the boys who was rearrested after three months for  
assault had carved the initials S.U.K. into his arm, which he said 
stood for Serious Untouchable Killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way I am,'' said Melvin, 14. ``They can't change  
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	LIVE `DREW': This November, ``The Drew Carey Show'' will  
continue its nontraditional tradition with a live, partly 
unscripted storyline calling for the cast to play improvisational 
games. Airing on ABC Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. EDT, the show will be 
performed three times, once for each time zone (Eastern/Central, 
Mountain and Pacific). The series has featured innovative elements 
before, including elaborate dance numbers, April Fool's contests, a 
guest-starring appearance by Daffy Duck and an episode filmed in 
mainland China.

<HEADLINE> Gore Offers Plan for Cutting Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the middle of this summer's tax-cut fight,  
Vice President Al Gore looks ahead to next summer's campaign and 
today proposes new -- but narrow -- tax breaks for the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in Minnesota, Gore called the Republicans' broader  
tax cuts ``kind of crazy.'' He promised to outline, in a morning 
speech at the Minneapolis Community &AMP; Technical College, his own 
plan for targeted tax breaks to help middle-class Americans pay for 
long-term health care, adult education and retirement savings. 
</P>
<P>
	By arguing for narrow tax relief over the $792 billion GOP  
package rolling through Congress this week, Gore hopes to lock 
himself into a debate with Republican front-runner George W. Bush 
without offering any plan so deviant from President Clinton's 
policies that it would alter the current course of economic 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president welcomes a compare-and-contrast with the  
Republicans, including the presidential candidates,'' said Gore 
spokesman Chris Lehane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their economic policies reflect an apparent desire to go back  
to the failed economic policies of the late 1980s, early 1990s and 
the previous Republican administrations'' of Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush, Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending most of Thursday evening at fund-raisers, Gore  
and his aides scrambled over night to put the finishing touches on 
his tax-cut plan, described as the first installment of an economic 
platform that will be rolled out piece by piece over the coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a  
Washington think tank allied with Clinton, said Gore's tax plan was 
designed to hold together the coalition that twice elected Clinton 
-- middle-class suburbanites plus the Democratic party's traditional 
urban base. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Gore campaign clearly wants to start setting the terms of  
the policy debate after several weeks of unflattering stories of 
disarray within the campaign,'' Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign took a poke at Bush and Bill Bradley, the vice  
president's only rival for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to having substantive dialogues and  
discussions on the issues with anyone who is going to put forward 
ideas,'' said Lehane. ``If you're going to run for president, your 
vision should be a predicate, not an afterthought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Bradley adviser Anita Dunn replied that the former New  
Jersey senator would not be rushed or pressured into outlining his 
own tax policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not been running a campaign that makes its plans in  
reaction to what the vice president's camp does,'' said Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	Through 18 years in the Senate, and as a chief architect of the  
1986 tax overhaul, Bradley has stood for ``the lowest possible rate 
for the most American workers, with the fewest loopholes and the 
least amount of corporate welfare and special-interest tax breaks 
in the code,'' Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan-based Republican pollster Bob Teeter said it made no  
sense -- especially this early in the 2000 campaign -- for Gore to 
put out a tax-cut plan right when the White House is waging a tax 
battle with congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sounds to me like Gore, who's behind and losing some  
ground to Bradley, is lunging around for a strategy,'' said Teeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax cuts is a Republican issue that would naturally be won by  
Bush, Teeter added. 
</P>
<P>
	But surveys show that voters, with the economy healthy, are not  
as interested in tax cuts as improving education and health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Carrick, a California-based Democratic consultant, said  
Gore's early pro-tax-cut talk could still buttress his record 
against charges in next year's general election that he is a 
tax-and-spend liberal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he's doing is more an immunization thing rather than a  
real opportunity for voters to rally around the cause of this 
particular collection of tax cuts,'' Carrick said.

<HEADLINE> Interbrew To Get S. Korean Brewery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A South Korean joint venture of  
Belgian brewing giant Interbrew won the court auction Friday of the 
country's ailing Jinro-Coors Brewery Co. for $378.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction ended a battle between Interbrew and Adolph Coors  
Co. of the United States to take over Jinro-Coors, which controls 
20 percent of South Korea's beer market, valued at about $2 billion 
in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Interbrew's South Korean joint venture, Oriental Brewery Co.,  
now will begin discussing details of the takeover with creditor 
banks of Jinro-Coors and likely will sign an agreement next week, 
court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Adolph Coors filed for a court injunction  
against Friday's auction, accusing Oriental Brewery of violating 
auction rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The court rejected the charge Thursday and called the auction as  
planned on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oriental Brewery, South Korea's largest brewery, was the sole  
bidder in Friday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Jinro-Coors started out in 1992 as a joint venture between  
Adolph Coors and Jinro, South Korea's 22nd largest conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jinro went bankrupt in 1997, Adolph Coors sold its stake  
to Jinro and then tried to take over the whole brewery, which now 
runs under court receivership.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Down 3 / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and  
natural gas in the United States fell this week by three to 602. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running nationwide, 102 were exploring for oil, 498  
for gas and two for miscellaneous purposes, Houston-based Baker 
Hughes Inc. reported Friday. During the same week last year, 822 
rigs were operating in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally  
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil 
boom, but has set several record lows this year, bottoming out at 
498 on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Louisiana and New  
Mexico each gained one rig and there was no change in California 
and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas lost four rigs and Alaska and Wyoming lost one each.

<HEADLINE> All-Tech a Large Day-Trading Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	All-Tech Investment Group Inc., where Mark O. Barton bought and  
sold stocks, is one of the largest companies in the country for day 
traders, investors who attempt to cash in on daily market swings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company based in Montvale, N.J., has 1,500 active trading  
accounts and 22 offices in 15 states. It was formed from an earlier 
company in 1988 as day trading was in its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Houtkin, who joined All-Tech in 1991 and has been the  
chairman and chief executive since 1993, calls himself ``father of 
electronic day trading'' and spreads his message through books and 
seminars. 
</P>
<P>
	Day traders buy and sell stocks, bonds or other securities on a  
moment-to-moment basis, usually using computer terminals linked to 
vast trading networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most investors who hold stocks for the long term, day  
traders try to capitalize on the daily ups and downs of the market, 
using rapid-fire buying and selling. 
</P>
<P>
	At All-Tech, each day trader puts up at least $50,000 in equity  
to open an account, and most paid $5,000 to attend All-Tech's 
30-day training course. 
</P>
<P>
	They trade with their own money and all pay a commission of  
about $25 per 1,000-share trade, or $50 to buy or sell the same 
shares. For instance, someone who buys 1,000 shares for $141.50, 
then sells them at $141.75, would net $200 after commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's also easy to lose money as a day trader. All-Tech  
employs a corporate psychotherapist to help traders deal with the 
daily stresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Barton talked about market dips Thursday during a  
shooting spree that left 12 people dead in the Atlanta area. He 
later killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site for All-Tech carries this statement: ``Warning:  
Active electronic stock trading is risky. Participants should be 
aware of, and capable of assuming the inherent risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech has run afoul of regulators in at least one state for  
allegedly making inflated promises of quick and easy riches. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the company agreed to pay $278,000 to the Massachusetts  
Investor Protection Fund and investors to settle claims that it 
used deceptive advertising and made unauthorized transfers of 
customers' funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Nestor, director of the Massachusetts Securities  
Division, said regulators began investigating the company because 
of its ads and literature. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were really concerned that a rosy scenario was being  
created when in fact the vast majority of day traders lose money,'' 
he said. ``Day trading is speculation; it's not investing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, the company is prohibited for two  
years from having a branch office in Massachusetts and soliciting 
customers from Massachusetts, said Nestor. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, the parent  
company of the Nasdaq Stock Market, approved a rule Thursday 
requiring firms that promote day-trading strategies to disclose to 
customers -- before they open accounts -- the risks associated with 
that type of trading. The risks include the loss of their entire 
investment. Those using borrowed money to trade could lose that as 
well, the ruling said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Upsets Cuba in Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- One day after a stirring victory over  
Cuba, the U.S. baseball team came out as flat as the prairie roads 
leading to the host city of the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	When they took the field against Brazil on Thursday night, the  
Americans already knew Canada had beaten Cuba 8-1, clinching the 
second seed in Pool A for the United States. Canada won the group, 
and world champion Cuba was third. 
</P>
<P>
	``We basically threw our hats out there today. We were flat and  
we knew it. We got to rebound and get ready for whoever we play 
next,'' American reliever Bobby Seay said after saving a 3-2 
victory over winless Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Pool play is now over, and it's single elimination time  
beginning Saturday with the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States needs victories Saturday over Panama and  
Sunday to make the gold medal game and qualify for the Sydney 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very emotional game yesterday,'' U.S. coach Buddy  
Bell said, looking back at a 10-5 victory over Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just got done playing Brazil, who some would argue is not  
the strongest team in the tournament. But again, it's just like 
hockey. You go up against a hot goalie you will have a tough 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil reliever Toni Nakashima was especially bothersome to U.S.  
hitters, giving up just two hits in 3 2-3 innings. The Americans, 
who had 19 hits in beating Cuba, managed only five overall. They 
scored the go-ahead run on Mike Neill's bases-loaded fielder's 
choice in the fifth on a double-play ball bobbled by the shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	``The left-hander they brought in was as good a pitcher as we've  
faced this whole tournament as far as command and mixing pitches. 
It's what you have to guard against,'' Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's victory over Cuba means the Americans will not have to  
play the Canadians or Cubans before Monday's finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They looked like they didn't want to be here,'' Canadian  
catcher Andy Stewart said of the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	Seay came on in the eighth with runners at second and third and  
struck out pinch-hitter T.N. Kussano, and then fanned two of three 
in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Hardtke homered for the United States in the first, but  
Brazil took a 2-1 lead in the second using a third-strike wild 
pitch, a throwing error by Neill and an RBI single by Victor 
Higuchi. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States tied the game in the bottom half when Brazil  
starter Douglas Assada fumbled a comebacker, allowing Neill to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil almost went ahead in the eighth, but Estevao Sato's long  
drive hit the top of the left field fence for a double instead of 
going over. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil finished 0-4 and is the only team in the nine-team  
tournament not headed for the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. starter Ryan Anderson, who at 6-foot-10 is known as the  
``Little Unit,'' struck out nine in six innings Thursday night in a 
game played in Stonewall, some 20 miles outside of Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Canada beat Cuba in baseball was at the  
Intercontinental Cup in Edmonton in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a rugged game at times, with Canada's Aaron Guiel  
flattening Cuban catcher Ariel Pestano twice and getting ejected. 
Guiel made no attempt to slide and appeared to deliver a forearm 
shiver to Pestano in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Players from both teams converged at home plate, but Guiel and  
Pestano were separated and no punches were thrown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was angry,'' Guiel said. ``I decided I was going to try and  
take a guy out on the infield or the catcher. I had to show them we 
would stand up for ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> Trail of Violence Leads to an End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Clutching his handguns, the man in the khaki  
shorts bolted from the cool lobby of the tinted-glass office 
building into a blast of Georgia summer heat. He headed for his 
minivan and made sure to fasten his seatbelt. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed his vehicle toward Interstate 75, merging into the  
traffic of metropolitan Atlanta rush-hour commuters listening with 
growing horror to radio reports of his bloody rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton, a chemist turned day-trader, was no stranger to  
violence. Six years earlier, his first wife and mother-in-law had 
been bludgeoned to death in a camper. At this very moment, his 
second wife and his two children were lying dead in nearby 
Stockbridge, their bodies still undiscovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind him, at the shiny office complex called Securities  
Centre, nine people were dead, a dozen more were wounded, and walls 
were splattered with blood. By nightfall, Barton would himself be 
dead, slumped over his steering wheel in the parking lot of a BP 
gas station. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	At least one person saw signs of trouble on Tuesday, when Barton  
picked up her grandson for a Boy Scout meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something's weird about this man,'' Marsha Jean DeFreese  
remembers thinking when the 44-year-old Barton, a troop leader, 
came to pick up her grandson Brian, who was friends with Barton's 
11-year-old son Matthew. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. DeFreese had lived near the family last year in the Atlanta  
suburb of Morrow, before Barton split with his second wife, Leigh 
Ann. Mrs. Barton had moved to a Stockbridge apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, Mrs. DeFreese recalled, Barton would not return with  
the boys until 11 p.m., which she thought was strange. She chalked 
it up to their closeness. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was hard to tell. Nearly six years ago, Barton's  
father-in-law, Bill Spivey, had considered Barton ``the perfect 
son-in-law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the bodies of his daughter and wife -- Barton's previous  
wife, Debra, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey -- were found 
bludgeoned in a camper on an Alabama lake over Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton was the main suspect at the time. No arrest was ever  
made. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Around 3 p.m. on Thursday, Barton walked into the Momentum  
Securities brokerage office in the seven-story Securities Centre 
building in Atlanta's upscale Buckhead neighborhood. Armed with 9 
mm and .45-caliber handguns, he started shooting with both hands. 
People huddled beneath desks, but four of his initial shots killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton then walked east across the six lanes of Piedmont Road  
and began shooting in the office of the All-Tech Investment Group, 
a stock trading firm in the Piedmont Center building where Barton 
had been a client. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he left, five more people were dead. Some workers threw a  
computer through a window, trying to escape. Others ran out; many 
remained holed up inside, waiting to be evacuated by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting outside one door was Nell Jones, an attorney. ``He was  
... very calm and determined, no feelings,'' she said. He pointed a 
gun at her and pulled the trigger at point-blank range. The bullet 
whizzed by her head. 
</P>
<P>
	Joette Castronova, 27, was one of the first paramedics at the  
scene. She quickly found herself holed up in an office with a 
24-year-old man who had been shot. ``He was in a lot of pain. I 
just rubbed his head and told him he was going to be OK,'' Ms. 
Castronova said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, Atlanta police set up police lines and started an  
office-by-office, floor-by-floor search. Helicopters took to the 
air as the manhunt was broadcast live on national TV. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barton was long gone.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Miles south, the manager of the Bristol Green apartment complex  
in Stockbridge was thinking about the strangely quiet apartment 
unit in building 1300. The rent was late, and he wondered what was 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	He called Henry County Police at 3:23 p.m., less than 30 minutes  
after the shooting started in Atlanta, and let an officer in. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing one body, the officer called for backup.  
</P>
<P>
	Both 11-year-old Matthew and 7-year-old Mychelle Elizabeth were  
dead, apparently from blows to the head. They lay in their beds, 
all but their faces covered. A handwritten note rested by each 
child's body. 
</P>
<P>
	Their stepmother also was dead, stuffed in a closet and  
similarly covered, with another scribbled note. In the living room 
was a longer letter, this one apparently typed out on the computer 
Barton so loved. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, meanwhile, was across the city, heading north.  
</P>
<P>
	Stopping at the Town Center Mall in Atlanta's northwest suburbs,  
he approached a woman in the parking lot and tried to take her 
vehicle, threatening to shoot her if she screamed. She ran and 
contacted mall security. 
</P>
<P>
	Police pursued Barton's dark green Ford Aerostar up Interstate  
75. About five miles from the mall, Barton pulled off into the BP 
station near a car wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were directly behind his minivan, surrounding Barton with  
guns drawn. Barton remained inside, still armed. 
</P>
<P>
	He put both guns to his head -- one behind each ear -- and fired,  
said Acworth police officer Steve Eidson. Moments later, he was 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad one of our officers didn't have to shoot him,''  
said Acworth Police Officer Mark Camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the lushly landscaped Securities Centre, evacuated  
office workers watched from police lines. Some huddled under nearby 
trees; others made their way across the street to El Azteca, a 
Mexican restaurant, where they ate dinner, sipped drinks and 
watched the investigation unfold. 
</P>
<P>
	``To think that when I woke up this morning, I thought that it  
was going to be a normal workday,'' said Tiombe Holland, 23, who 
works for a health services company one floor above some of the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in a matter of hours, a forthcoming Mayor  
Bill Campbell calmly related what he knew, what he didn't, how he 
felt. ``Pray for our city,'' Campbell implored on national 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours after the suicide, Barton's body was still at the gas  
station, still in his van, the driver's side door open. Nearby, a 
crowd of several dozen gawkers jostled to get a look. 
</P>
<P>
	Some explained why they were there. They wanted to get a glimpse  
of a mass murderer.

	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- One person was fatally shot Friday and  
another person wounded at a trucking terminal when an employee 
entered the building, fired at a colleague and then turned the gun 
on himself, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't immediately clear which employee was killed at Watkins

<HEADLINE> House Cuts Funds for Army School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House moved early today to cut funding for  
the Army school that has been criticized for human rights abuses 
committed in Latin American by some of its graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	The 230-197 vote during debate on the fiscal 2000 foreign  
operations spending bill marked the first congressional setback for 
the school since religious activists launched a campaign to close 
it a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The school, located at Fort Benning near Columbus, Ga., had  
survived four previous House votes since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The House action, which will be an issue for a conference with  
the Senate on the foreign operations bill, would eliminate only 
about 10 percent of the $20 million in federal funds earmarked next 
year for the school. The rest of its funding comes from the 
Pentagon budget. 
</P>
<P>
	But the vote is a major victory for opponents who have argued  
for years that the school should be closed because its graduates 
include some of the worst murderers and human rights abusers in 
Latin American history. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these years of going to prison, fasting and protesting,  
it's been a long, hard struggle,'' said Father Roy Bourgeois, the 
Maryknoll priest who launched the campaign after graduates of the 
school were linked to the 1989 murders of six Jesuit priests and 
two women in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., who led the congressional  
investigation into those 1989 murders, sponsored the amendment 
Thursday night that led to the House vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't stand for human rights in Georgia, how can we  
possibly promote them elsewhere in the world?'' Moakley asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga., a longtime proponent of the school,  
argued that 12 investigations by Congress and the Pentagon over the 
past decade have disproved allegations that the school teaches 
torture and murder to its Latin American military students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who persist in accusing the school of criminal and evil  
conduct are turning their backs on the facts,'' said Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the foreign operations  
appropriations subcommittee, said he has sent investigators from 
his panel to Georgia four times to ensure that the school is not 
teaching terrorism tactics or promoting human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The school has cleaned up its act,'' said Callahan. ``The only  
thing we hear year after year are the atrocities committed by 
graduates of the school decades ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But congressional opponents argued that human rights abuses by  
the school's graduates are continuing even today, and that the 
institution is no longer needed now that the Cold War is over and 
most Latin American dictatorships have been replaced by 
democracies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This school is a blemish on the image of the United States  
among the people of Latin America,'' said Rep. Jim McGovern, 
D-Mass., who as an aide to Moakley a decade ago helped investigate 
the slayings of the Jesuit priests in El Salvador.

<HEADLINE> Day Trading a Volatile Profession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intense, volatile, and risky, day trading is a  
profession at the center of the stampeding bull market that's 
mesmerizing Americans -- sometimes at great financial and emotional 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-time day traders ride the tiniest ups and downs of the  
stock markets, squeezing profits by rapidly buying and selling 
shares via Internet links set up at rapidly growing day trading 
offices. Many have abandoned regular jobs to join the rush for 
market gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 5,000 in number, they make up an increasingly powerful  
force in the markets. Another 250,000 others, also caught up in the 
national pasttime of market watching, do the same from home full 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton, the day trader who shot and killed nine people  
at two brokerage firms in Atlanta on Thursday -- a day when the 
markets plunged -- traded at one of the firms where he opened fire. 
Barton, who killed his wife and two children before the rampage 
started, committed suicide later Thursday after police pulled over 
his van at a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
	Day trading certainly isn't a job for everyone as it requires  
strong nerves, an ability to make snap decisions and sometimes to 
take huge risks. 
</P>
<P>
	A trader might buy hundreds of shares of stocks, worth thousands  
of dollars, then sell them minutes later as the stock rises or 
falls, hoping to make a quick profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way this market is so volatile, it's just really  
stressful,'' said Nick Granko, an Oklahoma City day trader who quit 
selling used cars six months ago to try his hand at the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get emotionally attached to stocks. It takes a lot of  
nerve disengaging your emotions from trading,'' he said in a 
telephone interview. ``Cutting your losses is one of the main 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But because the game is so new and the spoils so seemingly  
endless, day trading is attracting many people unsuited for the 
game, traders say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, I feel most people who get involved in day  
trading don't understand the risk involved and don't fully 
anticipate the time it takes to achieve consistent success,'' said 
Robert J. Rak, moderator of a number of day-trading Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Granko said he's seen traders at his firm ``who have no business  
being in there. They don't know what they're doing. They're 
afraid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Amanat, an owner of the New York day trading firm  
Tradescape.com, has watched as his offices have grown from 25 
traders a year ago to 180 currently. He said Wednesday, before the 
shootings, that his firm also gets dozens of calls and e-mails from 
wannabe traders, many with little experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, dozens of traders in baseball caps and shorts pack  
into Tradescape's darkened rooms, their eyes glued to computer 
workspaces littered with empty soda cans and coffee cups. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just two years ago that stock market rules were changed  
giving greater freedom to small investors to do the kind of trading 
that professional brokers do. Also new are the electronic networks 
that day traders use. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, securities regulators have express concern that some  
day trading companies, which provide work space and training to 
would-be traders, could be misleading them about potential profits. 
Regulators have stepped up scrutiny of the firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Day trading is not as simple as it appears,'' said Ari Kiev, a  
psychiatrist and author of ``Trading to Win: The Psychology of 
Mastering the Markets,'' published in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is easy to get into it and all the ads for it make it seem  
like it is less expensive and so forth. But they don't really tell 
you how risky it is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings left five dead at the building that houses  
All-Tech Investment Group, a firm that recently paid $278,000 in 
Massachusetts to settle claims of deceptive advertising and making 
unauthorized transfers of customers' money. At the firm, day 
traders put up at least $50,000 in equity to open an account, and 
most pay another $5,000 to attend All-Tech's 30-day training 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Web site on Thursday said the job ``appeals to  
executives, victims of downsizing or lay-off, retirees, graduating 
college students and anyone who recognizes the unlimited earnings 
potential and quality of life which an Electronic Day Trader may 
achieve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firm also promoted the job as allowing ``people to work a 6 1/2  
hour trading day, to take vacations on demand and to leave for the 
day on a whim.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices are higher in early trading today.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up seven points. Advancers on

<HEADLINE> NTSB Finds JFK Jr. Plane Functional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The wreckage of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane  
showed no signs of in-flight breakup or fire, and the engine 
appeared to have been working when the aircraft plunged into the 
ocean, a federal safety panel said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board, releasing its first  
update in a week on its investigation of the July 16 crash that 
killed Kennedy, his wife and her sister, also said that Kennedy had 
received a weather forecast via the Internet for his flight from 
Fairfield, N.J., to Martha's Vineyard, Mass. The report, issued at 
6:30 p.m., or about two hours before takeoff, was for good 
visual-flight-rules conditions, with six to eight miles visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	No weather warnings were issued to pilots flying Kennedy's  
route, which took him over the Long Island Sound along the southern 
coast of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, pilots who had flown over Long Island Sound that  
evening reported after the accident that the in-flight visibility 
over the water was significantly reduced,'' the safety board's 
statement said. ``Interviews of those pilots will continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, the 38-year-old son of President Kennedy, his wife,  
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her 34-year-old sister Lauren 
Bessette, were flying in Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga 
when it crashed about 7 1/2 miles southwest of the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple had intended to drop off Miss Bessette on the island  
before flying to nearby Hyannis, Mass., for the wedding of 
Kennedy's cousin Rory, youngest child of the late Sen. Robert F. 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	After a five-day search, the bodies of the three victims were  
located in 116 feet of water, still strapped into their seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board, which is investigating the accident, said the  
USS Grasp recovered about 75 percent of the plane. Among the items 
were a primitive recording device, which was destroyed by the 
impact with the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage was handed over to investigators in Newport, R.I.,  
earlier this week and subsequently taken to a secure hangar at the 
Coast Guard Air Station on the grounds of the former Otis Air Force 
Base. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage included about 80 percent of the left wing, 60  
percent of the right wing, the engine and the propeller, as well as 
the cockpit instrument panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The propeller ``indicated the presence of rotational damage,''  
which would indicate it was still spinning when the plane crashed. 
Radar tapes show the plane plummeted into the water at a descent 
rate of perhaps greater than 5,000 feet per minute at about 9:40 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The engine was sent to Williamsport, Pa., for examination by its  
manufacturer, Textron Lycoming, while the propeller was transferred 
to a facility near Dayton, Ohio, for examination by Hartzell 
Propeller. Both inspections were conducted under supervision of the 
safety board, as is standard practice. The parts have since been 
returned to Cape Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	``No evidence was found during the examinations of conditions  
that would have prevented either the engine or the propeller from 
operating,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said the aircraft's Global Positioning System unit and  
selected cockpit instruments will be sent to its lab in Washington 
for examination. The radios, meanwhile, have been hand-carried to 
their manufacturer, Allied Signal, in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said investigators have learned that Kennedy had  
about 300 hours of flying experience, not including his time in the 
Saratoga, which he bought in April. Kennedy received his pilot's 
license in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB has said it hopes to complete its investigation in six  
to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Coast  
Guard Commandant Adm. James M. Loy today paid tribute to those who 
``stretched themselves to their limits'' in the search for the 
Kennedy plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from more than a dozen federal, state and local  
police and rescue agencies accepted commendations for their efforts 
in a ceremony at a Coast Guard command center in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater defended the massive and costly search mission for the  
three civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president made it clear we should have done what we did --  
go the extra miles for a family who has suffered so much and 
contributed so much,'' Slater said.

<HEADLINE> Trade Figure Gave to NRCC, DNC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several recent big donors to the Democrats and  
Republicans are watching the current congressional session closely: 
They have high interest in legislation under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	A case in point: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which helped lead  
the successful fight in the House earlier this week to approve 
normal trade relations with China. The chamber contributed $37,500 
to the National Republican Congressional Committee during the first 
six months of 1999, according to Federal Election Commission 
records released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, the nation's leading supporter  
of gun owners' rights, gave $64,000 to the NRCC. The 
Republican-controlled House earlier this year defeated efforts to 
expand requirements for background checks of weapons purchasers at 
gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bernard Schwartz, chairman of Loral Corp., contributed  
$95,000 to the Democratic National Committee. In May, a 
congressional committee reported that Loral and another U.S. 
satellite manufacturer, and Hughes Electronics, provided China with 
information that could help make China's nuclear missiles more 
reliable. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest giver to both the House Republicans and the DNC  
during the first six months of 1999 was Carl Lindner, whose 
Chiquita brand bananas are at the center of a trade dispute between 
the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner and his American Financial Corp. contributed $375,000 to  
the National Republican Congressional Committee and $250,000 to the 
DNC. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials have been fighting for years  
against European Union rules they say unfairly discriminate against 
bananas grown in Latin America by Lindner's Chiquita Brands 
International and Dole Food Co. In April, the World Trade 
Organization supported the U.S. position and authorized $191 
million in tariffs on European goods in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats are divided on the issue. In the House, some  
Democrats have introduced legislation that would stop the United 
States from imposing tariffs on European products as part of the 
fight. Their bill, introduced in March, has gone nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Democratic National Committee reported raising  
$24.5 million, including $9.7 million in soft money, in the first 
six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the Republican Party's best attempts to bankrupt the  
DNC through dozens of partisan, taxpayer-funded investigations, the 
Democratic Party is in strong financial shape,'' Democratic 
National Chairman Joe Andrew said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee reported raising $30 million,  
with $8 million in ``soft money'' -- unregulated contributions from 
corporations, labor unions and individuals that do not fall under 
federal limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fund-raising success is a sure sign that Republicans are  
energized and excited about our ideas and candidates,'' Republican 
National Chairman Jim Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRCC reported raising nearly $28 million through June 30,  
$9.8 million of it in soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, meanwhile,  
raised $17 million, including $9 million in soft money.

<HEADLINE> Denver Owner Was Accused by SEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The new owner of the Denver Nuggets and the  
Colorado Avalanche was involved in an insider stock trading 
allegation more than a decade ago, according to Security and 
Exchange Commission documents. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Donald L.  
Sturm allegedly violated its anti-fraud provisions by helping a 
friend engage in insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm's lawyer, Paul Jacobs, said the now-billionaire banker did  
nothing wrong and that the action will have no effect on Sturm's 
ability to purchase the basketball and hockey teams and the new 
Pepsi Center arena. 
</P>
<P>
	A group headed by Sturm purchased the Avalanche, the Nuggets and  
the Pepsi Center from Ascent Entertainment Group for $461 million 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Hockey League and the National Basketball  
Association have 30 to 60 days to approve the offer, said Ascent 
spokesman Kasmah Kremmel, adding that he did not anticipate any 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, who was a banker and an executive of the Kiewit Co. in  
Omaha in 1988, neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations at 
the time. But he agreed to pay back $128,412 in stock investment 
profits earned by an unidentified friend, plus $25,673 in interest, 
for a total of $154,085. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, then 56, also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $128,412,  
an amount equal to the investment profit, according to SEC 
documents filed July 11, 1988, in U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm was not available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Paul Jacobs, said the information had been disclosed  
to the professional hockey and basketball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an issue at all,'' he said. ``There was never an  
allegation that Don himself ever engaged in anything illegal. An 
employee of his did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident also was disclosed to Ascent, Jacobs said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ascent officials declined to comment. Officials from the NBA and  
NHL declined to specifically discuss the SEC situation.

<HEADLINE> Webb Missing at Dolphins Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- A contract stalemate kept Miami Dolphins  
tackle Richmond Webb from reporting to training camp Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, is unsigned and  
negotiating a long-term deal. He declined a one-year tender of 
$3.369 million when the Dolphins designated him their franchise 
player in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson was upbeat about Webb's absence.  
</P>
<P>
	``I understand,'' Johnson said. ``We've got a major contract  
here. We're working on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, 32, has been a starting tackle since his rookie season in  
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing on the first day of full-squad workouts was  
second-year receiver Oronde Gadsden, who has little leverage as an 
exclusive rights player. Gadsden, who sought a signing bonus above 
the minimum tender of $250,000 offered by the Dolphins, told 
Johnson he'll report Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents for Webb and Gadsden didn't return phone calls seeking  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Court Reporter Haunted by Nuremberg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When she was 21, Vivien Spitz embarked on a dark,  
two-year journey. Her destination: the Nuremberg trials of accused 
Nazi war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitz wasn't a lawyer, a victim or a relative of the millions  
killed under Adolf Hitler's regime. She was a court reporter whose 
job was to record the atrocities of the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a 75-year-old retiree, Spitz is still haunted.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have never really recovered from it,'' said the Aurora,  
Colo., resident, in Boston on Thursday to address the 100th 
anniversary meeting of the National Court Reporters Association. 
``It was a horrific experience. We had to write sometimes with 
tears in our eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Allies -- the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and France  
-- set up the international tribunal to bring Hitler's henchmen to 
account. More than 200 Nazi military leaders, diplomats, government 
officials, industrialists and doctors were tried. Many were sent to 
prison, a few were sentenced to death and some were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the 13 trials produced 330,000 pages of testimony.  
</P>
<P>
	Spitz was one of 26 American court reporters who went to Germany  
in 1946. She used pen and paper, while others used stenotype 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitz sat through nearly two years of wrenching testimony and  
graphic evidence, including scores of photographs and films 
depicting the dead and tortured. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most dramatic moments for Spitz was in June 1947, as  
prosecutors were presenting evidence of the Nazis' ``sea water 
experiments,'' conducted with the goal of finding a process to make 
the briny water potable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The victims were German, Czech and Polish gypsies deprived of  
food and given only sea water for weeks, which resulted in 
excruciating pain and foaming at the mouth and, in most cases, 
madness,'' Spitz recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	One witness was a survivor of the experiment who, when asked to  
identify his torturer, darted toward the defendants' section and 
leaped over a table, arms outstretched toward the German doctor. A 
guard later told Spitz authorities found a knife on the witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``This little man (was) futilely bent on delivering his own  
brand of justice,'' said Spitz, who is half German, adding that the 
victim was later sent to jail for three months for contempt of 
court ``after all of the torture he had already suffered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Nuremberg, Spitz met an Army policeman she would marry. Since  
divorced, they have two grown sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitz went on to serve as court reporter in criminal and civil  
trials in Denver and in military courts around the country. She was 
a reporter of debates for the U.S. House of Representatives from 
1972 to 1982 and, after another stint in Denver courts, retired in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitz said she reopened the wounds of Nuremberg when she learned  
a Colorado teacher reportedly told students that the Holocaust, 
which killed 6 million Jews, was a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	``That fired me up so badly,'' Spitz said. ``I just hauled out  
my files and put together a prepared lecture. A mission has found 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last 10 years, Spitz has spoken about her experiences to  
more than 19,000 people in at least 30 states. 
</P>
<P>
	For years after Nuremberg, and occasionally since, Spitz had a  
recurring nightmare set in a concentration camp. In the dream, she 
is trying to escape with five small children through an underground 
tunnel, holding a candle for light and praying the Nazi guards 
above do not hear her. 
</P>
<P>
	She always wakes up before the ending, never escaping that  
tunnel -- or her memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not escaped to this day,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> MIT Revokes Graduate's Diploma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Associated Press Writer.    	
</P>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology has revoked a graduate's diploma for his involvement in 
the 1997 death of a student who suffered alcohol poisoning after a 
fraternity party. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Yoo, 23, now a Philadelphia stockbroker, was called back  
to his alma mater this week for a hearing in which his diploma was 
rescinded, said his lawyer, who plans to sue the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``They chose to scapegoat my client and take his degree, which  
he had earned and been awarded over a year ago,'' lawyer Timothy M. 
Burke said. ``Frankly, it's outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Scott Krueger, 18, died in September 1997 after he  
was forced to drink huge quantities of liquor as part of a pledge 
contest at ``Animal House Night'' at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity 
house. Krueger, of Orchard Park, N.Y., fell into a coma, and died 
several days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Krueger's blood alcohol level was 0.401 percent when he was  
hospitalized -- more than five times the state's legal limit for 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoo was the pledge trainer at the fraternity, and prosecutors  
said he gave the freshmen, including Krueger, whiskey and beer he 
had purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	The MIT chapter of the fraternity disbanded after prosecutors  
indicted it for manslaughter. The case was never prosecuted because 
no one showed up in court to represent the house. 
</P>
<P>
	MIT spokeswoman Sarah Wright refused to comment. She would not  
say whether the school had ever tried to revoke a graduate's 
diploma.

control and resolving a feud over the family's billion-dollar 
financial empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreement divides the assets of the Youngstown,  
Ohio-based Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. and allows DeBartolo and his 
sister, Denise DeBartolo York, to go their separate financial ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is signed, lawsuits filed by the siblings against  
each other will be dismissed, according to a source close to the 
negotiations. The suits, filed in federal court in Ohio, are on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Singer, a spokesman for the corporation, confirmed Friday a  
tentative deal had been reached. It still must be approved in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Rice, a spokesman for Eddie DeBartolo, said some details  
still needed to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may be close to an agreement but any announcements are  
premature at this moment,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative deal ends a messy battle between the DeBartolos  
that arose from Eddie DeBartolo's entanglement in a Louisiana 
gambling fraud scandal, which led to a guilty plea for failing to 
report a felony. He was also serving a year-long suspension imposed 
by NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue last March. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad occasion. We just have to move,'' 49ers general  
manager Bill Walsh said following the team's training camp workout 
in Stockton. ``We've all been observing and watching, and finally 
an agreement has been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The siblings owned equal shares of the corporation, which was  
the nominal owner of the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise DeBartolo York had said for some time that she wanted to  
divide the family holdings because she and her brother had 
radically different business philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, Denise Debartolo York and her  
husband, John York, now the 49ers executive vice president, have 
control of the team. The couple also retained three racetracks and 
the corporate offices and name. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's agreement, Eddie DeBartolo acknowledged owing the  
corporation $94 million. He received stock and real estate holdings 
and interest in some development projects, Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo, who is in the process of selling his Atherton home  
and moving to Florida, wasn't immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see this coming. All of us did,'' Walsh said. ``I wish  
Eddie well. There will be no changes except for tightening certain 
aspects of the business but certainly not shortchanging players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the deal kept the team in the family, it ends Eddie  
DeBartolo's 22-year association with the club. A flamboyant, 
demanding owner, DeBartolo was known as a free spender who lavished 
money on his players and expected championships in return. 
</P>
<P>
	The club won five Super Bowls with DeBartolo in charge, the last  
coming in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise DeBartolo York co-owned the team during most of that time  
but was a silent partner to her brother. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no plans to sell the club.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Yorks have always said that if they were to get the crown  
jewel of the corporation, and the 49ers are the crown jewel, that 
they would keep the team, and keep the team in San Francisco,'' 
Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was completed Friday during a telephone call with Judge  
Daniel Polster, a federal judge in Ohio, who held several hearings 
with the sides during the past two months and had urged them to 
settle. 
</P>
<P>
	Final court approval could take several months.  
</P>
<P>
	The NFL suspended DeBartolo through February 2000 and fined him  
$1 million for his role in a Louisiana gambling and bribery case. 
DeBartolo pleaded guilty to failing to report a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, York sued her brother in San Francisco, charging him  
with reneging on a $94 million debt to the family company and 
cutting an improper side deal with a prospective developer on a 
stadium-shopping mall project. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo responded with a lawsuit in Ohio, accusing her of  
breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, the feud has stalled the stadium project  
approved by voters in June 1997.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Urges Straw Poll Vote Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, citing  
persistent reports of campaign mischief, asked Iowa Republican 
leaders Friday to tighten ballot security for next month's straw 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the merest hint of such activities, true or not, threaten  
the integrity of the straw poll,'' Hatch wrote Iowa Republican 
Party executive director Dee Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, who wants the Republican presidential nomination, said  
participants in the straw poll should be required to produce a 
photo ID. He also told Stewart that all of the presidential 
campaigns should be challenged to sign an affidavit that they 
aren't paying anyone to vote or ``coercing people'' for support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been hearing some rumors'' of coercion, Hatch told  
reporters as he opened a five-day campaign swing in Iowa, where 
precinct caucuses launch the nominating season. ``That kind of 
undermines the integrity of the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Competition has been intense heading into the state's Aug. 14  
straw poll. There have been occasional reports of campaign 
misbehavior, generally leaked by rival campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush used $50,000 in unregulated ``soft''  
money to lease space and buy tickets for the event, but replaced it 
with campaign money after news accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	And publisher Steve Forbes has been accused of seeking to hire  
temporary workers to vote for him. He vehemently denied the 
allegation, which led to the firing of the head of the state's 
Christian Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch argued for some limits on what campaigns can do to get  
backers to Ames for the straw poll. While it's understood that 
campaigns will provide many free tickets, direct payments are out 
of line, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, in this election it looks to me like some  
people are trying to buy it,'' said Hatch. ``The rumors are that 
George Bush is going to spend something like $4 million on this. I 
don't know how he can do it without buying votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to protect the integrity of the straw poll, I urge  
you to take measures to ensure that no voting participants in the 
straw poll are being paid or coerced to attend and vote for any 
particular candidate,'' Hatch said in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
	State Republican officials have limited voting to Iowans, and  
said they'll demand photo identification. They also say strict 
ballot security measure are being employed, but won't discuss them 
publicly. Making the security measures public would give campaigns 
time to devise a method around them, officials argue. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to buying $25 tickets for backers, most campaigns  
are organizing bus caravans to bring backers to Ames, and plan 
giant parties with food and entertainment.

<HEADLINE> US Baseball Team 2 Wins From Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- With a whacky four-game round-robin  
series finally over, the U.S. baseball team must now navigate its 
way to Sydney. The road might not be as difficult as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In the win-or-go-home portion of the Pan American Games that  
begins Saturday, the Americans expected to confront talented teams 
from Cuba, Canada and the Dominican Republic. None will be in the 
opposite dugout in either the quarterfinals or semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the Americans get to Monday's finals, they also get a  
ticket to the 2000 Olympics next September. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody could have drawn the tournament up this way. Cuba,  
Canada and the Dominican would all have to play each other,'' said 
John Patterson, the U.S. starter Saturday night in the 
quarterfinals against Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	Using minor leaguers in international play for the first time,  
the United States needs two victories to qualify for the Olympics. 
If the Americans can get by Panama in the quarters, they would face 
either Mexico or Nicaragua in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need two games to qualify and three to take the gold,''  
Patterson said. ``Our sights are set on the gold. And that's the 
way we're looking at it. We're not just trying to qualify.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Host Canada won all four games in the opening pool series,  
beating both the United States and Cuba. The Canadians face winless 
Guatemala in the quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Cuba, shadowed by rumors of defection, split its  
first four games and is pitted against the Dominican in the 
quarterfinals. The United States is more than glad to miss the 
Dominican, which beat the Americans twice in a warmup tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that it seems to matter who the opponent is.  
</P>
<P>
	If there is one thing the Americans have learned from their  
brief taste in the international forum, it's that anything can 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different avenue,'' said third base coach Jackie Moore,  
who at age 60 has been around baseball all his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how long you're in the game, you always see  
something new. The other night the players from Brazil were 
cheering and singing in their dugout. That's what baseball is all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	``And the teams here are better than I thought they would be.''  
</P>
<P>
	The United States opened pool play with a crushing 7-6 loss to  
Canada in 11 innings. The Americans led 6-3 in the top of the 11th 
before Canadian manager Ernie Whitt held the game up for 30 minutes 
arguing and protesting the number of trips he was allowed to make 
to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada, also with a roster of minor leaguers, then scored four  
runs after two were out in the bottom of the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States came back to beat Mexico 5-1 and it was  
manager Buddy Bell's turn to question the rules. He twice came out 
of the dugout, wondering why a Mexican pitcher who had two 
spit-covered baseballs taken away from him by umpires wasn't 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell was thrown out of the next game for arguing in the ninth  
inning against Cuba with the game tied 5-5. Minutes later, Marcus 
Jensen hit a three-run homer to spark a 10-5 U.S. victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Americans struggled mightly against winless Brazil, the  
only team in the nine-country tournament not to quality for the 
quarters. The United States eked out a 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are quite a few things different,'' Bell said. ``The  
interpretation of the rules here is a little different than what we 
are used to. We're used to bottom line stuff where there really is 
no negotiating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bell, who played 18 years in the major leagues and also  
managed there for 2 1/2, has no complaints so far about the unique 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've all enjoyed it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter who you play. The intensity of this thing  
has been incredible. I think we would all agree with that.''

<HEADLINE> China Holds More in Sect Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese police today detained at least 20 people  
and beat one man outside the compound where China's leaders live 
and work, while authorities stepped up a campaign to crush a banned 
meditation sect. 
</P>
<P>
	Two police officers, one wielding a wooden pole and the other  
using his fists, beat the man outside the northwest gate of the 
tightly guarded leadership compound, known as Zhongnanhai. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, who was eventually pulled onto a bus by police, had  
fought back with his fists. One police officer had blood on his 
neck and the man's face appeared swollen following the beating. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 other detainees were held in a bus outside the  
red-walled leadership compound, the focus of earlier protests by 
the Falun Gong, which last week was banned as a threat to the 
government. Later, the detainees were transferred to smaller vans 
and driven away. 
</P>
<P>
	The detentions came a day after China issued an arrest warrant  
for the U.S.-based leader of the meditation group on charges of 
spreading superstition. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrant for Li Hongzhi was read out on state television. It  
wasn't clear whether China would seek to extradite Li, a former 
Chinese government clerk who now lives in New York City. State 
media, however, reported that China would seek unspecified 
cooperation from member countries of Interpol, the international 
police agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. State Department said it would not extradite Li because  
the two countries have no extradition treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2 million confiscated Falun Gong publications, videos  
and cassettes were destroyed Thursday by dozens of provinces and 
cities nationwide, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong is one of many schools of qigong, a traditional  
practice intended to improve health through exercise, mediation and 
attempts to channel unseen forces. Falun Gong's teachings draw on 
martial arts, Buddhism and Taoism. 
</P>
<P>
	Official estimates had put the group's membership as high as 70  
million -- 9 million more than the Communist Party -- although the 
government has since said the group has just 2 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	The crackdown was precipitated by protests that began with a  
silent vigil on April 25 by more than 10,000 Falun Gong devotees 
outside the leadership compound in central Beijing. The group said 
it was protesting official harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Li, who founded Falun Gong in 1992, has denied government  
accusations of having political ambitions. He also has denied 
organizing the April gathering or other protests and has told 
reporters he didn't even know about them in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	China's arrest order accused Li of organizing demonstrations  
without required permits, Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Public Security Ministry also said Li ``spread superstition  
and malicious fallacies to deceive people, resulting in the deaths 
of many practitioners,'' Xinhua said. It claimed the group was to 
blame for 743 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Li has denied any connection to deaths of members who he said  
might already have been ill or unstable. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong treats illness as a result of evil in a past life and  
discourages the use of medicines.

<HEADLINE> Malcolm X Grandson Closely Watched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- A Family Court judge has ordered tighter  
security around Malcolm X's grandson, who has escaped three times 
from juvenile detention after being sent there for setting a fire 
that killed his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a proven risk for being absent without leave,'' County  
Attorney Alan Scheinkman said in court Thursday of Malcolm Shabazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Shabazz, 14, set a fire two years ago that killed his  
grandmother, Betty Shabazz, who was Malcolm X's widow and a civil 
rights leader herself. He pleaded guilty to the juvenile 
equivalents of manslaughter and arson and has been in detention 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Since February he has escaped repeatedly. On Wednesday, he fled  
Woodfield Cottage -- a juvenile facility on the grounds of the 
county jail in Valhalla. He was missing for three hours before a 
policeman spotted him in a taxicab nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Janet DiFiore approved ``secure detention,'' but would not  
grant Scheinkman's request that Shabazz be kept indoors. She said 
she would leave it up to Woodfield Cottage to ``take the steps 
necessary to keep the young man safe and secure.''

<HEADLINE> Fullback Evans Fits in With Ravens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- Most of the Baltimore Ravens have spent  
the first few days of training camp adjusting to a new coach and a 
vastly different offensive scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Evans, however, has been hustling through practice as if  
he's been doing these same drills throughout his entire NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	As a matter of fact, he has.  
</P>
<P>
	Evans, the Ravens' new starting fullback, and coach Brian  
Billick both left the Minnesota Vikings for Baltimore during the 
offseason. Billick was hired in December, and three months later 
Evans severed his six-year relationship with the Vikings by signing 
as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been the only offensive coordinator I've had my whole  
career, and now he's the head coach,'' Evans said Friday. ``How 
much better can it get?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans should find life even more enjoyable once the regular  
season begins. After being selected by the Vikings in the 11th 
round of the 1992 draft, he was used almost exclusively in 
Minnesota as the lead blocker for the halfback. That will be his 
primary role in Baltimore, with one important exception. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will carry the ball more here, sort of like Leroy Hoard did  
for us in Minnesota,'' Billick said. ``I know that's one of the 
reasons Chuck came here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually there are plenty of reasons that Evans chose Baltimore,  
where he will replace the little-used Roosevelt Potts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played this team last year and I know they have a good  
young defense and a lot of talented players. It's going to be a 
good team,'' Evans said. ``Plus, knowing the coach, I can hit the 
ground running. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing here gives me a chance to get a few more carries. But  
I come from a system where there are a lot of stars and just one 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he did get his hands on the ball in Minnesota, he never  
lost it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 207 career touches (receiving, running and returning) Evans  
has never fumbled. His career numbers -- 118 carries for 364 yards 
and 78 catches for 531 yards -- are not overly impressive. But his 
value to a team cannot be measured by mere statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, 32, paved the way for Robert Smith to run for 1,187 yards  
and six touchdowns last year. He'd like to see the end zone himself 
a few times this year, but he knows his main job is to make sure 
that Priest Holmes has a hole to run through. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a fullback. It would be nice to get the ball on a carry or  
a catch, but I like to block for the guys too,'' Evans said. ``If 
Priest is breaking runs for touchdowns, then that means I'm doing 
something right. It may be unsung or unseen, but the football 
people know what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans put up some good numbers at Clark Atlanta University,  
where he ran for 871 yards and 15 touchdowns as a senior. He was 
drafted by Minnesota as a halfback, but because the Vikings were 
loaded with ball carriers Evans was almost immediately shifted to 
fullback. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been working with Billick ever since, and so his unofficial  
role in this training camp is as a liaison between the coach and 
players who have yet to become fully acquainted with Billick's 
practice regimen, offensive system and idiosyncrasies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows how our camps work and he knows what my expectations  
are,'' Billick said. ``I can check with Chuck to see how we're 
doing, how they're absorbing it and how they're feeling. He's a 
great asset for the players, and for me as well.''

<HEADLINE> London Stock Exchange Makes a Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The next company to be listed on the soon-to-be  
restructured London Stock Exchange could be ... the London Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The management board of Britain's largest stock market said  
today that it plans to end the LSE's 240-year status as a 
member-owned organization and transform it into a company 
controlled by shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal aims to make the exchange more competitive and  
efficient in an era of intensified electronic trading. Initial 
shareholders will be the exchange's 294 current members, but they 
will be able to sell their shares to third parties, including 
foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the LSE has no plan yet to list itself as a publicly  
traded company, an exchange spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that making shares available for sale to the public 
was a logical next step. 
</P>
<P>
	``To compete on equal terms in today's market, our  
decision-making processes must be geared to rapid response both to 
customer demand and changing economic conditions. The new structure 
will achieve this,'' LSE chief executive Gavin Casey said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is part of a global transformation in stock markets,  
propelled by the increase in cross-border trading of shares and the 
rapid growth of electronic trading systems. The two largest U.S. 
stock markets -- the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq -- are both 
weighing plans to move to for-profit status. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology that has allowed millions of people to trade using  
the Internet has led to trading networks that link buyers and 
sellers, bypassing the traditional exchanges. These trading 
systems, known as electronic communication networks, or ECNs, 
already have grabbed away an estimated 30 percent of the trading 
volume from Nasdaq.	   The potential challenge from ECNs was a major factor in the 
London exchange's decision to abandon its mutual status and adopt a 
more commercial structure. To do so, the London exchange will need 
the approval of 75 percent of its member firms. The board has not 
set a date for seeking such approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1760 as a club of brokers at Jonathan's Coffee House  
in London, the LSE now has an average daily trading volume of 1.3 
billion shares worth $2.6 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE, by comparison, has a smaller average daily trading  
volume -- 802 million shares -- but a much bigger share value of 
$16.1 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned restructuring would be the biggest evolutionary  
change for the LSE since 1986, when the exchange entered an era of 
dizzying growth by opening its membership ranks to firms, instead 
of individuals, in a step known as ``Big Bang.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders tend to demand greater accountability from a  
company than members do, and their focus on profits tends to force 
management to become more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	But some observers question the wisdom of the LSE's shift away  
from mutual status -- the ownership of a business by its members. 
</P>
<P>
	``De-mutualization is likely to become more a part of corporate  
life. Stock exchanges are a part of that,'' said Gishan Dissanaike, 
a lecturer in finance at Cambridge University's Judge Institute of 
Management Studies. ``Whether this is entirely healthy isn't clear 
yet because the long-term effects have not yet been studied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the London exchange's plan may not be sufficient to  
protect it from leaner, cheaper competitors, said Laurence 
Copeland, a finance professor at Cardiff Business School. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're losing market share all the time to electronic  
dealers, and they're deciding late in the day to try to catch up. 
Basically, they can't compete on cost,'' Copeland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The LSE is currently talking with seven other European stock  
exchanges about setting up a single pan-European equities market, 
and it believes its transformation into a shareholder-owned company 
will help speed such integration. 
</P>
<P>
	But talks between London and the Deutsche Boerse, Germany's main  
exchange, are said to be bogged down on issues of ownership of the 
planned regional exchange and the choice of technology to be used 
for its trading platform.

<HEADLINE> A Trail of Violence Leads to an End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Clutching his handguns, the man in the khaki  
shorts bolted from the cool lobby of the tinted-glass office 
building into a blast of Georgia summer heat. He headed for his 
minivan and made sure to fasten his seatbelt. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed his vehicle toward Interstate 75, merging into the  
traffic of metropolitan Atlanta rush-hour commuters, listening with 
growing horror to radio reports of his bloody rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton, a chemist turned day-trader, was no stranger to  
violence. Six years earlier, his first wife and mother-in-law had 
been bludgeoned to death in a camper. At this very moment, his 
second wife and his two children were lying dead in nearby 
Stockbridge, their bodies still undiscovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind him, at the shiny office complex called Securities  
Centre, nine people were dead, a dozen more were wounded, and walls 
were splattered with blood. By nightfall, Barton would himself be 
dead, slumped over his steering wheel in the parking lot of a BP 
gas station. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	At least one person saw signs of trouble on Tuesday, when Barton  
picked up her grandson for a Boy Scout meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something's weird about this man,'' Marsha Jean DeFreese  
remembers thinking when the 44-year-old Barton, a troop leader, 
came to pick up her grandson Brian, who was friends with Barton's 
11-year-old son Matthew. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. DeFreese had lived near the family last year in the Atlanta  
suburb of Morrow, before Barton split with his second wife, Leigh 
Ann. Mrs. Barton had moved Matthew and his 7-year-old sister 
Elizabeth Mychelle to a Stockbridge apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, Mrs. DeFreese recalled, Barton would not return with  
the boys until 11 p.m., which she thought was strange. She chalked 
it up to their closeness. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was hard to tell. Nearly six years ago, Barton's  
father-in-law, Bill Spivey, had considered Barton ``the perfect 
son-in-law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the bodies of his daughter and wife -- Barton's previous  
wife, Debra, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey -- were found 
bludgeoned in a camper on an Alabama lake over Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton was the main suspect at the time. No arrest was ever  
made. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Around 3 p.m. on Thursday, Barton walked into the Momentum  
Securities brokerage office in the seven-story Securities Centre 
building in Atlanta's upscale Buckhead neighborhood. Armed with 9 
mm and .45-caliber handguns, he started shooting with both hands. 
People huddled beneath desks, but four of his initial shots killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton then walked east across the six lanes of Piedmont Road  
and began shooting in the office of the All-Tech Investment Group, 
a stock trading firm in the Piedmont Center building where Barton 
had been a client. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he left, five more people were dead. Some workers threw a  
computer through a window, trying to escape. Others ran out; many 
remained holed up inside, waiting to be evacuated by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting outside one door was Nell Jones, an attorney. ``He was  
... very calm and determined, no feelings,'' she said. He pointed a 
gun at her and pulled the trigger at point-blank range. The bullet 
whizzed by her head. 
</P>
<P>
	Joette Castronova, 27, was one of the first paramedics at the  
scene. She quickly found herself holed up in an office with a 
24-year-old man who had been shot. ``He was in a lot of pain. I 
just rubbed his head and told him he was going to be OK,'' Ms. 
Castronova said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, Atlanta police set up police lines and started an  
office-by-office, floor-by-floor search. Helicopters took to the 
air as the manhunt was broadcast live on national TV. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barton was long gone.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Miles south, the manager of the Bristol Green apartment complex  
in Stockbridge was thinking about the strangely quiet apartment 
unit in building 1300. The rent was late, and he wondered what was 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	He called Henry County Police at 3:23 p.m., less than 30 minutes  
after the shooting started in Atlanta, and let an officer in. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing one body, the officer called for backup.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Matthew and Elizabeth Mychelle were dead, apparently from  
blows to the head. They lay in their beds, all but their faces 
covered. A handwritten note rested by each child's body. 
</P>
<P>
	Their stepmother also was dead, stuffed in a closet and  
similarly covered, with another scribbled note. In the living room 
was a longer letter, this one apparently typed out on the computer 
Barton so loved. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, meanwhile, was across the city, heading north. He had  
made it through nearly two counties since the rampage in Buckhead. 
But his dark green Ford Aerostar was soon spotted, and after the 
police car behind him hit its lights, Barton pulled off into the BP 
station near a car wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were directly behind his minivan, surrounding Barton with  
guns drawn. Barton remained inside, still armed. He turned the gun 
on himself; moments later, he was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad one of our officers didn't have to shoot him,''  
said Acworth Police Officer Mark Camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the lushly landscaped Securities Centre, evacuated  
office workers watched from police lines. Some huddled under nearby 
trees; others made their way across the street to El Azteca, a 
Mexican restaurant, where they ate dinner, sipped drinks and 
watched the investigation unfold. 
</P>
<P>
	``To think that when I woke up this morning, I thought that it  
was going to be a normal workday,'' said Tiombe Holland, 23, who 
works for a health services company one floor above some of the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in a matter of hours, a forthcoming Mayor  
Bill Campbell calmly related what he knew, what he didn't, how he 
felt. ``Pray for our city,'' Campbell implored on national 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours after the suicide, Barton's body was still at the gas  
station, still in his van, the driver's side door open. Nearby, a 
crowd of several dozen gawkers jostled to get a look. 
</P>
<P>
	Some explained why they were there. They wanted to get a glimpse  
of a mass murderer.

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Soars in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income galloped ahead  
faster than spending in June, the government said Friday. New home 
sales, meanwhile, rose 3.1 percent as buyers rushed to beat slowly 
rising mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports, economists said, were an outgrowth of a healthy  
U.S. economy, a low unemployment rate, a strong stock market and 
benign inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither report was expected to raise eyebrows at the Federal  
Reserve, which nudged up interest rates June 30 in a pre-emptive 
strike against inflation, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Fed would view them as neutral,'' said First Union  
economist Mark Vitner. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have been jittery, however, about the  
possibility of further rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said personal income, which includes  
wages, interest and government benefits, rose a 
faster-than-expected 0.7 percent last month. It was the biggest 
income gain since a 0.9 percent rise in November and marked the 
first time since January that income growth outpaced the rise in 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, income rose 0.3 percent, while spending went up 0.6  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	June's income growth reflected gains in wages and salary as well  
as from interest and dividends. A surge in farm income, stemming 
from federal subsidy payments to farmers, boosted overall income 
growth. Still, excluding these payments, income would have gone up 
0.5 percent, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Americans tempered their spending somewhat.  
Spending went up just 0.3 percent in June, a little less than many 
analysts had expected. That too was the smallest increase since 
November, when spending rose 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are still in a buying mood but not as aggressive,''  
said Gary Thayer, chief economist with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists attributed the moderation in spending to a number of  
factors including a recent rise in interest rates and a decline in 
mortgage refinancing. People who refinance homes end up with extra 
money which leads to higher spending, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because consumer spending has outpaced incomes repeatedly, the  
nation's savings rate -- saving as a percentage of after-tax income 
-- has set a string of record lows this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the savings rate was minus 1.0 percent, better than the  
record low of negative 1.4 percent set in May. 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for the negative savings rate, economists say, is  
that the strong stock market is boosting Americans' net worth and 
making them feel more comfortable about dipping into savings to pay 
for the spending spree. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, sales of new single-family homes rose in  
June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 929,000 units, better 
than forecast, the Commerce Department said. In May, new-home sales 
fell 4.1 percent to 901,000 units, not so bad as the government 
previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite rising interest rates, home sales have remained strong  
because home buyers are rushing to lock in current interest rates 
in the fear that rates might climb higher,'' said Merrill Lynch 
economist Karen Dexter. 
</P>
<P>
	The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage this  
week was 7.70 percent, up from 7.52 percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in sales pushed prices up as well. The median price  
for a new home -- meaning half of all homes sold in June for less 
and half for more -- rose 4.7 percent to $157,000, up from May's 
median price of $149,900. June's price was the highest since 
February's record of $159,900. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people buy homes, they also buy things to put into  
them,'' said Vitner. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on nondurable products, such as food and fuel,  
increased 0.4 percent in June, less than the 0.5 percent increase 
the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	But spending on durable goods -- big-ticket manufactured items  
expected to last at least three years, such as washing machines and 
cars -- was flat in June, following a sharp, 2.2 percent gain in 
May.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Death Toll Climbs to 93 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Guzzling down bottled water under the searing  
midday sun, police Officer Mike Sanders began his shift Friday 
checking to see how senior citizens were faring in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Knocking on the door of one high-rise apartment, he got no  
answer. Inside, he found 81-year-old Mary Powls lying on the floor 
of her sweltering home. Her windows were closed, and she had no 
fans or air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	The groggy woman said she had fallen and couldn't get help.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing that we came around when we did,'' Sanders  
said. He later checked on her in the hospital, where she was 
admitted in stable condition with a 104-degree temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	As an unrelenting heat wave kept its grip on much of the nation  
-- from the Plains to the East Coast -- Chicago officials deployed 
hundreds of workers on the streets to avoid a repeat of 1995, when 
scorching summer heat was blamed for more than 700 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The current heat wave has been linked to at least 94 deaths in  
18 states across the country since July 19. The Midwest has been 
hit hardest, with Missouri logging 29 heat-related deaths, Illinois 
23 and Ohio 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures neared 100 degrees in many cities, and the heat  
index -- a measure of temperature and humidity -- rose past 110 in 
several places. The heat index neared 120 in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature was 103 at Chicago's Midway Airport, and by  
midday it was 99 in Kansas City, Mo. -- the 15th straight day that 
state had seen temperatures in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	The misery was spread all over. It was 106 in Louisville, Ky.,  
one degree short of the city's record, and 104 in Fort Knox. 
Kenosha, Wis., reached 102, and Winona, Minn., reported a high of 
99. Nashville, Tenn., broke a record at 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Little Rock, Ark., registered 102. It's been so bad in central  
Arkansas that Danny Mahan, safety director for a construction 
company there, said workers pouring concrete have been arriving at 
work at about 3 a.m. to avoid laboring in the afternoon heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago had no formal heat emergency plan until the death tolls  
started mounting during the 1995 heat wave, when temperatures 
soared as high as 106 degrees, with humidity that made it feel like 
125. 
</P>
<P>
	The city issued an extreme heat warning Friday, sending workers  
door-to-door checking on senior citizens and urging people to take 
advantage of 30 air-conditioned cooling centers. Officials hired 
extra ambulances and sternly warned people to stay inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was ever a day that hot weather threatened the lives  
of people in Chicago, it is today,'' said Fire Commissioner Edward 
Altman, who has been coordinating the city's heat relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wrigley Field, ushers sprayed water onto Chicago Cubs  
baseball fans in the bleachers and two players had to leave the 
game because of the heat. Across town, Jimmy Connors also was 
forced to withdraw from a seniors tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But by late Friday, a glimmer of relief appeared in the form a  
Canada cool front moving into Minnesota and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in Minnesota fell into the 70s and even into the  
mid-60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Wisconsin saw severe storms with violent lightning,  
rain and wind gusts of about 50 mph to 70 mph that toppled trees 
and ripped down power lines, the National Weather Service reported. 
Scattered power outages were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	More of the Midwest was expected to get relief by Saturday, with  
thunderstorms expected to help cool things off along the central 
Great Lakes and through the mid-Atlantic states. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, temperatures were in the 90s for the 14th  
straight day on Friday, with the National Weather Service bureau in 
Raleigh reporting the heat index as high as 110 in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, produce farmer Tony Southerland of Wilson's Mills,  
S.C., said he didn't have much to complain about, considering his 
field had been ``blessed with rain'' for most of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heat's tough, but it's July,'' Southerland said. ``You get  
out and load watermelons, and you'll have a new appreciation for 
heat in the sunshine.''

<HEADLINE> Ahanotu Signs 6-Year Deal with Bucs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay's Chidi Ahanotu became one of the  
NFL's highest-paid defensive ends Friday when he signed a six-year 
contract worth about $5 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which included a signing bonus of more than $5  
million, continued the club's pattern of locking its players into 
long-term contracts rather than pursuing high-profile free agents 
from other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buccaneers designated Ahanotu, 28, as their franchise player  
in February, making a tender worth just under $4 million that the 
seventh-year pro could have accepted as a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	If the 6-foot-2, 285-pound end opted to play for the tender, the  
entire $3.95 million would have counted against this season's 
salary cap. By accepting a multiyear deal, it cleared room to sign 
the club's remaining unsigned rookie draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's flashier and spicier to be able to go out and get  
somebody else's player and bring him in here and say we've got 
somebody new,'' general manager Rich McKay said. ``But for us, we 
felt we should stick to our plan of trying to sign our guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ahanotu had a career-best 10 sacks in 1997, helping Tampa Bay  
earn a playoff berth for the first time in 15 years. When efforts 
to sign him to a contract extension failed after that season, the 
Bucs turned their attention to working out a long-term deal with 
fullback Mike Alstott. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-signing Ahanotu became a priority again last fall, despite a  
shoulder injury that forced him to sit out all but four games in 
1998. He had started at least 10 games in each of his first five 
NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``A year and a half is a long time to go not knowing what your  
future is going to be,'' Ahanotu said, adding that his shoulder is 
fine and he's ``chomping at the bit'' to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal makes Ahanotu the second highest-paid player on the  
Bucs behind defensive tackle Warren Sapp, who signed a contract 
worth $6 million per season last year. It also placed him in the 
top five among defensive ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day in Tampa Bay,'' the defensive lineman said  
before McKay interrupted to add: ``For Chidi Ahanotu.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal clears the way for the Bucs to sign first-round draft  
pick Anthony McFarland and second-round pick Shaun King before the 
start of training camp Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	McKay met with McFarland's agent, Karl Bernard, this week and  
the two sides could be close to an agreement. The general manager 
expects to sign King this weekend, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect anybody to be late,'' McKay said. ``We clearly  
have (salary cap) room to do it now, and I think we have the 
necessary rookie pool to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Mixed; Down Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped to its lowest level against  
the yen in five months Friday as another decline on Wall Street 
caused concerns that demand for the dollar could fall if investors 
pull funds out of U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 114.48 Japanese yen in late New York  
trading, down from 115.40 yen late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell for a second day running Friday on continued fears  
that wage growth data could lead Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan to consider higher interest rates in order to curb 
inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was mixed against other currencies. The euro was  
quoted at $1.0705, down from $1.0730 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4907 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4889, and 1.5046 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5060. The British 
pound rose to $1.6221 from $1.6189. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Tours Big Apple After Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lance Armstrong's initial surprise at the size  
of the crowds welcoming him back to the United States quickly gave 
way to appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to try and do this every year,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was greeted by raucous, cheering New Yorkers on  
Thursday, four days after completing his inspiring victory in the 
grueling Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea how much America, how much the communities  
around America, were following the Tour de France,'' he said. ``To 
see the turnout and the response in the sports world and in the 
media, it makes my day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who overcame an advanced form of testicular cancer  
two years ago before winning cycling's most prestigious race, spent 
the day being interviewed on talk shows, touring the New York Stock 
Exchange and making a promotional visit to Nike's Manhattan store. 
</P>
<P>
	Since winning the tour, Armstrong has ridden in races in Europe  
on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Then he flew to New York for 
Thursday's round of appearances at the ``Today'' show, ``Good 
Morning America,'' the stock exchange, the Nike store and a taping 
of ``The Late Show with David Letterman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani proclaimed July 29 ``Lance  
Armstrong Day'' in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	And the impact of his victory still hasn't sunk in.  
</P>
<P>
	``I still can hardly believe I won the race,'' Armstrong said.  
</P>
<P>
	In his interviews with NBC and ABC, Armstrong, accompanied by  
his wife Kristin, talked about the cancer that nearly took his life 
in 1996 when it spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm able now to look a year out, two years out, 10 years out,  
20 years out, whereas in the first couple of months of my illness I 
was only able to look a day away, and in the first year I was able 
to look a week away or a month away,'' Armstrong said on NBC. ``But 
now we feel confident in my health and feel confident as a couple 
and as a family and we want to have a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kristin, whom Armstrong met toward the end of his chemotherapy,  
is expecting the couple's first child in October. 
</P>
<P>
	On ``Good Morning America,'' Armstrong received a congratulatory  
phone call from Olympic skater Scott Hamilton, also a survivor of 
testicular cancer, and spoke to Kelly Davidson, an 11-year-old 
cancer patient in Fort Worth, Texas. Armstrong, a native of Plano, 
Texas, developed a friendship with Davidson after meeting her 
during a promotion in Austin in 1997, and he wished her well on 
camera while riding in the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson, her head bald from chemotherapy, wore a ring on a  
chain around her neck given to her by Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me really, really happy that he won,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong presented Davidson with a mountain bike on the air,  
and Davidson showed Armstrong a stuffed animal she bought as a gift 
for his baby. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the three weeks (of the race) I thought about Kelly  
and people like Kelly and the entire cancer community,'' Armstrong 
said. ``I get so much of my own motivation and inspiration from 
them, that extended family. They're so special to me and to Kristin 
and to the whole team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 27, was found to be cancer-free in 1997, and his  
chances of a recurrence are estimated at 2 percent by his doctors. 
But Armstrong, who started the Lance Armstrong Foundation during 
his recovery to raise funds to help people manage and survive 
cancer, feels the need to share what he has learned in his battle 
with cancer, with others suffering from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to believe,'' he said. ``You have to want to live.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a responsibility to tell my story, to encourage people  
to fight.''

<HEADLINE>  Atlanta Gunman Kills Nine People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Authorities are grimly piecing together what they  
know about Mark O. Barton, the 44-year-old father, investor and 
former murder suspect who walked into two Atlanta brokerages and 
killed nine people. 
</P>
<P>
	Some questions may never be answered: Barton sped away after the  
shooting rampage, driving to a suburb where he killed himself 
Thursday evening as police closed in. Authorities later said he had 
killed his wife and two children before committing one of the worst 
workplace massacres in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people were injured, some by bullets and others by their  
frantic attempts to avoid the killer. Seven remained in critical 
condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, both buildings where the shootings happened were  
open. Someone left a bouquet of spring flowers -- red carnations, 
yellow chrysanthemums and white daisies -- outside each with a card 
that said, ``I'm so sorry. God bless you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the building where the first victims were killed, Allegiance  
Telecom sales manager Eric Blaier was already at work but took a 
break to sip a Diet Coke and gaze at the TV satellite trucks parked 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the game of telecom sales, it's business as usual,'' said  
Blaier, who works on the same floor where four victims were killed. 
``Unfortunately true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation on a motive has centered on Barton's work as a day  
trader, investors who dabble in risky, moment-by-moment changes in 
the stock market, which dropped sharply Thursday. But Barton's 
family was slain earlier in the week and company officials said he 
hadn't traded since April at the firm where five of his victims 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea what caused Mr. Barton to begin shooting,''  
Mayor Bill Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clues may be found in notes left with the bodies of his family.  
Police have not disclosed their contents, except to say that they 
had found a list indicating Barton had intended to kill at least 
three more people. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting rampage -- the third in the Atlanta area in little  
more than two months -- and the ensuing manhunt stunned the city of 
3.1 million and quickly captured national attention. It was the 
latest in a grisly wave of mass slayings at schools and workplaces, 
and President Clinton today expressed sadness at the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, dark-haired and 6-foot-4, was wearing khaki shorts when  
he walked into the Momentum Securities brokerage at the Two 
Securities Centre building in the trendy Buckhead section of 
Atlanta about 3 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were dead within minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a lot of blood in the hallway,'' said Chris Carter, 32,  
who works on the building's third floor. ``There was a trail of 
blood leading from one end of the hallway to the other.'' It wasn't 
immediately clear what relationship Barson had with the Momentum 
firm, if any. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton then walked across a busy six-lane road and into the  
All-Tech Investment Group, a day trading firm in the Piedmont 
Center building where he had been a client. Five died there. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, who was carrying a pistol in each hand, at one point  
reportedly said: ``I hope this doesn't upset your trading day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton came into the office ``and after speaking with our branch  
manager, suddenly stood up and for no reason opened fire on the 
manager and his secretary,'' Jai Ramoutar, director of All-Tech, 
said in a statement released from the company's headquarters in 
Montvale, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man then went into our main trading room and began  
indiscriminately shooting the customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nell Jones, 53, a day trader at All-Tech, said she was sitting  
at her computer when she heard shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting outside the door when he exited, so I was the  
first person to look into his eyes,'' Ms. Jones told WSB-TV. ``He 
was someone who was very calm and determined, no feelings. The 
bullet missed me and then he turned to shoot at other people, so I 
was able to escape,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the victims were shot with 9 mm and .45-caliber  
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next five hours, the mayor and police did not know where  
Barton was and SWAT teams and helicopters swarmed Buckhead to look 
for him. Police told workers to stay in their offices and lock the 
doors; some huddled in their cubicles four hours after the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put the furniture up against the door and barricaded  
ourselves in,'' said Morgan Lyle, 51. ``We had no idea what was 
going on so we just got really quiet and tried to stay calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rampage ended when Barton shot himself as police cornered  
him in a dark green minivan at a service station in Atlanta's 
northern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pulled over, and then killed himself,'' Campbell said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Barton's 27-year-old wife, Leigh Ann, and  
children, 11-year-old Matthew and 7-year-old Elizabeth Mychelle, 
were found in their home in Stockbridge, 16 miles southeast of 
Atlanta. Police said they had been bludgeoned to death perhaps as 
long as two days before the office shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's bodies were in their beds, with sheets pulled up  
to their necks and towels around their heads so only their faces 
showed, said Jimmy Mercer, police chief in Henry County. Mrs. 
Barton's body was in a closet. 
</P>
<P>
	A handwritten note was left on each body and a  
computer-generated note left in the living room explained ``why he 
did what he did,'' Mercer said. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's first wife and mother-in-law were bludgeoned to death  
in 1993 in Cedar Bluff, Ala. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was,''  
said Richard Igou, the district attorney at the time of the 
killings. The current prosecutor declined to say whether Barton was 
still a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton worked as a chemist before he began trading stocks,  
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had swings up and down,'' said the mayor. ``He apparently  
was concerned about losses, at least expressed that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech requires each day trader to put up at least $50,000 in  
equity to open an account. To cope with the stress, the company 
employs a psychotherapist to help traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is still reeling from earlier shootings, including a  
domestic dispute July 12 that left seven people dead. In May, a 
15-year-old student shot six students in nearby Conyers, none 
fatally.

<HEADLINE> Infant Clothing Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 68,000 infant ``creeper'' short-sleeved  
body suits are being recalled by Shopko Stores because they have 
defective snaps that can detach and choke children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday the suits  
have two snaps on the left shoulder and three snaps at the crotch 
that easily can be removed. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries have been reported but ``the creepers should be  
returned to the store for a refund,'' said commission spokeswoman 
Nychelle Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
	Shopko Stores of Green Bay, Wis., sold the clothing,  
manufactured in solid and stripe fabrics, from last December to 
June for sizes newborn to 24 months.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Limo Driver Found Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTLAND, Mich. (AP) -- The driver of the limousine that crashed  
two years ago, severely injuring two members of the Detroit Red 
Wings, was found guilty Friday of drunken driving in an unrelated 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Gnida, 29, could face up to one year in jail and a  
$1,000 fine. His license would be revoked for five years, and he 
could be required to perform 90 days' community service. 
</P>
<P>
	A $2,500 bond set after his July 2 arrest in Westland was  
revoked. He was sent to the Wayne County Jail pending an Aug. 18 
sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Gnida's third drunken drinking conviction, assistant  
prosecutor Thomas Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wayne County officer who pulled over Gnida testified  
Thursday that he smelled alcohol on his breath. Deputy Timothy 
Mengel said he thought Gnida might be drunk because he had just 
left a bar and had run a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said a breath test showed Gnida's blood-alcohol  
level was 0.12 percent when he was arrested. The legal threshold 
for intoxicated driving in Michigan is 0.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Gnida's license was revoked in January 1996 following two  
drunken driving convictions. He got it back April 19, a month after 
he was released from jail following a probation violation related 
to the Red Wings crash on June 13, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei  
Mnatsakanov received disabling head injuries in the 1997 accident. 
A second player, Viacheslav Fetisov, also was injured.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Death Toll Climbs to 86 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Hector Soto uses the shade to keep track  
of time this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m., the parking lot attendant escapes the heat in the  
shadow of a tree. When the patch recedes at noon, he follows it. An 
hour later, he relies on another temporary spot of cool by the 
guard house on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
	By 3 p.m. there's no place left to hide, and the black pavement  
feels like it's burning through his sandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start to get really dizzy,'' Soto said Thursday as the  
temperatures crept toward 90 degrees. ``You just try to sit still 
in the coolest place you can find and drink a lot of water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This summer's unrelenting heat has been sapping energy from  
outdoor workers, drying up crops and turning forests into kindling 
across Connecticut and elsewhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 86 deaths in 15 states have been blamed on the heat  
wave that has gripped much of country since July 19, as 
temperatures linger in the 90s and 100s. Missouri has the highest 
death toll at 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat was expected to last at least until today before a  
change in the jet stream brings cooler air from Canada to northern 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures reached the 90s from the Plains to the East Coast  
on Thursday, with the heat index -- a measure of temperature and 
humidity -- breaking 100 in many places. 
</P>
<P>
	To the north, the weather was even worse. It was 111 in Pierre,  
S.D., topping the record of 109 set in 1933. The temperature was a 
record-tying 104 in Bismarck, N.D., and an all-time high of 103 in 
Dickinson, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, a 6-year-old girl appeared to be one of the latest  
victims. Her body was found Thursday afternoon in her bedroom in 
the family's mobile home in Grove. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no air conditioning or fans, and the windows of the  
trailer were closed,'' said Dr. Robert Hopper, the acting medical 
examiner. ``It was hard to breathe just walking in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air conditioning has become a necessity for many trying to beat  
the heat. But for people whose jobs force them to stay outside, 
getting a steady stream of cool air is a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last summer you could work 10 hours a day with no problem,''  
said Angel Santos, a Hartford, Conn. landscaper. ``This year you 
can't even stay out for seven hours. My reward is going home, 
putting on the air conditioner and chilling the house to 65 
degrees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Greenfield, Wis., Scott Lewitzke, the landscape manager for  
Bluemel's Garden Center and Greenhouse, said the heat means less 
productivity for his workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys just work at a much slower pace,'' Lewitzke said. ``If  
you get 50 percent productivity, you're lucky. And you can't expect 
much more in the heat -- they'll pass out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Near Mamuelle, Ark., where temperatures rose above 100 Thursday,  
roadside vendor Carolyn Archer has closed down her vegetable and 
fruit stand early each day this week to avoid the afternoon heat. 
For the time when she is outside, she has tools to keep cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have an ice chest full of ice, water, juice and plenty of  
wash rags to dig down there to keep cool,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For people lucky enough to have access to fans and air  
conditioning, power companies urged them to conserve energy, 
fearing potential blackouts or brownouts due to consumer overload. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the Kentucky's largest utilities made a special plea to  
their largest customers. Both utilities set all-time peak-usage 
records for the fourth time since July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response has been very favorable,'' said Joel Reuter, a  
spokesman for LG&AMP;E Energy Corp., the Louisville-based parent of the 
two utilities. ``I think that people and industry in the Midwest 
understand that this gripping heat wave has put a tremendous amount 
of pressure on electrical utilities in the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was bothered by the heat. In Grand Rapids, Mich.,  
where temperatures reached 95, Jim Pikaart stood in the shade 
outside a coffee shop -- while sipping tea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where I'm from, it's been really hot and really dry. This is  
really nice and breezy,'' said the Summersville, W. Va., resident. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minnesota, it reached 98 degrees on Thursday, tying a record  
set in 1933. Still, Dana Buffie spent most of her day under the sun 
riding a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents don't understand, either,'' said the 26-year-old  
said. ``I think it's beautiful. I love being out in this weather -- 
blue skies, hot and people everywhere. I like to see bodies out, 
skin exposed, people's faces.''

<HEADLINE>  Taliban: bin Laden Not Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- The Taliban government today denied a  
report that Osama bin Laden, who tops the FBI's 10 Most Wanted 
list, was planning to leave Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a totally baseless report that Osama has either left or  
is planning to leave Afghanistan,'' Maulwi Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil, 
the Islamic militia's most senior spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Afghan Islamic Press reported today that bin Laden  
has decided to leave Afghanistan and seek sanctuary in another 
Islamic country because of fears the United States might attack 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports last week that people were fleeing the  
outskirts of Jalalabad, where bin Laden reportedly was hiding out. 
Local Taliban officials denied any such exodus, and the city 
appeared to be bustling normally earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden is in Afghanistan under tight security, said  
Mutawakil, who refused to divulge his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been a guest of Afghan people since the Afghan jihad  
(holy war) against the Soviet forces and will remain so,'' the 
Taliban spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. court has indicted bin Laden for allegedly masterminding  
the bombing of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa in July 1998 that 
killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	He escaped a U.S. cruise missile attack on his hideout in  
eastern Afghanistan last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban, who control more than 90 percent of war-ravaged  
Afghanistan, have rejected Washington's demand that bin Laden be 
extradited. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutawakil said bin Laden was not allowed to carry out any  
political activities from Afghanistan or even give press 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue cropped up as the Taliban are engaged in a major  
offensive against the northern-based opposition alliance that 
controls about 10 percent of the country.

<HEADLINE> Display Spans Centuries of Black Art </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A painting by a free black artist of a white  
family in a slave state almost 200 years ago highlights a display 
of African-American work that opens Saturday at the Corcoran 
Gallery of Art. 
</P>
<P>
	Little is known about the artist, Joshua Johnson, who called  
himself a ``self-taught genius.'' He painted in Baltimore from 1797 
to 1825 and is the first known black artist in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``He painted both blacks and whites and advertised his services  
in the newspapers,'' said Renee Ater, the Corcoran's assistant 
curator of American Art, discussing the exhibit Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corcoran owns his portrait of Mrs. Hugh McCurdy and her two  
young daughters, one of about 80 known paintings by him -- many of 
them featuring prosperous Baltimore families. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Laughter Can Help When Facing Grief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Go to any bookstore and you'll find loads of  
advice on coping with the death of a loved one, how to ``work 
through'' grief. But psychologist George Bonanno contends there's 
little science to back up much of the advice. 
</P>
<P>
	So he set out to study bereavement -- and found that contrary to  
much of the self-help grief industry, some people may find laughter 
helps. 
</P>
<P>
	Not forced laughter. Bonanno's not advising anyone to peddle  
jokes to the bereaved. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Catholic University professor studied recent widows and  
widowers by videotaping them as they recalled their spouse. He says 
those who were able to give a heartfelt laugh once or twice during 
the reminiscence appeared to cope better over time. 
</P>
<P>
	A polite ``social'' smile or laugh -- yes, scientists can tell  
the difference -- didn't count. Those people coped worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the bereavement literature, laughter and  
positive emotions are almost never mentioned,'' Bonanno said. When 
it is, ``it's generally viewed with great suspicion, as a form of 
denial or avoiding, which is very odd, I think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some psychologists look askance at Bonanno's contention. Others  
call his studies groundbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, psychologists agree there's no one way to grieve.  
It's an intensely personal time that everyone handles differently. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's important to learn if Bonanno's right.  
</P>
<P>
	``It suggests those in the support network should be tolerant  
and recognize that if the bereaved laugh over reminiscences, this 
is perfectly natural and normal,'' said Camille Wortman, a 
psychologist at the State University of New York, Stonybrook. 
``Further, they might do things to encourage reminiscences, such as 
recalling an interesting or amusing story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People don't think it's normal?  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, they can be pretty judgmental, says Wortman, who  
studies parents who have lost young children. She recalled the 
mother of an infant who died of sudden infant death syndrome. The 
mother, trying to keep life more normal for her older child, gave 
the sibling a birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother ``was extremely hurt to hear a neighbor say, 'How can  
she be throwing a party at a time like this?''' Wortman said. 
``When people are making an attempt to show positive emotion and be 
happy, it's important to support them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, hearing Bonanno describe it, laughter seems a  
subconscious tool that mourners may find draws more support from 
friends, who typically are uncomfortable around the grieving and 
thus may avoid them. 
</P>
<P>
	``In bereavement, people tend to feel this utter aloneness,''  
said Bonanno. Laughter helps ``bond you to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly laughter is part of some grief rituals. Think of the  
Irish wake, or those New Orleans funeral processions where friends 
woefully parade behind the casket before wildly celebrating the 
deceased's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonanno, in studies funded by the National Institutes of Health,  
focused more on personal handling of grief. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides videotaping widows and widowers, he followed them for  
two years with standard psychological questionnaires to see how 
they coped. 
</P>
<P>
	Dacher Keltner of the University of California, Berkeley, is a  
specialist in facial expressions who analyzed the tapes. It's very 
hard to fake genuine positive emotions -- heartfelt smiles and 
laughter include not just the mouth but specific muscles around the 
eyes that scientists can track. 
</P>
<P>
	The mourners' grief clearly showed, but Keltner spotted those  
who did give a heartfelt laugh or two. Some recalled an amusing 
story. Some laughed after an angry memory, a tool Bonanno said 
reaches out to listeners to say, ``I'm angry but I'm in control, 
I'm going to be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonanno found those people scored better on his coping tests.  
</P>
<P>
	How does he know mourners who laughed weren't already coping  
better, which is why they could laugh? The questionnaires measured 
mourners' initial levels of grief so Bonanno could control for 
that, but he has more studies planned for better evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many well-intentioned people ... may feel that they have a  
duty to honor the deceased and the pain of loss with somber 
reassurances,'' he advises this month in a British journal for 
therapists. ``Warm support coupled with the encouragement to laugh 
now and then may be equally as important, if not imperative.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Urged on Airline Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government plan to crack down on predatory  
practices within the airline industry is flawed and the 
Transportation Department should take other steps to boost 
competition, says a report to Congress released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Research Council, in a study commissioned by the  
department, said airline competition could be improved by dropping 
flight restrictions at popular airports in New York, Chicago and 
Washington, and by creating special ``congestion fees'' that would 
raise extra money for gate and terminal construction. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the council said the federal government should end  
its prohibition against foreign investment in and ownership of U.S. 
airlines. Doing so ``could result in more seed money for start-up 
carriers, putting them in a stronger position to compete for 
customers,'' said a statement issued with the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report stems from efforts by both the department and  
Congress to improve airline competition in order to increase 
flights to small and medium communities and reduce airfares 
throughout the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, amid allegations that major airlines were squashing  
discount rivals, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater proposed a 
set of guidelines for determining if airlines were engaging in 
unfair practices. The airlines panned the proposal and, after 
debate, Congress asked instead for a new assessment of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department had no immediate response to the  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	John Meenan of the Air Transport Association, a trade group  
representing the nation's major airlines, said the group had not 
yet seen the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Research Council is the principle operating arm of  
the National Academy of Sciences, which provides advice on science 
and technology under a congressional charter. The council last 
studied airline competition in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The new committee's 11 members includes Alfred Kahn, a Cornell  
University economics professor who has been dubbed ``the father of 
airline deregulation'' for his work on the issue in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	In its report, the committee unanimously agreed that the  
Transportation Department's proposed competition guidelines were 
``flawed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1998, the department promised to block airline actions  
-- taken in response to new competition -- that officials deemed 
unreasonable. Such a policy, the committee said, ``could lead to 
regulations that would stifle competition more than encourage it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee members split over remedies, however. Some favored  
having the department be more aggressive with existing laws against 
tactics aimed solely at driving out competition. Others favored 
having the Justice Department take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said the Transportation Department should try to  
``steer air traffic away from the nation's busiest airports and 
toward secondary airports in major cities. ... A recommended tool 
to achieve this is a system that would charge airlines fees for 
using congested airports during peak periods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such fees, the committee said, would provide revenue for airport  
construction and reduce delays caused by overcrowded gates. New 
gates also would break the grip that dominant airlines have on 
existing gates. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also said takeoff and landing limits in Chicago,  
New York and Washington airports, as well as a 1,250-mile limit on 
the length of flights to and from Reagan National Airport in 
Washington, are barriers to competition by new airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines also received criticism. The committee complained that  
carriers that give bonus commissions to travel agents who steer 
business to them can inhibit consumer access to the lowest fares. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said the department should consider rules to govern how  
flights are displayed in computer reservations systems so all 
airlines have an equal chance for business.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Pay Fine in Contempt Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- After five years of court battles and  
almost $1 million in remuneration from President Clinton, it's now 
up to Paula Jones' legal team to decide whether to push for more or 
put an end to her claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers say the president is willing to comply with a  
federal court order Thursday to pay about $90,000 in penalties for 
giving false testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	But some in Mrs. Jones' camp, who had sought nearly $500,000,  
say they may appeal for more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel the court vastly underestimated the reasonable amount  
of time'' spent working on perjury and obstruction-of-justice 
issues, the Dallas-based law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pyke 
said in a statement. ``In sum, we continue to assert that Ms. 
Jones' attorneys are entitled to the full amount of fees claimed, 
if not more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Lavallee, administrator of Clinton's legal fund, said the  
trustees wouldn't consider whether they could use the money they've 
raised for legal fees to pay the president's fine unless Clinton 
tells them he wants them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The award by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright was on top  
of $850,000 Clinton paid to Mrs. Jones to settle the sexual 
harassment lawsuit she brought against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's testimony in the case led to his impeachment by the  
U.S. House and eventual acquittal in a Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge in April issued a historic contempt ruling against  
Clinton and said she would order him to pay for costs that resulted 
from ``false, misleading and evasive answers'' in his January 1998 
deposition in Mrs. Jones' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers argued that a reasonable sanction should  
be in the range of $12,300 to $33,737. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawyers, meanwhile, had requested $496,358 to cover  
costs incurred after Clinton's deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	In her order, Wright said the lawyers' claims were ``excessive  
and must be reduced.'' She denied compensation for various news 
conferences held by Mrs. Jones' lawyers, as well as attorney 
expenses associated with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's probe 
of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge limited the sanctions to the costs most directly  
associated with Clinton's testimony about Ms. Lewinsky, beginning 
after a written statement he gave on Dec. 23, 1997. The judge said 
about 20 percent of Clinton's Jan. 17, 1998, deposition dealt with 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas firm said Thursday that it could have sought more  
than $1 million, ``so the fees we requested are clearly fair and 
reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute, a conservative group  
in Charlottesville, Va., that also represented Mrs. Jones' team, 
said he was pleased that Clinton was penalized but might appeal the 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
	John DiPippa, a constitutional law professor who has closely  
watched the case, said Mrs. Jones' lawyers should consider $90,000 
a victory and put an end to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the Jones attorneys come out better here in the  
end than the president,'' said DiPippa of the University of 
Arkansas at Little Rock. ``(The judge) took a more generous view 
than the president's attorneys and did so as a way to send a 
message to the president's lawyers and other attorneys that they 
shouldn't act like this in deposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright wrote in her order that she took ``no pleasure in  
imposing contempt sanctions'' against Clinton, but they were 
necessary to ``redress the president's misconduct and to deter 
others who might consider emulating the president's misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas law firm was awarded $79,999 and the Rutherford  
Institute $9,485. The judge also ordered Clinton to pay the court 
$1,202 for her trip to Washington at the president's request to 
preside over his deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	In her lawsuit, Mrs. Jones claimed that Clinton made an unwanted  
sexual advance in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991 while he was 
Arkansas governor and she was a state employee. Wright dismissed 
her suit on April 1, 1998, but Clinton agreed to the $850,000 
settlement after Mrs. Jones appealed the dismissal. Clinton 
admitted no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones lawyers' drew Ms. Lewinsky into the case in an  
attempt to show a pattern of sexual misconduct by Clinton.

<HEADLINE> NBA Officials Enforce Ignored Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- No blood, no foul? Not this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	Whistles are blowing and players are grumbling in the NBA's  
summer leagues, where officials are using a by-the-book approach to 
experimental rules aimed at boosting offense. Long-ignored rules 
are being enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're calling the rules very literally. That's their job  
right now,'' said Portland coach Mike Dunleavy, watching his team 
of rookies and regular-season bench-warmers at the Rocky Mountain 
Revue. 
</P>
<P>
	A defender who uses a hand check or a forearm is immediately  
whistled for a foul. Likewise, an offensive player who moves while 
setting a screen will get tagged with a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	Another experimental rule bars defenders from impeding offensive  
players cutting through the lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Try guarding Shaquille O'Neal in the low post without a forearm  
in his back, or stop Allen Iverson off the dribble without a hand 
check. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players are used to putting their hands on people and moving  
them around,'' Sacramento coach Rick Adelman said. ``If they're not 
allowed to do that, it's going to make it much harder to guard 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One rule seeks to make illegal defense guidelines more  
understandable. Another sets the shot clock at 14 seconds after 
fouls or out-of-bounds plays in the frontcourt, rather than the 
usual 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA director of officiating Ed Rush said the changes are  
intended to reinvigorate the plodding offenses of the 1990s, 
returning the league to the 100-point games that were the norm in 
earlier decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the best athletes in the world,'' Rush said from the  
NBA offices in New York. ``Quickness and pure athleticism are big 
parts of basketball. We want to make sure our athletes have the 
chance to showcase their talents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it backfired last week as play during some Salt Lake City  
games was agonizingly slow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Jazz summer team had 49 fouls in one 40-minute game,  
the typical total in an NBA game for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Rush stressed no decision has been made on using the rules in  
the regular season. A 16-member committee of past and present 
players, coaches and front-office officials will meet before the 
season to evaluate the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will it make a difference if they call it like this during the  
regular season?'' Antonio Daniels of the San Antonio Spurs asked. 
``Without question. I think you'll see a lot of guys in foul 
trouble. A lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Daniels found a silver lining.  
</P>
<P>
	``On defense, you have to play with your feet and do more than  
using your hands,'' he said. ``Offensively, if you're quicker than 
somebody who's guarding you, it gives you a huge advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches and players at the Rocky Mountain Revue were reluctant  
to publicly criticize the experiment, but most agreed there's been 
plenty of griping in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Better to try it out here than in the regular season,''  
Adelman said. ``Everybody's going to complain. Players and coaches 
just have to adjust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels agrees players will have to deal with any changes.  
</P>
<P>
	``This takes you back to the fundamental way basketball is  
supposed to be played,'' Daniels said. ``Whether you like it or not 
is irrelevant. If they change the rules, you deal with it.''

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Nominees Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A friend and former aide to the Senate  
Judiciary Committee chairman and the sister of a well-known New 
York real estate developer are among the latest nominees for 
federal judgeships approved by the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. envoy to a regional multinational organization also is  
among the group, whose nominations advanced Thursday to the full 
Senate for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House only this week announced it had chosen Ted  
Stewart to be a U.S. District judge in Utah. He is an aide to the 
state's governor and friend and former employee of Sen. Orrin 
Hatch, R-Utah, the committee's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart is opposed by some Democrats and environmentalists, and  
Hatch had stalled action on President Clinton's judicial nominees 
for months because of a deadlock with the administration over 
Stewart's selection. Hatch resumed confirmation hearings in June 
after saying Clinton had assured him that Stewart would be 
nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Stewart, three candidates for the federal appeals  
court and four for district court vacancies in New York and 
California won approval Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee voted 10-8 to elevate U.S. District Judge Richard  
Paez of Los Angeles -- first nominated in January 1996 -- to the 9th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The other seven nominations were approved by voice votes. All of  
the names moved to the Senate, but action there was not likely 
before the August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven judicial nominations were pending in the Senate in advance  
of Thursday's committee votes, bringing the total awaiting final 
confirmation to 15, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine judges have been confirmed this year, compared with 33 by  
this time last year, said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the 
committee's senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still remain well behind the pace of last year, but over  
the last few weeks we have been making progress,'' Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a lawyer, served on Utah's Public Service Commission  
and was executive director of its Commerce and Natural Resources 
departments. At the resources agency, he criticized environmental 
groups and opposed federal land policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents cited the fact that Stewart never has tried a case and  
is listed as ``inactive'' by the Utah State Bar. His defenders say 
he gained judicial experience during his seven-year stint at the 
public service commission. The American Bar Association found him 
qualified to be a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who know Ted know he will continue to serve the public  
well,'' Hatch said Thursday at an earlier hearing on seven of the 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Paez's nomination also has been controversial.  
</P>
<P>
	A Hispanic, Paez angered conservatives with his outspoken  
opposition to two California ballot initiatives that ended many 
state affirmative action programs and excluded many illegal 
immigrants from government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The other nominees approved are:  
</P>
<P>
	--U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry of New Jersey to the  
3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. She is the sister of real estate 
mogul Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raymond C. Fisher of California to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court  
of appeals. A lawyer, Fisher has been an associate U.S. attorney 
general since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	--Victor Marrero of New York to be a U.S. District judge for the  
Southern District of New York. A native of Santurce, Puerto Rico, 
and a former Fulbright Scholar, Marrero is U.S. ambassador to the 
Organization of American States. 
</P>
<P>
	--U.S. Magistrate Naomi Reice Buchwald of New York to be a U.S.  
District judge for the Southern District of New York. A former 
assistant U.S. attorney, Buchwald became a magistrate in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	--U.S. Magistrate David N. Hurd of New York to be a U.S. District  
judge for the Northern District of New York. He has been a 
magistrate since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Tax Bill Has Special-Interest Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Companies that produce electricity from  
poultry waste, Vermont maple syrup tappers and Alaskan fishermen 
and others would benefit if special-interest provisions of the 
Senate tax bill become law. 
</P>
<P>
	As with most tax bills, lawmakers add language to help  
constituents and promote favorite causes, some that didn't make it 
as individual pieces of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans' $792 billion tax cut package that passed the  
Senate on Friday and now goes to a House-Senate conference 
committee is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a presidential hopeful, issued his  
traditional statement criticizing special-interest provisions, 
although he liked enough of the bill to vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can we justify giving a $33 million tax break next year to  
companies producing electricity from chicken waste?'' McCain asked, 
when some working Social Security recipients have trouble making 
ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The poultry-waste electricity tax credit was added to the bill  
by Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Individuals with foreign addresses would be exempt from paying a  
7.5 percent air passenger ticket tax on frequent flier miles, a 
provision McCain said would cost $238 million over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, successfully attached provisions to  
help fishermen in his state through difficult harvest periods. 
</P>
<P>
	About five million Americans who are self-employed could deduct  
100 percent of their health insurance premiums as of next Jan. 1 
under a provision sponsored by Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont Sens. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, and James Jeffords, a  
Republican, co-sponsored language to help a much smaller group: 
maple syrup foresters in Vermont. They would benefit from a change 
in the threshold for paying unemployment tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of nonprofit organizations would benefit from an  
environmental cleanup tax break sponsored by Sen. Jim Bunning, 
R-Ky. It would give relief to nonprofits forced to clean up 
hazardous waste on property they owned before the Superfund cleanup 
law took effect. At least one and possibly two Kentucky 
organizations would benefit, along with a handful in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to ease estate taxes, Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., had  
a provision attached to expand tax breaks for land kept from 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Restaurant Association praised a provision to  
extend the Work Opportunity Tax Credit for five years. One in four 
restaurants utilize the program to employ and train former welfare 
recipients, the organization said.

<HEADLINE> British Newspaper Deal Worth $1.98B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Trinity has won the battle for the Mirror Group,  
reaching a deal to acquire the publisher of the tabloid Daily 
Mirror for $1.98 billion in stock and cash 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, to be called Trinity Mirror, will be Britain's  
largest regional newspaper company, with 155 newspapers that have a 
weekly circulation of more than 15.3 million and a daily 
circulation of 2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merged group will have enhanced scale and financial  
strength providing a strong platform for future expansion,'' 
Trinity chairman Peter Birch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is expected to yield annual cost savings of $24  
million by the end of 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal appears to shut the door on a potential third bid for  
Mirror, by an ousted former chief executive of Mirror Group, David 
Montgomery, who said last week he was trying to arrange backing for 
an offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity will pay the equivalent of $4.34 per Mirror share, well  
above the roughly $3.20 offered by rival bidder Regional 
Independent Media. Trinity shareholders will own 48.4 percent of 
the new company, with Mirror investors holding 51.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity chief executive Phil Graf will become head of the new  
group, while Trinity's finance director, Mike Masters, will be 
responsible for regional newspapers. Mirror's head of national 
newspapers, Roger Eastoe, will keep that role in the new business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strategic fit between our two businesses enables us to  
build further on our market-leading positions,'' Mirror Chairman 
Victor Blank said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Stephen Byers approved  
the deal last week on condition that Trinity sell off its four 
newspapers in Northern Ireland, where Mirror Group already owns 
several titles. Byers said he was concerned that there needed to be 
a diverse ownership of newspapers in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition still needs approval from shareholders and  
British regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity's papers include the Western Mail, the Liverpool Echo  
and Daily Post and the Newcastle Journal. Mirror Group owns 
Scotland's Daily Record and Sunday Mail along with the Daily 
Mirror.

<HEADLINE> Ray, Calkins: Fitness Key at Dover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Even if the fastest car wins the MBNA  
Mid-Atlantic 200 at Dover Downs International Speedway, Indy Racing 
League drivers Greg Ray and Buzz Calkins are convinced the fittest 
driver will be a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's hot and you test here, you're whipped after 40  
laps,'' said Ray, one of a growing number of physical culturists on 
the circuit. ``On Sunday, we've got to run 200, and that's going to 
be tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the current weather pattern of excessively high heat and  
humidity on the East Coast changes unexpectedly, IRL drivers will 
battle fatigue and its chief derivative -- lack of concentration -- 
as well as each other on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, who got his lone IRL victory last month in Fountain, Colo.,  
has a strict workout regimen he says is invaluable in maintaining 
stamina in the race car. The day before he won at Pikes Peak 
International Raceway, Ray took an 18-mile hike through the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped him combat the effect of the mile-high altitude in  
the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. But the temperature was not 
flirting with the century mark, as it had been for the last week in 
Dover. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get tired much more easily,'' said Ray, a Texan who knows  
plenty about heat and humidity. ``When you are overcome by fatigue, 
you make mistakes. Those two things go hand in hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, who tries to jog several miles every day, gets no argument  
from Calkins -- perhaps the best runner among all the world's 
drivers. He competed this year in the New York City Marathon, 
posting a middle-of-the-pack finish in just above 4 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your heart rate in a race car under green conditions is about  
150-160 beats per minute,'' said Calkins, who won the inaugural IRL 
race and shared the first championship in 1996 with defending Dover 
race champion Scott Sharp. ``It's about the same for a marathon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calkins says people who don't race are surprised by that. Also  
points out that the battle between gravity and centrifugal force on 
the body on a banked track cannot be realized in a passenger 
vehicle on a flat roadway. 
</P>
<P>
	And Calkins insists that the sleek open-wheel cars used in the  
IRL are designed for nothing more than speed. There is no comfort. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people envision it like a street car, with power  
steering, with springs and shocks that absorb the bumps real 
well,'' he said. ``We don't have that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're basically taking shots, and in the corners of  
high-banked tracks like this we're subjected to about 4 Gs with 
5,000 pounds of downforce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calkins says there is virtually no time to relax because much of  
the one-mile surface is comprised of turns banked at 24 degrees. 
Most of a 19-second lap at better than 180 mph is spent setting up, 
running through and exiting these turns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally and physically, a place like this really taps you,''  
Ray said. ``The guys who are the best qualifiers might not be the 
guys you'll see running for it at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calkins plans to be one of them. He can't predict race  
circumstances, but says he won't lose because he isn't ready for 
the physical demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the beginning of the race there's considerable stress with  
so many cars on the track,'' he said. ``Later, after attrition 
takes its toll, that stress becomes a battle with fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I want to do is stay out of trouble and be there at the  
end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray hopes for the same scenario, but says that a narrow track  
with such high banking and sharp turns presents a set of problems 
not common to most layouts on which the IRL races. With that in 
mind, he has trained especially hard for his appointment with The 
Monster Mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not interested in defeating The Monster when you  
work out, then The Monster will eat you up,'' Ray said.

<HEADLINE> Barton's Mother Sensed Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUMTER, S.C. (AP) -- The day before Mark O. Barton's killing  
spree, he called his mother, who noticed something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The conversation Wednesday ``kind of upset'' Gladys Barton and  
left her worried about her only child's mental state, said close 
friend Zelma Hutchinson. Mrs. Barton said her son was suffering 
from depression. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Barton, 44, shot and killed nine people in two  
Atlanta office buildings. He also bludgeoned his wife and two 
children to death and killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply saddened by the events that have taken place over  
the past several days,'' Mrs. Barton, 77, said in a statement 
released Friday that she said would be her only comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no explanation for tragedy such as this. I have been  
praying for the victims and their families. Even though I am deeply 
hurt by the actions of my son, Mark, I loved him very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton grew up in Sumter on a street lined with pecan and  
magnolia trees. He didn't leave much of mark on the town, the home 
of sprawling Shaw Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton graduated from Sumter High in 1973. Beth Edwards, who  
helped organize the class' 25th reunion in 1998, said she didn't 
remember him. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's yearbook photos had his name wrong twice -- he was  
``Jack Barton'' in 1971 and ``Mack Barton'' in 1972. His picture is 
missing his senior year and his school involvement was listed 
simply as ``Merit Scholars Semi Finalist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was ``highly intelligent, much, much more intelligent than  
most people,'' said Cindy Haley, who attended Sunday school with 
Barton at St. John's United Methodist Church for several years. 
``He was very quiet, kind of a loner. I don't remember him having 
many friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1979  
with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. None of the 18 chemistry 
professors who were there then and are still at the school could 
recall Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	School spokesman Russ McKinney said Barton had not had any  
contact with the university's alumni association. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's father, Truman, died almost two years ago. Mrs.  
Barton's neighbors said her son used to visit his family about 
every two weeks most summers, but had not been to Sumter this 
summer.

<HEADLINE> Study: 1/3 of Russians in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- More than one in three Russians is living below  
the official poverty line, according to government figures released 
Friday, the latest sign of the wreckage left by last year's 
economic meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
	About 35 percent of the population, or 51.7 million people,  
received monthly salaries below Russia's minimum subsistence level 
of 872 rubles ($36) during the first half of the year, the Russian 
Statistics Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	That figure was up from 22 percent living in poverty during the  
same period last year, when the minimum monthly subsistence level 
averaged out to about 429 rubles ($71 at the time). 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists say the figure overstates the poverty problem  
somewhat because many Russians make money in the economy's informal 
sector and don't declare their income to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the figures reflect the dramatic decline in living  
standards that has been taking place throughout this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial crash last August resulted in widespread job  
layoffs and pay cuts, sent inflation soaring, and pushed millions 
more into poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	In more fallout from the crisis, imports crashed by 46 percent  
in the first six months of 1999, while exports fell by 11 percent, 
the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ruble devaluation, many imports became prohibitively  
expensive for Russians. The agency didn't give exact foreign-trade 
volumes, but monthly figures show exports totaled $34.4 billion 
against imports of $19.6 billion, for a trade surplus at around 
$14.8 billion for the first half of the year. Russia's trade 
surplus was just $900 million from January to June of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Ballpark Promo Targets Moms-To-Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOWELL, Mass. (AP) -- In a sport that seems to have labor  
problems every nine months, maybe ``Birth Night'' isn't such a 
strange idea after all. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest twist on old-time ballpark promotions, the Class A  
Lowell Spinners invited expectant mothers to Thursday night's game 
and offered a year's supply of diapers to the woman who delivered 
first. None went into labor during the game, but the Spinners are 
in contact with local hospitals so that the winner will eventually 
get her prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must say there were a couple that were very low when they  
came in,'' said Linda Jezek, a childbirth educator who led the 
packed house in breathing exercises between innings. ``One of them 
is overdue, so I think she's the favorite. I'd definitely be 
betting on her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 5,000 -- and threatening to expand at any minute --  
cheered the mothers along, voted on potential names and tried to 
guess the time of the first delivery. But by the time Lowell had 
finished beating the Vermont Expos 7-2, none of the women reported 
so much as a contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's even warming up at this point,'' said Dr. Ed Lipman,  
who was standing by along with four paramedics and a fleet of 
ambulances. ``The most we've seen is some discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
	``No woman at full term is comfortable for more than seven  
minutes in any one position. There have been a lot of trips to the 
bathroom,'' he said. ``And maybe the (ice cream) line is a little 
longer tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although 40 couples called the team to inquire about the  
promotion, 30 showed up and registered for the contest. As they 
checked in, they were told what to do in case they went into labor: 
call an usher and he'll summon the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Joann Weber said one man called Thursday morning  
while his wife was in labor in the next room. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `If she hasn't given birth by then, can I wheel her  
in in a wheelchair?''' Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `This is your first baby, right?'  
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Yes.'  
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him if he discussed it with his wife, and he said,  
`No.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `You talk to your wife. If she thinks this is as good  
an idea as you do, it would be our pleasure to have you.' I'd like 
to be a fly on the wall for that one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not call back.  
</P>
<P>
	The original guru of the giveaway day was former White Sox,  
Indians and St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck, who used prizes to 
lure children to the ballpark, then made his money back on all the 
peanuts and hot dogs they ate while waiting for the game to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Veeck gave away bats, balls and caps. As the idea spread, the  
gifts expanded to beach sandals, beanie babies and even haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, though, publicity-starved teams have taken the  
idea to new heights -- or lows-- like the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' 
``Lawyer Appreciation Night,'' when attorneys were charged double 
and billed by the third of an inning. On Conversion Day, Tampa Bay 
fans were rewarded for getting rid of New York Yankees caps. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Spinners, it's promotions like this that make  
minor-league baseball a fun, inexpensive alternative to the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try sometimes to make people enjoy baseball who might not  
be the consummate baseball fans,'' owner Drew Weber said. ``I see a 
lot of kids smiling, and that's what it's all about to me.''

<P>
	INTERLAKEN, Switzerland (AP) -- More relatives of young  
adventurers killed in a flash flood in the Swiss Alps flew to 
Switzerland Friday to help with the grim task of identifying badly 
battered bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have officially named only five of the 19 people who  
were swept away as they bodysurfed down the fast-running Saxeten 
Brook on Tuesday near this central Alpine resort. Rescuers 
continued Friday to look for two people still missing, and used 
underwater cameras and dogs and earthmoving equipment to search 
higher up the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they were formally investigating whether five  
guides on the expedition are guilty of negligent homicide for not 
taking notice of a pending storm. Three other guides who went with 
the group of 45 vacationers were killed in the flood. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the victims: A couple on their honeymoon. A doctor taking  
a break from his South African practice. One of the tour's bus 
drivers who decided to join his passengers for a bit of fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was supposed to be an adventure and it was something we  
just didn't expect,'' survivor Jodie Marshall told Channel Nine 
news. ``We're thankful that we're here, but we just have lost some 
really great friends and it will always be with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a watersports instructor who worked for the company  
which arranged the activity, Adventure World, was quoted Friday as 
saying he had left the company because of concerns over safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Erikson, a New Zealander, said, ``Profit was more important  
to the people running the firm than the safety of the guides and 
participants,'' the daily Basler Zeitung reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists were ``canyoning,'' a new extreme sport in which  
participants slide, jump or rappel down waterfalls and mountain 
streams into gorges without rafts. 
</P>
<P>
	The last of the six people injured in the accident left the  
hospital Friday.

	A memorial service is scheduled for Thursday in Interlaken.

<HEADLINE> Angry Umpires Blaming Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- One of the National League umpires let go this  
week said Friday the minor league umps taking over are the 
equivalent of ``scabs'' and blamed two AL umps for splitting the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Tata, an NL crew chief who is among the 22 umpires being  
forced out Sept. 2, said AL umps Joe Brinkman and John Hirschbeck 
caused the union's strategy of mass resignations to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be solid as a rock, and these guys have turned into  
pebbles,'' Tata, a 27-season veteran, said in Milwaukee before the 
Brewers played the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	Tata's crew was the hardest hit, losing three of its four  
umpires. Tom Hallion and Bill Hohn also were among the 13 umps told 
Thursday that their resignations had been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion said the actions by Brinkman and Hirschbeck affected all  
umpires. Fourteen of the dissident umpires issued a statement 
Thursday blaming the union's leadership, which is headed by 
negotiator Richie Phillips and union president Jerry Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about families getting ruined,'' Hallion said. ``If  
you're a human being -- I don't care if you're an umpire or a steel 
worker -- put it aside. What they're doing isn't right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brinkman said in Toronto that he stands by his actions.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel sorry for Tata, but I can't support a flawed  
strategy,'' he said. ``I know they are hurt, but they had a window 
to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tata, who has umpired the World Series four times and worked the  
All-Star game earlier this month, said he intended to retire after 
the 2000 season. Even if he regains his job, he says he will quit 
at the end of the year, blaming the minor league umps and Sandy 
Alderson, the official in the commissioner's office put in charge 
of umpires this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't work for Sandy Alderson and I won't work with scabs,''  
Tata said. ``I did it in '79 and there's no way I'm going to do it 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their first confrontation with baseball, umps struck for the  
first seven weeks of the 1979 season and games went on with 
replacements. While baseball kept some of the replacements and two 
of them remain -- Derryl Cousins and John Shulock -- the anger of the 
regular umps hasn't decreased much in the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 umpires participated in a three-hour conference  
call Thursday night, speaking with their new lawyer, Bruce Simon, a 
veteran of fights involving airline pilots and Teamsters. Simon is 
widely respected, even among lawyers for the baseball owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was boisterous. It was loud,'' Tata said.  
</P>
<P>
	Phillips spent Friday at Simon's office in New York preparing an  
unfair labor practice charge to be filed next week, possibly in New 
York instead of Philadelphia, according to Tata. The union hopes 
the National Labor Relations Board will force baseball to take back 
the 22 umps. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are tired of the issues,'' Tata said. ``They want the  
game of baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their case is expected to center on the effort by commissioner  
Bud Selig to shift supervision of umpires from the AL and NL 
presidents to Sandy Alderson, the executive vice president of 
baseball operations in the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips contends that because the umpires' labor contract is  
with the leagues, Alderson's involvement in umpiring matters 
violates, and perhaps voids, the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's lawyers are expected to argue that the two leagues  
and the commissioner's office ultimately are the same entity, 
because they are controlled by the 30 major league teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a meeting in Philadelphia on July 14, most umpires  
submitted their resignations, effective Sept. 2, thinking it would 
force an early start to negotiations to replace the labor contract 
that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, baseball hired 25 replacement umpires from Triple-A,  
many of whom have worked in the majors as vacation fill-ins. 
</P>
<P>
	After 14 of the regular umps withdrew their resignations, and it  
became clear that another 13 never quit in the first place, the 
walkout threat collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	All umps withdrew their resignations Tuesday, but baseball told  
22 it was too late.

<HEADLINE> Trade Figure Gave to NRCC, DNC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Carl Lindner, whose Chiquita bananas are at  
the center of a trade dispute between the United States and Europe, 
was the biggest contributor to both House Republicans and the 
Democratic National Committee during the first six months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner and his American Financial Corp. contributed $375,000 to  
the National Republican Congressional Committee and $250,000 to the 
DNC, according to Federal Election Commission records released 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials have been fighting for years  
against European Union rules that they say unfairly discriminate 
against bananas grown in Latin America by Lindner's Chiquita Brands 
International and Dole Food Co. In April, the World Trade 
Organization supported the U.S. position and authorized $191 
million in tariffs on European goods in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats are divided on the issue. In the House, some  
Democrats have introduced legislation that would stop the United 
States from imposing tariffs on European products as part of the 
fight. Their bill, introduced in March, has gone nowhere in the 
Republican-controlled chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner did not immediately return a call to his office seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the NRCC reported raising almost $28 million through  
June 30, including $9.8 million in unregulated ``soft money,'' 
contributions from corporations, labor unions and individuals that 
do not fall under federal limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, meanwhile,  
raised $17 million, including $9 million in soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner was not the only big contributor to the NRCC with an  
interest in pending legislation. AT&AMP;T contributed $126,050, while 
BellSouth gave $86,300 and SBC Communications contributed $86,000. 
The phone companies are fighting each other over proposed 
legislation that would determine who could carry data over 
long-distance telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Cross-Blue Shield contributed $38,150 to the House  
Republicans and various state Blue Cross-Blue Shield associations 
gave another $31,000. The House is scheduled to take up legislation 
to impose new rules on managed care health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Democrats took in $100,000 from MGM Grand, a major Las  
Vegas casino, in June, the same month a federal gambling commission 
urged a slowdown in new casinos and lotteries, an increase in the 
minimum betting age to 21, and more help for addicted gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRCC also reported that it traded $2.5 million in soft money  
to the Republican National Committee for $1.8 million in so-called 
``hard money,'' which is raised under federal contribution limits 
and can be used to help elect specific congressional candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The RNC can use more soft money to pay for party ``issue ads''  
that do not directly endorse candidates. Soft money is less useful 
to the NRCC, whose main mission is to elect House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, in an unusual swap, the National Republican  
Senatorial Committee gave $400,000 in soft money to a new 
foundation started by former Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. The foundation 
can use soft money because it won't be involved in electing 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Coats sent the NRSC $400,000 in surplus campaign  
funds -- more desirable ``hard money'' that was used to directly 
help Republican Senate candidates in the 1998 election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, reported that it  
had raised $24.5 million, including $9.7 million in soft money, in 
the first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee reported raising $30 million,  
with $8 million in soft money.

<HEADLINE>  Heat Wave Death Toll Climbs to 86 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Hector Soto uses the shade to keep track  
of time this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m., the parking lot attendant escapes the heat in the  
shadow of a tree. When the patch recedes at noon, he follows it. An 
hour later, he relies on another temporary spot of cool by the 
guard house on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
	By 3 p.m. there's no place left to hide, and the black pavement  
feels like it's burning through his sandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start to get really dizzy,'' Soto said Thursday as the  
temperatures crept toward 90 degrees. ``You just try to sit still 
in the coolest place you can find and drink a lot of water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This summer's unrelenting heat has been sapping energy from  
outdoor workers, drying up crops and turning forests into kindling 
across Connecticut and elsewhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 86 deaths in 15 states have been blamed on the heat  
wave that has gripped much of country since July 19, as 
temperatures linger in the 90s and 100s. Missouri has the highest 
death toll at 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat was expected to last at least until today before a  
change in the jet stream brings cooler air from Canada to northern 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures reached the 90s from the Plains to the East Coast  
on Thursday, with the heat index -- a measure of temperature and 
humidity -- breaking 100 in many places. 
</P>
<P>
	To the north, the weather was even worse. It was 111 in Pierre,  
S.D., topping the record of 109 set in 1933. The temperature was a 
record-tying 104 in Bismarck, N.D., and an all-time high of 103 in 
Dickinson, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, a 6-year-old girl appeared to be one of the latest  
victims. Her body was found Thursday afternoon in her bedroom in 
the family's mobile home in Grove. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no air conditioning or fans, and the windows of the  
trailer were closed,'' said Dr. Robert Hopper, the acting medical 
examiner. ``It was hard to breathe just walking in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air conditioning has become a necessity for many trying to beat  
the heat. But for people whose jobs force them to stay outside, 
getting a steady stream of cool air is a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last summer you could work 10 hours a day with no problem,''  
said Angel Santos, a Hartford, Conn. landscaper. ``This year you 
can't even stay out for seven hours. My reward is going home, 
putting on the air conditioner and chilling the house to 65 
degrees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Greenfield, Wis., Scott Lewitzke, the landscape manager for  
Bluemel's Garden Center and Greenhouse, said the heat means less 
productivity for his workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys just work at a much slower pace,'' Lewitzke said. ``If  
you get 50 percent productivity, you're lucky. And you can't expect 
much more in the heat -- they'll pass out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Near Mamuelle, Ark., where temperatures rose above 100 Thursday,  
roadside vendor Carolyn Archer has closed down her vegetable and 
fruit stand early each day this week to avoid the afternoon heat. 
For the time when she is outside, she has tools to keep cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have an ice chest full of ice, water, juice and plenty of  
wash rags to dig down there to keep cool,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For people lucky enough to have access to fans and air  
conditioning, power companies urged them to conserve energy, 
fearing potential blackouts or brownouts due to consumer overload. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the Kentucky's largest utilities made a special plea to  
their largest customers. Both utilities set all-time peak-usage 
records for the fourth time since July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response has been very favorable,'' said Joel Reuter, a  
spokesman for LG&AMP;E Energy Corp., the Louisville-based parent of the 
two utilities. ``I think that people and industry in the Midwest 
understand that this gripping heat wave has put a tremendous amount 
of pressure on electrical utilities in the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was bothered by the heat. In Grand Rapids, Mich.,  
where temperatures reached 95, Jim Pikaart stood in the shade 
outside a coffee shop -- while sipping tea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where I'm from, it's been really hot and really dry. This is  
really nice and breezy,'' said the Summersville, W. Va., resident. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minnesota, it reached 98 degrees on Thursday, tying a record  
set in 1933. Still, Dana Buffie spent most of her day under the sun 
riding a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents don't understand, either,'' said the 26-year-old  
said. ``I think it's beautiful. I love being out in this weather -- 
blue skies, hot and people everywhere. I like to see bodies out, 
skin exposed, people's faces.''

<HEADLINE> Lions Enlist Sanders' Father Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Barry Sanders' father said late Friday he would  
encourage his son to meet with Detroit Lions vice chairman William 
Clay Ford Jr. in the executive's efforts to talk the star running 
back out of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	But even to William Sanders, the prospect of a meeting remained  
uncertain Friday night, given that Barry Sanders was touring Europe 
and his father was unable to immediately reach his son. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 31, shocked the football world Wednesday by announcing  
his retirement after 10 years, although he's just 1,458 yards shy 
of breaking Walter Payton's NFL career rushing record of 16,726 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released by his lawyer and agent, Sanders said:  
``My desire to exit the game is greater than my desire to remain in 
it'' for what would be the third year of a six-year, $36 million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Those stunned by Sanders' move included Ford, who called  
Sanders' father at his Wichita, Kan., home Wednesday morning and 
sought his help in arranging a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I'd do everything I can,'' the elder Sanders said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The guy really seemed like he was on the up-and-up, a man of  
his word,'' William Sanders said Friday night. ``Just in talking to 
him, he seemed awfully impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to try to change his mind. But I will ask him to  
contact Mr. Ford. I think that's only fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lions spokesman Bill Keenist on Friday night acknowledged that  
Ford spoke with the elder Sanders on the day Barry Sanders 
announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill and Mr. Sanders did speak on the phone Wednesday morning,  
but that's the extent of what I can tell you,'' Keenist said. 
``Bill suggested that if there was anything he could do, that he 
would be available, and Mr. Sanders acknowledged that, and that was 
the extent of the discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' retirement is not final, at least not technically. The  
Lions have put him on the reserve-did not report list, which would 
allow him to rejoin the team this season. Sanders also has not 
filed retirement papers with the league office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still possible (Sanders could return), and that's the  
basis of placing Barry in the category that we did,'' Lions coach 
Bobby Ross said. ``We've got to proceed as though he's not going to 
be here, but I'd be very happy if he came back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Wednesday at London's Gatwick Airport whether he might  
change his mind, Sanders said: ``I don't think that's going to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his father said he believes his son will meet with Ford.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll listen to me. He has nothing to lose. The odds  
are in Mr. Ford's favor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no way of reaching him. In fact, I don't think he wants  
to be reached,'' William Sanders said of his son. ``I think he 
wants to just do his own thing.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wins Water Polo Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Chris Humbert was so sick with an ear  
infection he couldn't even play in the first two games of the water 
polo competition at the Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	And when he came to the gold medal game against Cuba on Friday  
night, he was still ailing. His temperature was 101. 
</P>
<P>
	So what did the 6-foot-7 former California prep basketball star  
do to make him and his teammates, who have also been under the 
weather, feel better? 
</P>
<P>
	He scored five goals as the United States rolled to an 11-7  
victory, clinching a berth in the Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week hasn't been a lot of fun. We had to quarantine all  
the sick guys,'' said Humbert, regarded as one of the world's best 
water polo players, manning the two-meter post. ``We've had a lot 
of coughing, nasal congestion and headaches. We've come through 
some adversity and this feels good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humbert, who once scored 46 points in a high school game, got  
his first goal 30 seconds into the game Friday night. The Americans 
led 2-1 after one period and then swam away. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Oeding and Humbert got behind the Cuban defense and  
took long passes from goalie Daniel Hackett for easy scores within 
40 seconds of one another to open the second period. The United 
States led 6-2 at the half and 10-3 after three periods, using 
their superior swimming ability and strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just wanted to get on them early and make it clear to them  
they were not going to be competitive,'' Humbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Humbert out early in the tournament, the United States had  
beaten Cuba just 6-4. That's how big a difference the big 
left-hander makes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half our team has been sick,'' U.S. coach John Vargas said.  
``But we were confident going in that if we played our game, no 
team would be able to stay with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has not won an Olympic water polo medal since  
claiming silver in 1988 at Calgary.

<HEADLINE> Driver Waltrip To Retire Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Darrell Waltrip, a three-time Winston Cup  
champion who has not won a race in seven years, plans to retire 
after stock car racing's 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip has scheduled a news conference for next Thursday in  
Indianapolis to make a formal announcement, The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad to see (Waltrip) retire, but I guess it's good when  
someone can call it quits on their own terms,'' Phillipe Lopez, 
Waltrip's crew chief, told the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is just at a point where he wants to see and do other  
things in life, especially be at home more with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Carter, co-owner of Waltrip's No. 66 Ford Taurus, said,  
``Time waits for no man; (it's) time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, 52, of Franklin, Tenn., leads all active Winston Cup  
drivers with 84 career victories but has not won a race since 
Darlington in September 1992. He finished 25th at last week's 
Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip sold his team last year after owning it for eight years,  
citing continuing disputes with sponsors and other financial 
reasons. At the time, he said the 1999 season would be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	He changed his mind after signing a two-year sponsorship deal  
with Kmart at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip's team is making preparations for a farewell tour next  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to do everything in our power to make sure  
Darrell goes out with a bang at each and every race,'' Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip has indicated a desire to enter broadcasting after  
retiring. He has done race commentary for The Nashville Network.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Dip; Grain Prices Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures slid sharply towards the close of trading  
Friday and other energy futures also gave back recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, grain futures posted strong gains and coffee  
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The crude oil market was sluggish much of the day until the  
close of trade approached. Then the price of the September contract 
got as high as $21.10 a barrel, flirting with a 21-month high, 
before dropping as low as $20.48 in the last hour, said Tim Evans, 
an analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen a whole lot of news. Sometimes it just  
happens,'' said George Beranek, an analyst with Petroleum Finance 
Co. in Washington. ``Sometimes later on Fridays the trading thins 
out and things can happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	September crude oil futures prices had hit a 21-month spot  
contract high of $21.12 a barrel during trading on Thursday, driven 
in part by the strength of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices have been on an upward trend this year, driven  
in part by reduced oil production by the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries and helped by rising demand during 
the peak summer travel season. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas has received a lift from the recent heat wave.  
Electric utilities often fire up their natural gas units in times 
of peak demand. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Unleaded gasoline and natural gas both gave back  
gains posted earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans said there was little news to drive the market Friday.  
Rather, he believed market participants were anticipating the 
expiration of the August contract at the close of Friday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe this run up this week was the August contract reaching  
expiration rather than how tight the gasoline market is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for September delivery fell 44 cents to $20.53 a barrel;  
August heating oil fell 0.56 cent to 52.17 cents a gallon; August 
unleaded gasoline rose 0.15 cent to 65.13 cents a gallon; September 
natural gas fell 0.26 cent to $2.543 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
September fell 43 cents to $19.37 a barrel at the International 
Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain futures prices were higher Friday on the Chicago Board of  
Trade as the Midwest continued to bake under stifling heat and 
humidity. 
</P>
<P>
	Grains started higher on follow-through from Thursday's strong  
showing, and mostly maintained the gains through the close. 
</P>
<P>
	Both corn and wheat posted gains, shaking off news that more  
favorable weather may be in store for heat-addled growing regions. 
September and December wheat contracts, which represent the fall 
harvest, hit their highest levels of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week we went through a critical time frame with corn,''  
said Don Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. ``For 
the areas that didn't get the rain, this heat really took a toll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The heat, which reached the high 90s and triple digits in key  
growing states Friday, could bake parched crops and reduce yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains were limited by the more favorable weather forecasts for  
this weekend and next week. Forecasters are calling for rain and 
cooler temperatures throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices were mixed Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``The soybeans can withstand the heat a lot better than the  
corn,'' Roose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 6 1/4 cents to $2.79 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.14 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell 
4 3/4 cents to $1.11 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 1/4 cent to 
$4.33 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mixed and pork higher Friday on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell 0.10 cent to 64.22 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose 0.17 cent to 76.87 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose 0.67 cent to 48.27 cents a pound; August pork bellies 
rose 3.0 cents to 52.12 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices fell Friday when the end of a truckers strike in  
Brazil eased shipping concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee for September delivery fell 4.0 cents to 91.10 cents a  
pound on the Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange in New York, the lowest 
price since Jan. 3, 1996.

	The texts of four notes found in Mark O. Barton's apartment  
along with the bodies of his wife, son and daughter, as released by 
Henry County, Ga., police. The first note, found in the living

The others, found on each of the three bodies, were handwritten.

	July 29, 1999, 6:38 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
	To Whom It May Concern:  
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Ann is in the master bedroom closet under a blanket. I  
killed her on Tuesday night. I killed Matthew and Mychelle 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be similarities between these deaths and the death of  
my first wife, Debra Spivey. However, I deny killing her and her 
mother. There's no reason for me to lie now. It just seemed like a 
quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little pain. All of them were dead in less than five  
minutes. I hit them with a hammer in their sleep and then put them 
face down in a bathtub to make sure they did not wake up in pain. 
To make sure they were dead. I am so sorry. I wish I didn't. Words 
cannot tell the agony. Why did I? 
</P>
<P>
	I have been dying since October. I wake up at night so afraid,  
so terrified that I couldn't be that afraid while awake. It has 
taken its toll. I have come to hate this life and this system of 
things. I have come to have no hope. 
</P>
<P>
	I killed the children to exchange them for five minutes of pain  
for a lifetime of pain. I forced myself to do it to keep them from 
suffering so much later. No mother, no father, no relatives. The 
fears of the father are transferred to the son. It was from my 
father to me and from me to my son. He already had it and now to be 
left alone. I had to take him with me. 
</P>
<P>
	I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for  
my demise as I planned to kill the others. I really wish I hadn't 
killed her now. She really couldn't help it and I love her so much 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	I know that Jehovah will take care of all of them in the next  
life. I'm sure the details don't matter. There is no excuse, no 
good reason. I am sure no one would understand. If they could, I 
wouldn't want them to. I just write these things to say why. 
</P>
<P>
	Please know that I love Leigh Ann, Matthew and Mychelle with all  
of my heart. If Jehovah is willing, I would like to see all of them 
again in the resurrection, to have a second chance. I don't plan to 
live very much longer, just long enough to kill as many of the 
people that greedily sought my destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	You should kill me if you can.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	I give you my wife, Leigh Ann Vandiver Barton. My honey, my  
precious love. Please take care of her. I will love her forever. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	I give you Matthew David Barton. My son, my buddy, my life.  
Please take care of him. 
</P>

	I give you Mychelle Elizabeth Barton. My daughter, my  
sweetheart, my life. Please take care of her.

<HEADLINE> FTC Wants Online Pharmacies Watched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To help state authorities monitor how well  
online pharmacies are complying with the law, the Federal Trade 
Commission wants Congress to force Internet sites that sell 
prescription drugs to disclose more information about their 
businesses and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	In making the recommendations, the FTC recognized the limits of  
its own authority in monitoring online pharmacies and the 
challenges state officials face because of jurisdictional problems 
and the lack of adequate identifying information on the Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``State authorities appear to have laws that are substantively  
adequate to stop irresponsible prescribing and dispensing of drugs 
via the Internet,'' Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau 
of Consumer Protection, said. ``The real challenge lies in dealing 
with the logistical difficulties of identifying responsible parties 
and enforcing laws across states boundaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein was to testify today before the House Commerce  
subcommittee on oversight and investigations about the need for new 
laws covering Internet pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC says the sites should contain the name, address and  
phone number of the pharmacy that will dispense the drugs and where 
that pharmacy is licensed to do business. Similar information also 
should be provided about physicians who prescribe drugs over the 
Internet, as well as the states where that physician is licensed or 
authorized to practice medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	There should also be information about any Internet operator --  
separate from the doctor or pharmacy -- that is offering the drugs 
for sale, including the principal owners of the business. 
</P>
<P>
	The site should tell consumers the states from which it will  
accept orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission says such disclosures are needed because of the  
new problems posed by Internet pharmacies, even as consumers enjoy 
the cost-savings and convenience. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a consumer might go to a Web site and have an  
online consultation with an unknown doctor who then prescribes 
drugs for the pharmacy to dispense. 
</P>
<P>
	Prescriptions could be issued without adequate review of a  
patient's medical history, posing serious health threats, Bernstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is illegal for doctors to prescribe for patients in a state  
where they are not licensed to practice. Licensed doctors also must 
meet standards of care that in most states require a patient 
relationship to prescribe drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some online pharmacies stress they operate with the same  
standards as a traditional pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers at drugstore.com, for example, must already have  
prescriptions from their doctors, which must be either mailed or 
faxed to the store, said Peter Neupert, the company's president and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must be careful to distinguish between safe, legitimate  
online pharmacies and profiteers using the Internet to engage in 
illegal activities with willing participants,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the company has applied for approval from an  
online certification program established by the National 
Association of Boards of Pharmacy.

<HEADLINE> Katzenberg Gets New DreamWorks Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fresh from settlement of a bonus dispute with  
his former employer, Jeffrey Katzenberg has some new bosses -- at 
the DreamWorks SKG studio, where he is a principal owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg said Thursday he is taking over as interim head of  
production at DreamWorks, the studio he founded with Steven 
Spielberg and David Geffen. He replaces Robert Cooper, who is 
forming his own production company. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseeing day-to-day film development, Katzenberg will report  
to Spielberg and feature-film chiefs Walter Parkes and Laurie 
MacDonald, while technically remaining one of Parkes and 
MacDonald's bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm back where I was in 1981 and glad to be there,'' said  
Katzenberg, referring to his time as a production executive at 
Paramount before he went to Disney in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg this month settled a three-year legal fight with  
Disney over bonus money owed him from his tenure as studio chief. 
With that behind him, and DreamWorks' plans for a Los Angeles 
studio at Playa Vista fallen through, Katzenberg had time to take 
on the extra work when Cooper announced he was leaving, MacDonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When all this came up, there was no one we felt was right who  
could come in immediately,'' MacDonald said. ``Rather than make an 
impulsive decision, the decision was to try to work it out 
internally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg will remain in the job until DreamWorks finds a  
long-term replacement for Cooper, MacDonald said. She said it was 
unknown how long that would take. 
</P>
<P>
	While taking a subordinate role on live-action films, Katzenberg  
said he will retain control over DreamWorks' animation and 
television operations. Final live-action film decisions will remain 
in Spielberg's hands, MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could there possibly be anybody better to work for in  
live-action film than Steven Spielberg? I don't think so,'' 
Katzenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	After agreeing to the setup, Katzenberg assured MacDonald and  
Parkes he would have no problem taking a back seat on production 
decisions and that he would not try to overrule them, MacDonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional studio hierarchies do not apply at DreamWorks,  
MacDonald said. Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen founded DreamWorks 
in 1994, saying it would be a studio that would minimize 
bureaucracy and leave more control in the hands of the artists. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no ego problems with dividing up the work in different  
ways,'' MacDonald said. ``It's always better to figure out what 
each individual's gifts are and make the company work around the 
gifts, rather than try to work around the traditional structures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper had been at DreamWorks for two years. The first two films  
scheduled for release under Cooper's supervision are ``American 
Beauty'' with Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening and ``Galaxy Quest'' 
with Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver. Both are due out this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Tristar Pictures president, Cooper will continue his  
association with DreamWorks as a producer. Some of the projects he 
has in the works were films he began developing as DreamWorks' head 
of production. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob's creativity, energy and intelligence are reflected in the  
projects he championed, and we are happy he will continue to be 
part of our team through his new role as a producer,'' Spielberg 
said in a news release.

<HEADLINE> $525,000 Spent on JFK Jr. Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Government officials said Friday the mission to  
search for John F. Kennedy's plane and recover the three bodies 
aboard cost the Coast Guard more than $525,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard -- one of several agencies involved -- had said  
last week its costs were $287,402 in the first two days of the 
search for Kennedy's Piper Saratoga II, which crashed on July 17. 
The effort involved patrol boats, helicopters and other aircraft 
stationed along the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next three days, the Coast Guard spent about $240,440.  
</P>
<P>
	``The president made it clear we should have done what we did --  
go the extra mile for a family who has suffered so much and 
contributed so much,'' U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney E. 
Slater told a crowd of 150 people Friday at an award ceremony for 
those involved in the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from more than a dozen federal, state and local  
police and rescue agencies were on hand for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard spokesman Mike Lapinski said he was angered by  
criticism of the mission's cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the same time as the Kennedy search we had two other  
search-and-rescues that actually took more resources,'' he said. 
They were an unsuccessful search for a man who fell off his boat 
off the coast of Puerto Rico, and the rescue of three fishermen off 
the coast of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Friday, four civilian airplanes paid tribute to Kennedy  
by flying in a missing-man formation at the Experimental Aircraft 
Association fly-in and convention in Oshkosh, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole show centers around aviation and that was one of the  
things he loved,'' said Heather Ray, 38, of Ontario, Canada. ``He 
was a great guy who lived as much life as he could in a short 
time.''

<HEADLINE> Day Trading a Volatile Profession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intense, volatile, and risky, day trading is a  
profession at the center of the stampeding bull market that's 
mesmerizing Americans -- sometimes at great financial and emotional 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-time day traders ride the tiniest ups and downs of the  
stock markets, squeezing profits by rapidly buying and selling 
shares via Internet links set up at rapidly growing day trading 
offices. Many have abandoned regular jobs to join the rush for 
market gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 5,000 in number, they make up an increasingly powerful  
force in the markets. Another 250,000 others, also caught up in the 
national pasttime of market watching, do the same from home full 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton, the day trader who shot and killed nine people  
at two brokerage firms in Atlanta on Thursday -- a day when the 
markets plunged -- traded at one of the firms where he opened fire. 
Barton, who killed his wife and two children before the rampage 
started, committed suicide later Thursday after police pulled over 
his van at a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
	Day trading certainly isn't a job for everyone as it requires  
strong nerves, an ability to make snap decisions and sometimes to 
take huge risks. 
</P>
<P>
	A trader might buy hundreds of shares of stocks, worth thousands  
of dollars, then sell them minutes later as the stock rises or 
falls, hoping to make a quick profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way this market is so volatile, it's just really  
stressful,'' said Nick Granko, an Oklahoma City day trader who quit 
selling used cars six months ago to try his hand at the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get emotionally attached to stocks. It takes a lot of  
nerve disengaging your emotions from trading,'' he said in a 
telephone interview. ``Cutting your losses is one of the main 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But because the game is so new and the spoils so seemingly  
endless, day trading is attracting many people unsuited for the 
game, traders say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, I feel most people who get involved in day  
trading don't understand the risk involved and don't fully 
anticipate the time it takes to achieve consistent success,'' said 
Robert J. Rak, moderator of a number of day-trading Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Granko said he's seen traders at his firm ``who have no business  
being in there. They don't know what they're doing. They're 
afraid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Amanat, an owner of the New York day trading firm  
Tradescape.com, has watched as his offices have grown from 25 
traders a year ago to 180 currently. He said Wednesday, before the 
shootings, that his firm also gets dozens of calls and e-mails from 
wannabe traders, many with little experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, dozens of traders in baseball caps and shorts pack  
into Tradescape's darkened rooms, their eyes glued to computer 
workspaces littered with empty soda cans and coffee cups. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just two years ago that stock market rules were changed  
giving greater freedom to small investors to do the kind of trading 
that professional brokers do. Also new are the electronic networks 
that day traders use. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, securities regulators have express concern that some  
day trading companies, which provide work space and training to 
would-be traders, could be misleading them about potential profits. 
Regulators have stepped up scrutiny of the firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Day trading is not as simple as it appears,'' said Ari Kiev, a  
psychiatrist and author of ``Trading to Win: The Psychology of 
Mastering the Markets,'' published in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is easy to get into it and all the ads for it make it seem  
like it is less expensive and so forth. But they don't really tell 
you how risky it is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings left five dead at the building that houses  
All-Tech Investment Group, a firm that recently paid $278,000 in 
Massachusetts to settle claims of deceptive advertising and making 
unauthorized transfers of customers' money. At the firm, day 
traders put up at least $50,000 in equity to open an account, and 
most pay another $5,000 to attend All-Tech's 30-day training 
course. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft Aimed To Smash Into Moon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speeding at 3,800 miles an hour, the Lunar  
Prospector spacecraft was to smash into a frigid crater of the moon 
early Saturday in its final task for science: a search for evidence 
of lunar water. 
</P>
<P>
	The 354-pound spacecraft was targeted to collide inside a  
constantly shaded crater near the moon's south pole, where 
scientists believe pockets of frozen water exist. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat and fury of the impact -- equal to a two-ton car  
smashing into the ground at 1,100 mph -- was expected to throw a 
cloud of vapor and debris high above the crater. An arsenal of 
telescopes on Earth and in space were to be watching, searching for 
the telltale chemical signature of water. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunar Prospector was launched Jan. 6, 1998, and has spent about  
18 months orbiting the moon. Its five instruments have analyzed the 
chemistry, gravity and magnetic fields of the moon. Findings from 
one of the instruments led to the plan to crash the spacecraft into 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The instrument detected the chemical signature of hydrogen, a  
finding that to scientists suggests the presence of water. By some 
estimates, there could be as much as 200 million metric tons of 
water mixed in the top 18 inches of lunar soil near the poles. 
</P>
<P>
	David Goldstein of the University of Texas came up with the idea  
of testing for the presence of water by crashing the spent Lunar 
Prospector into a frozen crater. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was quickly approved by project scientists, but most  
admitted the chance of a total success is low. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really a tricky maneuver,'' said David Folta, head of  
the NASA team controlling the guidance of Lunar Prospector. 
</P>
<P>
	It's like trying to hit a pie pan at home plate with a baseball  
thrown from second base at more than 100 miles an hour, Folta said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is for the spacecraft to fire rockets to slow down and  
start a speedy dive toward a crater. It will come in at a very low 
angle, clear a half-mile-high rim by about half a mile, then crash 
into the 2 1/2-mile-deep crater. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground controllers will not see the rockets fire, he said. The  
engineers will send instructions the Lunar Prospector as it circles 
the moon for the last time. Following the instructions, the 
spacecraft is to fire its rockets over the back side of the moon. 
It will crash before radio contact is restored with Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the rocket burn goes as planned, we'll never see it again  
after it goes around the back of the moon,'' Folta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Binder, the principal scientist for the Lunar Prospector  
mission, said the crash is a fitting end for the little spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has never failed us,'' said Binder of Prospector's 18-month  
exploration of the moon. ``It got 10 times more data than was 
expected. It has flown perfectly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mission was to end Saturday anyway, and Binder said by  
crashing Prospector into the moon, ``We'll get one final bit of 
science out of it.'' If all goes well, he said, the crash will 
produce a plume containing about 100 pounds -- 12 1/2 gallons -- of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be about a bathtub full,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Binder said chances of success are not strong, but the payoff  
would be big for science and exploration if lunar water is proven. 
</P>
<P>
	Water on the moon could be chemically broken down into oxygen  
and hydrogen to make fuel for rockets or for electrical generators. 
The oxygen also could supply an atmosphere for a lunar base. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to one day set up a lunar base,'' said Binder.  
Water there, he said, would ``make it a lot cheaper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein's idea was that, if frozen water is in the crater,  
then the collision would vaporize the ice and create a vapor of 
water molecules. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunlight would quickly break down the water into hydrogen and  
hydroxyl, a chemical formed when ultraviolet radiation frees a 
hydrogen atom from water. 
</P>
<P>
	If the vapor cloud is dense enough, Goldstein said, sunlight  
will cause the hydroxyl molecules to be visible to powerful 
telescopes using ultraviolet radiation detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Binder sees little likelihood that amateur astronomers will be  
able to detect the impact cloud over the lunar south pole, but he 
added: ``I would encourage anyone to try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash site will become the final resting place for Eugene  
Shoemaker. The famed U.S. Geological Survey astronomer was one of 
the world's leading authorities on lunar impacts. After he died two 
years ago, a small metal container filled with his ashes was glued 
to one of Prospector's braces before the craft was launched. 
</P>
<P>
	Binder said the lipstick-sized container will be scattered  
across the lunar crater, along with the rest of the little craft.
