<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economy Not Doing Well: Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition United
Parties (UP) today said the ongoing strike by farm workers
reflects fundamental macro-economic problems the country is
currently facing.
</P>
<P>
UP Information and Publicity Secretary Isaac Manyemba told the
Zimbabwe National News Agency that commercial farmers, like
employers in other sectors, found it difficult to give workers
reasonable wage increments because of the ever soaring cost of
production, among other constraints.
</P>
<P>
"The real problem lies, by and large, neither with the
employer nor the employees but heavy taxation and high cost of
production leaves the employer with little room for wage
increments," he said.
</P>
<P>
The high budget deficit due to uncontrolled public
expenditure, he said, caused runaway inflation resulting in price
increases.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, workers find it difficult to survive hence the
widespread industrial actions," he said, adding that farm workers
are among the lowest paid in the country.
</P>
<P>
Many sectors of the economy were hit by strikes this year as
workers demanded higher wage and salary increases than those
offered by their employers.
</P>
<P>
And for the first time, commercial farm workers also went on
strike, demanding monthly wages of up to 848 Zimbabwe Dollars (67
U.S. Dollars), up from about 360 Zimbabwe Dollars (28 U.S.
Dollars), while farmers offered them a minimum wage of 460
Zimbabwe Dollars (36 U.S. Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kohl Faces Test at Party Congress in Leipzig </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leipzig, October 12 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
is facing a vital test at the ruling party national congress in
forging a united front for the next national elections in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress
opened here today, some senior CDU members criticized Kohl's
leadership while the party's junior members urged Kohl to step
down as CDU party leader after the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, 67, has been chairman of the CDU for 24 years and German
chancellor for uninterrupted 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Although most opinion polls had showed that his public support
was dropping down, Kohl announced in April that he would run for
an unparalleled fifth term of office.
</P>
<P>
Unpleasant with Kohl's monopoly of power over the past decades,
Klaus Escher, chairman of CDU's youth wing, last week made a
public call on Kohl to give up the party leadership after 1998,
saying that it was time for a "generational change."
</P>
<P>
Peter Mueller, CDU party chairman for the German state of
Saarland, also told the German Stern magazine that "there is an
increasing pressure for change at the top."
</P>
<P>
Despite the attacks from his own ranks, Kohl said today in an
interview with the Welt am Sonntag, a German newspaper, "We must
and will run the 1998 election campaigns with great solidarity."
</P>
<P>
He also definitely rejected the idea of giving up the party
leadership, remaining as the chancellor candidate of the CDU for
the next elections.
</P>
<P>
Past experiences had showed that such a division could produced
"miserable" results, Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, noted that in order to avoid public rifts
and rally the 1,001 delegates firmly behind him, Kohl must deliver
a powerful speech at the congress on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He made at such a kind of speech at the 1994 Hamburg local CDU
congress, which successfully united his depressed party and
provided a fresh thrust for the CDU to win reelection in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Only a similar breakthrough will give the party new courage
and bring its members firmly behind him," said Welt am Sonntag
newspaper in a commentary today.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- British hospitals will receive
an emergency cash injection of around 250 million pounds (402
million US dollars) to tackle the problem of growing patient
queues this winter.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to announce the decision this week,
local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of patients on the waiting lists has risen by 10
percent to a record 1.15 million in England in the past year and
some of emergency treatment and other operations are facing
cancellation because of cash shortages.
</P>
<P>
Most of the support funds is expected to be found from cuts
in the defense and trade and industry budgets, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The medical society sees the money as welcome relief, though it
claims that more than 500 million pounds (805 million US dollars)
is needed to deal with the difficult situation.

Detectives later searched a house in which the suspects had
stayed but found nothing.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Calls for Global Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides today urged the international community to work more
actively to secure a just and viable solution to the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimist that if the international community is engaged
more decisively than in the past, the road towards a just,
workable and viable solution in Cyprus will open," said the
president in a message to a Greek Cypriot rally.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot demonstrators were protesting the occupation
by Turkey of Morphou village on the northwestern coast of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The president's message, read out by Justice and Public Order
Minister Nicos Koshis, reiterated the President's pledge that he
would not "allow the Turkish air force to bomb our towns and
villages at will, as it has done in the past, without being able
to defend ourselves."
</P>
<P>
It said Cyprus will continue to boost its air defense
capability until the threat emanating from the continuing Turkish
occupation ends.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government signed an agreement with Russia earlier
this year to buy an undisclosed number of S-300 surface-to-air
missiles. The missiles are expected to be deployed on the island
in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Reacting strongly to the missile deal, Turkey threatened a
preemptive strike against Cyprus if the missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus responded that it would not deploy the missiles if there
is sufficient progress toward a settlement or an agreement on the
demilitarization of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the 37 percent of the island in the wake of a
failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Invited to Attend MENA Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today received an
invitation to attend the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
Economic Conference due to be held in November in the Qatari
capital city of Doha, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was extended to Jordanian Minister of Foreign
Affairs Fayez Tarawneh by the Qatari Embassy in Amman, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has not officially responded to the
invitation today, but on September 23 the Arabic newspaper Al
Hayat quoted Tarawneh as saying that Jordan would attend the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference is to be held under the title of creating a new
partnership of trade and economic development between the public
and private sectors of Middle East and North Africa beyond the
year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has invited 92 countries and organizations to attend the
November 16 to 18 conference and expects some 2,900 foreign
participants for the conference, among them 800 government
delegates, 800 businessmen, 300 representatives of international
and regional organizations, 500 journalists, as well as 500 people
from the host country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of Middle East, African and European
countries have been invited to attend the conference which was
boycotted by some Arab countries due to an expected Israeli
participation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will send its Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
the meeting while Israel will be represented by Foreign Minister
David Levy, they added.
</P>
<P>
The conference is traditionally attended by Arab states, Israel
and their major partners in the industrialized world. It is the
fourth since it was launched in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Though Qatar remained firm on hosting the conference as
scheduled, it had to downgrade the meeting from a summit to a
ministerial level, saying the current atmosphere is not
"appropriate" to invite heads of states because of the stalled
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace
process, Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian National Authority, the
United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have announced that they
will boycott the conference.
</P>
<P>
Most of other Arab countries has not yet officially voiced
their stands, but observers here said that they would most likely
send delegates at low levels.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says Netanyahu-Arafat Summit Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright today telephoned Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to praise his meeting with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat last week as a "positive progress."
</P>
<P>
Albright said the Netanyahu-Arafat secret summit at the Erez
checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip in the small hours of
Wednesday is a step to advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process, according to Israeli Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
In September Albright made her maiden visit to the Middle East
as secretary of state to revive the peace process, which came to a
halt after Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem in March. Short of making a breakthrough, she
did manage to arrange a series of meetings between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu-Arafat summit, the first in eight months,
reportedly focused on ways to push forward the peace process. The
two leaders agreed to work together in a joint fight against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a weekly Cabinet meeting today, Netanyahu
praised the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) for making a
"good start" in recent days to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Palestinian efforts "should be examined
further to ensure that the fight will be systematic and ongoing,"
the Prime Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told the Cabinet that
negotiations on the opening of the Gaza International Airport
would be conducted within the framework of principles set by the
inner Cabinet formed by Netanyahu, Foreign Minister David Levy and
himself.
</P>
<P>
Israel maintains that it will retain security control over the
Gaza airport and seaport in order to prevent the smuggling in
weapons that could threaten Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Gaza airport is one of the key interim
issues to be settled in the renewed peace negotiations, which will
tackle the "safe passages" between the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails as
well.
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, the Egyptian English daily Al-Ahram today quoted
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa as criticizing the
Netanyahu-Arafat summit for failing to produce any tangible
results.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the summit did not tackle real issues, adding Egypt
wanted to see real movement and would not be convinced by
"handshakes and anything superficial."
</P>
<P>
His comments, contradicting those of Israel and the United
States, seemed to reflect Egypt's displeasure with the fact that
Egypt was sidelined in recent diplomatic activities to restart the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Receives Phone Call From Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 12 (Xinhua)--U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright made a phone call today to Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat, informing him
that the U.S. peace envoy will return to the region shortly.
</P>
<P>
According to the Palestinian News Agency WAFA, Arafat, who
received the phone call in Gaza, said that Albright also told him
that the U.S. side was satisfied with the progress made so far by
the PNA and Israel in preparation of the reopening of the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of State also highly appreciated his talks
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week,
saying such talks were very helpful for bringing the peace
process back on track, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
With the help of U.S. Peace envoy Dennis Ross, Arafat
held a secret talk with Netanyahu on Wednesday at the Erez
Checkpoint between Jerusalem and Gaza and the two discussed ways
and means for reviving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Before that, nine joint committees appointed by the PNA and
Israel started their preparations on respective agendas that to
be discussed during the peace talks. The most important issues
include the security cooperation between the PNA and Israel,
definition of Jewish settlements, Israeli troop redeployment in
West Bank, the Gaza Airport and Seaport, and the safe
passage between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Ross will return to the region shortly to
help speed up the peace talk preparations, without giving a
definite date, Arafat said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Teachers' Strike to End Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Kenyan
teachers are to end strike on Monday after the government has
agreed the up-to-200-percent pay hike over the next five years
starting from January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ambrose Adongo, chief of the 240,000-member Kenya National
Union of Teachers (KNUT), today called off the 12-day strike and
asked them to resume their duties at 8:00 a.m. on Monday, the
Kenyan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Teachers go back to school, teachers go back to teach," he
said on Kenyan Television Network (KTN) evening news.
</P>
<P>
Adongo also declared that teachers around the country will
continue to give President Daniel arap Moi and the government
full support, noting that Moi is a founder of KNUT.
</P>
<P>
However, the strike is widely believed to hurt the ruling
Kenya African National Union (KANU) in the coming elections as
teachers, among the lowest paid professionals in Kenya, carry
considerable political influences especially in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The strike has forced more than seven million pupils out of
classrooms in primary and secondary schools since October 1 in a
key month for national examinations.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a national holiday known as Moi Day, Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi appointed three senior government
officials to immediately meet with KNUT officials so as to end
the strike within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the national interest that the dispute be resolved
amicably and expeditiously," said Moi, 74 and in power since
1978. He is widely believed to win the general election which
will be called by himself later this year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government argued that the 200-percent pay rise
demand by KNUT is unacceptable as it means more than half of the
government expenditure, nearly 90 billion Shillings (1.47 billion
U.S. Dollars), should be used on teachers' pay alone.
</P>
<P>
The teachers' pay makes up 16 percent of the entire government
expenditure in this east African country in the 1997-1998 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
A Kenyan primary teacher in the bottom rung currently earns
only about 1,800 Shillings (29 Dollars) per month.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Ministry
confirmed today that Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy is due
to head Israel's team to attend the Middle East and North Africa
Economic Conference to be held in Qatar next month.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation is to include Finance Minister Yaacov
Neeman and some business leaders, who will seek ways to
boost economic cooperation with other countries of the region
during the meeting which is scheduled from November 16 to 18.
</P>
<P>
Sumir Raveh, the head of Israel trade mission in Doha
said that he has not received Qatari invitation but he said
Qatar has announced it would invite Levy and actually the
invitation is just formality.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry also expressed satisfaction that the
United States has applied pressure on Arab states not to
call off the conference.
</P>
<P>
Many Arab countries have privately asked Qatar to cancel or
at least postpone the conference because of the deadlock in
the Middle East peace process, which, they said, was caused by the
hard-line policy of current Israeli Likud-government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirate, have announced they would boycott
the Doha meeting.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the appeal from Arab world, Qatar has downgraded
the meeting from a summit to a conference at a ministerial
level. And it started Tuesday sending out invitations to the
conference to about 92 countries and international organizations
and said it has no plans to delay it.
</P>
<P>
"The conference will be held as scheduled and preparations
for it are proceeding in the desired fashion," Qatar's Foreign
Ministry spokesman Fawza bin Ahmad al-Attiyah said today.

<HEADLINE> Teenager Drug Distributors Arouse Concern in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The use of teenagers for the
distribution of dangerous drugs and illicit substances in Nigeria
has aroused concern of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency
(NDLEA), local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Teenagers are mostly recruited from primary and secondary
schools by drug dealers, according to NDLEA Chairman
Major-General Musa Bamaiyi, who did not give the number of the
teenagers involved.
</P>
<P>
He however disclosed that some of the teenagers had already
been apprehended and were being detained at various NDLEA cells
nationwide, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
NDLEA had also intensified efforts to track those who lure the
youths into such nefarious trade, Bamaiyi said over the weekend
at a NDLEA train-the-trainers workshop held in Kaduna state,
north Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"No responsible government can afford to fold its arms and
watch these unscrupulous and negligible percentage of Nigerians
destroy the populace at home and bring disrepute to the nation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
While calling on all tiers of government to join hands
together in the drug war, Bamaiyi urged the trainers to
collaborate with NDLEA in the prevention of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
"We have realized that prevention is not only better but also
cheaper than cure," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Govt Urged to Punish Sexual Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has been advised to review the law to punish people involved in
harassing women at work places.
</P>
<P>
Presently cases of sexual harassment at places of work have
surged but there are no clauses in the proposed employment law,
whose first draft is expected to be ready next January, to
protect women against such acts.
</P>
<P>
The advice was made during the four-day workshop of the
Tanzania Industrial Relations Association on the proposed
Employment Act 1997 and the issue of globalization.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which ended Saturday, pointed out that the
proposed Act had omitted the issue of safeguarding workers in
respect of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
The participants urged the government not to abandon its role
in regulating and supervising the labor market in order to
maintain harmonious labor relations for increased productivity.
</P>
<P>
On expanding private and multinational companies, they advised
the Ministry of Labor to ensure workers are not underpaid or
harassed.
</P>
<P>
The workshop earlier accused some private companies and
multinationals of exploiting workers by underpaying or denying
rights and compensations because of lack of proper labor ministry
supervision.
</P>
<P>
The delegates discussed several parts of the proposed act
which discriminates women, and recommended that the restriction
of employment of women in mines and night work should be removed
so as to offer fair treatment to all people.

<HEADLINE> Israel Erects Checkpoints Again At Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces erected
checkpoints again early this morning at the entrances of West Bank
city of Hebron and reinforced checking of identity documents and
vehicles, the Palestinian News Agency WAFA said.
</P>
<P>
Local residents have to show their identity documents to the
Israeli forces before entering into or coming out from the city
and the vehicles were searched thoroughly, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces treated people in a barbaric way, it quoted
local residents as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is about 50 kilometers south of Jerusalem. Israel
tightened security measures after it arrested outside Jerusalem
shortly after midnight Thursday two Palestinians from Hebron who
were found to have some 50 kilograms of explosives in their car.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli police said that they have not ruled out
nationalist motives, but they believe the suspects intended to
sell the explosives to the Jewish contractors, from whom they had
been stolen.
</P>
<P>
Based on the confessions of the suspects, Israeli police and
defense forces raided a building near Hebron Friday afternoon,
where they found 30 kilograms of explosives.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security experts have confirmed the explosives were not
the type used in the suicide bomb attacks in Jerusalem on July 30
and September 4, which killed 26 people and wounded hundreds
others.
</P>
<P>
An explosion in the vegetable market close to a Jewish quarter
in Hebron created panic on Saturday. The Israeli police said that
the explosion may have been caused by a stun grenade thrown by an
Israeli soldier.

<HEADLINE> Aida Celebrates 125th Birthday in Egypt's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Verdi's Aida, the love story that
has fascinated opera lovers in the past 125 years, sparked new
fantasy as the best sopranos sang their high notes under the stars
in front of Egypt's ancient pharaohs and VIPs from the world.
</P>
<P>
Hailed as the most lavish production ever of Aida, the
performance is intended to celebrate the 125th anniversary of
Aida's premiere in Cairo and the 75th anniversary of the discovery
of the Tomb of King Tutankhamun.
</P>
<P>
The opera, chanting the doomed love between an ancient Egyptian
conqueror and an Ethiopian slave girl, was commissioned from Verdi
by the Khedive Ismail to mark the opening of the Suez Canal in
1869 but its debut was delayed for three years.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, eager to promote its image as a safe tourist paradise,
has put in 15 million pounds to produce the opera and has staged
an enormous media campaign to sell tickets since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Up to 18,000 opera fans, including wives of several world
leaders, are attracted to the event staged in front of the
3,000-year-old Temple of Queen Hatshepsut on the west bank of the
Nile opposite Luxor, about 700 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Luxor, meaning "the palaces" in Arabic, is the most
awe-inspiring conglomeration of ancient monuments in the world.
</P>
<P>
Giving a finishing touch to months of laborious preparation,
the world's leading Verdi sopranos, Aprile Milo and Velhelmnia
Fernandez, shared the title role, while tenors Guiseppe Giaccomini
and Walter Fraccaro played Radames, Aida's lover.
</P>
<P>
All tickets of the inaugural performance were sold out while
the booking of other performances ranged between 60-70 percent.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the expected crowds a temporary theater
seating 5,000 has been constructed and a new lighting system
installed along the road leading to the temple.
</P>
<P>
To improve security, 300 Feddans of sugar-cane that used to
grow along the roads leading to the venue have been razed to the
ground. Sugar cane plantations are well-known hideouts of Islamist
militants who often carry out terrorist raids on tourists.
</P>
<P>
Officials hope the six-night run will attract a record number
of visitors despite last month's deadly bombing of a German
tourist bus in front of the Egyptian Museum in downtown Cairo.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni, the six nights
of performances between October 12-17 constitute a "most important
artistic event reflecting the glory of Egyptian civilization."
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak, who sat among the thousands of viewers
in the open-air theater tonight, has ordered the opera to be
performed annually on the same location to give an impetus to
Egypt's tourist industry as well as artistic and cultural
activities.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Promote Wheat Production: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will take measures to
promote wheat production to realize 75 percent self-sufficiency by
the year 2000, Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili
said today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Economic Committee of the ruling National
Democratic Party, he said that the government will pay the wheat
growers a price one third higher than the average international
prices next year.
</P>
<P>
Farmers, now receiving about 71 pounds (about 21 dollars) per
ardeb (197.6 liters), will get 95 pounds (about 28 dollars) in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Farmers turned in about 1.3 million tonnes of wheat this year,
an increase of 300,000 tonnes over last year, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, Egypt's
self-sufficiency in wheat reached 57 percent in 1995. But it did
not give the percentage of 1996 or 1997, while predicting that
Egypt will be self-sufficient in food within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said the prospects also augur well for
Egyptian non-petroleum exports, which registered a 15 percent
increase in the first half of this year and the last six months of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Exports of manufactured goods, notably spinning and textiles,
registered an increase of 29 percent during the same period, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili said the government is aiming to raise the value of
cotton export next year to more than 3 billion pounds (about 900
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
He expected that next year will witness an increase in exports
of rice, spinning and weaving, vegetables and fruits and food
industries.

Ismail Hakki Karaday and other high-ranking military officers.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the Israeli military chief will also meet
with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
He is reportedly to persuade the Turkish military to replace
its armored units with Israeli-made Merkava 3 tanks, which are one
of the world's most advanced types.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to discuss the date and other
specific arrangements concerning scheduled three-way naval
maneuvers of Israel, Turkey and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite war games, re-scheduled to start on November 16,
might be further delayed until next January at the request of the
U.S. side, earlier reports said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's involvement in the joint exercises has been strongly
criticized by the Arab world, which accused Ankara of betraying
the interests of Muslims by developing closer military ties with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed two defense and military training
agreements last year to allow joint warplane exercises in each
other's airspace.
</P>
<P>
Shahak's tour, a return visit for the one to Israel by Karaday
last February, indicates that the two countries are determined to
boost their cooperation in the military field, observers here
noted.

<HEADLINE> 2 Policemen Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Two policemen were killed when
a group of gunmen opened fire on a police vehicle in southeastern
Turkey last night, the Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place at 23:00, local time, in Lice,
Diyarbarkir Province while the vehicle drove the police home.
</P>
<P>
Two other policemen were wounded and rushed to a nearby hospital
for emergency treatment.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsible for the incident so far, but
police suspected the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) of
this attack.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, the PKK rebels reportedly attacked a
military post in northern Black Sea town of Giresun, killing
nine soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Eight rebels were killed in the cross-fire with the government
troops.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels, which has been fighting a 13-year-old war
against the Turkish government in southeastern Turkey, are trying
to build new bases in the Black Sea region, local reports
said earlier.
</P>
<P>
At present, around 15,000 Turkish troops are fighting the PKK
militants in a cross-border operation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A total of 797 PKK rebels have been killed since Turkish
troops, backed by jet bombers and artillery fire, entered northern
Iraq late last month to wipe out the newly built PKK camps
there.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government Holds Talks with Main Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
held talks with the main anti-government group, the Sudan People's
Liberation Movement, the local daily Akhbar el Yom reported today.
</P>
<P>
A Sudanese minister of state John Dor Magok said that the talks
were held during October 5 to 9 in Germany, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Movement, led by John Garang, along with other rebel
factions, began in early 1980's to fight against the government
for an independent state in the south.
</P>
<P>
John Dor Magok, head of the government delegation, described
the talks as "positive" and would give "strong push" for the
success of the upcoming negotiations in Kenyan capital Nairobi on
October 28.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted him as saying that the two sides had come to
a conclusion that "there is no option but dialogue as a way to
resolving differences between the two parties."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Sudanese President Omar Bashir said today to a
rally in Juba, a southern city about 1,230 kilometers from
Khartoum, that his government was determined to pursue peace in
the south of the country, Sudanese News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the accord signed by the government and six rebel
factions had "established peace" for the country, safeguarding
rights and obligations of all citizens without discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and rebel factions signed last April an
agreement, under which self-determination will be exercised in the
south after a transitional period of four years.
</P>
<P>
But the agreement was rejected by the People's Movement led
by John Garang.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a Kenyan envoy is expected to visit
Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea, which are mediating between the
Sudanese government and the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
After the tour, the envoy will come to Khartoum to meet with
Sudanese officials, helping arrange the talks between the Sudanese
government and the rebel factions.

<P>
This has fully demonstrated the determination of the CPC and
the Chinese government, which have been working for many years to
make cross-Straits negotiations possible and to promote peaceful
reunification of the motherland with a practical attitude, sincere
manner, and flexible methods.
</P>
<P>
If cross-Straits relations are to be improved, the two sides
should exchange views on major problems affecting the development
of relations and find ways to solve the differences by following
the One China principle.
</P>
<P>
A non-governmental organization, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan-Straits, was approved for discussing routine
matters with Taiwan's Foundation for Exchanges Across Taiwan
Straits and these discussions have played an important role in
promoting the development of cross-Straits relations and
safeguarding the rights and interests of compatriots on both sides.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taiwan side has repeatedly raised political issues
like "Judicial Jurisdiction" to hinder the progress of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The major problems faced by the two bodies are political
issues, and if political differences are not exposed and ways to
solve them are not found, even discussions of routine matters will
produce no satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
There can be favorable conditions for realizing the peaceful
reunification of the two sides, and the stability and development
of cross-Straits relations can be achieved by holding
cross-Straits negotiations as soon as possible under the One China
principle.

<HEADLINE> HK Able to Maintain Stability, Prosperity: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa today told
participants of the East Asia Economic Summit that Hong Kong
people have full confidence in maintaining stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech at the opening dinner of the Summit
organized by the World Economic Forum, Tung said that it has been
more than three months since Hong Kong became an SAR of China on
July 1, and things have been going quite well, with people's
confidence in the future rising to a historical high.
</P>
<P>
"We in Hong Kong are moving forward with pride and confidence.
Pride in that we are reunited with China and become masters of our
own destiny; confidence in that we can and we will make our city
an even better place going forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the economy continues to grow, the financial
foundation remains solid, the society remains pluralistic, the
politicians continue to debate openly on all the topical subjects,
and the many interest groups continue to express their opinions
through many demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
He said that maintaining financial stability is very
challenging, but it can be done. Hong Kong's financial policies
and institutions must operate in a prudent manner to maintain
public confidence. The banking and financial systems must be sound
and healthy to withstand external shocks or policy adjustments.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Hong Kong will remain secure from the financial
turmoil that some East Asian countries have recently experienced.
</P>
<P>
"For us here in Hong Kong we will continue to pursue sound and
sustainable macro economic policies, which support the stability
of the financial system. This means continued pursuit of the
fiscal discipline which has been a hallmark of Hong Kong in the
past. We shall remain our guideline that government expenditure
over time will grow at a rate no faster than the economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that fiscal prudence is a necessary precondition for
exchange rate stability and it shall remain a key of Hong Kong's
economic policy to maintain the link between the Hong Kong dollar
and the US dollar. This gives the confidence in the currency to
the people of Hong Kong and those who do business and invest in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Despite one or two short-lived speculative attacks during the
recent currency upheavals, the Hong Kong dollar has remained rock
solid. We aim to keep it that way," he said, adding that the large
stock of foreign exchange reserves of 82 billion U.S. dollars and
good economic fundamentals of Hong Kong provide the means to do
so, and Hong Kong can also rely on the unwavering support of the
motherland in this objective.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong will continue its policy of law and
predictable tax structure, continue to adhere to the present legal
system and the rule of law to reassure that Hong Kong continues to
provide an even-handed, corruption-free and secure business
environment.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the solid promises of the Basic Law is
fundamental for Hong Kong people's confidence.
</P>
<P>
Tung also explained to participants the electoral affairs of
Hong Kong SAR in the coming few years.
</P>
<P>
The Summit was opened today through Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Early Negotiations Across Taiwan Straits Urged (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The peaceful reunification of China is a complicated process
and something that cannot be done overnight. Political
negotiations between the two sides should come in different
stages, starting with an end to the long-lasting hostilities. This
is the desire of people on both sides and an important part of
developing cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, in his eight-point proposals, suggested
negotiations as a first step in "formally putting an end to
hostilities under the One China principle".
</P>
<P>
The two side should shoulder the responsibility of safeguarding
Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity and work out plans
for future development of cross-Straits ties. By doing so a safe
environment will be created for developing cross-Straits ties, and
the question of the vital interests of Taiwan compatriots will be
tackled, and a plan will be worked out for further developing
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan side, however, refused Jiang's proposal of formally
ending cross-strait hostilities under the principle of One China,
in January of 1995. Then, when bilateral relations grew strained
in mid-1995 because of reasons known to all, Taiwan expressed a
desire to deal with the issue of cross-Straits hostilities and
said it would give priority to ending hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Recently, important people in Taiwan have made it clear that
political issues can be discussed and that the most important is
to end cross-Straits hostilities and sign peace agreements, but
some people in Taiwan are against this.
</P>
<P>
Whether cross-Straits political negotiations can be held or not
is a question of sincerity rather than rhetoric and the impasse in
cross-Straits negotiations will be broken if both sides have good
faith, and strive for a consensus with a rational and pragmatic
attitude in the following points:
</P>
<P>
First, the One China principle must be adhered to. This is
directed at those in Taiwan and elsewhere who attempt to separate
Taiwan from China. So, negotiations on routine matters should
follow this principle, and political ones should follow it even
more.
</P>
<P>
The Association for Relations across the Taiwan Straits has
always maintained that both sides should be clear in adhering to
the One China principle in negotiations on routine matters, but
political implications can be left for future negotiations.

<TEXT>
<P>
The political meaning of "One China" is, as Jiang Zemin made it
clear in his speech on January 30, 1995, that there is only one
China, and Taiwan is part of it. China's sovereignty and
territorial integration are one and China opposes any "Taiwan
Independence" activity or any advocating "Splitting and Separate
Ruling" or "Having Two Chinas for the Time-being".
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole the
two sides should adhere to the One China principle, and if the
Taiwan side insists on "Recognizing the Republic of China" as the
prerequisite for holding political negotiations between the two
sides, it is an attempt to make two Chinas.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has, from the very beginning, made it clear that
negotiations between the CPC and the Kuomintang are "negotiations
between equal parties", and Jiang Zemin, in his Eight-Point
Proposals said that the location and methods of political
negotiations could be settled through talks.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the mainland has insisted on equal negotiations
under the One China principle, and has never meant to have a
"central-to-locality" attitude, and has fully understood the
thinking and situation of Taiwan, in order to avoid causing it any
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, in his report to the 15th CPC National Congress,
said, "Under the prerequisite of One China, any issue can be
discussed, and any comment and proposal, if it is helpful to the
reunification of the motherland, can be put forward."
</P>
<P>
No foreign forces can interfere in political negotiations
between the two sides because the reunification of the two is an
internal affair of China and should be resolved by the people of
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
History has shown that wherever there has been foreign
interference, the Taiwan question has gotten even more critical
and complicated, and the reunification process was
interrupted. But, the mainland's door has always been open to
political negotiations between the two sides, and the earlier the
talks, the better.

BANGKOK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors can invest in
Thai finance companies as a major shareholder as a means to put
the 58 suspended finance firms on the road of recovery, according
to a press release of the Thai Government House today.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners will be allowed to hold more than 50 percent of the
shares in financial companies for up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
However, after 10 years, any increase of fund must be sold to
Thai shareholders only, until the foreign shareholding is reduced
to less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting today, the Economic Affairs Screening Committee
also approved that the amount of non-performing loans of the
finance firms can be deducted for taxation.
</P>
<P>
Those of the 58 suspended finance firms which will submit plans
for rehabilitation are required to have enough money to raise
fund.
</P>
<P>
They can raise fund by themselves, seeking a new partner, by
acquisition or merging. Each finance company must have a fund
ratio no less than 15 percent of capital adequacy ratio.
</P>
<P>
They can also be acquired by, or merged with, other finance
company, with the latter as the core institution.
</P>
<P>
The 58 finance companies were suspended by the government in
June and August because of their huge amounts of bad and
non-performing debts and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is under pressure of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to restructure its financial sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has made
representations to the United Nations and the International Civil
Aviation Organization over the violations of Cypriot airspace by
Turkish warplanes.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Cyprus today said that two Turkish
fighter planes flew over the Paphos area in the western part of
the island on Sunday, and took pictures of the Paphos military
airport in construction.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish warplanes tangled with two Greek fighter bombers,
which were taking part in an ongoing joint exercise with Cyprus
troops, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the Cyprus Ministry of Foreign Affairs made
the necessary representations to the U.N. and the International
Civil Aviation Organization, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish violations took place when the Cyprus National
Guard is carrying out an exercise, in which Greek warplanes and
warships are participating.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 60 Turkish warplanes on Sunday flew into the
airspace over the southeastern Aegean Sea between Cyprus and the
Greek islands of Crete and Rhodes, where Greek troops are carrying
out an exercise.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops took the
northern third of the Mediterranean island following a failed coup
by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1984 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", which is recognized only by Turkey,
against the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Early Negotiations Across Taiwan Straits Urged (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The October issue of Beijing's
"Cross-Straits Relations Monthly" has called for early political
negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
In an article titled "Starting Early Political Negotiations to
Promote the Development of Cross-Straits Relations", it says that
Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), spoke about peaceful reunification
in his political report to the 15th CPC National Congress last
month.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that as a first step, the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits can hold negotiations on ending cross-Straits hostilities
under the "One China" principle, and said he hopes that Taiwan
will respond to this seriously and hold political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Qian Qichen also said recently that he hopes the
Taiwan authorities will exchange views with the mainland on a
agenda for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
This is an important decision of the CPC and the Chinese
government for promoting the development of cross-Straits
relations, peacefully removing political differences between the
two, and speeding up peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
This shows the breadth of vision, practical manner, and great
sincerity and determination of the CPC Central Committee, and it
reflects the aspirations of the people on both sides of the
Straits, who hope to end hostilities as soon as possible by
improving and developing cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
This has gotten a warm response from Taiwan compatriots and
attracted the concern of the international community and Taiwan
should respond to the call seriously and begin negotiations with
the mainland.

<HEADLINE> Early Negotiations Across Taiwan Straits Urged (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only way to solve differences and develop cross-Straits
relations, and promote peaceful reunification of the motherland is
political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The new century is characterized by both opportunities and
challenges and the Chinese people are looking forward to ending
cross-Straits hostilities as soon as possible. This will lead to
common prosperity of the two economies and the gradual development
of peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, the mainland has adjusted its policies
on political negotiations in keeping with developments and changes
in cross-Straits relations in the following ways:
</P>
<P>
First, there has been a change in participants. The
negotiations used to be primarily a CPC and Kuomintang affair, but
then turned into negotiations with other participants, and finally
came to be defined as cross-Straits political negotiations set by
Jiang Zemin in his eight-point proposals.
</P>
<P>
Second, there has been a change in the content of the
negotiations. The 1979 "Letters to Taiwan Compatriots" proposed an
end to military hostilities across the Taiwan Straits. Then, the
report to the 14th CPC National Congress proposed a formal halt to
cross-Straits hostilities and a step-by-step peaceful
reunification. Jiang Zemin then offered the eight-point proposals,
stipulating that, as a first step, the two sides can begin
negotiations on the issue of formally ending cross-Straits
hostilities under the One China principle.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Spends US$210 Million in Energy Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea has so far
invested more than 210 million US dollars in developing energy,
Eritrean Minister of Energy and Mines Tesfai Gebreselassie said.
</P>
<P>
The latest weekly issue of Eritrea Profile quoted
Gebreselassie as saying in Asmara, capital of Eritrea, that there
is growing demand for energy in the country which calls for
increased state expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Over 28 million US dollars has been spent in developing
sources of electricity supply nationwide, research on energy and
exploration of mining and related activities.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that more energy development projects
will get under way in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to Gebreselassie, an average electric consumption in
the country is 45 kw/hr per person per year. Studies show that
this rate, compared with that of other countries, puts Eritrea in
line with the most backward countries. The energy consumption has
risen by 10 percent annually since 1993.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Offshore Natural Gas Areas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Developing natural gas has
helped China adjust its energy structure and increase the supply
of high-quality energy from offshore areas, Zhao Xiuguang, of the
China National Offshore Oil Corporation, told the 15th World
Petroleum Congress in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, the use of coal caused problems for the
environment and transport in coastal areas, and it needed to be
replaced by clean and efficient natural gas to meet the needs of
continued economic expansion, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The western part of the South China Sea is a key gas source and
four oilfields and 15 gas-bearing structures have been found there.
</P>
<P>
The Nanyacheng-131 oilfield off the island province of Hainan
now provides 2.9 billion cu.m. of natural gas for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region annually via a 780-km submarine
pipeline, and 500 million cu.m. of gas for the province's
fertilizer plants and power plants via a 100-km pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the western sea area of the South China Sea will
add three billion cu.m. of gas by the year 2005, and another three
billion cu.m. by 2010.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Offshore Natural Gas Areas (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two oilfields and eight oil-bearing structures have been
discovered in the eastern part of the South China Sea. The Pinghu
oilfield, about 400 km east of Shanghai, is being developed and
will supply the city with 400 million cu.m. of gas every year, and
add 1.2 billion cu.m. of gas by 2010.
</P>
<P>
On the Bohai sea, one oilfield and 18 oil-bearing structures
have been discovered. The Jinzhou-202 oilfield provides 400
million cu.m. of natural gas for the Jinzhou Chemical Fertilizer
Plant annually and will increase the supply to 700 million
cu.m. by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and
Jiangsu are the most economically-vibrant regions in China, with a
13 to 19 percent annual increase on average in their GDPs, far
exceeding the national average. Their combined energy demand will
be nearly 360 million tons of coal by the year 2000, 470 million tons
by 2005, and 610 million tons by 2010.
</P>
<P>
So, developing offshore natural gas is important for sustained
economic growth in the region, Zhao pointed out.

<HEADLINE> World Records Fall at China's National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Teenager Chen Yan broke the
15-year-old world record in the women's 400-meter individual
medley, highlighting the opening day competitions of the Eighth
National Games here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen, 16, stole the limelight by clocking four minutes and
34.79 seconds, crushing the previous mark of 4:36.10 set by Petra
Schneider of former East Germany on August 1, 1982.
</P>
<P>
World record holder and Olympic champion Le Jingyi clocked the
year best of 54.10 seconds to take the first swimming title of the
Games in the women's 100-meter freestyle, an event she won in the
Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Chen signalled the advent of the Chinese younger swimmers who
are ready to take over the torch from the veterans.
</P>
<P>
"She was chased very hard by second-placer Wu Yanyan of Guangxi
Autunomous Region, and she had to strike out for the gold, which
probably was the factor for her record," said coach Han Bingyan.
</P>
<P>
"I had not expected to set a new world mark," said Chen. "But I
have trained hard after I returned home from Atlanta."
</P>
<P>
Being the best short-course women swimmer in the world, as her
coach Zhou Ming said, Le Jingyi was very elated to see the new
swimmers have getting more mature.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely congratulate Chen Yan on her world mark," Le said.
"I hope the young swimmers will have better performances in the
international competitions."
</P>
<P>
In the men's 100-meter breaststroke, Guangdong's Zeng Qiliang,
who finished seventh in the Atlanta Games, won the gold with a
Asian-mark of one minute and 1.66 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The men's 200-meter freestyle gold was taken by Shanghai's Chen
Zhou, followed by Tianjin's Du Jie and Hebei's Deng Qingsong.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese strongwomen also launched their strong attacks upon
the world records as a total of 12 women lifters surpassed the
listed records in the first-day competitions.
</P>
<P>
Xing Fen of Guangdong province, claimed three world best marks
en route to her victory in the women's 46-kg category, by lifting
85 kgs in snatch and 117.5 kgs in jerk for a combined total of
202.5 kgs.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhuo of Liaoning province, repeated the feat with three
world best scores to take the women's 50-kg title in a two-lift
combined total of 217.5 kgs.
</P>
<P>
The previous world marks in the 46-kg class were 81.5 kgs in
snatch, 105.5 kgs in jerk for a total of 185 kgs while the 50-kg
class world records were 88 kgs in snatch, 110.5 kgs in jerk and
197.5 kgs in two-lift total.
</P>
<P>
Four other women surpassed all three marks in the 46-kg class,
and two others bettered all three records in the 50-kg category.
</P>
<P>
Markswomen Zhao Ying and Xu Yimin both improved the world
record of 596 by one point in the women's standard rifle prone
competition.
</P>
<P>
The previous mark was set by Irina Shilova of former Soviet
Union on August 15, 1990.

<HEADLINE> China's Integration into World Economy Benefits All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The furthering of China's
integration into the world economy will benefit both China and its
 partners, a Chinese businesswoman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Shi Xiaoyuan, executive vice president of China National
Chemicals Imports and Exports Corporation (Sinochem), told a
plenary session of the East Asia Economic Summit that Sinochem's
annual business turnover has averaged 13.7 billion U.S. dollars
since 1988 compared with a total growth of less than 3 billion
dollars over a period of 38 years from 1950 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the rapid growth in the past decade to the
company's strategic readjustment in 1988 when Sinochem began to go
 global.
</P>
<P>
Today, Sinochem is no longer a mere trading company. It has
diversified into manufacturing, finance, shipping, real estate and
 insurance, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Sinochem has 46 domestic subsidiaries and
five overseas regional groups which control 44 overseas
subsidiaries in 22 countries and regions, she added.
</P>
<P>
At the session, a U.S. scholar attending the session said that
when China is further integrated into the world economy, its
increasing export ability will be a threat to the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Shi responded that the integration of China into the world
economy will not pose a threat to the rest of the world. On the
contrary, it will benefit the world because China will further
open its markets to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
China will open up wider in the future and that will obviously
offer a lot of opportunities for the businessmen of the world, she
 said.
</P>
<P>
At two other plenary sessions held in parallel earlier today,
top officials from Chongqing, China's newly established
municipality directly under the central government, and Hainan,
the largest special economic zone in China, explained their
preferential policies and excellent services to attract overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of Chongqing to be China's 4th municipality has
provided excellent opportunities for entrepreneurs and merchants
of the world to increase economic cooperation with the city, said
Xu Zhongmin, vice mayor of Chongqing, an economic center on the
upper reaches of the 6,300-km Yangtze River, the longest in China.
</P>
<P>
Both Chongqing and Hainan have decided to take measures to
encourage foreign investment, which include the formulation of
laws and regulations, strict enforcement of laws to protect the
legal rights and interests of foreign investors, adoption of one
stop service to raise efficiency, control of land price and
complete opening of markets.

<HEADLINE> HK Returns Illegal Waste to Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Three containers of computer
scrap, which arrived here last month from Australia without a
permit, are being returned to the country of export, Hong Kong's
Environmental Protection Department (EPD) said today.
</P>
<P>
The return of the waste to Sydney has been agreed with the
Australian authority, and EPD will continue to liaise with them on
the investigation and enforcement action of any further illegal
waste shipments, an EPD spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The three containers of computer scrap were detained on
September 22, and EPD officers found some potentially hazardous
electrical components which are subject to control under local
Waste Disposal Ordinance (WDO).
</P>
<P>
"A significant quantity of scrap computer monitors containing
cathode ray tubes were found in the containers. As cathode ray
tubes are potentially hazardous, transshipment of such waste
through Hong Kong requires a permit issued by EPD," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Since no permit has been sought or issued in this case,
enforcement action will be taken against the importer and the
illegal waste must be returned to the country of export," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman explained that computer scrap, such as printed
circuit boards, cable, metal or plastic frames, is not classified
as hazardous waste internationally and such waste can be recycled
to aid resource conservation.
</P>
<P>
But cathode ray tubes are potentially hazardous and are
classified as controlled waste under both local legislation and
the Basel Convention, an international agreement on the control of
transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and their disposal.
</P>
<P>
Under the local legislation, any person who imports, exports or
arranges the transshipment of hazardous or non-recyclable waste in
Hong Kong without a permit issued by EPD will be liable to a
maximum fine of 200,000 HK dollars (26,000 U.S. dollars) and six
months' imprisonment upon first conviction.

</P>
<P>
A fierce battle has been going on in the vicinity of Kunduz
airport which is located in a mountainous region, said the report.

</P>
<P>
Tashkargan is on a strategic road leading to the major northern
city of Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold of the anti-Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal from Tashkargan by the Taliban has opened the
road to Mazar-e-Sharif, making it easier for the anti-Taliban

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns USS Nimitz's Arrival in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran today condemned the
arrival of the nuclear-powered U.S. aircraft carrier Nimitz in
the Persian Gulf, calling it a "major source of tension" in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The USS Nimitz geared up into the Gulf Sunday night with its
battle group of six warships, as Iran was halfway in its naval
exercises code-named "Piroozi (Victory) 8" in the waters further
north.
</P>
<P>
"The American warships are the sole source of threats in the
region," Iran's Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said aboard his
command ship "Tunb" off Iran's southern port city of Bushehr,
according to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
"Termination of tensions in the Persian Gulf is possible only
through the departure of the U.S. and other foreign warships from
the region," he said, urging the regional countries to cooperate
toward a new security arrangement in the strategic area.
</P>
<P>
The Nimitz and its battle group reinforced eight destroyers,
frigates and other U.S. warships already in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iran's war games headquarters said the army and the Islamic
Revolution Guards Corps today staged a marine parade of 120
warships, cruisers, destroyers, torpedo boats, speed boats,
logistic warships as well as two Russian-made submarines, and some
40 fighter-bombers and helicopters demonstrated their combat power.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister and a number of senior military
commanders inspected the parade. IRNA said Victory 8 maneuvers
will enter into the fourth stage (tactical stage) from tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Shamkhani as dismissing the U.S. concern over Iran's
maneuvers as part of its propaganda campaign aimed to justify its
illegitimate presence in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's defense doctrine is geared toward elimination of the
sources of tension external to the region. We never consider our
Muslim brothers in the Arab states as a threat to the Islamic
Iran," Shamkhani said.
</P>
<P>
He added "The Victory 8 joint naval maneuvers are within the
scope of the previously announced annual exercises by Iran's armed
forces."
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that "beyond any doubts, the protest by the
Muslim nations of the region against the U.S. warships' polluting
presence would take new dimensions in the future."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the environmental group Green Front of Iran (Green
Peace) today condemned the Nimitz's presence in the Gulf. saying
it contributes to increasing pollution in the Gulf through various
thermal, sound and nuclear pollutants.
</P>
<P>
It urged environmental activists to call on all international
organizations and bodies to declare the Gulf as an area free of
nuclear weapons and confrontation and demand an end to U.S. naval
operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to IRNA, Iranian fishermen in the southern provinces
of Khuzestan, Bushehr, Hormuzgan and Sistan and Baluchistan have
strongly protested against the presence of the Nimitz and its
creation of pollution to the water.

<HEADLINE> New York Harbor Increases Cargo Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Cargo traffic handled by New
York Harbor rose about 12 percent in the first half of this year
compared with the same period 1996 due to a healthy economy and
infrastructure improvement, Port Authority reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Traffic increases were seen in evenly split imports and
exports, mostly in consumer goods including electrical and
electronics and cars, it said.
</P>
<P>
On the geographic scene, the growth came from almost every part
of the globe with Latin America leading the way, recording a 21
percent surge over last year, followed by Europe, up 15 percent,
Africa 13 percent and Mediterranean countries 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of containers moving through the port rose 11.8
percent to 832,499, a significant jump never seen in years.
</P>
<P>
The port has poured 500 million U.S. dollars in docks'
modernization in the past five years, including a ship-to-rail
terminal which helped cut the import and export costs.
</P>
<P>
Port officials said they need to do more to face the challenge
of growing cargos from East Asia.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Prefers French Missiles to U.S. Stinger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Defense Ministry
announced today that it had decided to purchase French-made
Mistral portable missiles rather than U.S. Stinger or British
Starburst missiles.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Mistral systems, valued at 250 billion won (275
million U.S. dollars), will be imported between 1998-1999 to
enhance the army's local air defense capabilities, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
It was a rare victory for France in South Korea, whose military
arsenal consists mainly of U.S.-made weapons.
</P>
<P>
France had offered to transfer missile technology to win the
fierce three-country bidding war, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
All three missiles met South Korean demands, but what won South
Korea over to Paris was the purchase terms, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Mistrals are more expensive, but more accurate, with a
successful hit rate of 92 percent, French officials in Seoul said.
</P>
<P>
As the army has already been operating about 1,000 Mistrals
imported in the late 1980s, the projected missile system has
advantage over Stinger and Starburst in terms of logistical
support, education, training and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Washington had lobbied forcefully for Seoul to purchase Stinger
missiles, which American forces stationed here are armed with.
</P>
<P>
In early June, the Pentagon notified the U.S. Congress that
Seoul would purchase Stinger missiles. The Pentagon announced
plans to sell 1,065 Stinger missiles, plus launchers and support
equipment to the country.
</P>
<P>
But the South Korean Defense Ministry immediately denied this,
saying nothing had been decided and the ministry had simply
requested the United States to provide prices and related
documents.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said at that time that the final decision would be
made in July, but it was delayed amid heated lobbying by the three
nations.

<HEADLINE> Religion Alive And Well in China, Says Senior Religious Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The head of the State Council's
Bureau of Religious Affairs said here today that because of the
Chinese government's policy, various religions are alive and well
and are going through what many believers call a "golden period".
</P>
<P>
According to Ye Xiaowen, Taoism, Islam, and Christianity have
85,000 places of worship nationwide and some 3,000 religious
groups. The country has 10 million Christians, compared with only
700,000 in 1949, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Tibet Autonomous Region, he noted, there are over 1,700
places of worship and 46,000 monks and nuns living in lamaseries
and monasteries.
</P>
<P>
In northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region alone,
there are 23,000 mosques that are home to approximately 30,000
religious officials, and since the early 1980s, more than 40,000
people have made the pilgrimage to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
Ye went on to say that Chinese believers have all kinds of
religious activities, chanting sutras, preaching, or being
baptised, both at home or in sites of worship and they have
religious festivals that are protected by Chinese laws.
</P>
<P>
In Tibet, sutra halls and statues of Buddha can be found in
almost every Buddhist's house and prayer flags are a common
sight. Each year Lhasa, Tibet's capital, has a million pilgrims.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Denies Remarks on Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President's Office
today denied a report quoting President Ezer Weizman as saying
that Israel is ready to give up Golan Heights in order to resume
peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The President's Office was commenting on a report published
on the leading Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot, which claimed that
Weizman had hinted to United States President Bill Clinton
during his visit to Washington last week that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu was ready to give up the occupied Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
The office said Weizman did not talk about territorial
compromise during his meeting with Clinton, but focused on ways
to resume peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Arye Shumer, Director-General of the President's Office,
charged Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Eliyahu Ben-Elisa for
leaking the news about Weizman-Clinton talks. His office has
lodged complaints to the Foreign Ministry and Cabinet Secretary
Danny Naveh.
</P>
<P>
Eitan Ben-Tsur, Director-General of the Foreign Ministry, said
it was not the job of embassy officials to make statements on
the president's visit. He called the incident as a serious
offense and a deviation from the work of the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Weizman is to hold a meeting with Netanyahu either today or
Tuesday to brief the latter on his visit to Washington, which
focused on resumption of the peace process, not only with the
Palestinian National Authority, but also with with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Despite of being the ceremonial head of state, Weizman has
been outspoken about politics, especially on the government's
policies on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He is often at odds with the prime minister over
controversial remarks he made to foreign guests that revealed
their differences over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace process has been suspended since
early last year following a wave of suicide bombings launched
by Islamic militants and the access to power in May last year by
the hardline Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly called for unconditional resumption of
peace talks, but Syria insists that the talks should be
restarted from the point where they were left off last year with
the previous Labor government, namely a promise to fully
withdraw troops from the strategic Golan Heights taken by Israel
in the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged deadlock in the peace track has led to fears
about possible armed confrontation between the two sides, and
Israel charges Damascus for preparing for a military attack
against Israel aimed at forcing the resumption of peace
talks.

<P>
Nevertheless, he said, some religious organizations have
appeared in China since 1980s engaging in illegal activities under
the pretext of carrying out religion, and although there are only
a handful of people, they have done considerable harm. This is
attributed to the fact that China is still at a primary stage of
socialism when there are remnants of feudalism.
</P>
<P>
They may mislead people when the country is undergoing great
social changes and is opening to all kinds of intellectual and
cultural influences, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
The heads of these organizations are mostly pleasure seekers
with no jobs, he added. They either distort religious doctrine,
deceiving people and getting them to resist the law or cheat
people out of their money and get them together for sexually
promiscuous activities.
</P>
<P>
"The general public, including religious believers, hate these
people bitterly," said Ye, "No country in the world can tolerate
criminal activities under the guise of religion, and China will
not."
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese government has cracked down on some of
these religious groups because of its obligation to protect the
people's interests and safeguard the dignity of the law and that
this is to better protect religious freedom and normal religious
activities.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Adapt Rapidly Changing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti today said there is an urgent need for African countries
"to adapt to the rapidly changing information technology as a
tool of communication" in a bid to confront the challenge of
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing the opening session of the Third
International Advertizing Association Africa Congress held here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti who is also the Minister for Planning and National
Development pointed out that with the process of globalization
gaining momentum, the economic marginalization of the African
continent was set to grow.
</P>
<P>
In the past, he noted, Africa had failed to take full
advantage of the opportunities offkred by growth in international
trade, inter-dependent enterprise and information technology.
</P>
<P>
The continent had also failed to take advantage of the
investment and financial flows to developing countries, the
vice-president added.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti stated that African countries were making efforts to
counter the economic marginalization of the@gontinent by
strengthening sub-regional groups.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these efforts, the Kenyan leader called upon
international organizations and bilateral donors to spearhead
efforts for finding a solution to the debt burden of the
continent on a "concerted basis".
</P>
<P>
He also required the international community to provide access
to the markets in the developed countries of processed goods from
developing countries, especially the African countries.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president stressed that African countries should make
use of information technology "to effectively advertize our
potentials to the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
In his view, the African continent has enormous amount of
resource and inexhaustible manpower that can steer it into a
newly industrializing continent and a commercial powerhouse in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the four-day congress due to end on October 16,
is "Creating a Borderless Continent: Africa's 21st Century
Communication Challenge".
</P>
<P>
Sources at the meeting noted that communication in Africa is
yet to be developed as governments in the continent still find it
expensive to spend on infrastructure like roads, railway lines,
telephone networks and rural electrification.
</P>
<P>
Many African governments are also reluctant to liberalize the
information industry so that private enterprises can invest and
develop the industry, they said. Endite

<TEXT>
<P>
The Communist Party, as the party in power in China, has been
implementing an earnest policy of religious freedom, and although
it consists of atheists, it has never stopped the people from
believing in religion.
</P>
<P>
"The Communist Party of China is in favor of abiding by the law
on religious development and opposes suppressing religion with
administrative power," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although there are various religions among the 1.2 billion
Chinese, he said, they have the fundamentally same interest in
building a more powerful, more democratic, and more civilized
country and in safeguarding national sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, with this common interest, the Chinese people should
consider the difference between theists and atheists as a matter
of secondary importance, and should not let it escalate into
antagonism, he said. There should be mutual respect and mutual
understanding in seeking common ground but preserving differences.
</P>
<P>
China has a long history of religion mingled with Chinese
culture, which has a central theme of forgiveness, peacefulness,
and "not doing unto others what you would not have them do unto
you."
</P>
<P>
Religion has also contributed to the Chinese culture, and the
Communist Party cherishes all traditional culture, including
religious culture, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Feudal rulers throughout the history viewed religion with
lenience and respect, and unlike in Western countries, in the
several thousand years of Chinese civilization there has never
been any large-scale religious persecution or religious wars," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Religions with different origins or doctrines can co-exist
harmoniously and develop in a healthy way. This is the historical
basis under which the Party carries out the policy of religious
freedom," Ye concluded.

<HEADLINE> WPC Delegates Seek Western Aid With Capital, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the 15th World
Petroleum Congress (WPC) today strongly appealed
to western industrialized countries to offer substantive aid in
capital and technology to tap petroleum resources.
</P>
<P>
"African countries face capital problems in opening up local
petroleum resources, so the western petroleum powers should
provide support in this effort," said Abba Kantao, head of the
Mali delegation to the WPC in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Some developed countries have repeatedly said they would help
us exploit oil resources, but we hope that the promises can be
carried out in earnest," said Kantao, who is Mali's director of
geology and minerals.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industries in many developing countries have
remained stagnant because of insufficient funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Driven by interests, the western countries may go and invest
in some developing nations," said Leite Da Costa of Angola, "but
they did little in technological transfer."
</P>
<P>
After a long civil war, Angola needs full-scale reconstruction,
he said, adding that petroleum is the country's most important
source of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The African delegate expressed his hope that developed
countries would make an effort to promote technological transfer
and seek common development.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 4,000 delegates from more than 90 countries and regions
are attending the five-day conference, which will focus on "Technology
and Globalization -- Leading the Petroleum Industry in the 21st
Century."

<HEADLINE> Action Urged to Save Mediterranean Fisheries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) is urging a European Union (EU) official to convince
Mediterranean states that they must take effective measures to
save their 3.8 billion U.S. dollars fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The WWF, along with Greenpeace and 41 Mediterranean
environmental groups, today called on Emma Bonino, the EU
commissioner for fishery and consumer policies, to increase
efforts on behalf of the EU.
</P>
<P>
The 22nd Session of the General Fisheries Council for the
Mediterranean (GFCM) of the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) of the United Nations opened in Rome today.
</P>
<P>
But the the European Commission's initiative for better
management of Mediterranean fish stocks Sea risks running aground
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The main bottleneck is lack of political will by GFCM member
states, says a press release from the WWF European Policy Office
in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
It says that crucial issues which must be resolved include the
overriding obligation to conserve marine species and ecosystems of
the Mediterranean, and the effective management of fishing
activities on a precautionary basis.
</P>
<P>
"The European Commission has an important responsibility in
ensuring that the Mediterranean governments, particularly EU
member states, will take the tough yet necessary management
decision to set Mediterranean fisheries on the course towards
sustainability," said Demetres Karavellas, WWF's Mediterranean
Fisheries Coordinator.
</P>
<P>
The release also quoted Bonino as saying that for the
Mediterranean, a policy of overfishing today will mean no fish
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The population of adult blue-fin tuna in the Mediterranean and
the East Atlantic has decreased by 83 percent in the last 20
years, while fleet expansion continues at an average annual rate
of 4 to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The EU fleets account for most of the annual Mediterranean fish
catch of 1.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The GFCM was established in 1949, but it has so far failed to
introduce effective fisheries management. The Rome meeting will
determine the future role of GFCM as an effective management body,
and test the ability of the European Commission in motivating its
member states.

ADDIS ABABA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Daily water supply for

The report attributed the increase of water supply in the city

<HEADLINE> Oil Trade Growing between Asia and Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Oil trading between Asia and
Africa has heated up because of the soaring demand for petroleum
in rapidly growing Asian countries, one senior oil official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Dirk van der Meer, president of the World Petroleum Congress
(WPC), told Xinhua in the ongoing WPC's 15th congress that Africa,
a continent with rich hydrocarbon resources, will play a more
important role in the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
Except for established oil-producing countries such as
Nigeria, Tunisia, Algeria and Libya, more African countries are
joining the oil development team, he said.
</P>
<P>
Van der Meer said the oil output in Africa in 1996 totaled 350
million tons, an increase of 1.5 percent from 1995. "The
production accounted for 10.4 percent of the world's total," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The daily oil output in Cote D'Ivoire averaged 2,055 tons last
year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1992, the proven oil reserves in Chad reached 200
million tons. The daily crude oil output of the country is
expected to top 20,550 tons in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Van der Meer said that Africa has already become the world's
second largest oil export region behind Gulf countries, and "the
export is expected to go upward in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries and regions have realized the
importance of Africa in future oil supply. In the last five
years, oil exports from Africa to Asia doubled with the daily
amount averaging 61,650 tons, or 10 percent of Africa's total
daily production.
</P>
<P>
Van der Meer said more Asian petroleum companies in recent
years have turned to Africa to import oil. The Republic of Korea
last year imported 2,055 tons a day from Africa, becoming one of
the main traders in the Nigerian oil market.
</P>
<P>
Now the second largest African crude oil buyer, India Oil
Corporation has increased its daily crude import from Nigeria
to 50,000 tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Official sources here denied
today the reported wheat shortage in Pakistan, saying that there
is no wheat crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that there is adequate wheat stock available
in the four provinces to meet the domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent reports in the local press about the
wheat crisis, the sources said the government is fully alive to
the situation, and there is no question of any crisis.
</P>
<P>
All possible measures are being taken to check wheat shortage,
and the four provinces have enough wheat stock to meet the demand,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
They also said the provinces are building their reserves, as
more supply is in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that supply from the major sources of
imported wheat like the U.S., Canada and Australia is on
uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has so far procured 2.8 million tons
of wheat besides an import of 1.7 million tons. A total of 4.5
million tons of wheat have been made available so far, which is
1.2 million tons more than last year's supply.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Pakistan will import another 2.8
million tons of wheat up to March 1998 and its uninterrupted
supply will continue to the provinces.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Military Exchanges Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Friendly exchanges between the
armed forces of China and the United States have been increasing
along with Sino-US relations since the meeting between presidents
Jiang Zemin and Bill Clinton in Manila last November, where they
discussed principles for further growth of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
After the visit to the U.S. last December by Vice-Chairman of
China's Central Military Commission and Defense Minister Chi
Haotian, there was a marked improvement in bilateral military
links. The visit was regarded as a major step toward the
improvement and development of Sino-US military relations.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the US, Chi met with President Clinton and
Defense Secretary William Perry and the two sides noted the
importance of bilateral ties in safeguarding peace in the
Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In February, Kui Fulin, a Deputy Chief of General Staff of the
China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), visited the US, and in
July, Wu Quanxu, another Deputy Chief also visited there, as did
Fu Quanyou, Chief of the PLA General Staff, in August.
</P>
<P>
John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff;
Archie Clemins, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet;
Dennis Reimer, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army; and Chief of
Naval Operations Jay Johnson visited China this year.
</P>
<P>
These high-level exchanges have increased mutual understanding,
friendship, and trust and have provided channels for the two sides
to discuss issues of common concern. The two armed forces have
made some substantial progress in regional security matters and in
bilateral ties through these exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have smoothly arranged for American warships to
anchor in Hong Kong after July 1 of this year, and 8 groups of
U.S. warships have been in Hong Kong since that time. US warships
also visited the Chinese city of Qingdao this September.
</P>
<P>
The first visit to the U.S. by a Chinese fleet last March was a
significant voyage that opened a new chapter in relations between
the two navies and showed the PLA's mighty and civilized image to
the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The two armed forces have also had exchanges in the fields of
military science, logistics and military law.
</P>
<P>
Sino-US military ties obviously constitute an important part of
overall bilateral ties, and an official from China's Defense
Ministry's Foreign Affairs Bureau says that Jiang Zemin's
forthcoming visit to the U.S. will help develop friendly ties
between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The PLA is ready to have more exchanges with its U.S.
counterparts in various fields and at various levels on the basis
of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, and on equality, mutual
benefit, and mutual respect as part of a joint effort for peace,
security, and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the world
as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Warns Greece, Cyprus Over Joint Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry
warned today that the ongoing joint maneuvers by Greece and Cyprus
will negatively affect the Cyprus peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly press conference here, Sermet Atacanli,
spokesman for the ministry, said that the Greek-Cypriot joint
military exercises would not be conducive to finding a solution
to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Under their joint defense pact, Greek and Cypriot troops
started one-week joint exercises, code-named "Nikiforos '97," last
Friday in the Greek Cypriot-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
The exercises have drawn strong protests from both Turkey and
the Turkish Cypriots, which accused Greece and Greek Cypriots of
damaging the climate of talks on the island.
</P>
<P>
All parties concerned should avoid actions which might make an
adverse impact on the settlement of the Cyprus issue, Atacanli
said.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the small island state has become worse after
the Cypriot government signed a deal early this year to buy S-300
anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military has threatened that it would destroy these
missiles if they are finally deployed in Cyprus, saying that the
missiles constitute a serious threat to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish navy and police have tightened their security
measures on those ships sailing through the Bosporus Strait in
order to prevent the delivery of the Russian-made missiles to
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Greece have warned Turkey not to attack Russian or
Greek ships carrying the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of an abortive pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" which is recognized only by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and international community have been making
efforts for the reunification of the divided country, but no
tangible results have been achieved so far.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Economic Ministers to Discuss Regional Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUBANG JAYA, Malaysia, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The currency
problems affecting the Southeast Asia region will be discussed at
the 29th ASEAN Economic Ministers (AEM) meeting on October 16-18,
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz
said here today.
</P>
<P>
She said, "Although currency discussions might not be within
our (AEM's) jurisdiction but that of finance ministers, we should
be discussing it."
</P>
<P>
This was "because currency issues are related to trade and
investments... We must look at the linkages," she told reporters
while checking out media facilities at the media center at the
Sunway Lagoon Resort Hotel where the AEM will be held.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it would lead towards ASEAN's full management (of the
problem)," she said, adding that before this, there had been no
informal talks on the issue by ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members -- Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Indonesia and Malaysia -- have borne the brunt of severe currency
speculation since July with their currencies falling between 25-30
percent against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, in the past few days, some currencies recouped part of
their losses. Malaysia's ringgit came back from a low of 3.41 just
two weeks ago to the 3.04 level last week.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said, "Malaysia is expected to present a background
paper on the issue at the Senior Economic Officials Meeting (SEOM)
either today or tomorrow," and that the paper would include the
impact the crisis had on affected countries.
</P>
<P>
To a question whether the economic ministers would discuss the
setting up of an ASEAN fund to help countries deal with currency
problems, she said, "If such a fund was being proposed, it would
be discussed by ASEAN finance ministers."
</P>
<P>
What economic ministers want to do is to "start a dialogue on
this... come to a meeting of minds and to coordinate our
approaches," she said, adding "I cannot say what will come out of
this but it would be a free-wheeling discussion."
</P>
<P>
She is of the view that the discussions on the regional
currency problems at the AEM proposed by Malaysia could provide
valuable input in dealing with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
She said ASEAN's experience in handling the crisis could
complement the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank's
efforts to look into ways to curb excessive speculation and
manipulation in the currency markets.
</P>
<P>
Both multilateral agencies have charged Malaysia with
initiating studies into ways to curb currency manipulation, with
the latter consistently calling for greater transparency in
foreign exchange trading.

<P>
BRUSSELS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
calling for dynamic, innovative and stable European enterprises
with international outlooks.
</P>
<P>
Christos Papoutsis, EU commissioner responsible for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SME), made the call today at the fifth
annual SME conference of the Union of Industrial and Employers'
Confederations of Europe (UNICE).
</P>
<P>
"We should more actively encourage an enterprise culture," the
commissioner said, adding that this great potential in particular
sectors like the social economy needed to be unlocked.
</P>
<P>
Papoutsis said Europe should specify those sectors where SME
could play a significant role and should "pay particular
attention" to the structurally changing sectors. He set a new
agenda at the conference for improving and simplifying the EU
business environment.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises and the social partners should join in their
efforts to make enterprises productive and competitive, and to
achieve the required balance between flexibility and security in
labor market, Papoutsis emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also announced the state of development,
achieved by the EU's executive body, the European Commission, of a
new financial system to provide support for the creation of
cross-border joint ventures by SMEs within the EU.

the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government
that represents China. He said that his country was the first

future.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government of his country will
unswervingly push forward the deepening of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>

cherishes friendly feelings toward the peoples of other developing
countries. China has always lent sympathy and support to them for
their efforts to build their own countries and provided them with
assistance within its capacity.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both China and Antiqua and Barbuda are faced with
common task of developing their own economies. Both countries are
trying to explore the new ways and fields for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Bird thanked the Chinese Government and people for providing
assistance to his country in the fields of agriculture, culture
and urban development. He noted that economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries has a bright future. He
welcomes Chinese entrepreneurs to go to his country for
cooperation. He also hopes that the two peoples will strengthen
exchanges and deepen mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
closed down today on lackluster trading, with continuing selling
of industrials to finance the Telstra (telecommunications giant)
offering and fears surrounding the 10th anniversary of the stock
market crash.
</P>
<P>
"The market was sluggish," said broker Peter Struk of Reynolds
and Co. "It drifted virtually most of the day. People are still
selling industrials to get into Telstra."
</P>
<P>
He said some investors had talked about the anniversary of the
October 20, 1987, the Black Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index was down 31.2 points at 2663.3 after
an intra-day high of 2694.5 and a low of 2662.1.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The all resources index was down 11.4 points at 1319.5 and the
all industrials index was down 56 points at 4372.1.
</P>

Among the resources giants, blue chip BHP dropped 28 cents, WMC

</P>
<P>
Shares in Coca-Cola Amatil continued to lose ground today
because of ongoing Southeast Asian currency turmoil and its
exposure in the Philippines.

<P>
The bank sector continued to lose ground as speculation on
another interest rate reduction dampened, with some investors now
suggesting it might not occur until next year, if at all, brokers
said.
</P>
<P>
The gold index was up 2.8 points at 1327.9, boosted in early
trading by a higher gold bullion price. Sydney trading in gold

<HEADLINE> World's Proved Oil Reserves to Trend Down Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The world's net proved oil
reserves will most probably begin to decrease during the second
quarter of the 21st century, a group of leading international
experts said here today.
</P>
<P>
By that time, the addition of commercial oil reserves will not
be able to compensate oil production, according to a review and
forecast paper delivered by the Russian experts at the ongoing
15th World Petroleum Congress.
</P>
<P>
But the amount of remaining unexplored world oil resources will
allow to provide an addition of proved reserves due to new
discoveries in the first quarter of next century, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, successful addition of gas reserves due to new
discoveries will continue beyond the middle of the new century,
according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that at present, the basic trends in petroleum
exploration indicate a decline in scales of new discoveries in
long-term explored basins and a complication of newly discovered
accumulation types in old basins.
</P>
<P>
The share of gas discoveries in total world energy discoveries
has been increasing while that of oil has been decreasing, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The conditions for oil exploration will continue to be more
complicated because of a decrease in new discoveries and
complications in the nature of new accumulations in old basins,
they said, adding that another factor complicating exploration in
the next century will be an increase in drilling depths.
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the assessments of the world's recoverable oil
reserves have fallen between 300 to 400 billion tons.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Up 77.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
in August increased 77.7 percent from a year earlier to 817.8
billion yen (6.8 billion U.S. dollars), the Finance Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise to the yen's weakness against
the dollar, which gave export competitiveness to Japanese goods,
and to a strong demand in overseas markets such as the United
States against weak demand in Japan.
</P>
<P>
In goods and services trading in August, Japan registered a
surplus of 326.6 billion yen (2.7 billion U.S. dollars), about 65
times more than that of last year, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus in merchandise trade in August expanded 68.0
percent to 912.6 billion yen (7.6 billion U.S. dollars), up for
the fifth straight month, following a 50.5 percent surge in the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew 13.8 percent to 3,826.5 billion yen (31.9 billion
dollars), while imports edged up 3.4 percent to 2,913.8 billion yen
(24.3 billion U.S. dollars), the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In service trade, including tourism, Japan posted a deficit of
586.0 billion yen (4.9 billion U.S. dollars), up from a deficit of
538.2 billion yen (4.5 billion U.S. dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance measures the flow of goods and
services as well as investment and other monetary transfers.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the August data, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo
Muraoka said the recent sharp growth in Japan's current account
surplus will end before too long.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it (the sharp rise) will be mended sooner or
later," the top government spokesman told a press conference.

<HEADLINE> China Successful in Increasing Onshore Oil Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- After 30-odd years of
scientific research and practice, China has scored remarkable
progress in increasing crude oil recovery by developing the oil
polymer-driven technology.
</P>
<P>
According to Han Dakuang, a senior expert at the China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC), most of the country's oilfields belong to
the continental deposits as far as reserve layers are concerned,
with oil wells containing more water.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ongoing 15th World Petroleum Congress (WPC), the
expert noted that about two thirds of the country's crude reserves
remained to be extracted. And it has become a pressing task to
develop oil recovery technology.
</P>
<P>
Han said that as early as in the 1960s, China started interior
experiments on the polymer-driven technology and achieved
positive results in Xinjiang and Daqing, the country's largest
oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, China has made six pilot experiments in the
oilfields of Daqing, Dagang and Henan, resulting in the decline of
the water content and higher crude output in these oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Starting in the 1990s, the country expanded the experiments
into industrial production, with more satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
The expert said that the polymer-driven technology is very
promising and more mature in terms of technological application,
which produced higher economic returns after being applied to
the country's various major oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that injection of one ton of polymer into the
oil wells will turn out an additional 167 tons of crude.
</P>
<P>
To provide more polymer for the oilfields, the country has set
up the world's largest polymer-making plant with an annual
production capacity of more than 50,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The expert expected the country to pump out an additional 5 to
7 million tons of crude annually by the year 2000 by spreading the
use of the new technology.

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel released today
another nine Jordanian prisoners in a bid to show the gesture
of goodwill to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
All the nine Jordanians were being transported to Jordan
today by the Israeli military helicopter, an Israeli army
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that these Jordanians were not related to the
activities of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and they
will continue their prison services in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Jordanian relationship has been damaged by
Israeli intelligence agents' failed assassination of Hamas
leader Khaled Mashaal last month in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Some media reports said that Jordan has suspended its security
cooperation with Israel, but the Israeli side has denied that.
</P>
<P>
the Israeli army announcement quoted Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai as saying today that the Israeli army will do its best
to improve Israel's relations with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister is going to Jordan again in the near
future for such a purpose, it said.
</P>
<P>
Israel released early this month nine Jordanian prisoners and
sent them back to Jordan under the agreement reached by the two
sides in exchange for the release of the two Israeli agents who
attacked Mashaal.

<HEADLINE> Investments in Indonesia Approach 73 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Investments implemented in
Indonesia, under both foreign and domestic investment schemes, in
the 6th Five-year Development Plan (1994-1999) have reached 72.89
billion U.S. dollars, 97.43 percent of the 74.9 billion dollar
target.
</P>
<P>
But to ensure full achievement of the investment target,
services for investors must be improved, Iskandar, vice chairman
for development and implementation supervision of the Capital
Investment Coordinating Agency (BKPK), said Sunday in Mataram,
West Nusa Tenggara, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
From April 1994 to September 1997, the total number of approved
local investment projects reached 2,763 worth 99.53 billion
dollars, while foreign investment projects reached 2,700 worth
118.4 billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There have been efforts underway to spread investment
throughout the country, particularly outside Java in eastern
Indonesia. This has shown some improvement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iskandar said the reason that not all domestic and foreign
projects approved had been implemented was because prospective
investors still faced some constraints.
</P>
<P>
He said the problems included the necessary funding support,
difficulty in raw material supply and finding skilled and trained
workers and the long process of permit issuance in the provinces.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yan of Liaoning province
broke the 400-meter women's individual medley world record while
Olympic champion Le Jingyi swam the year best on the opening day
of the China's Eighth Naitonal Games here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen, 16, captured the gold medal by clocking four minutes and
34.79 seconds, beating the previous world mark of 4:36.10 set by
Petra Schneider of former East Germany on August 1, 1982.
</P>
<P>
Le, winner of the 100-meter freestyle in the Atlanta Games last
year, captured the first swimming gold of the National Games in
her discipline with the year-best 54.10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who had a poor show in Atlanta, stole the limelight from
the two-time Olympian and world 50-meter freestyle record holder
Le, signalling the advent of the Chinese younger swimmers who are
to take over the torch from the veterans.
</P>
<P>
"She was chased very hard by second-placer Wu Yanyan of Guangxi
Autunomous Region," Chen's coach Han Bingyan said. "She had to
strike out for the gold, which probably was the factor for her
record."
</P>
<P>
Wu, also a teenager who competed in the Atlanta Games, finished
second with 4:36.28, followed by Ning Bo of Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
"I had not expected to set a new world mark," said Chen. "But I
have trained hard after I returned home from Atlanta."
</P>
<P>
"I'm very satisfied with the results," Le said. "After all, I
resumed systematic training only months ago after the Pan-Pacific
Championships early this year."
</P>
<P>
Le was followed by teenager Shan Ying of the Chinese Army and
Sun Guiling of Guangdong province, who were timed at 54.49 and
55.33 seconds respetively.
</P>
<P>
Being the best short-course women swimmer in the world, as her
coach Zhou Ming said, Le was very elated to see the new swimmers
have getting more mature.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely congratulate Chen Yan on her world mark," Le said.
"I hope the young swimmers will have better performances in the
international competitions."
</P>
<P>
In the men's 100-meter breaststroke, Guangdong's Zeng Qiliang,
who finished seventh in the Atlanta Games, won the gold with a
Asian-mark of one minute and 1.66 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Local swimmer Chen Jianhong finished second with 1:02.29 and
Chinese Army's Zhu Yi at third with 1:02.61.
</P>
<P>
The men's 200-meter freestyle gold was taken by Shanghai's Chen
Zhou, who was followed by Tianjin's Du Jie and Hebei's Deng
Qingsong.

<HEADLINE> NAA Stresses Transatlantic Ties in Wider Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The annual session of the
North Atlantic Assembly (NAA), which ended here today, agreed that
a new dimension should be added to the Euro-Atlantic alliance to
manage new threats to peace and freedom.
</P>
<P>
The threats were defined as nationalistic, ethnic, religious,
socio-economic and ecological crises and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the new threats, NAA President William Roth
appealed to delegates to shoulder the responsibility of
burden-sharing enlargement costs, to seriously consider new
missions for the transatlantic alliance and to expedite the
internal and external adaptation of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Roth said the three tasks need both transatlantic consensus and
improved military capability.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from NATO member states and other European countries
maintained that transatlantic interests should not be undermined
by divergence of views and differences among alliance members.
</P>
<P>
Adverse debates are expected in the following months when the
parliaments of NATO member states start ratifying the accession of
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
"As parliamentarians, we must ensure that the ratification of
the first new members of the alliance is shepherded through our
respective nations expeditiously and decisively," Roth said.
</P>
<P>
Enlargement had to be accompanied by a collective determination
to streamline, restructure and modernize the defense capabilities
that in turn rendered NATO members into a constructive and
indispensable bedrock of Euro-Atlantic security, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's Secretary-General, Javier Solana, said the
expansion of the military alliance will not be limited by
geography.
</P>
<P>
Future enlargement will be defined by common values, he added.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said NATO's opening was not just a gesture but
rather a guarantee for future security and stability.
</P>
<P>
NAA delegates were aware that only as close partners would the
transatlantic alliance succeed in meeting global challenges.
</P>
<P>
Partners of the transatlantic alliance were urged to lay the
foundation for a successful global partnership through joint
movement toward multilateral cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite a lull in the clash
over the weekend between Nigerian soldiers of ECOMOG and Sierra
Leonean troops at Jui, 13 miles east of the capital, hundreds of
people today continued to flee from nearby Wellington village.
</P>
<P>
A family of five died when stray shells fired by Nigerian
gunners hit their residence on Saturday. Over 200 people are in
hospital suffering from fragment wounds, a medical officer said.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning in Wellington, this reporter saw mothers
with babies strapped on their backs, the aged and other sweating
displaced people walking long distances barefooted.
</P>
<P>
One eyewitness told Xinhua, "I just left my house without
deciding where I am heading for."
</P>
<P>
The Jui area remains closed and stern looking Sierra Leonean
soldiers backed by the people's army set up checkpoints with huge
boulders, scrapped cars and worn out tyres on the road leading to
the Nigerian base.
</P>
<P>
"No one goes through," a soldier shouted to this reporter as
he crawled behind a sub machine gun.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources said it is still not known whether the
Sierra Leonean troops have routed the Nigerians from their Jui
base as was claimed by government spokesman Allieu Kamara. But
parading soldiers in the capital seemed to be in high spirit
since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have captured many Nigerian soldiers and this time we
shall not just let them go like the last time," said a military
officer.
</P>
<P>
Observers attributed the reference to the surrender of some
300 Nigerian soldiers on June 2 when rebels captured the
Nigerians at a seaside hotel in the west of the capital. They
were freed unarmed a few days later.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government Torchlight newspaper said today, "More than
100 Nigerians including six top officers were captured from Jui,
Kenema in the east and Gondama in the southern Bo."

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Promises Wider Alliance in Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 13 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Secretary General Javier Solana said today the
expansion of the military alliance would not be limited simply by
geography.
</P>
<P>
At a plenary session of the North Atlantic Assembly (NAA),
Solana said that enlargement would be defined by common values,
not merely by geographical division.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO's expansion membership would include all
those qualified, including Russia, if it intended to apply for
entry into the NATO.
</P>
<P>
"Time is moving so fast that it is hard to make any
prediction," said Solana who arrived here today to address the
plenary session of the four-day meeting which closed today.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO's expansion is a guarantee for future security and
stability rather than a gesture.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of the entry of Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic into the NATO would be the joint responsibilities of all
the participants at the NAA annual session in building a new
alliance.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the cost of enlargement "will be manageable
and will be shared fairly by the 19 NATO members".
</P>
<P>
He argued that the enlargement benefits far outweigh the cost
of enlargement, and "the cost of not opening will be much more
expensive."
</P>
<P>
Solana said enlargement costs would be an important decision
with a political dimension, which "will benefit the generations to
come."
</P>
<P>
All members of the NATO Partnership for Peace program will be
involved in future planning and decision making of NATO, Solana
also said.
</P>
<P>
The NAA session was attended by about 300 parliamentarians from
the 16 NATO member states and 15 central and eastern European
countries, Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Macedonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania,
Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Solana said it was important for the meeting to be held here as
it showed Romania, the first non-NATO member hosting the NAA
meeting, had gone far and fast in NATO integration.
</P>

However, Solana did not reveal whether Romania would be
included in the second wave of the enlargement in early 1999. He
said the Madrid summit was only the beginning of the expansion
process instead of the end of it.
</P>
<P>
Romania has not been invited to the Madrid summit to join the
accession negotiations mainly because of its delay in economic
restructuring and minority problems.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets With WPC Participants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng, in a
meeting with participants from 90 countries and regions to the
on-going 15th World Petroleum Congress (WPC) here today, said that
it is an occassion for Chinese petroleum sector to increase its
co-operative relations with foreign counterparts on the basis on
equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Li said he believes that participants can increase mutual
understanding through discussions and exchanges and promote the
development and technical advancement of the oil industry globally.
</P>
<P>
Li discussed the development of China's petroleum industry and
said the Chinese government has always paid close attention to its
development and has designated the industry one of the key
economic sectors in the national development program, and the
industry has a pivotal role in China's economic growth in the last
five years of the century.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China's petroleum industry has had some great
achievements over the past 40 years and domestic oil products have
not only basically satisfied the rising domestic demand, but also
are exported.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China's rapid economic growth will create more
demand for oil, natural gas, and related products in the future,
but by "stablizing the east and developing the west" the oil
industry in China will develop sustainably.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country with more than 1.2 billion people, he
noted, China's hydrocarbon resources still can not meet the
fast-growing demand and oil resources need further exploration and
development, but "it takes time to build new oilfields."
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, he said, the Chinese government has
formulated a policy of developing both domestic and overseas
markets with various forms of international co-operation, such as
trade or investment on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that some multinationals in recent years have
been optimistic about the China market and have discussed
cooperation with Chinese counterparts, and the Chinese government
welcomes and supports these actions.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dirk van der Meer, the WPC president, said on behalf of all
the participants in the meeting that he would like to extend his
gratitude for the work done by the Chinese
organizers. Participants have used the opportunity to improve
their understanding of China's moderization drive, he said.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Criminal Tribunal Dogged by Staffing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda continues to be dogged by a shortage of
competent prosecutors to lead the on-going trials of the 1994
genocide suspects, the East African newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Recruitment of competent staff in both the Tribunals is my
biggest problem," Judge Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor of
the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of vacancies but I have always been looking
for people with two languages so as to avoid problems, but to be
honest with you it has been very difficult for me to get the
right people", he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that most people with the desired qualifications have
been reluctant to join the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The use of non-professionals to translate from Kinyarwanda to
English has sometimes caused misunderstandings in the tribunal,
said the press report.
</P>
<P>
In a recent case, a witness under cross examination called a
defence counsel, named Tiphaine Dickson, a liar on the basis of a
misunderstanding caused by a translator and complained to
Tribunal President Laity Kama.
</P>
<P>
Kama then apologized to Dickson and warned the translator not
to give her own opinion but to accurately convey what the witness
had said.
</P>
<P>
This was not the first time the president of the tribunal has
had to warn prosecution officers to be better prepared and more
accurate during sessions, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Trade Deficit Shrinks Remarkably </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's trade deficit
shrank 25 percent to 6 billion US dollars during the first
three-quarters of the year, in comparison to the same period in
1996, Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics announced today.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that imports in the first nine months totaled
21.45 billion dollars, while exports reached 15.36 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli economists are concerned that the reduced deficit
is not the result of an increase in exports, but rather the
economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
On the positive front, economist Ruth Lowenstein, of economic
planning company Sadan Lowenstein Limited, pointed out that there
has been an increase in investment goods being brought into the
country within the figures for imports.
</P>
<P>
Lowenstein said that "This is good as it shows an improvement
in the overall composition of imports."
</P>
<P>
But he added that it is too early to say this is the end of
the downward cycle in the economy, that is likely to continue for
a while yet.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta to Hold ECOWAS Citizens Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG) has alerted that the military junta in Sierra
Leone plans to arrest, detain and hold hostage as many west
African citizens as it can capture.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the junta is to hold the hostages as human shield
and use them to bargain in future negotiations with sub-regional
leaders for the return of Foday Sankoh, the rebel leader now
detained in Nigeria, according to an ECOMOG statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued on Sunday by ECOMOG headquarters in
Liberia, said the junta also attacked ECOMOG protected areas last
Thursday and Sunday, and the force had no option but to defend
itself.
</P>
<P>
"Attacking ECOMOG protected areas would only aggravate the
crisis and bring more hardship on civilians who are already
traumatized by the recklessness and state of anarchy the junta
has unleashed on the citizens since May," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Many citizens of othe west African countries and Sierra
Leoneans are currently taking refuge in ECOMOG protected areas
which the junta plans to attack to capture civilians and
soldiers, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the junta claimed at the weekend that it had overrun
a Nigerian military base outside the capital Freetown and
captured some Nigerian soldiers, who constitute the bulk of
ECOMOG forces.
</P>
<P>
Describing the claim as "wishful thinking", ECOMOG said the
junta were telling lies.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu was reported
as saying Sunday night that his troops were still holding the
position allegedly overrun by the junta.
</P>
<P>
West African countries decided on Saturday to resume dialogue
with the junta toward peaceful settlement of the crisis in Sierra
Leone triggered off by the the May 25 coup that toppled the
legitimate government led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
So far there has been no response from the junta.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Plants, Pests Invade Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- At least ten kinds of foreign
pests invaded Uganda due to flouting quarantine, The New Vision
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The large amount of water hyacinth is suffocating almost all
other water organisms in some waters, and latana camara in its
full developed stature of five meters high are stifling all other
plants beneath them in shallow ponds and wetlands.
</P>
<P>
Both water hyacinth and latana camara, or "the curse of India"
as referred to by locals, were declared by Ugandan authorities as
the forbidden plants to import. But still, they have been
introduced into the country in earlier sixties and
fifties.
</P>
<P>
The recent case is a micro-organism called Em 4 which local
scientists said is suspected to cause diseases both to plants and
animals and to have negative environmental effect. Em 4 is
imported by some farmers visiting Indonesia in July. The
substance of Em 4 was impounded in August when the presidential
office intervened. The garden using the substance now is under
scientific observation.
</P>
<P>
Em 4 was brought into the country in a luggage and not
declared to custom, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Other dangerous imported plants and pests include dodder weeds
and oxalis from Kenya which choke crops, coffee wilt from Zaire,
cassava mite from south America and cotris woolly white fly.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said that evading pre-export plant inspection
also caused a big loss to Ugandan exporters.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Begin Water Treatment Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Work on a water treatment plant
for improving water supply in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka will
begin on October 21, said sources from the city authorities today.
</P>
<P>
The building up of the water treatment plant at Saidabad is
aimed at increasing the water supply by an additional 225 million
liters or 50 million gallons daily.
</P>
<P>
The plant to be financed jointly by the World Bank and the
French government will cost an estimated 7.5 billion taka (about
168.91 million U.S. dollars), and the work is expected to complete
by the year 2002, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
For Dhaka, a city with a population of 9 million, the present
water consumption has been estimated at 1.3 billion liters per
day, but the quantity of supply through 224 deep tubewells and
water supply works stands at 850 million liters, leaving a daily
shortfall of 450 million liters, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken up this plan apprehending that
extraction of water from underground through deep tubewells might
cause an adverse effect to high-rise buildings, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Belgian Defense Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Defense Minister
Jean-Paul Ponsle's current China visit will not only increase
friendship and cooperation between the two armed forces, but
also make new contributions to Sino-Belgian relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese National Defense Minister Chi Haotian made this remark
today in talks with his Belgian counterpart Ponsle, who is
here on an official goodwill visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and
state councillor, extended welcome to Ponsle, who is the first
Belgian defense minister to visit China since the establishment of
diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1971.
</P>
<P>
He said that since then, the two countries have had fruitful
cooperation in political, economic and military areas.
</P>
<P>
China places great emphasis on advancing friendly and
cooperative ties with Belgium, he said, adding that it is ready to
promote bilateral relations on the basis of mutual respect, and
seeking common grounds while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
he said, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is ready to
redouble its efforts to further relations between the two armed
forces."
</P>
<P>
On peace-keeping actions of the United Nations (UN), Chi said
that as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China
supports the UN in maintaining world peace and security in
accordance with its Charter, and that China adheres to principles,
upholds justice, safeguards the rights and interests of developing
nations and has participated in the UN peace-keeping actions in
a constructive and responsible manner.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Ponsle on China's guilding principle concerning
the UN peace-keeping actions, reform and opening-up, the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's
defense-oriented national policy and its independent foreign
policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
Ponsle said that as China is a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, Belgium is willing to exchange views with China
on security issues. He also briefed Chi on Belgium's participation
in peace-keeping actions in Croatia, the reform of the Belgian
armed forces and Belgium's views on European security.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Belgian-Chinese relations have been developing
smoothly, and that leaders of the two armed forces have frequently
exchanged visits in recent years, thus increasing contacts between
the two armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Downplays Israeli Military Chief's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today downplayed the
visit by Israeli Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak -- a focus of
attention for Arab countries -- as a regular one.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press briefing here, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that Shahak's visit is aimed at
exchanging views with high-ranking Turkish military officials over
some issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
He declined to elaborate on the topics to be discussed by
Shahak and his Turkish counterpart Ismail Hakki Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
Describing the visit as "regular and routine," Atacanli added
that the Israeli military chief's tour was a return visit for the
one to Israel by Karadayi last February.
</P>
<P>
Shahak arrived here yesterday on a three-day visit to Turkey
aimed at enhancing bilateral military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two top officers are expected to discuss the scheduled
joint naval exercises of Israel, Turkey and the United States
and Israel's involvement in the project to modernized Turkey's
tank units.
</P>
<P>
On the three-way naval war games, Atacanli said that it might
be held in mid-November, but added that the final date would be
announced by the Turkish General Staff.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side had earlier asked for the further postponement of
the Israeli-Turkish-U.S. joint maneuvers, re-scheduled to start on
November 16. Some reports put the date in next January.
</P>
<P>
However, neither Israel nor Turkey had given any positive
response to the U.S. suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's involvement in the joint exercises has been strongly
criticized by some Arab countries, which accused Ankara of
betraying the interests of the Muslim world by developing closer
military ties with the Jewish rival.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government had repeatedly stated that its
cooperation with Israel is not directed against any other
countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shahak is reportedly to persuade the Turkish
military to replace its tank units with Israeli-made Merkava 3
tanks, which are one of the world's most advanced types.
</P>
<P>
Turkish-Israeli cooperation in military and defense fields has
gained a rapid expansion since early last year, when the two
countries signed two agreements to allow joint warplane exercise
in each other's airspace.

<HEADLINE> China to Become More Open, Prosperous: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Wang Zhongyu, minister of
China's State Economic and Trade Commission, said here today that
China is expected to become a more open and prosperous country and
an important participant in the world economy in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the Sixth East Asia Economic
Summit in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, Wang
briefed some 1,000 delegates from over 50 countries on the
economic growth in China and reform of its state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He described the ongoing three-day summit organized by the
World Economic Forum as the most important meeting held in the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region following the World
Bank/International Monetary Fund annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy will grow at an annual rate of 8 percent in
 the remaining years of the century, while the country's annual
inflation rate will be kept below 5 percent, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China could maintain a 7 percent growth rate in the first 10
years of the next century, he said, predicting that "a more open
and prosperous China will become an important participant in the
world economy, particularly in the East Asian economy, and a
cooperation partner to be trusted."
</P>
<P>
China has made great progress in its economic development since
1979, under the policy of reform and opening to the outside world
initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, Wang said,
adding that its annual growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP)
reached 12.1 percent during the 1991-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the growth rate of the Chinese
economy was 9.7 percent and the price increases were lowered to
6.1 percent, he said, noting that the Chinese economy had
embarked on a track of continuous, rapid and sound development.
</P>
<P>
As to the restructuring of the state-run enterprises, Wang said
the Chinese government is ready to bail out most of the
loss-making large- and medium-sized state-run enterprises within
the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the state-run enterprises provides a great
opportunity for foreign investors, Wang stressed, calling on the
foreign industrial and commercial community to take part in the
reform and reorganization of China's state-run enterprises.

<HEADLINE> World Tanker Market Expected to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- World tanker market is likely
to improve in the next two or three years though it is facing
strong competition from pipeline transportation, experts attending
the ongoing 15th World Petroleum Congress (WPC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
There are signs that some of the positive development for tanker
demand seen in the early 1990s will be restored by the end of the
century, Jon Edvard Sundnes with Norway's First Olsen Tankers Ltd
said at a forum of the congress.
</P>
<P>
The world tanker market experienced a major setback in 1994 after
a significant increase in tanker demand in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Sundnes said that while the development in oil consumption in the
United States and Europe were earlier regarded as the driving force
behind tanker demand, Far East Asia's importance has been increasing.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Far East oil consumption is expected to
continue its growth and crude oil import will increase as more
refineries come on stream in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is now assumed that the increased demand for transport to the
Far East will more than compensate for the lost transport demand to
the Atlantic Basin," Sundnes noted.
</P>
<P>
Much of the transport demand for tankers over the coming years
is expected to be for short haul trading, and many new oilfield
developments will be offshore, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the back of this development a market for shuttle tankers at
the offshore oilfields will develop further in competition with
pipelines, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the tanker market is volatile, and even
though the most probable scenario points to a broad based
recovery, there is still a downside risk in the market.
</P>
<P>
The main threat to recovery is the fragility of the recovery in
the OECD region and the present new building potential due to
increased yard capacity, Sundnes said.

HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Economic Forum's
Sixth East Asia Economic Summit opened here today to discuss the
economic development in China, the economic growth in East Asia as
a whole and possible Asia-Europe-America triangular economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Opening the three-day meeting at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center, Klaus Schwab, president and founder of the
26-year-old forum, said the meeting with the participation of
about 1,000 delegates from more than 50 countries is significant
for the global economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, minister of China's State Economic and Trade
Commission, said in a keynote address at the opening session that
China will maintain the 8-percent growth rate of its economy
annually in the remaining years of this century while keeping its
inflation rate under 5 percent.

He stressed that a more opening and prosperous China could
become an important participant of the world economy, particularly
the East Asian economy, and a cooperation partner to be trusted in
the coming years.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Market Recovery, Long Journey for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Over three months after a
financial crisis hit Southeast Asia, a currency market recovery is
still a long journey for the region, from where investors are
continuing to shift their funds to other places due to loss of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Southeast Asian currencies were broadly stronger
against the U.S. dollar and some people predicted that a recovery
in the region's foreign exchange markets is on the way.
</P>
<P>
Such a prediction seems too optimistic because there are a
number of factors which pushed regional currencies higher last
week.
</P>
<P>
During the week, profit-taking in the dollar boosted the
Malaysian Ringgit and Singapore dollar; Indonesia's decision to
seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led to
the buying of the country's rupiah; and the Philippine Central
Bank's restrictions on dollar holdings forced local banks to buy
pesos.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts warned that the rising trend is unlikely to
sustain as investors are still lacking confidence in the region's
economies.
</P>
<P>
Soon after a currency turmoil spread across Southeast Asia in
early July, countries in the region took a series of emergency
measures to stabilize the market, such as raising interest rates
and imposing restrictions on foreign exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
However, these measures have not succeeded in containing the
sharp fall of regional currencies. Since July, the currencies of
Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines have
depreciated between 10 percent and 35 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Explaining causes for the currency tumbles, economists said
that if speculative attacks could be blamed for the spreading of
the currency crisis in early July, loss of confidence in the
region's economic future is attributed to the continuous slide of
regional currencies now.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Southeast Asian nations tried to build
confidence by cutting their current account deficits, which have
amounted to over 5 percent of gross national product (GNP) in some
countries and are considered one of the major causes of the
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, the government postponed the construction of the
Bakun dam, an ambitious infrastructure project, with a price tag
of 13.6 billion Ringgit (4.6 billion US dollars), and other large
projects which need a lot of imports.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesia government also postponed the construction of
power plants and toll roads worth of billions of dollars. In the
Philippines, President Fidel Ramos approved general proposals to
discourage excessive private-sector investment, increase savings,
improve banking regulations and reduce government spending.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Indonesia's decision to seek IMF assistance last
week is also seen as a confidence building step.
</P>
<P>
But analysts described these moves as first steps in a daunting
journey to a currency market recovery.
</P>
<P>
At present, a dim outlook for the regional economy is
continuing to undermine investors' confidence. High interest rates
and weaker currencies are slowing the pace of economic growth in
Southeast Asia. The Philippine government on Friday scaled down
its GNP growth target for this year from 7 to 8 percent to a range
of 5 to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other countries in the region, except Singapore, could hardly
realize this year's growth rates either, at least 1 or 2 percent
lower than the original ones. And next year's growth will be much
slower as these countries could feel the full negative impact of
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, cracks in the region's banking sector made
investors more worrisome. In Thailand, where the government has
closed 58 of 91 financial companies, Moody's Investors Service
Inc. says that as many as five of the country's 15 commercial
banks could fail by the end of 1998 because of bad debts.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, experts warned that the rising level of
non-performing loans and declining earnings growth could cripple
the country's banks.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that a new wave of anxiety is washing over
financial markets in Southeast Asia, and this one is not driven by
worries over current-account deficit, but by fears about the
health of the region's banking systems.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, foreign investors are complaining about controls
imposed recently by Southeast Asian governments on foreign
exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Philippines re-imposed its volatility band for
peso -- a stipulation that trading be suspended for 30 minutes if
the peso falls more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia also introduced
various capital control measures, a move described by foreign
investors as "regulatory backlash against the foreign exchange
market."
</P>
<P>
These measures could help stabilize the markets temporarily,
but will undermine confidence of investors who will shift more
funds to other places in the world.
</P>
<P>
Before confidence in Southeast Asia is fully restored in the
months ahead, analysts said, turbulence in the region's currency
markets is still unavoidable.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set Up Three More Urea Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government will
set up three more urea fertilizer factories to meet the growing
demand for urea and phosphate fertilizer in the country, the
independent United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported today.
</P>
<P>
This statement was made by Commerce and Industry Minister
Tofael Ahmed while addressing a gathering in the country's second
largest city of Chittagong Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bangladesh has six urea fertilizer factories which
produce about 2.1 million tons of urea against the local demand
for 2.5 million tons a year, the UNB said.
Natural gas is the only raw material used in producing urea in
Bangladesh, the UNB said.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the minister also talked about the government's
disinvestment plan for loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
He said the government would follow a realistic approach in
disinvesting SOEs, considering the grievances of laborers and
workers, the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, in the twin process of globalization and
liberalization, Bangladesh has to go for disinvestment of the
SOEs, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Due to misrule, mismanagement, corruption and nepotism, the
profitable SOEs of the early 1970s had now become loss-making
enterprises, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a government can not survive for long by
incurring annual loss of 25 billion taka (about 563.10 million
U.S. dollars) from the SOEs.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Tighten Border Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has decided to tighten border control to prevent
illegal immigrants and smugglers, The Star newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that 17 billion Rand, or 3.6 billion
U.S. dollars, is being lost in revenue every year, and 500 people
are entering South Africa illegally every month, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
As a major step, the cabinet has approved a plan to restrict
the number of international airports to 10.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Department deputy director-general, Bernie
Fanaroff, said the measure will bring South Africa in line with
international practice.
</P>
<P>
He said cross-border flights are currently allowed to land at
virtually all airports.
</P>
<P>
The 10 airports to be allowed to clear goods and people for or
from international flights are Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban,
Bloemfontein international airports, and airports of Lanseria,
Nelspruit, Upington, Pietersburg, Mmabatho and Port Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
A deadline has been suggested in April 1998, when all
facilities would have to be granted international status, the

<HEADLINE>   Committee Urges Sri Lankan Government to Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A committee under the Ministry
of Fisheries urged the government to give financial support for
shrimp farmers in the northwest of the country, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ten-member committee recommended that the government should
provide a fund of 100 million Rupees (1.7 million U.S. dollars) to
rehabilitate the shrimp industry, which was hit by disease in May
last year.
</P>
<P>
They also asked the government to give 50,000 Rupees (847
dollars) to farmers for each acre of shrimp pond they are
managing.
</P>
<P>
Shrimp farmers in Sri Lanka had argued that the government
should give more assistance to the industry which provides direct
employment for 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The industry brought in 40 million U.S. dollars of foreign
exchange in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Drifting Oil Tanker off Scottish Coast Towed to Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A 10,000-ton oil tanker
drifting off the coast of northern Scotland was saved today from
the teeth of a howling gale and towed to safety after an overnight
rescue operation by British coastguards, media reports here said.
</P>
<P>
The Maltese-registered Yusup K lost power Sunday night,
steering in stormy seas five miles (eight kilometers) from Holborn
Head near the Scottish coastal town of Thurso.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that three non-essential members of the
26-strong crew were airlifted to safety by a British Royal Air
Force helicopter.
</P>
<P>
The oil tanker was carrying a cargo of 9,500 tons of naphtha
from England's west coast to Teesport on the east coast.
</P>
<P>
The coastguards said that the ship was finally towed to safety
about four hours after the breakdown and would be repaired soon.

<HEADLINE> World Refugee Emergencies are Declining, Says UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of persons of concern
to the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) at the
begining of 1997 was 22.7 million, a decrease of 1.3 million from
that of early 1996, head of the UNHCR office Sadako Ogata said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we are entering a period of declining refugee
emergencies and we can focus our efforts on solving some long-time
refugee situations, mainly through repatriation," Ogata said in her
opening speech at the 48th annual meeting of UNHCR's executive
committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee, of which 53 governments are members, will oversee
UNHCR's budgets and advise on refugee protection during the meeting on
October 13-17. The central theme of this meeting is the
"challenge of refugee repatriation."
</P>
<P>
Ogata called on governments to respect humanitarian principles.
</P>
<P>
If states had "fulfilled their responsibilities as stipulated
by the committee and supported UNHCR's actions more firmly
and decisively, some of the problems we encountered could have
been avoided, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The rights of refugees, asylum and non-refoulement, are the
foundation of my mandate and I wish to reaffirm our non-negotiable
commitment to defend and promote them," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that repatriation involves more than just logistics
and it can be durable and sustainable only if refugees' rights,
including basic human rights, and justice are restored.
</P>
<P>
She believed that the situation in Bosnia exemplifies the
variety of reintegration challenges.
</P>
<P>
Physical safety must be assured, including the removal of land
mines, the result of elections must be accepted, and those who
committed crimes against humanity must be brought to justice, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Unless UNHCR's work is "part of an integrated strategy for
rehabilitation and reconciliation", she said, "its impact is
likely to be insufficient."

<HEADLINE> World Gas Demand Forecast to Grow 2.7 Percent Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- World gas demand is expected to
grow at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the 15 years to 2010,
experts predicted at the 15th World Petroleum Congress here today.
</P>
<P>
Total demand for natural gas will climb to a little over 3,000
billion cubic meters in 2010 from around 2,100 billion cubic
meters in 1995, Ian Rushby, general manager in charge of gas
business of British Petroleum's Exploration Operating Company,
told a forum of the congress.
</P>
<P>
In particular, gas demand in the Asia-Pacific region is
expected to grow from around 200 billion cubic meters in 1995 to
around 470 billion cubic meters in 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
The region's growth rate of gas demand during the period will
be almost six percent annually, well ahead of the world average,
Rushby said.
</P>
<P>
"This rapid growth in the use of gas has been driven by several
factors, some related to the specific characteristics of gas
itself and others to developments in the wider energy economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In a decade during which environmental protection has risen to
the top of the political agenda, the inherent cleanliness of gas
has been one of the key drivers of demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted, it is also an extremely convenient and
efficient form of fuel.
</P>
<P>
"I am firmly convinced that the fundamental drivers of future
energy demand are particularly favourable for gas," Rushby said,
noting that the factors which have led to its becoming the fuel of
choice in most energy markets worldwide will continue to drive the
growth in gas demand.
</P>
<P>
The growing trend towards liberalisation and deregulation,
particularly in the more developed energy markets, and economic
restructuring will add further stimulus to gas demand, he said.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project to Be World Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 13 (Xinhua) --The Three Gorges project under
construction on the Yangtze River is being touted as a world
leader in many major areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Jiazhu, deputy general manager of the Yangtze
River Three Gorges Project Development Corp., the Three Gorges
flood-control project will be the most efficient in the world when
finished in 2009.
</P>
<P>
A reservoir with a storage capacity of 39.3 billion cubic
meters is designed to protect 15 million people and 1.53 million
hectares of farmland from destructive flooding on the Yangtze,
China's longest river.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges project also is expected to lead the world in
power generation with 26 sets of turbogenerators producing a
generating capacity of 700,000 kilowatt, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Three Gorges will generate 84.6 billion kilowatt-hours of
electricity a year, 13 billion kwh more than the Itaipu
hydroelectric station jointly operated in South America by Brazil
and Paraguay, presently the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
Wang, responsible for the design of the Three Gorges project,
said the third area of leadership will be in navigation efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Navigating the Yangtze in Sichuan province will be possible for
ships with 10,000 dwt (dead weight tonnage) between Chongqing and
Yichang of central China's Hubei province. This should reduce
shipping costs by 35 percent to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
The size of the project is also the biggest of its kind in the
world, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Chinese researchers have spent four decades solving technical
problems that might occur in construction of the Three Gorges
Dam. A man-made canal was built for use while the main course of
the Yangtze is blocked.
</P>
<P>
A countdown has started for damming the main course of the
Yangtze from November 6-8.

<HEADLINE> PNA Trying to Avoid Straining Ties With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) is trying to avoid straining ties with Jordan
despite its anger over the Israeli-Jordanian deal to release Hamas
leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Several PNA officials including Palestinian Legislative Council
(PLC) Speaker Ahmed Queria (Abu Ala) visited Amman in the last few
days to deliver the message, the Israeli English daily The
Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Queria, who met with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam
Majali, was quoted as saying that the relations between the PNA
and Jordan was "strong."
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the media reports that the PNA was angered
by the deal between Israel and Jordan to release Yassin, the
spiritual leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), and
other Palestinian prisoners. The PNA has failed to secure Yassin's
release after several attempts in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, thousands of Palestinian protesters held
demonstration in the West Bank city of Ramallah in protest against
the Israeli-Jordanian plot to bypass the PNA in releasing
Yassin.
</P>
<P>
Queria added that the PNA did not complain to Jordan about
Amman's failure to coordinate the PNA the release of Yassin and 70
other Palestinian prisoners by Israel early this month.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Jordanian King Hussein telephoned PNA leader
Yasser Arafat immediately after Yassin's release on October 1. He
noted that Arafat did not complain about Jordan's behavior to the
PLC in its emergency meeting held last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Sheikh Yassin and Hamas are speaking about Palestinian
national unity," he said. "So I hope his release will maintain
security."
</P>
<P>
Yassin, jailed by Israel for eight years, was released to
Jordan under a deal with Israel to exchange for the two Israeli
agents detained by Jordan during a botched attempt to assassinate
Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal in Amman in late September. Yassin was
later allowed to return to his home in Gaza a week ago.

PARIS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Jean Gandois, president of France's employers association
CNPF, was criticized by his peers for not quitting the table of
the national job conference held on October 10 in the office of
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who was said to have imposed his
plan to reduce the legal working week time to 35 hours by January
1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
-- President Paul Biya was assured of a reelection in the
presidential election held Sunday in Cameroun, which the
oppositions boycotted.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- France's opposition parties and employers denounced the plan
announced by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to reduce working week
time to 35 hours from January 1, 2000. Jean Gandois, president of
France's employers association CNPF, denounced a "conspiracy
organized between the government and the trade unions to
marginalize" the employers at the national job conference held on
October 10.
</P>
<P>
-- After the first week of trial of former Vichy official
Maurice Papon which was marked by the dramatic release of the
87-year-old accused of crimes against humanity, the debates will
resume this afternoon at the Assize Court of Bordeaux, in which
Papon will stand as a free man.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Revenues Fall Sharply for Thai Restaurants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Many Thai restaurant operators
have reported a drop in business by as much as 50 percent in
recent months because of consumers' lower spending power,
according to industry sources.
</P>
<P>
Average, middle-class families, which used to dine out once or
twice a week, now eat at home to economize.
</P>
<P>
Many of these families have members who have been made
redundant or have had their wages cut.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, fewer company executives are entertaining
their clients at upmarket restaurants to cut the company's costs.
</P>
<P>
Office workers now bring their lunch box to office, or share a
simple lunch among colleagues to save expenses.
</P>
<P>
Even at weekend dinner time, many restaurants are deserted.
</P>
<P>
S and P syndicate, a major bakery and restaurant chain with 86
outlets nationwide, expects that its sales this year would fall by
20 percent from last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Srifah, a popular Thai restaurant chain, has seen sales fall by
more than 25 percent since the July 2 baht depreciation,
continuing a downward trend which began earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
Srifah Managing Director Taveerach Rachjaibul described the
current economic downturn as the worst in the 50 years Srifah has
been operating.
</P>
<P>
Executives of Mk Suki Japanese food chain restaurants admitted
that earnings at the chain's 70 outlets throughout the country has
so far fallen by 10 percent and are likely to fall further.
</P>
<P>
Restaurants located in hotels suffer the most, where price wars
have been launched to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
Restaurants are struggling to survive, adopting various
methods, such as price freeze, discounts, give-aways, promotions
such as "buy one, get one free" and free home delivery.
</P>
<P>
Harsher cost-saving measures such as cutting year-end bonuses
and laying off staff are being considered. Mk Suki, which employs
4,000 workers, has already moved to cut utility costs, freeze new
employment, and cut advertising and promotional spending.
</P>
<P>
Reducing waste of raw materials is another way of staying
afloat.
</P>
<P>
Many restaurant operators are in dilemma whether to increase
food prices. Raising prices would mean driving away more
customers, while price freeze would mean operators will have to
bear more loss as a result of a higher value-added tax, higher
cost in raw materials and depreciated baht.
</P>
<P>
Raising prices would be the last alternative, some operators
say.
</P>
<P>
In the face of hotel restaurants' intense competition, one
hotel recently launched a promotional campaign offering two
buffets for the price of one, plus two free beers.
</P>
<P>
If things go on like this, more weak restaurants are bound to
crumble, observers believe.

<HEADLINE> Rare Surgery on Lion Performed in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A lion trainer underwent a
successful eye operation and soon asked for another -- for his
lion, which turned out to be the world's first eye surgery on the
king beast.
</P>
<P>
The story all started two months ago when a breathtaking
beast-taming show of the Egyptian National Circus here sped
into a bloody fight between two giant lions over Gina, a new
lioness that just joined the troupe, local English-language
newspaper the Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
Trainer Mahassen el-Helu quickly intervened in the scene but
the lion Kota had already been slapped across the eye and could be
left blind for ever.
</P>
<P>
El-Helu canceled the performance and sought emergency medical
help to save Kota's eye.
</P>
<P>
But as very few vets in Egypt are experienced enought to
conduct an eye operation on such a large beast, she had to resort
to her own doctor Osama el-Hofi, an ophthalmologist at Cairo
University's medical college.
</P>
<P>
The doctor, who conducted a perfect eye operation on the
trainer a month ago, agreed to examine the injured lion after it
was put to sleep. He told the worried trainer that Kota still has
a chance to get back his eyesight after a sophisticated operation.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, el-Hofi conducted a cornea transplant operation
to the injured lion. The surgery, which took place at the National
Circus, one of the region's oldest and most prestigious circus, is
reported to be the first in the world.
</P>
<P>
Besides implanting the cornea of a dead cat in the lion's eye,
the doctor also conducted two other surgeries to remove cataract
from the eye, which was caused by the strong slap.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first such surgery in the world. I did it
voluntarily," said the doctor triumphantly, adding that otherwise
the lion's bad eyesight would pose a threat to the trainers during
the shows.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Not Contacted to Stop Plutonium-Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A rocket laden with
plutonium will fly over Southern Africa today after a reported
last-ditch effort to get South African President Nelson Mandela
to block the launch failed.
</P>
<P>
The Cassini space probe, due to be launched from Cape
Canaveral in Florida of the United States at dawn, is carrying 33
kg of plutonium needed to power its seven-year journey to Venus
and Saturn.
</P>
<P>
Local mass media quoted opponents of Cassini as saying at the
weekend that the mission will cross Panama, the Caribbean,
Southern Africa and Madagascar before hurtling into space.
</P>
<P>
The opponents said the probe will pose a threat to millions of
lives because if it burns up in the atmosphere, it could cause
plutonium to rain down on the Earth, causing large number of
people to contract cancer.
</P>
<P>
They believed Mandela was "their last chance" to stop the
launch.
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch effort to block the launch, campaigners
against the mission reportedly approached Mandela and asked him
to intervene, local daily the Sunday Independent reported
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
But presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Mandela had
not received any request to help block the launch by yesterday
afternoon. "We don't know anything about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign affairs spokesman Pieter Swanepoel said neither had
his department received any request or contacted the American
authorities to find out what was happening with Cassini.
</P>
<P>
Both Swanepoel and Mankahlana said they did not know whether
South Africa would monitor the rocket as it crossed the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Local environmental group Earthlife said it could not comment
because it had not been aware of the mission.
</P>
<P>
Nearly seven meters in height, Cassini will be carrying 12
separate packages of scientific instruments, as well as a probe,
carrying six more bundles of sensors, which is to be dropped on
to Titan, Saturn's largest moon.
</P>
<P>
Among the instruments on Cassini are cameras to provide
pictures of Saturn, its rings and moons, and radar to pierce the
orange, hydrocarbon haze surrounding Titan.
</P>
<P>
Phil Metcalfe, spokesman for South Africa's Council for
Nuclear Safety, said yesterday that the chances of Cassini
burning up in the atmosphere were very small. Even if something
happened, South Africa had contacted with the U.S. and would
immediately speak to it about it, he added.

December-April season of the European winter, projections after
the violence were for only 125,000 visitors, local sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
Many air charters and personal bookings were canceled as some
65 Kenyans, though no tourists, have been killed in sporadic
torchings and mob attacks in the Coast Province since August 13.
</P>
<P>
The visa proposal was made by the Marketing Action Group of
the Kenya Tourist Board (KTB) which has been meeting regularly to
discuss how to pull Kenya's largest foreign exchange-earner out
of the current quagmire.
</P>
<P>
The group argued that the cumbersome visa requirement
discourages some would-be tourists and has been dropped long ago
by countries such as Thailand and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
"If you don't live near an embassy or consulate offices, you
have to travel long distances or post your passport for
endorsement and most people do not like parting with their
passports," said Jim Flannery, an Irish adviser to the KTB.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kenya Association of Tour Operators (KATO) has
urged the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) to lower entry fees to
national parks and game reserves by 50 percent for tourists until
the crisis is over.
</P>
<P>
The entry fee currently ranges from 23 to 27 U.S. Dollars for
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
KATO also asked KWS to allow foreign travel writers, travel
agents and Kenyan journalists on familiarization tours with free
entry to parks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chairman of the Mombasa and Coast Tourist Association
Najib Balala urged the establishment of a rehabilitation fund
from which hoteliers and others could borrow on favorable terms
to rebuild their businesses after the slump.
</P>
<P>
"We are also asking the government to give a tax moratorium
for at least one year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Occupancy rates at the Coast remained between 10 and 30
percent last week, but some hotels frequented by Italians which
had been facing closure are now recording 20-40 percent occupancy
due to an aggressive media campaign in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Two Kenyan cabinet ministers, accompanied by tourism
officials, were scheduled to visit Britain, Germany, Austria,
Italy and Switzerland over a week from October 18 with the
message that Kenya is safe for visitors.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Shanghai to Jointly Shed Lights in Sports World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Tagged as the Oriental Pearl
and Paris of the East respectively, Hong Kong and Shanghai, are
trying to combine their efforts to live up to their reputation not
only in economy, but in sports as well.
</P>
<P>
A renaissance of cooperation? Not enough.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hui-tang, born in Hong Kong and dubbed Soccer King of Asia
in the 1930s, paced a Shanghai squad to defeat an arrogant foreign
team to win the first club title for China 60 years ago, opening a
new chapter in sports exchange between Shanghai and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an era when foreign invasion and inner unrest rocked the
country, few people noticed great feat.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong returned to China in July, people began
unveiling the sports links early this century for something
valuable.
</P>
<P>
Dated back to 1908, the soccer confederations of Hong Kong and
Shanghai inaugurated an annual inter-port duel, aiming to
establish a long-term sports exchange between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
From 1908 to 1948, except those years during two World Wars, a
total of 20 contests were played on a home-and-away format.
</P>
<P>
At that time, besides Lee, who was later elected president of
the Asian Football Confederation and vice president of FIFA, many
a Hong Kong natives left their marks in Shanghai, including
well-known stars Sun Jinshun and Liang Yutang.
</P>
<P>
The inter-port system resumed in 1987 after a 40-year absence
in a sell-out 40,000-capacity Jiangwan Stadium in Shanghai, with
the local squad winning the year's meet 3-1 last week.
</P>
<P>
The soccer contest heralded an era for the two cities to step
up exchange in sports. After Hong Kong returned to China, both
sides are eager to gear up their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Daohan, former mayor of Shanghai and current president of
Cross Straits Association, said Shanghai and Hong Kong should
cooperate like doubles partners in tennis when Shanghai is
striving to become an economic, financial, trade and information
center.
</P>
<P>
"It's like a team and we are the pair in a tennis match," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong boasts of a first division soccer league with eight
teams whereas Shanghai produces three squads for the Division A
league in the country, with Shenhua being the lone team of any
significance.
</P>
<P>
Putting aside soccer, Shanghai has produced dozens of world and
Olympic champions while Hong Kong cherished its lone Olympic gold
from surfer Lee Lai-Shan in the women's mistral in the Atlanta
Games last year.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's return to the motherland provides precious
favorable conditions for our cooperation in sports," said Shanghai
vice mayor Gong Xueping.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the two sides will establish a soccer league featuring
all the top clubs on the basis of the annual inter-port soccer
tournament," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has a lot to learn from Hong Kong in horse racing. "We
hope Hong Kong could give us a hand in this respect," Gong said.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Fok, head of the Hong Kong delegation for the on-going
National Games, also hoped Shanghai spare no efforts to help Hong
Kong improve its competitive sports.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange should not be limited in soccer. There are a
great potentials for us to cooperate in other events," Fok said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shaozu, minister of the Chinese State Physical Culture and
Sports Commission, also voiced his support for the inter-port
cooperation in sports between the two Chinese metropolitans.
</P>
<P>
"A closer tie between the two sides will surely foster the
sports development and give a boost to the whole country," Wu
said.

<HEADLINE> New Oilfield Discovered in South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A new oilfield, with an
expected daily output of some 1,000 tons of crude oil, has been
discovered in the southern part of the South China Sea, it is
learned today.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield, a basin at the mouth of the Pearl River, is 139
km from the southeastern tip of Hong Kong. the crude oil in the
field has a specific gravity of 0.79 to 0.83, according to sources
from the Nanhai East Company of the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation (CNOOC).
</P>
<P>
The field is 8,500 meters from the production platform of an
oilfield at the Huizhou-26 block, which has already gone into
operation. That should provide advantageous conditions for joint
development of the two fields.
</P>
<P>
The multi-national group -- comprising the CNOOC, Italy's Agip
Overseas Corporation Ltd., the Chevron Overseas Oil Corporation
Ltd. from the United States, and the China Company of the Texaco
group of the U.S. -- discovered the oilfield when drilling
offshore earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The group has built and begun production on four oilfields in
its area of the South China Sea, yielding a combined 13,000 tons
of crude oil per day. This yield makes the area the largest
oil-field community in China.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 24 oilfields in the eastern part of the South
China Sea have become operational, and one more is expected to
begin operation within a few months.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the eastern South China Sea, the country's
largest crude oil production base, generated 11.84 million tons of
in 1996. Total deposits in the area could reach five billion tons,
only 10 percent of which has so far been found.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President's Son Gets 3-Year Prison Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam's second son, Kim Hyun-chul, was sentenced to three-year
imprisonment today by the Seoul District Court for charges of tax
evasion and taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
The junior Kim was also ordered to pay a fine of 1.44 billion
won (about 1.6 million U.S. dollars) for tax evasion and an
additional penalty of 524.2 million won (about 582,000
U.S. dollars) for taking bribes from businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Kim, 38, was arrested on May 17 and indicted on June 5, charged
with influence-peddling and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had earlier demanded that Kim serve seven
years' imprisonment on charges that he received 6.61 billion won
(about 7.34 million dollars) from six businessmen from 1993 till
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
But the court acquitted Kim of the charge that he received 1.5
billion won (about 1.67 million dollars) from Dooyang Group chairman
Kim Duk-yong through influence-peddling.
</P>
<P>
In its judgment, the court condemned Kim Hyun-chul's receipt of
huge amounts of money from the businessmen and tax evasion as
"failing to fulfill his status as the son of the president."
</P>
<P>
President Kim Young-sam formally took his five-year term office
in February, 1993, after he won the presidential election in
1992.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Hits Kenya's Third-Largest City, Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The cholera epidemic has hit
Kenya's third-largest city of Kisumu bordering on Lake Victoria,
killing eight people during the past two days and leaving more
than 30 hospitalized, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The disease, which has ravaged south-eastern Nyanza Province
and killed more than 200 people within two months, is currently
spreading fast in residential estates and Kisumu's suburbs, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Local public health officials said persistent lack of clean
drinking water could hasten the spread of the disease, which
kills within hours of attack.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims came from the Kibos, Nyamasaria, Manyatta,
Nyalenda, Obunga and Nyawita areas of the town.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and Kisumu municipal authorities had
closed down all food stands in the town to prevent the disease
from reaching the area, but all of them have since been
re-opened.
</P>
<P>
Reports said intravenous fluids and necessary drugs are likely
to run out owing to the mounting number of patients.

<HEADLINE> Experts Predicts More Alternative Fuel Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Experts attending the ongoing
15th World Petroleum Congress (WPC) predicted here today that the
market share of alternative fuel vehicles will grow in the future.
</P>
<P>
Alternative fuels are a way to reduce dependency on oil and
they can also assist in solving agricultural problems if they are
of renewable resources, Alexander Buchsbaum with the Austria-based
OMV AG said at a forum of the congress.
</P>
<P>
A number of fuels are capable of powering motor vehicles
including ethanol, methanol, esters derived from oil seeds,
electricity, natural gas and liquid petroleum gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Alternative fuels have a number of inherent properties which
make them more environmentally benign than conventional gasoline,
he said.
</P>
<P>
While natural gas vehicles are presently the popular choice
among alternative fuel vehicles, electric vehicles are actually
close to zero emitting, he said.
</P>
<P>
But most of the current alternative fuel vehicles have two
disadvantages, namely higher cost and smaller range, compared to
gasoline and diesel fuel vehicles, Buchsbaum said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, diesel fuel and gasoline will continue to comprise
the main share of automotive fuels, with efforts to be further
made to ensure reliability and safety of them, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Still Respect Local Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Zimbabweans
continue to appreciate traditional music and dances as they
strive to identify themselves with their culture, Cleopas Makoni,
chairman of the Zimbabwe Traditional Dance Association said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the 1997 traditional dances prize-awarding ceremony, Makoni
said the number of people coming to witness the event were
increasing each year as Zimbabweans sought to learn about their
tradition.
</P>
<P>
Although people were exposed to other foreign cultures, he
noted, there was tendency to retreat to one's culture.
</P>
<P>
"Most of our children are exposed to dancehall reggae, pop and
gospel music in urban areas. But whenever there is an event like
this one they always come to watch because they have an itching
desire to know what their elders were doing in the past," Makoni
added.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of places where traditional dances are
performed, the association felt obliged to charge no fee for
entry into the annual event to enable people to see the dances.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Education, Sport and Culture Minister Gabriel
Machinga said traditional dances were not only a form of
entertainment but reflected the culture of people which should be
preserved, adding that youths had a lot to learn from the dances.
</P>
<P>
"Youths now have a credit to conduct research on the
traditional dances and write books on them to ensure that they
are preserved," the minister said.

BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met here today with Siddhi Savesila,
privy councillor of Thailand, and his party.
</P>
<P>
Qian welcomed Siddhi and expressed appreciation over his
cooperation with China in handling regional affairs during his

</P>
<P>
China has realized the smooth return of Hong Kong and convened
the 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party this
year, Qian said, while maintaining sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The lesson in the recent financial crisis which took place in
Thailand and other southeast Asian nations is worth drawing on for
China, Qian said, and China will adopt a more cautious position in
opening up its markets, especially in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Siddhi extended his gratitude for China's support to Thailand
during that country's financial crisis. He said China, as a nation
of great influence in Asia, plays an important role in reinforcing
the unity and coordination among Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed Thailand's support for China's entry into the World
Trade Organization, noting China's participation is conducive to a
fair and rational international trade.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Alleviation Tops Malawian Government's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili
Muluzi has said that poverty alleviation is the top priority of
his administration, Zambia's leading independent newspaper The
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Opening parliament Sunday in Lilongwe, Malawi's capital,
Muluzi promised that his government will continue to fight
poverty until it is eradicated.
</P>
<P>
However, lack of enough food is always a problem besetting the
Malawian leaders since food security is one of the most important
indication in poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi disclosed that his country is suffering food shortage
of 288 thousand tons of maize at present, adding the government
has worked out intervention measures to deal with the situation.
</P>
<P>
At the 17th summit of the Southern African Development
Community held earlier last month, Muluzi called on other members
of the regional grouping for urgent food aid to his country,
which registered a shortfall of 31 percent of food production
compared with the harvest in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Malawi is looking for markets from which to buy the staple
crop, said the president, who came to power in Malawi's first
multi-party polls in 1994 and promised to maintain democracy and
fight to end mass poverty in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Malawi, which has an area of 118.5 thousand square kilometers
and a population of 10 million, is classified by the United
Nations as one of the most under-developed countries in the
world.
</P>
<P>
To eradicate the widespread poverty in Malawi, the Muluzi
government formulated the program for poverty alleviation in
1995. But weak economic infrastructure and frequent natural
disasters have made the president's ambition impossible.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Chakma Refugees to be Repatriated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The repatriation of Chakma
refugees, now sheltered in six refugee camps in the Indian state
of Tripura, will resume next month following more benefits offered
by the Bangladeshi government, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The refugees took shelter in Tripura in April, 1986 following
disturbances in their hometown Chittagong Hill Tracts due to
decades of war between government forces and pro-independent
Chakma rebels.
</P>
<P>
There were three earlier phases of repatriation on February of
1994, June of 1994 and March of 1997 during which a total of
12,300 Chakma refugees returned to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The decision to resume the process of repatriation was taken
after a visit to Dhaka last month by a delegation of Chakma
leaders, who met Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a
dramatic move to end the stalemate regarding the repatriation on
September 12.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has reportedly assured the refugee
delegation that all the conditions agreed upon by the government,
including the return of their land and homestead, would be fully
implemented and some additional benefits would be provided to the
returnees.
</P>
<P>
The additional benefits include the extension of free ration
for the returnees from nine months to one year and a financial
grant of 10,000 taka (about 250 U.S. dollars) to each of the
family of the tribesman killed in different incidents.
</P>
<P>
About 44,000 refugees are still left in the six refugees camps
in India.

<HEADLINE> WPC to Release New Petroleum Definitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A new set of definitions
standardizing international concepts governing crude oil and reserves
will be issued by the World Petroleum Congress (WPC) here tomorrow,
Xinhua was told here today.
</P>
<P>
The 15th World Petroleum Congress, opened here yesterday, will
make adjustments in the original standards in conjunction with the
Society of Petroleum Engineers, according to Paul Tempest, director
general of the WPC.
</P>
<P>
The old definitions, established by the first WPC in 1933, fail
to reflect new technology and the diversity of geological
environments in which oil and gas are now produced, Tempest said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the alterations now will help the international
business circle to have a clearer understanding of current
petroleum production that varies from place to place.
</P>
<P>
The changes will reflect the neutrality that has been the WPC's
consistent policy, Tempest said.

<HEADLINE> Exxon Predicts Growing Oil Demand in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- International petroleum giant
Exxon forecast here today that demand of oil for transportation and
industrial use in Asia will grow by nearly 10 million barrels per
day by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Lee Raymond, chairman and chief executive officer of the
U.S.-based company, told the ongoing 15th World Petroleum Congress
that the growth in Asia's oil demand will be equivalent to about 40
new large refineries over the period.
</P>
<P>
Energy use and economic growth are inextricably linked, Raymond
said. "The countries with the highest economic growth and the
highest standards of living are also those with the highest energy
use per capita," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the energy comes from fossil fuels at present,
accounting for about 85 percent both in Asia and in the world as a
whole, Raymond said, adding that oil and natural gas supply the
majority in energy consumption, with coal also being a major player.
</P>
<P>
"With no readily available economic alternatives on the horizon,
fossil fuels will continue to supply most of the world's and this
region's energy for the foreseeable future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In recognition of this, we must continue to develop and apply
technology and expertise that enable us to use fossil fuels in ways
that are efficient and environmentally sound," he said.
</P>
<P>
Doing that will require a great deal, from both government and
the petroleum industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Raymond noted that supply strategies are changing, with Chinese
and other Asian companies becoming more active in exploration in
other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"But this change should not cause us to lose sight of the need
to maintain and, if possible, increase local production and
reserves," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Asia still has numerous areas with hydrocarbon potential. But
it will take a major effort to unlock these resources for the
benefit of consumers," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Arms Deal with Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's state arms
exporter Denel has denied the reports that it was selling or
planning to sell any military equipment to Algeria.
</P>
<P>
This followed reports carried in the Sunday Independent
yesterday which claimed that Denel had clinched a number of
seeker remotely piloted surveillance aircrafts.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today quoted a Denel spokesman as saying his
company "was not selling anything to Algeria".
</P>
<P>
The seeker remotely piloted surveillance system is designed to
be sent behind enemy lines from where it sends back
high-resolution video pictures of enemy installations and troop
and vehicle movements.
</P>
<P>
The system is usually sold with a launch vehicle and a station
from where a pilot can remotely control it.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Independent said the Algerian government would use
the equipment in their fight against "Islamic extremists".
</P>
<P>
The deal was said to have followed the visit to South Africa
last week by a delegation of senior officials of the Algerian
defense force to view local weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian ambassador in Pretoria Sadek Kitoumi reportedly
told the local press that joint-venture deals with South African
defense companies were possible, but Algeria would "not order any
lethal weapons from South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Requests Kenya to Open Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Syluester Wanjusi-Wasieba,
Uganda's State Minister for Works, Transport and Communications,
and other local officials have asked Kenya to open Lwakhakha
border post, local daily The Monitor reported today.
</P>
<P>
The request was conveyed to Wilfred Ndolo, head of the 33-man
delegation from Kenya who were having a one-day visit in Mbale,
eastern Uganda last week.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan official asked the Kenya side to revive trade
across Lwakhakha border.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries need each other, more so the local people
living on either side of the border. There is a bumper harvest of
maize and beans in Mbale and the commodities are greatly needed
in Kenya, why not open the border to allow in these exports,"
Wanjusi inquired.
</P>
<P>
He warned that further closure of the border post would
encourage smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Ndolo, however, explained that the recent IMF and World Bank
withdrawal of funding to Kenya had disrupted the budget, which
meant "Fund for such projects like construction of offices and
accommodation for customs officials, police and repair of roads
and offices at Lwakhakha, were diverted to other areas."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Commercialise National Railways by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government will
commercialise the National Railways by December, Deputy Minister
of Transport and Energy Zenzo Nsimbi said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the National Railways of Zimbabwe
(NRZ) Sitting Tenants' Association in Bulawayo, the country's
second largest city, Nsimbi said he will push for the
commercialisation of the parastatal in parliament next week.
</P>
<P>
The commercialisation was expected on turning the NRZ into a
profitable organisation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the exercise, the parastatal would shed off non-core
businesses like the provision of houses for employees and its
workshops to concentrate on transporting goods and passengers.
</P>
<P>
"In commercialisation, the government will be the sole
shareholder and companies are encouraged to zero in on core
business," Nsimbi noted.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called to discuss progress made on
negotiations to sell NRZ houses to sitting tenants.
</P>
<P>
NRZ was not opposed to selling the houses to sitting tenants,
he said, adding that the commercialisation might be the opportune
time to dispose of the houses as provision of accommodation was
not NRZ's core business.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China's crude oil production
will keep increasing steadily over the next decade, a senior
Chinese official said here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the country's oil demand can be met by domestic
production, Wang Tao, senior advisor to the China National
Petroleum Corporation, said at the ongoing 15th World Petroleum
Congress.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country with 1.2 billion people, "China must be
committed to the development and utilization of its own domestic
hydrocarbon resources," Wang said, adding that it's "the base of
the state petroleum strategy".
</P>
<P>
China produced 157 million tons of crude oil and 20.1 billion
cubic meters of natural gas last year. Net oil imports accounted
for eight percent of domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Wang forecast that China's annual oil demand will rise to 195
million tons in 2000 and 265 million tons in 2010.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has a promising future to meet its own needs
mainly by promoting domestic oil and gas production in the coming
years, based on the achievements made for oil and gas exploration
and development as well as estimates of reserves.

<P>
Figures show that the ultimate recoverable oil resources in
China, in line with the world prevailing standards, total 102
billion barrels. By the end of 1996, the cumulative proved
recoverable oil reserves were 38 billion barrels, with the rest
yet to be proved.
</P>
<P>
China also has abundant non-conventional oil resources, such as
extra-heavy oil, bitumen and oil shales, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The oil shale resources alone account for 483.1 billion tons,
among which 31.1 billion tons is composed of more than five
percent oil content.
</P>
<P>
The oil production in China is increasing steadily, Wang said,
and "very good prospects" are foreseeable as a result of increased
exploration and enhanced oil recovery activities in existing
matured oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil production in east China contributes to 75 percent of
the national total. Wang said that the recoverable reserves in the
region have been increasing by 700 million barrels each year, as
new geophysical methods have been applied.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that in the coming decade, additional
recoverable oil reserves will be found and oil output will be
almost the same as today in this part of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He regarded west China as the country's strategic area for oil
production, noting that significant exploration breakthroughs have
been made in Tarim, Junggar and Turpan-Hami basins.

The cumulative proved recoverable oil reserves in west China
reached 4.93 billion barrels and the daily oil production was
396,000 barrels by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
"In the couple of years later, a dramatic increase over the
current figures can be expected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang described offshore China as having "huge
potential" in hydrocarbon resources, noting that the recoverable
resources total about 21 billion barrels at present and will
increase further as more exploration and development will be made
in Bohai Sea and South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The daily oil production from offshore has been greatly
increased from 25,400 barrels in 1990 to 300,000 barrels in 1996,
he said.

Furthermore, the national total of gas production will keep

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Countries Urged to Mobilize Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPPUR, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today called upon the Asia-Pacific countries to
mobilize financial resources from within instead of relying on
multilateral and bilateral donors in their efforts to eradicate
poverty.
</P>
<P>
A proposal by the Regional Steering Committee on the Economic
Advancement of Rural and Island Women for the Asia-Pacific
(RSC-AP) for an independent national revolving fund could be
utilized as an alternative to multilateral, multi-donor
international funds intended to assist the poor, he said at an
RSC-AP meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
The RSC-AP, dedicated to poverty eradication among women in the
region, made the proposal in April this year for setting up such a
fund as the most crucial measure towards achieving its goal in
reaching 70 million poor women in the Asia Pacific region with
poverty-focused Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs) by 2005.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the mobilization of financial resources from
within our own nations should be the first step towards
self-reliance and gaining dignity for indigenous ways of
generating funds," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that it was more appropriate to be self-reliant
than depending on rich countries and that the nations of the
RSC-AP could collectively mobilize resources without the need to
be overdependent on developed economies.
</P>
<P>
He said "I believe that through concerted efforts and
commitments from non-governmental organizations and the private
sectors, we can create the greatest social development engineering
for the poor in the next century."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the banking sector, governments and MFIs should
work together towards creating a supportive national policy
framework for the creation of an environment for MFIs to be
nurtured into financially viable and sustainable institutions.
</P>
<P>
The six-day RSC-AP meeting which started on October 11 is being
attended by representatives from 14 RSC-AP members -- Australia,
China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Maldives, Malaysia,
Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Tonga, Uzbekistan and
Vietnam.

LHASA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's Minister of Finance
Shukla has shown satisfaction with the Tibetan investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
He was in Tibet recently for the Tibet-Nepal Economic and Trade
Talks '97, where he said that he is familiar with Tibet's
preferential investment policies and that Tibet and Nepal have
similar geographical and economic conditions, and economic and
trade co-operation among them is increasing and that they want it
to grow quicker.
</P>
<P>
The talks shifted the co-operation focus from exchanges of
goods to project co-operation, and the minister said that there
have been problems with project co-operation, but that they have
eventually been solved with the help of the Tibetan regional
government. Recently, Nepal set up 28 joint projects in Tibet and
they are doing well.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he hopes Tibetan enterprises can invest in
Nepal, and that it would be a good opportunity for them to use
Nepal as a transfer point on the way to South Asian markets.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Largest Habitat for Snub-Nosed Monkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Markam county in southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region has become the world's largest
habitat for Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, with more than 700 of the
primates.
</P>
<P>
The population a decade ago was 600, according to the forestry
department of the autonomous region. The world's population of
snub-nosed monkeys is about 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The species was thought to live only in Yunnan province, where
its name derived, but in 1988 an expedition discovered that the
actual main habitat for the monkeys is an area with a north-south
length of about 200 kilometers and a east-west width of less than
40 kilometers spanning Deqin county of Yunnan and Markam of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the Markam Nature Reserve was established. The
reserve, with a land area of 1,853 square kilometers, has 880
square kilometers set aside for the snub-nosed monkeys.
</P>
<P>
The Forestry Survey Institute experts of the autonomous
region's forestry department say the main threat to the snub-nosed
monkeys comes from forest fires and hunters from outside the area.
</P>
<P>
The population of snub-nosed monkeys in Markam is expected to
surpass 1,000 in a not too long period.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, German FMs Co-pen Article on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his German counterpart Klaus
Kinkel have co-penned an article to mark the 25th anniversary of
the establishment of diplomatic relationship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The article, which was published today in the People's Daily,
said that the idea of publishing a joint article came to the two
ministers when they met in New York on September 25 during the
52nd U.N. General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers hailed the establishment of diplomatic
relationship between the People's Republic of China and the
Federal Republic of Germany on October 11, 1972 as an event of
historical significance.
</P>
<P>
Over the past quarter of a century, the article said, the
speed, depth and range of the development of Sino-German
cooperation have been unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking officials of the two countries frequently
exchanged visits while multi-leveled coordination and cooperation
mechanisms were set up in all government departments.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits between heads of state and government of
the two countries contributed a great deal to deepening mutual
understanding and promoting bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sino-German economic ties and trade keep growing, with Germany
being China's biggest trade partner in Europe, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, bilateral trade exceeded 20 billion Deutsche marks
(11.4 billion U.S. dollars), trebling that of the year when
diplomatic relationship was established between China and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that Germany is also the biggest technology
exporter to China in Europe. By now, Germany has invested in more
than 1,500 projects in China, mainly in transportation,
communications, energy and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Financial and technological cooperation is also very
successful, the article said. Germany has more than 160
development aid projects in China.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also noted that China and Germany are opening
up new forms and fields for cooperation while strengthening
traditional cooperation in trade.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation and exchange have also expanded in the fields of
science and technology, education, culture and environmental
protection, forming an exchange pattern of multi-levels, channels,
fields and forms.
</P>
<P>
They noted that in 1997, a high-tech dialogue forum was
established, while colleges and universities as well as
professional training schools in both countries saw sound
development of cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental communication is diversified in form and rich
in content. There have been 34 pairs of sister cities and
provinces in China and Germany. Direct cultural communication is
very active between them.
</P>
<P>
Germany is one of China's major partners in Europe. Germany and
China share the same or similar views on many major international
issues. They maintain close consultation and smooth cooperation on
issues such as the anti-nuclear and bio-chemical proliferation
campaign, anti-drug campaign, environmental protection and
disarmament, the article said.
</P>
<P>
China gives its backing to the unification of Europe and the
integration process of the European Union, and hopes to see
Germany playing a greater role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people always extend their sympathy,
understanding and support to the reunification of the two Germanys.
</P>
<P>
For Germany, China occupies the central place in its Asia
policy. The German government upholds its One China policy and
always supports the reform and opening-up policies adopted by the
Chinese government in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Germany also gives strong backing to China's application for
the membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers said Germany and China have
differences with regard to some issues because they have different
social systems, cultures, ideologies, values and levels of
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The existence of such differences is only normal for a
diversified world, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article said during their meeting in September last year,
they stressed state-to-state relationship should be based on the
principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and they
agreed that despite their differences on the human rights issue, a
solution should be found through dialogue, not confrontation, on
the basis of equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Friendship and cooperation between Germany and China during the
past 25 years are crucial not only for the interests of the two
peoples but also the promotion of world peace and economic
development, the article said.
</P>
<P>
There exists a bright future for long-term, stable cooperation
between a reforming and opening China with rapid economic growth
and a reunified and powerful Germany.
</P>
<P>
Qian and Kinkel said that they believed the German and Chinese
people would join efforts to establish a fair and rational
international political and economic order and to help build a
better world in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in Czech Republic Continues to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in the
Czech Republic rose to 4.8 percent in September, up 1.6 percentage
points over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs reported today that
registered unemployment at the end of September totaled nearly
250,000, a record high in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that unemployment will continue to rise,
likely to cap five percent by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The rise in unemployment was primarily due to the austerity
measures the government took in April and May to cope with the
serious economic difficulties. Spending budget was drastically
cut, followed by staff reductions in enterprises and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rise, the Czech Republic remains one of the East
European countries with the lowest unemployment rate. In 1996, its
jobless rate was 3.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Economic Officials Begin Meeting in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUBANG JAYA (MALAYSIA), October 13 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN senior
economic officials began their two-day meeting here today to
prepare for the 29th ASEAN Economic Ministers (AEM) meeting from
October 16 to 18.
</P>
<P>
The Senior Economic Officials Meeting (SEOM) would focus on the
progress of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and top officials
from the trade and industry ministries of the ASEAN countries
would fine-tune commitments by the respective members to tearing
down tariffs, meeting sources said.
</P>
<P>
The AEM is considered significant for the implementation of
AFTA and thus the region's resolve to create an attractive single
free market where tariffs would be between only zero and 5 percent
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Economic ministers from Laos and Myanmar, which were admitted
into the regional grouping last July at the 30th ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting, would for the first time attend the AEM which is
scheduled to be opened by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
What is noteworthy is the fact that the AEM comes at a time
when the ASEAN economies, especially that of Indonesia, the
Philippines, Thailand and host Malaysia, are being severely tested
due to what are described as manipulative and speculative attacks
on their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is expected to propose for the AEM to consider,
possibly, common strategies to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a senior Taliban leader, Mulla Wakil Ahmad,

fighters of former Defense Minister Ahmad Masood moved in from the
east, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Begins First South America Trip in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived here today to start his first South America trip, aiming
to strengthen trade with that part of America.
</P>
<P>
Clinton chose October 12, the Columbus Day, as the day to start
his tour. The day is a common holiday celebrated in most of the
North and South American countries for the discovery of Columbus
some 500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In his speech upon arrival, Clinton called for unity of
American countries and appraised the free market economies of the
South American countries and their efforts on eliminating trade
barriers and multiplying employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera said Venezuela and the
United States "have a ... joint commitment against corruption,
against delinquency, against drug trafficking."
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the United States' biggest oil supplier. Some 70
percent of Venezuelan oil enter into the U.S. market. From January
to September this year, the country exported 1.7 million barrels
of oil to the United States every day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States becomes Venezuela's biggest trade
partner. In 1996, bilateral trade amounted to 17.2 billion
U.S. dollars, accounting for more than half of the country's total
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
During his 24-hour visit here, Clinton will hold talks with
Caldera on customs, environmental protection, technological
cooperation and especially energy issues.
</P>
<P>
He was accompanied by Energy Secretary Federico Pena, Commerce
Secretary William Daley and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
as well as U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson and the drug policy
adviser, General Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the fourth U.S. president who has visited Venezuela,
following John Kennedy in 1961, Jimmy Carter in 1978 and George
Bush in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will also visit Brazil and Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Water Project Started in Sri Lanka's Ancient City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A project has been started to
ease water shortage in Sri Lanka's ancient city of Anuradhapura in
North Central Province.
</P>
<P>
The cost of 54 million U.S. dollars of the project came from
the French government, the Asian Development Bank and the Sri
Lankan government, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project, when completed, could increase daily water supply
capacity from the present 8.34 million liters to 20.82 million
liters by year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Lack of rains and high evaporation rate make the shortage of
water a serious problem for the old town.
</P>
<P>
Anuradhapura was made the first capital of the ancient Sri
Lankan kingdom around 380 B.C. Though only the ruins of the old
glories have survived, the city remains a sacred place for
Buddhists to pay their homage to the Buddha.
</P>
<P>
People gather here in large numbers in the pilgrimage season
each year, boosting the population of Anuradhapura from around
60,000 to 600,000 seasonally and further worsening the water
supply situation there.

<HEADLINE> Thai Developers Long for Japanese Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Developers of Thailand's
industrial estates are hoping that more Japanese investment will
come as a result of Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's Japan
visit last week.
</P>
<P>
Sales of land in industrial estates were lackluster in recent
months because both domestic and foreign businessmen are delaying
investment, according to Thavich Dechavanakul, secretary-general
of the Thai Industrial Estate Developers Association.
</P>
<P>
Investors are waiting for the baht, the country's currency, as
well as the general political and economic situation, to
stabilize.
</P>
<P>
The value of the baht, now fluctuating around 36 to the U.S.
dollar, has depreciated about 40 percent against the greenback
since its flotation on July 2.
</P>
<P>
As a result of investors' wait-and-see attitude, large tracks
of land in the estates are unsold.
</P>
<P>
Developers hope that Chavalit's visit to Japan last week will
help restore confidence among Japanese investors and induce them
to move their ventures to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
If no businesses move into the estates within the next three
months, many developers will have to scrap their projects, Thavich
was quoted by the local press today as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thavich is confident that the Japanese will step in to help
rescue Thailand's economy because they have been doing business in
the country for a long time and regard the country as a key
production base.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Overseas property developers
are eyeing quality apartment markets at a time as the office
market in Beijing is oversupplied, according to today's "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
Beijing's housing price index increased from 844 points in June

competition is still fierce on high-level apartment. Beijing
totally approved 12,621 overseas-funded companies with a committed
investment of 3.32 billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
With the stable demand of luxury apartments in China's capital,
the overseas property giants, including Malaysia-based Hongleong
Co. and Dynamic Holdings Co. have been involved in apartment
development.
</P>
<P>
Dynamic Holdings opened a commercial bank in Xiamen, the first
foreign-funded bank in coastal Fujian province. It also invested

<HEADLINE> Economist Stressing Government's Role in Market Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Government should let market
forces become the determinant factor of resource allocation, and
act as a watchdog for the country's overall economic situation in
market economy, today's "China Daily" quoted a speech from a
senior economist.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinglian, a leading economist from the Development Research
Center of the State Council, delivered the speech concerning the
government's role in Asian-Pacific Economic Times, recently.
</P>
<P>
In a market Economy, governments at all levels should grant
more autonomy to State enterprises and push them into market
competition boldly, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
After 18 years of reform, non-State sectors such as private and
township enterprises have witnessed rapid development.
</P>
<P>
However, State-owned enterprises, the backbone of the national
economy, still face difficulty in reforming their management
systems and adjusting to the market economy, said the economist.
</P>
<P>
Wu emphasized that governments should focus on monitoring,
analyzing and forecasting macro-economic situations and make
timely adjustments in macro-control policies in line with the rule
of the market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is imperative for governments to maintain
stable, fair and competitive economic conditions by administrative
means.

<HEADLINE> China to Enhance Cooperation with World Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China looks forward to further
developing the cooperative relations with the world oil industry
on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, a senior Chinese
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao, senior advisor to the China National Petroleum
Corporation, said at the 15th World Petroleum Congress that China
is willing to enhance cooperation with both developed and
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will be conducted in line with international
practice and in flexible forms that can be accepted by all
partners, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities for cooperation exist in the fields of oil
recovery, downstream processing, long-distance oil and gas
pipeline construction, research and development as well as human
resources training, he said.
</P>
<P>
More foreign capital and advanced technologies as well as
managerial skills are also welcome, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese oil industry has been expanding cooperation with
international partners since 1978, with close ties with the world
petroleum community already in place.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, offshore exploration was first open for international
cooperation. To date, some 126 petroleum contracts and agreements
with a total investment of 5.38 billion US dollars have been
signed with 67 companies from 18 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the cooperation has brought advanced foreign
technologies and managerial skills to the Chinese offshore oil
industry, helping offshore oil production keep on increasing at an
average annual rate of 39.6 percent for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
As for onshore petroleum international cooperation, 37
contracts valued at one billion U.S. dollars have been signed
since 1985, in addition to five billion U.S. dollars of foreign
credit loans in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
In the process of opening to the outside world, China now has
started to play an active role in overseas petroleum exploration
and development, Wang said, adding that a couple of petroleum
contracts have been signed with countries including Peru, Sudan,
Venezuela, Khazakstan, Canada and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The rather complicated geological conditions in China have
helped the industry accumulate rich working experience and it also
trained a group of qualified experts as well as a strong work
force, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to share our technologies and experience with
the world, particularly with developing countries by multiple ways
and means," he said. "We will keep on developing ties with some
countries for oil import and export business to improve oil and
gas supply of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese petroleum industry will strengthen
cooperation with its neighboring countries as the acceleration of
hydrocarbon exploration and development is of great significance
to the balance between supply and demand in the Asia-Pacific
region as well as the world market, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese oil industry is willing to join hands with its
counterparts and work hard to develop a more prosperous world
petroleum industry in the 21st century," he said.

<HEADLINE> Italian Police Detain Activist for Drug Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A leading Italian political
activist was arrested today in downtown Rome when she tried to
hand out packets of hashish during a rally calling for the
legalization of light drugs.
</P>
<P>
"I denounce myself for violating the law on drugs and for
association to commit crime," Rita Bernardini, 45, a key member of
the right-wing Radical Party, said as she finished her speech and
attempted to distribute to demonstrators some 400 envelopes each
containing one-half gram of hashish.
</P>
<P>
Police immediately stepped onto the podium and took her into
custody.
</P>
<P>
Italian law on drugs permits small quantities to be held for
personal consumption, but punishes handing it to others harshly as
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Anti-prohibitionists have long been agitating for the law to
distinguish between relatively harmless light drugs such as
hashish and others like heroin.
</P>
<P>
Bernardini is part of a political movement headed by Marco
Panella, who was given a suspended eight-month jail sentence on
September 19 for a public distribution of hashish and marijuana in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Panella's Radical Party became known for frequently creating
media events to propagandize its cause.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists recently
unearthed a bone artifact and other 30,000 Neolithic relics,
mostly painted pottery.
</P>
<P>
They were discovered at 300 tombs at the Zongri site in Tongde
County, Qinghai province. One unique painted pottery basin has a
design of two men carrying something.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists had already found bronze age relics in
Shangtao in Datong county and Shenna in the city of Xining.
</P>
<P>
In Shenna, they began to unravel a mystery of the Qijia Culture
when they found a large number of dwellings and cave ruins and a
large bronze spear that is very rare.
</P>
<P>
Many unusual finds also came from four tombs of the Eastern Han
Dynasty (25-220 A. D.) that had been spared destruction by tomb
robbers. The unearthed tombs provide information about customs of
the time, scholars say.
</P>
<P>
Relics found in tombs in the Qaidam Basin in northwest China
and Central Asia have proven the close links between China and
neighboring kingdoms in ancient times.

<HEADLINE> Service Apartments Become Hot in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Investors could enjoy an
lucrative return by putting money into "service apartments", which
provide hotel-type services but at lower rents, as there is a
great need for such apartments in China, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
"More and more investors have begun to show interest in such
apartments as a result of surging demands for the new property
product," said Zeng Jiang of the Overseas Investment Group
(Australia) Co Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Ranking officials from over 293,500 overseas-funded firms in
the country, as well as some well-off Chinese, need those
apartments.
</P>
<P>
The cost of such apartments, usually between 50-80 square
meters, was around 75,000 US dollars for each. Investors could
take back their money in a few years under the current rental of
1.2 US dollars per square meter each day.
</P>
<P>
"The economic return of such investments is as high as 20
percent," Deng Qing, director of the China Real Estate Index
System (Creis) Office, said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Police Fail to Stem Flow of Ecstasy Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's anti-narcotics
police are fighting a losing battle against the influx of ecstasy
drugs because certain senior officials are working together with
the traffickers, a drug enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
Ecstasy drugs were widespread at popular entertainment places
and hotels, Narcotics Suppression Bureau Commissioner Noppadol
Somboonsap was quoted today by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite hard work, police could arrest only minor traffickers
as the major ones had been tipped off by well-known senior
officials with access to inside information obtained by police
intelligence, he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we have seized is less than 10 percent of all ecstasy
tablets available in the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the commissioner, ecstasy drugs are mostly
transported by air from Europe through Singapore to Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Golkar to Announce Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ruling party,
Golkar, plans to announce its candidate for the country's next
president next Sunday at the conclusion of its fourth leadership
meeting, the party's chairman Harmoko said.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar Central Board has drawn up a list of names, Harmoko
said here on Sunday, Antara News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko did not mention any names for the presidential election
scheduled for next March, but it is unlikely that Golkar will
nominate anyone else but the incumbent President Soeharto,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
A number of party executives, along with leaders of
Golkar-affiliated organizations, have recently declared support
for Soeharto's nomination.
</P>
<P>
In regard to vice presidential candidate, Harmoko said Golkar
would announce it at the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
session next year because consultation is necessary with the
president on the candidate in view of the requirement that the
vice president has to be able to cooperate with the president.
</P>
<P>
The newly inducted 1,000 members of the MPR will convene next
March to elect a president and vice president and establish the
state policy guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Golkar has won all the six elections held under President
Soeharto. Last May in a landslide election victory, Golkar
obtained 74.3 percent of the vote, a significant increase from the
68 percent it won in 1992.

<P>
GUAYAQUIL, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador kept their slim hopes
of a first World Cup appearance flickering Sunday by defeating
Bolivia 1-0 in a World Cup South American qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's striker Ariel Graziani scored the winning goal in the
27th minute to bury any lingering hopes the Bolivians, who have 17
points from 15 games, may have had of repeating their 1994
apperance.
</P>
<P>
Graziani, who headed in a cross by veteran captain Luis
Capurro, also missed two gilt-edged chances to add to his tally in
the second half of a generally scrappy game.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador colleted 21 points from 15 matches, one less than
fourth-placed Peru, who were away to Chile later on Sunday. The
top four teams in the South American group qualify for France.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador were left hoping that Peru did not win their match, as
this would guarantee their neighbors the last place still open in
the group. Argentina, Colombia and Paraguay have already
qualified.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Warn People About High Blood Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical experts and
doctors are worried about the growing number of people who have
high blood pressure but few of whom regard it as an illness or
know how to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
A recent national study found that there are 90 million people
above the age of 15 who suffer from high blood pressure. Last
year, there was a 50-percent increase in the number of people
suffering from the problem, which used to be confined to those
above the age of 50, but which is now reaching more young people
and even people in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Doctors attribute the increase to improved living standards,
changes in diet, and a lack of physical exercise. They are upset
by the fact that only half the people with high blood pressure are
actually aware of their condition and have gotten regular
treatment.
</P>
<P>
"Quite a number of people are ignorant of the illness and its
consequences," says Dr. Fang Qi, honorary president of Union
Hospital in Beijing. He said that high blood pressure and related
diseases cause about two million deaths a year, in addition to
many cases of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
"It is almost the number one killer," Dr.Fang noted, and
advised people to be more alert and to have regular check-ups when
they reach the age of 35.
</P>
<P>
A recent study of medication use by urban residents found that
30.43 percent of the people thought that the ailment did not
require any medication.

<HEADLINE> 28 Detained and 69 Injured in World Cup Disorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Police said here today that 24
Britons and four Italians were detained, 33 Britons and 36
Italians injured disorders in Rome before, during and after
yesterday evening's World Cup game in which England won access to
the final phase of the competition in France Next year.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Rome's police headquarters said charges had been
preferred against 14 Britons and two Italians. Only one of the
injured, Paul Shadbolt, was reported in a serious condition. He
was knifed in the stomach and doctors fear he may have suffered
internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, the charges range from aggravated
disorder and insulting behaviour to causing bodily harm and
resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
Before the game, police made baton charges against rioting fans
around the Spanish Steps and other parts of downtown Rome. There
were also baton charges in the areas of the stands reserved to the
English fans. After the match, three buses and three trams were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
Police intervened in the stands when Italian and English fans
started hurling objects at each other. A cordon of baton-wielding
agents separated them and later charged to push back the English
fans twenty or so yards. The incidents stirred up polemics and
rispostes in Rome and London, where returning fans claimed their
Italian confreres had behaved "like animals".
</P>
<P>
In London, Davis Mellor, the Tory ex-minister who heads
Britain's official soccer commission, charged the Italian police
with "over-reacting", and the FA's executive director Graham Kelly
criticised the Italian organisers of the event.
</P>
<P>
The police chief reported that the 6,000 England fans involved
were escorted from the stadium first, loaded into sixty municipal
buses and left at scattered points around the city, which
prevented incidents during the night.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of fans were detained and in some cases charged in
incidents in various parts of Italy as the England supporters
converged on Rome.

BONN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Privatization of Germany's
national airline Lufthansa has been completed in success, an
international bank group announced in Frankfurt today.

The Bonn government is expected to gain some 4.7 billion

subscription offer, and that over half of the shares had been
ordered by private investors with the rest going to large local
and foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Camerounians Go to Polls to Elect New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Camerounians today went to
polling stations throughout the nation's territory to elect a new
president who will lead the country for the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
Candidates of seven political parties including the ruling
Cameroun People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) are vying for the
post of the president of the republic.
</P>
<P>
In the nation's capital Yaounde, most of the polling stations
opened at 8:00 a.m. as stipulated by the law. The election day in
the capital today went on smoothly without any incident recorded,
and some of the earlier voters were seen coming to vote at 9:00
a.m.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent President and candidate of the CPDM Paul Biya cast
his vote at the Government Bilingual Grammar School in Bastos
here this afternoon. Prime Minister Pete Mafany Musonge also cast
his vote in the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Cameroun, presidential election has taken
place throughout all the provinces of the country in peace, order
and tranquillity. But in some places, there were not many voters
to visit polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Since the three major opposition parties -- the Social
Democratic Front (SDF), the National Union for Democracy and
Progress (NUDP) and the Camerounian Democratic Union (CDU) --
declared their boycott of this year's presidential elections,
their militants and sympathizers stayed at home during the
polling day today.
</P>
<P>
Besides, many Camerounians have refused to go to the polls
today, saying their votes would not change anything in the
country, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that only the ruling CPDM party was represented
in all the polling stations throughout Cameroun. Some parties
were eventually absent in all provinces.
</P>
<P>
The polling stations all over the country were expected to be
closed at 6:00 p.m. today. Vote counting is expected to begin
immediately after today's presidential elections. The results
will be officially announced in a few days, perhaps in two weeks,
some said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second presidential election which has taken place
in Cameroun since the multiparty system practiced in the country.
The first presidential election was won by CPDM leader Paul Biya
in 1992.
