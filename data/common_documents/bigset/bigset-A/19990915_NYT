PRIMARY WIN GIVES COUNCILMAN LOCK ON BALTIMORE MAYORALTY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ City Councilman Martin O'Malley, a 36-year-old
former prosecutor who has vowed to crack down on the city's
alarming wave of drug dealing and homicide, was elected Tuesday as
the Democratic mayoral nominee in a primary victory tantamount to
final election in this Democratic bastion.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley, who is white, won more than 50 percent of the vote in
defeating the two leading black candidates, Lawrence BellIII, the
City Council president, and Carl Stokes, a former councilman and
school board member. The two split much of the majority black vote
in this gritty, troubled city which, the candidates all emphasized,
has sadly missed out on the renaissance enjoyed by other major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for diversity and a victory for
inclusiveness,'' O'Malley told a victory rally Tuesday night. All
about him, a happy throng of black and white political leaders
beamed at his strong showing among black voters and his
overwhelming margin of victory of close to 2-1 over Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to build a new Baltimore,'' O'Malley said as he
promised to work for ``those who dream of a new tomorrow for this
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Overtaking the field after a late decision to run, the
boyish-looking councilman prevailed in a raucous primary
competition. It featured 19 Democratic contenders, veiled charges
of racism and a political standoff that caused an 11th-hour shift
to the O'Malley banner by several leading black politicians. This
proved a critical blessing in a city that is 65 percent black and
90 percent Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The vote meant that O'Malley, a tireless campaigner who visited
New York and other cities to underline Baltimore's deeply resistant
crime problems, is virtually certain to succeed Mayor Kurt Schmoke
in November as the city's 47th chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Elected and hailed 12 years ago as an urban visionary and the
city's first black mayor, Schmoke chose not to run again in the
face of Baltimore's continuing problems with middle-class flight,
crime, budget deficit and failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   The hopes of political and business leaders to draft Kweisi
Mfume, the former Baltimore congressman who is now the president of
the NAACP, as an overwhelming unity candidate failed when he
declined to run, and O'Malley entered a wide-open primary with no
clear leader until Tuesday night. The election turnout proved
strong, about 50 percent of the 294,000 registered voters in this
city of 675,000.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes, 49, finished second after several campaign stumbles,
including an erroneous claim of a college degree and an income tax
lien he had once settled. Bell saw his early front-runner status as
a 37-year-old leader of the black community fade in a series of
campaign gaffes including, at one point, his appeal for black votes
because ``I look like you.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican ballot, David Tufaro, 52, a developer and
lawyer, was the victorious mayoral nominee, defeating Carl Adair,
65, a public school teacher and Republican committeeman.
</P>
<P>
   With a virtual lock on the mayoralty in the November election,
the Democratic victor is expected to spend the next two months not
campaigning so much as appealing for unity and trying to heal the
civic wounds of the rugged primary contest. Voters faced a listless
bevy of candidates at first, 27 in all from both parties. The
Democratic candidates were winnowed to three main contenders by
Labor Day, with some bare-knuckled campaign tactics flashing about
the race.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley stuck doggedly to his anti-crime theme, asking why
Baltimore, which has more than 300 murders a year, could not enjoy
the same urban renaissance as New York and other rebounding cities.
In particular, he targeted the open-air drug markets as an affront
to the city and vowed a ``zero-tolerance'' criminal justice stance.
``We have to make our city safe,'' was his repeated message.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes, denouncing a ``zero-tolerance'' policy as basically
anti-minority, focused more on the failures in the city's schools,
which have the lowest test scores in the state. He promised smaller
class sizes and vowed to quickly generate renewal in the city's
neighborhoods, which lose about 1,000 working- and middle-class
residents each month to surrounding suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, a political tyro when he came up through neighborhood
organizations to win an underdog victory on the City Council and
then the council presidency, attacked O'Malley as a political
spoiler exploiting a divided black community. ``When he saw there
was a split vote, he leaped into the race,'' Bell said of O'Malley.
Their sharp-edged rivalry ended a once cooperative relationship on
the council in days when they were dubbed Batman and Robin for
their crime-fighting agenda.
</P>
<P>
   By early August, a group of black leaders led by a state General
Assembly delegate, Howard Rawlings, was disappointed by Bell and
Stokes as questions arose about their personal finances. The
leaders decided to cast their lot with O'Malley. ``It's not a
question of being the best black candidate or the best white
candidate,'' Rawlings announced, putting his record as a party
kingmaker on the line. ``O'Malley has a track record of empowering
black Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   After all the crossfire of the primary, O'Malley now has to
apply a fresh burst of resolve and energy to managing what the
departing Schmoke has wistfully dubbed ``the tale of the two
cities'' _ Baltimore's gleaming inner-harbor image of skyline
optimism and its back-street reality of deep neighborhood problems.

THANKFULLY, THESE ATHLETES COME ALONG ONLY ONCE A CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ESPN went to the expense the occasion deserved in
unveiling its list of the top 20 athletes of the 20th century on
Tuesday. Honorees were flown to New York for the ceremony, somebody
put on a record of dramatic orchestral music and lunch was served.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, this column is going to the expense the occasion
deserves in revealing its bottom 20 today. No airline tickets (our
honorees would miss the plane), no music (``Chopsticks'' is not
available on CD) and no meal (these guys might hurt themselves with
the forks.)
</P>
<P>
   Another difference between ESPN's top 20 and our bottom 20: They
consulted broadcasters, writers and sports scholars before making
their list. We asked the guy at the next desk.
</P>
<P>
   Arazi: ESPN was ridiculed for including three racehorses in its
top 100. But our list of the most hapless, star-crossed,
disappointing athletes would be incomplete without the overhyped
little colt from France who inspired Pimlico Race Course to build a
second press box to handle the Preakness media overflow. Arazi
finished eighth in the Kentucky Derby, never made it to Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Benjamin: What he lacked in ability for the Clippers,
Lakers and six other teams, he made up for with lack of effort.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brown: The often-injured (or so he thought) third baseman
begged out of the San Francisco Giants lineup one day because ``I
slept on my eye wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Buckner: We're listing them alphabetically. He also could
go under ``E.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Decker Slaney: Little Mary wailing in the arms of her
husband is the most pathetic sight in Olympic sports history.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Ford: Good football player, middling president, dangerous
golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Frazier: The heavyweight champion set the ``boxers are
athletes'' side of the argument back 10 years by nearly drowning in
``Superstars'' swimming competition.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gerkin: He went 0-12 _ despite a 3.62 ERA _ as a rookie
pitcher for the 1945 Philadelphia A's. But he wouldn't have made
our list if his name weren't Gerkin.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Kuiper: The anti-Aaron hit !ital!one home run in 3,379
at-bats for the Indians and Giants, and had a sense of humor about
it, posing for a trading-card photo with a splintered bat on his
shoulder. Had Kuiper played with the lively baseball of the '90s,
he might have hit two homers.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Lett: It must be the drugs: The Cowboys defensive lineman's
knack for committing more turnovers than he causes is all that
keeps earlier football boneheads Roy Riegels and Jim Marshall off
our list.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Merkle: As in ``Merkle's boner.'' The moral of the story is
that you should always touch second base, lest your name appear
alongside ``boner'' for the next 90 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Mendoza: The weak-hitting infielder is the namesake of the
``Mendoza line'' (.200, or .215 if you're going by his actual
career average). Now he's passing along his secrets to future
Angels as manager of Single-A Lake Elsinore.
</P>
<P>
   Dan O'Brien: Commercialism and pole-vaulting at their worst. The
decathlete starred in those ``Dan and Dave'' shoe commercials
before the 1992 Olympics _ then failed to qualify for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   George Plimpton: Everybody on this list is a bad athlete in one
way or another. What sets Plimpton apart is the fact he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Powlus: The Notre Dame quarterback Beano Cook predicted
would win two Heisman Trophies fell two short. He was, after all,
no Gino Torretta.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ryun: Mary Decker with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry: ``You're wrong,'' Tom Lasorda told an
interviewer. ``Darryl Strawberry is not a dog. A dog is loyal and
runs hard after balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Marv Throneberry: The symbol of the 1962 Mets hit .244, led the
National League's first basemen with 17 errors, then held out for a
bigger contract. The Mets shipped him to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Wadkins: He and brother Lanny began the 1999 season with
21 PGA Tour victories between them. Lanny had 21 while Bobby was
winless in 702 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Wepner: The heavyweight known as ``the Bayonne Bleeder''
once said: ``I was 6-foot-1 when I started boxing, but with all the
uppercuts I'm up to 6-5.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, too, gave out its list in alphabetical order: Hank Aaron,
Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Wilt Chamberlain, Ty Cobb, Babe Didrikson
Zaharias, Wayne Gretzky, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Carl Lewis,
Joe Louis, Willie Mays, Martina Navratilova, Jack Nicklaus, Jesse
Owens, Jackie Robinson, Bill Russell, Babe Ruth, Jim Thorpe and Ted
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The exact ranking of the ESPN top 20 _ and the answer to ``Who's
No. 1?'' _ will be revealed as the network's weekly biographies
continue.
</P>
<P>
   As for our bottom 20, we have no plans to rank them. We've spent
just about long enough on them already.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ The buzz began late last fall when Texas A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum, who feels the same way about hyping players as
he does about using Grecian Formula, dropped the first bomb about
wide receiver Bethel Johnson.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnson was ineligible last season as an academic partial
qualifier, but Slocum had seen him enough in practice to say he had
a chance to be the best Aggies wide receiver in the 26 seasons
Slocum has been at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters checked and double-checked the tapes to make sure they
had heard Slocum correctly, talking this way about a player who had
yet to participate in a game. They had.
</P>
<P>
   During the spring and summer, Slocum said the Aggies were going
to be more proficient passing the ball. The reason, he said, was
that the receiving corps was the best he had ever had. The
implication was that Johnson, a 6-0, 190-pound ball of speed, would
make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   One game into his collegiate career, Johnson has done nothing to
dispel that enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   In the Aggies' season-opening 37-17 win over Louisiana Tech,
Johnson had four catches for 106 yards and one touchdown. He caught
bombs for 46 and 33 yards, turned a hitch-and-go pattern into a
15-yard gain, and leaped to grab a 12-yard touchdown pass in the
corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Johnson was not at full strength after suffering a
stress fracture in his foot during summer practice and then
straining his hamstring the week before the opener, he will be
worth watching when the Aggies host Tulsa on Saturday night in
their home opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did on the field what I had seen in practice,'' said
Slocum. ``He's the kind of receiver who can make a quarterback look
good. Quarterbacks love a guy who can turn a hitch pattern into 15
or 40 yards, a guy who can leap and make the great catch. He can
sky and get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggies quarterback Randy McCown, who also raved after watching
Johnson practice last season, concurs. McCown was 17-of-28 against
Louisiana Tech, setting career bests for completions and yardage
(252).
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to throw it right on the money for him to catch
it,'' said McCown. ``He's a lot like (Minnesota Vikings receiver)
Randy Moss in that he can go up and make the play. With that speed,
he (Johnson) is a tough guy to overthrow. You'd have to have a
stiff wind at your back.''
</P>
<P>
   The question that begs to be asked is why Johnson, who moved
from running back to wide receiver midway through his junior year
at Corsicana High School, elected to attend Texas A&AMP;M. Under
Slocum, the Aggies have built a reputation as a team that throws
only when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were recruiting me, they pretty much came to me
straight,'' he said. ``I knew that this wasn't a passing school,
but they were telling me that coach (Steve) Kragthorpe was the new
offensive coordinator, and he was the wide receivers coach, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I didn't want to go to A&AMP;M, because I just thought
they would run the ball. But then I got to thinking, `If he's the
wide receivers coach and the offensive coordinator, there's a
pretty good chance he's going to be passing the ball.'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is at once brash and humble. He said he was disappointed
in his first-game effort against Louisiana Tech because ``after I
watched films, I thought the catches I made should have been
touchdowns. I know it's different from high school, but in high
school those were touchdowns. I hate falling down (being tackled)
after a catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has picked the role model of role models for wide
receivers _ San Francisco's Jerry Rice. The main reason, says
Johnson, is that Rice's work ethic is something he would like to
emulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got this Jerry Rice film, and I watch it like every other
day for inspiration,'' said Johnson. ``He practices real hard, and
sometimes I tend to be lazy. Then I start thinking about the film.
It's like, `Jerry Rice wouldn't do this.' He works extra hard to
stay a step ahead of everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Aggies believe Johnson will be in the weeks and
years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got big-play capabilities,'' said senior running back
Dante Hall. ``The way he was running past the defensive backs in
practice (last year) caught your attention. We couldn't wait for
him to do it in the game. Now, it's just a matter of execution.''

ROCKIES HIT DOTEL, BEAT METS, 7-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Bobby Valentine made it perfectly clear before this
game as to what he had advised his rookie starter, Octavio Dotel,
to do differently in his first outing in the nightmarish
environment of Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' Valentine said. ``I would not like to see him
change for the ballpark. You have to go with your strength.''
</P>
<P>
   That hands-off approach did not work for Dotel and the Mets
Tuesday night in a 7-2 loss to the Colorado Rockies. Dotel, whose
season has otherwise been so impressive that he is almost sure to
remain in the Mets' rotation when it is pared down for the final
two weeks of the season, was hit hard by the Rockies and victimized
by the thin air and remarkable carry of fly balls at the park. He
gave up six runs on seven hits _ there were consecutive home runs
that looked like routine fly balls by Vinny Castilla and Edgard
Clemente in the third and a total of six extra-base hits _ in only
three innings.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat could have been worse for the Mets. Cincinnati lost
to the Chicago Cubs, 4-3, so the Mets remained two and a half games
ahead of the Reds in the wild-card race. Meanwhile, the Mets
dropped a game and a half behind Atlanta in the National League
East, with the Braves playing later in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   This was not Dotel's worst start in his still brief tenure with
the Mets, although it ended a streak of seven consecutive winning
decisions for the right-hander. He was hit harder and had less
control against the Cubs at Wrigley Field in July. But in recent
starts, Dotel (7-2) had been superb. In his last three starts, he
had given up just five earned runs on 13 hits in 20 innings and
beaten two potential playoff opponents _ Arizona and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he walked just two, but he left several pitches
up in the strike zone, prime territory for Colorado batters to put
the ball in the air and watch it fly. If there was any good to come
from this outing, it was that Dotel's early exit afforded Bobby
Jones to make his debut as a long reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had a 3-3 record with a 5.81 earned run average this
season, had not pitched since May 22, when he began to suffer from
tendinitis in his right shoulder. He went on the disabled list, and
when he came off in August and began a rehabilitation assignment,
he was diagnosed with bursitis in the shoulder as well.
</P>
<P>
   There was gloomy talk that Jones might be finished for the
season to rest the shoulder and that if the pain persisted when he
tried to throw, he could need off-season surgery to clean out the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he continued pain-free with his rehabilitation and was
activated in Los Angeles. Barring cataclysmic injuries to the
rotation, Jones will not be a starter again this season, a
situation he seems content with for now.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Jones gave a glimpse of the pitcher he could be
again next season. He had entered the game with a dismal record at
Coors, having allowed 25 earned runs in 24 1/3 innings here. But in
his first relief effort as a professional, he retired the side in
the fourth, allowed only a single in the fifth and did not give up
a run _ on Neifi Perez's second triple of the night, to drive in
Ben Petrick _ until the sixth, his final inning.
</P>
<P>
   In three innings, he allowed one run, three hits and no walks,
while striking out three.
</P>
<P>
   That was the best part of the game for the Mets in what was an
otherwise sleepy effort. Colorado's starter, Jamey Wright, had
spent the summer in Class AAA before being recalled Aug. 2. He shut
down the Mets on only three hits through six innings, assisted by a
third-inning pickoff of Rickey Henderson. Only three times did
Wright allow runners to get into scoring position before the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets finally threatened in the seventh when Roger Cedeno
walked and later scored on a single by Luis Lopez, who had been
inserted in the bottom of the fourth at shortstop in place of Rey
Ordonez, who has gone 2 for 22 on this road trip. Jay Payton, who
pinch-hit for Jones and remained in the game, had singled and gone
to second on Lopez's hit.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Henderson came to the plate. The count went full
and the Mets seemed ready to continue the rally. But living
dangerously, Valentine sent the runners. Henderson struck out and
Petrick threw Payton out easily at third for an inning-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine recently said that he never gives up in a game. But
even he conceded Tuesday night. For the bottom of the eighth
inning, Valentine put in the Class AAA call-ups Melvin Mora at
second and Jorge Toca at first. Todd Pratt replaced Mike Piazza as
catcher. The infield had not one regular starter remaining, a sure
sign that Valentine was not counting on any late-game rallies by
his team.

WTO STRUGGLES TO DISEPL MYTHS ABOUT WHAT IT DOES, HOW IT WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ To those who accuse it of everything from spawning El
Nino to being a tool of ruthless multinational corporations bent on
globalization, the World Trade Organization has a ready reply:
Don't blame us, blame your government.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the threat of massive demonstrations at the Nov. 30-Dec.
3 ministerial conference in Seattle, WTO officials in Geneva are
struggling to dispel what they consider numerous fallacies about
the controversial world body.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 5,000 guests from the WTO's 135 member states
expected to attend, the Seattle event will be the largest trade
meeting ever held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It is also expected to draw an army of public-interest groups
with a multitude of concerns ranging from saving rain forests to
AIDS activism to militant anti-capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   WTO officials believe many of these groups have little or no
understanding of how the organization actually works.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very strange perceptions out there about the
WTO,'' said David Hartridge, director of the Geneva-based
organization's Trade in Services Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that people have a grossly inflated idea of the
power and influence of the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps foremost among the misperceptions, according to several
trade officials interviewed in Geneva, is the notion that the WTO
is trying to control world trade by dictating policy to
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO is basically a negotiating forum to help facilitate
the settlement of trade disputes,'' Hartridge said. ``The WTO
itself does not regulate trade. We don't issue licenses or regulate
tariffs. The WTO itself does not take a decision on anything; the
member governments do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartridge and his colleagues said the WTO's staff of more than
500 people, most of them translators and support personnel, simply
provide a neutral secretariat to serve member governments.
</P>
<P>
   And they say complaints about a lack of openness and access to
the decision-making process should be directed at the member
governments, not at the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make an easy target,'' acknowledged Jorge Vigano, counselor
for the WTO's Trade and Environment Division. ``But the decisions
are taken by governments.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument doesn't quite wash with critics like Mike Dolan,
deputy director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, an offshoot
of Ralph Nader's Washington, D.C.-based consumer group. While
recognizing the WTO's function as a legislative forum for
governments, Dolan said the organization also has a direct judicial
role in resolving trade disputes through its Dispute Settlement
Body. The body issues rulings by adopting the findings of a panel
of experts or an appeal report.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, our demands and complaints are not directed at the
WTO functionaries in Geneva, but at the 135 member governments,''
said Dolan, who is helping to organize the so-called ``mobilization
against globalization'' in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a bit disingenuous for the WTO to ignore its judicial
function. They refer to their legislative function, but they also
have a judiciary role that is extremely untransparent and extremely
undemocratic.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, WTO officials acknowledge, the organization is going
to serve as a lightning rod for all kinds of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been blamed for everything from El Nino to acting as a
tool of powerful multinational corporations,'' said a Geneva-based
trade official who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   He said violent protests in the normally placid streets of
Geneva during the last ministerial conference in May 1998
underscored the public-relations challenge faced by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Geneva protests, including the overturning of the Jamaican
ambassador's car, was an eye-opener for a lot of us,'' the official
said. ``The passion in the streets was based on ignorance and was
totally misdirected, but it illustrated the need for us to inform
and educate the general public as to what the WTO really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous groups, known as non-governmental organizations, or
NGOs, have sought a place at the WTO negotiating table in Seattle,
a demand that has so far been rejected by member states. Dolan said
``the deck is stacked against civil society,'' which may get a seat
``near the table, but not at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the Seattle conference will provide ``an
opportunity for a historic confrontation'' that will reveal the
``slavish devotion'' of political elites to the ``corporate
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of talk that makes people in Geneva nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Although Geneva trade officials are ``much impressed'' with
preparations by the Seattle Host Committee, the threat of
disruption remains a very real fear, Hartridge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are worried about the huge presence of NGOs,'' he
said. ``You've got the right wing on one end of the spectrum, then
in the middle are trade unions and environmentalists, then the left
wing. It's impossible to address a single audience because there's
such a large spectrum. It's easy to meet with some of them and
discuss issues with some of them, but you can't provide a sort of
all-inclusive discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though donor governments won't allow them into the
negotiating room, a lot of NGOs are consulted closely by their
respective governments in advance of ministerial meetings, he
added. In a bid to make NGOs feel involved, the WTO secretariat
regularly meets with them and has organized conferences on specific
trade-related issues. In March, for example, about 900
organizations attended a Geneva symposium on trade and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But Vigano agreed there is little chance NGOs will be involved
in the decision-making process in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if any government representative would want NGOs
participating in the official ministerial,'' Vigano said. ``It
would be very difficult. There are those NGOs who work with us and
those who say no to everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartridge dismissed those critics who say the WTO does more harm
than good. ``To say that the WTO is harmful is literally to say
that the world would be better off without a multilateral set of
rules on trade,'' he said. ``It's manifest nonsense. Nobody could
seriously defend that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can perfectly well say that some of the individual
rules should be revised. That's OK; that's what rules are for.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Rockwell, the U.S. director of the WTO's Information and
Media Relations Division, said he welcomes the public scrutiny.
``Our main concern is that there not be violence,'' he said. ``But
peaceful protest? I think every American believes it's their right
to express their point of view. In fact, it's a right and a duty.''

   MERRITT ISLAND, Fla. _ After days of worry and preparation, with
much of the state's eastern coast boarded up and deserted, people
here in Florida braced for the arrival Wednesday morning of massive
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the hurricane's outer bands began to buffet the
state's east-central barrier islands after dark, forecasters were
still unsure if the deadly eye of the Category 4 storm would make
landfall, perhaps around Cape Canaveral, or if the storm center
would only skirt the state before turning north to threaten Georgia
and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said that, as they had cautiously forecast, Floyd
seemed to be turning more to the north, good news for Florida. But
even if the storm's eye, with winds of around 150 mph, did not come
ashore, meteorologists predicted that hurricane-force winds would
still extend into the state, strong enough to blow roofs off
houses, fell walls and topple trees.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, more than half a million people were on the move as
authorities ordered the evacuation of Savannah and low-lying
counties. In South Carolina, 800,000 people were ordered to leave
coastal areas, and even North Carolina declared a state of
emergency and urged residents of outlying islands to seek shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Max Mayfield, the deputy director of the National Hurricane
Center in Miami, said Tuesday night that the most recent prediction
put the direction of the storm more toward the north, making
landfall more likely in Georgia or the Carolinas. He also said that
the storm had weakened, but warned against making too much of that.
``It's the difference between being hit by a semi and being hit by
a freight train,'' Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, President Clinton on Tuesday issued an
unusual pre-emptive declaration of disaster for the state, even
before the first palm tree had been pushed down.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, James Witt, the federal official in charge of the
storm relief efforts, said Tuesday night that the exodus of
residents from the coastal areas was one of the largest evacuations
ever conducted in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Clinton had declared Florida and Georgia disaster
areas even before the storm reached land, Witt said, ``The massive
evacuation is almost a disaster in itself,'' with its needs of
shelter, food and medical care for the thousands of people who left
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, warned that the northward jaunt of the storm probably came
too late to spare the east-central coast from what is still a
dangerous storm. One meteorologist predicted a ``weed-eater
effect'' as winds churn up the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd howled through the Bahamas Tuesday, knocking out power,
wrecking boats, knocking down trees and damaging houses, but damage
was not as bad as expected, according to e-mails from residents
there.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, more than 1 million people evacuated the east coast
on Monday and Tuesday, and as of Tuesday evening thousands were
still stranded in unmoving traffic on a variety of interstates and
toll roads. Interstate 4, Toll Road 528, U.S. 1 and other routes
were more like parking lots much of the day, as people fled inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to get the hell out,'' said Stephen Collins, who lives on
Merritt Island, between Cape Canaveral and Cocoa Beach, as he
gassed up his car at a convenience store on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the store's manager, A.K. Patel, put up hurricane
shutters and prepared to leave. ``I've got two kids,'' he said.
``We're scared.''
</P>
<P>
   In Charleston, S.C., where memories remain vivid from Hurricane
Hugo, which devastated the South Carolina low country 10 years ago,
a mandatory evacuation turned into an unthinkable traffic debacle
as state officials waited until late Tuesday evening to open the
eastbound lane of Interstate 26 to westbound traffic. Although the
evacuation order came at midday, police did not reverse the
eastbound lane on the primary westbound escape route until after 10
p.m., leaving tens of thousands of cars at a standstill for hours.
</P>
<P>
   All along the central Florida coast, waves were already chewing
into the beaches and washing over sea walls, but as dark fell the
worst of the storm was still miles off shore.
</P>
<P>
   Most people were long gone, and towns up and down the beach were
quiet and boarded-up. A few people made last-minute runs to the few
open stores for essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Rich is staying. After boarding up her own windows in
Melbourne, she made a trip to the store for provisions: a case of
Corona beer, a 12-pack of Pepsi and a carton of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how long we're going to be trapped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just highway traffic that snarled here. Floyd closed
most of the state's airports, leaving passengers stranded and
upsetting flight schedules around the country.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   State officials said that decisions made as early as Monday to
evacuate coastal areas were wise ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local governments did the right thing by asking for
evacuations early enough,'' said Gov. Jeb Bush. ``Floridians have
responded in the proper way.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 1 million people ordered to evacuate their homes
in coastal Florida, hundreds of thousands spent the night inland
wherever they could find a bed. The more fortunate, and more
wealthy, filled hotel rooms in Orlando and other inland cities, and
some drove as far the west coast, to Naples, Fort Myers and the
Tampa Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands filled high school gymnasiums, auditoriums and
churches, spending a miserable night on the floor or in folding
chairs. In Belle Glade, about 40 miles west of Palm Beach, more
than 500 people packed the auditorium of Glades Central High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all by myself with my four kids, and I was scared,''
said Pearlie Hill, 33, who abandoned her mobile home in this mostly
poor farming community for the stronger walls of the school. ``We
had no safe place to be. We all learned in school about the 1928
hurricane, so hurricanes scare us around these parts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, a hurricane crashed through Palm Beach County, flooded
the farm towns around Lake Okeechobee and killed nearly 2,000
people, most of them poor farm workers. Some 1,000 were buried in a
mass grave in a cemetery in Canal Point.
</P>
<P>
   Missoura Philpart, 49, brought her family of eight to the
shelter. ``My grandmama had to climb to the top of her roof when
that hurricane hit in 1928,'' she said. ``I was raised to fear
hurricanes.''
</P>
<P>
   To the east in Palm Beach County on Tuesday, the usually busy
Federal Highway was mostly quiet as the sun set and Floyd, finally,
began to blow into the state. The strip malls, their storefronts
covered over with plywood, were almost empty of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Loony, a mail carrier, tried to keep his Postal Service
jeep from being blown off the road by wind gusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're the only ones who had to work today,''
Loony said, before moving on with his baskets of mail, a real-life
example of that old slogan about neither rain nor sleet nor dark of
night. He did not seem pleased.
</P>
<P>
   But others were looking ahead for the possible consequences and
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, said that the cost of caring for the evacuated
people was going to be very great regardless of damage to the
coastal areas. One example he gave was the cost of calling up 2,000
members of the South Carolina National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   There were other costs that ordinarily do not come to mind, he
said, giving as an example warnings that he received from Southern
governors that ``they're right in the middle of harvesting cotton,
and it could have a devastating effect.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Boca Raton, as in other parts of Florida, the time for
preparation was past, and people hoped the forecasters' prediction
that the worst of the storm would go north of them, was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, it looked as if that was exactly what had
happened, and people here were grateful that lashing rain and winds
of 70 mph were the worst they saw of Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, I had this awful pit in my stomach,'' said Charles
Miehz, a retiree who lives in Boca Raton. As he, and many others
here, had watched the massive storm creep across his television
screen, it seemed as if it would swallow the whole state. But, as
the worst of the storm passed farther north, he finally took a safe
breath.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same in Miami, where Tiffany Zadi, a student at the
University of Miami, stayed up late at her parents' house in Cutler
Ridge, praying that the storm would pass Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Thank God,''' said Miss Zadi, who, along with her
parents, rode out Hurricane Andrew in their Cutler Ridge home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricane Andrew was a nightmare,'' she said. And Floyd seemed
so much bigger, so much more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane warning that went into effect Monday night in
Miami was lifted late Tuesday afternoon, allowing people to leave
emergency shelters and return to their homes. Mayor Alex Penelas
announced late Tuesday that schools and government offices would
reopen Wednesday, and that city services would resume normal
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, the best preparation they could think of was to
go for a swim. On Miami Beach's South Beach, a half-dozen hardy
souls dove into the waves at midday, while dozens of other braved a
hazy, gritty wind to watch them. John Tedesco, who lives in Miami
Beach, had already been there twice for nighttime swims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a little bit of fear you're going to get pulled
out,'' he said. ``You got to know your limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Becker, Tedesco's girlfriend, knew hers. She stayed on
shore, watching him like a sailor's wife perched in the widow's
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's nuts, I tell you,'' she said. ``He likes the rush of it.
And my heart stops.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Juan Andrada stood and took it all in.
Bare-chested and with a leathery tan, he was almost meditative as
he beheld the ocean. For 30 years, he worked as a steward on cruise
ships, including the Queen Elizabeth II. He was happy just to watch
what he knew could be a wicked, unforgiving sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always an attraction to the sea,'' he said. ``I can
see what people don't know. I have respect for the sea. I'm not
going in it. I know the force of the sea. Other people don't. There
is wind and water. That is electricity. For me, this is a great
miracle.''

HOUSE PASSES BILL WITH NEW LIMITS ON CAMPAIGN DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Updating and rewriting throughout to reflect House approval of
bill)   (bl)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defying the Republican leadership, the House late
Tuesday night voted for the second year in a row to limit the
influence of money in politics and overhaul the way the nation's
political campaigns are financed.
</P>
<P>
   The 252-177 vote in favor of legislation sponsored by Reps.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass., was nearly
identical to last year's vote, as House members for both parties
complained that the money pouring into politics was fueling public
cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four Republicans split from their party to back the bill,
while 13 Democrats broke party lines to vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   But in a slap at Hillary Rodham Clinton, the House by a vote of
261-167 added to the bill a provision that would require the first
lady to reimburse the federal government for any transportation
costs she incurs in her expected Senate bid in New York. Forty-six
Democrats voted for the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over campaign financing now moves to the Senate,
where the bill to ban the unlimited and unregulated ``soft money''
donations to the national political parties drew a majority of 52
votes last year. But the legislation then died in a Republican-led
filibuster. Opponents have vowed to kill it once again when it
comes to the floor in October, and its proponents face an uphill
struggle in finding the extra votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that there are the votes to pass any bill this
year in the Senate,'' said Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles on
Tuesday. ``Right now, there's no consensus pulling together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is volatile and Shays predicted that the
legislation could yet pass before the 106th Congress ends in 2000
if its Senate supporters are adamant. ``We are going to ask the
Senate to do what they did during the civil rights days,'' he said.
``We are going to ask the proponents of campaign finance to force
the opponents of campaign finance reform, a minority in the Senate,
to have to filibuster continually to prevent a fair vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on Tuesday clashed repeatedly over whether the influx
of money into campaigns was corrupting Congress or whether it was
essential to free political speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reach and influence of special interests have grown out of
control,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., one of numerous
Republicans to buck their leadership and support the bipartisan
bill. ``As a consequence, people believe their elected officials
are bought and paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., insisted that the legislation could
not face constitutional muster. ``It tromps all over people's
individual First Amendment freedoms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton this week called upon the House to approve the
bipartisan bill, saying it would ``revitalize the political process
by curbing the role of special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The House debate came as a new campaign season was already well
underway and promising to be the most costly yet.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side of the presidential campaign, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, who has amassed an enormous $50 million campaign
fund, has already declared that he will not accept federal matching
funds. Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher, is also
forgoing federal funds. Those decisions leave both men unrestricted
by a $40 million spending limit that applies to candidates who
accept matching funds in the primaries, a cap that was a bulwark of
the post Watergate campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chief Republican sponsor of the
Senate legislation to ban soft money, has put his crusade at the
center of his own uphill bid for the Republican presidential
nomination. He has called the current campaign system ``an
elaborate influence peddling scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Democrat Bill Bradley has pledged that he
would refuse soft money in 2000 if the Republicans would also do
so, saying big money is at the root of multiple problems in U.S.
politics. Vice President Al Gore supports legislation to ban soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan legislation would not raise the current
donation limit of $1,000 per candidate in the presidential race.
Instead, it would ban so-called ``soft money,'' the unlimited and
unregulated donations to political parties that both parties have
used to circumvent the limits on contributions to individual
candidates that were enacted in the wake of Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   It would also curb the increasingly popular practice by
independent advocacy groups of running advertisements that purport
to explain an issues but are thinly veiled campaign commercials
attacking or supporting a candidate. The bill would more strictly
regulate such advertisements in the 60 days before an election. And
it would raise the total limit on individual campaign contributions
from $25,000 to $30,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to overhaul the campaign finance system took
on new resonance after the 1996 campaign, in which Clinton
aggressively used access to the White House to raise money. Both
parties found ways to use television commercials that stopped just
short of promoting a candidate to get around federal spending
limits. And the Democratic National Committee gave back several
million dollars in donations after disclosures that the money had
come from foreign nationals or was of questionable legality.
</P>
<P>
   But despite holding a series of high profile hearings into the
1996 abuses, the Republican leaders in Congress have staunchly
opposed the move to ban soft-money, arguing publicly that it would
weaken political parties and harm free speech.
</P>
<P>
   This summer in a closed door meeting for House Republicans,
party leaders were more blunt. Republicans said their party
chairman, Jim Nicholson, and Rep. Thomas Davis, R-Va., of Virginia,
who is head of the House Republicans' re-election effort, told
lawmakers that their party held a $39.9 million advantage in soft
money in the 1997-1998 election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Through a long day and into the night, House members argued over
the money chase that they have come to know so well.
</P>
<P>
   Shays insisted his legislation would close loopholes that had
come over time come to erode long-standing fund-raising
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about ending corrupt politics,'' he said, ''that's what
it's about. It has been against the law since 1907 for corporate
treasury money to be used in campaigns. But it happens. It's been
against the law since 1947 for union dues money to be used in
campaigns. But it's happening. It's been against the law since 1974
for foreign nationals to contribute to campaigns. But they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill said its restrictions on issue advocacy
infringed on the First Amendment. ``Free speech, particularly free
political speech, is a cherished right and shrine in the First
Amendment to our Constitution,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif.
``For democracy to flourish, a free people must be able to express
their political views without government restriction.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt accused the Republican
majority of being in the sway of special interests on issues
ranging from health care to tax cuts to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all seen what being bound to big money from the
special interests has done to the Republican legislative agenda,''
Gephardt said. ``Republican leaders put the needs of powerful
lobbyists ahead of the average family and their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, for their part, charged that the issue advocacy
restrictions would particularly disadvantage conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan legislation approved by the House was pitted
against three rival bills and 10 amendments.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first signs that Shays and Meehan would prevail came when
they handily defeated a series of amendments that they had called
``poison pills'' designed to splinter their ranks and weaken their
legislation. Among the defeated amendments were ones to raise
contribution limits and to exempt from regulation advertisements on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The House, however, did pass, several amendments, including one
that was all about the New York Senate race. Sponsored by Rep. John
Sweeney, R-N.Y., with Mrs. Clinton in mind, it would require ``a
candidate for election for federal office (other than a candidate
who holds federal office)'' to reimburse the government for federal
transportation used for campaign purposes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sweeney said his measure ``remedies an unfair advantage.'' But
Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., called the measure ``a mean-spirited
petty politically charged amendment.'' Democratic leaders said the
amendment would never become law and that they did not consider it
significant enough for their party to withdraw their support from
the overall bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday night also defeated three rival campaign
finance measures that could have been used to trump the bipartisan
legislation. One would have eliminated all federal contributions
limits, eliminated public financing of campaigns and required
immediate disclosure of contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Another would have banned soft money donations to the national
political parties but not to the state parties. A third proposal
would have strengthened the powers of the Federal Election
Commission. Shays and Meehan were fighting it on grounds that its
passage and would supersede and thus kill their own measure.

MILLIONS FLEE COASTS OF FLORIDA TO VIRGINIA 

</HEADLINE>

and TERRY KLIEWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Fla. _ Millions of people from Virginia to Florida
were ordered inland Tuesday as Hurricane Floyd, one of the
strongest and potentially most destructive storms to threaten the
United States in decades, bore down on the southeast Atlantic
coast.
</P>
<P>
   With winds pushing 140 mph and the storm a monstrous 600 miles
wide, authorities from the tip of the Florida peninsula to Cape
Charles, Va., urged coastal residents to evacuate. Clogged highways
and emptied towns up and down the seaboard indicated the warnings
were being heeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest evacuation that has ever been done in the
face of a hurricane,'' said Federal Emergency Management Agency
Director James Lee Witt. Estimates placed the number of people on
the move at 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   In both size and intensity, Floyd, a Category 4 hurricane, ranks
as one of the mightiest storms ever to threaten the coast of the
United States. Hurricane Andrew, which caused $25 billion in damage
and killed 40 people in South Florida in 1992, also was a Category
4 storm, but it was significantly smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters could not say with any certainty where or when Floyd
might make landfall, but computer models showed the storm running
parallel to the Florida coast Wednesday, with the eye a few miles
offshore, and a possible landfall later in the week in Georgia or
the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing parallels us, it could act like a weed-eater
going up the coast,'' Craig Fugate of the Florida Emergency
Operations Center told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   NASA meteorologists, wary of the threat to the space agency's
shuttle fleet parked in hangars at the coastal Kennedy Space
Center, predicted the eye of the storm would be 30 to 40 miles due
east of the center Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane-force winds extend up to 125 miles from the center of
the storm and tropical-storm-force winds reach out for at least 200
miles. A storm surge of 5-10 feet above normal tide was expected as
Floyd nears the Florida coast; higher levels could be expected if
it approaches the coasts of Georgia or South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the possibility of severe damage along the Florida
and Georgia shores, President Clinton ``declared an emergency
exists'' in those states and ordered federal aid ``to supplement
state and local recovery efforts,'' the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   And even before the storm hit, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Tuesday
requested $7 billion in federal disaster assistance for his state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was ending an overseas trip to New Zealand,
returned to Washington to ``oversee the federal response.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, preparations Tuesday concentrated on
evacuating people from the most vulnerable areas. Traffic slowed to
a crawl on Florida's major highways.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1.2 million coastal residents from Miami's northern
suburbs to Jacksonville vacated their homes and businesses. The
migration topped the previous high of 800,000 ordered during
Hurricane Elena in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are heeding the warning and moving out,'' said Janet
Dennis, a spokeswoman in the state's division of emergency
management in Tallahassee. ``Our highways are packed with folks
moving very slowly, but they are getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   The normal three-hour commute from Jacksonville to Tampa took
twice as long on Tuesday as rain began to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters favored a course that would bring the powerful storm
close to the central Florida shoreline before it curved toward
Georgia. But there was no guarantee the storm would not make
landfall in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general reaction from folks here who have dealt with a
number of hurricanes is that this is a particularly bad
situation,'' Dennis said. ``Whether it comes in or rolls up the
coast line, there will be awful damage. I can't really say which
will be worse or better.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, which looked Tuesday like it might be spared the
worst, people who had sought refuge in shelters began to drift
home, although a substantial number opted to remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going well in our shelters,'' Miami Mayor Alex
Penales said.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, authorities ordered 500,000 people to evacuate six
coastal counties. A similar order covered 800,000 people in South
Carolina, a week shy of the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Hugo's
destructive run there.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, residents were urged to evacuate outlying
islands on the Outer Banks, and Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of evacuees prompted the American Red Cross to open
163 shelters in the three states _ 64 in Florida, six in Georgia
and 93 in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to meet the needs of the evacuees and to
provide them with the care they need to ride out'' the storm, said
Dr. Bernadine Healy, president of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Healy said 70 emergency response vehicles have been deployed
from southeastern states to the Red Cross staging area in Atlanta.
Another 48 are on standby.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Healy, whose agency manages about half the nation's
blood supply, issued a plea for donors to replenish stocks that
normally decline after the Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will ensure that the Red Cross and other blood centers
have an adequate supply for hospitals should they receive an influx
of patients because of the hurricane,'' Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   In Savannah, Ga., officials ordered thousands of people to
evacuate the historic city. They expressed concern that the city,
with its antebellum mansions and mature oaks, would not fare well
from a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere along the Eastern Seaboard, the U.S. military began
moving ships, aircraft and personnel out of Floyd's path.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said more than 4,000
National Guardsmen were assigned to help with the evacuation and to
provide security for areas abandoned by residents.
</P>
<P>
   NASA could only hope for the best at the Kennedy Space Center,
where forecasters said the storm could pass 30 miles to the east
with winds in excess of 130 mph. The seaside launch pads, at nine
feet above sea level, could be threatened by the storm surge. The
space agency's four shuttles and international space station
components worth hundreds of millions of dollars were secured in
hangars vulnerable to Category 4 winds. Eighty personnel were
prepared to ride out the storm at Kennedy. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Disney World, for the first time in its 28-year history, shut
its doors Tuesday and will not reopen until Thursday.

LONG-TERM CARE GAMBLE
</HEADLINE>
 TERM CARE-AZR  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By RUSS WILES 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  PHOENIX - Pat and Rudy Dvorak have
seven adult children and, by their estimation, plenty of potential
caregivers in case they need help down the road. But the Mesa resi
dents don't want to have to rely on their kids for assistance, and
they've done something about it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both spouses purchased a long-term care insurance policy
designed to defray the costs for nursing care or other assistance.
The policies will pay up to $150 a day for up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Dvoraks opted for private insur ance because they don't want
to risk going on welfare _ that is, Medicaid _ and they don't wish
to become a family burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen how taking care of someone over the long haul
creates a bitter hate, a situation where the caregiver basically
wishes the person would die,'' said Pat, an accountant and tax
preparer. ``I don't want that to happen in my family.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sentiment shared by millions of Americans, but only a
fraction of them have purchased a long-term care policy.
</P>
<P>
   LTC coverage ranks as one of the least popular types of
mainstream insurance, accounting for just a 7 percent share of the
senior market, according to a new report from the Center for
Long-Term Care Financ ing in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Only one in 50 Americans owns a policy, even though every adult
is a potential buyer. Despite longer life expectancies, rising
health-care costs and more people moving into older age categories
_ factors that nor mally would spur demand _ sales of LTC coverage
have been sluggish, say the report's authors, Stephen Moses and
David Rosenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting paradox, as de mographers expect a sixfold
increase within the next half-century in the number of Americans 85
and over _ precisely the demographic group that needs the most
living assistance and runs up the highest health-care bills.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing-home care costs about $50,000 a year on average. In Ari
zona, some 27,400 individuals are served by the state's version of
Medicaid, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, and its
long-term care division.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Denial is one reason that a lot of people fail to consider LTC
coverage. ``Whenever you're talking about chronic illness or
disability, people don't think it will happen to them,'' said
Robert Davis, president of Long-Term Care Quote, an insurance
information center and brokerage in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the cost of cover age _ premiums can run
several thousands of dollars a year. ``Good-quality policies are
simply too expen sive,'' argues Joshua Wiener in a report prepared
by the Urban Insti tute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Chester McLaughlin, a Phoenix el der-law attorney, adds that
insurance just isn't an option for everyone. ``If you're receiving
$700 a month in Social Security, paying for long-term care
insurance is the last thing on your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And as with other forms of insur ance, there's no certainty that
you'll ever collect benefits. Some estimates suggest that seniors
face a 1-in-5 chance of staying in a nursing home more than a year,
and a 1-in-12 chance of remaining there at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   However, long-term care policies typically also cover assisted
living, at-home care and other services that don't require
institutionalization, which means you might receive benefits short
of having to enter a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that's helping to stifle demand for LTC insurance
is confu sion over Medicaid. These feder al/state programs pick up
the nursing-home tabs for the poor and for thousands of
middle-class seniors who have chosen to step through what critics
claim are eligibility loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective Medicaid patients face a ``pretty stringent''
medical evalua tion before they gain admission to a nursing home,
says Frank Lopez, a spokesman for AHCCCS. But he concedes that some
patients, usually with help from elder-law attorneys, have found
ways around the finan cial tests that _ on paper anyway _ require
them to deplete their assets before receiving public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   It's not especially difficult for middle-class people to qualify
for Medicaid, critics say. Although the programs are designed for
individu als with just $2,000 to their names _ plus a home,
personal property and other items _ the perceived loop holes
sometimes seem wide enough to drive a Sun City golf cart through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The often-quoted limit on assets of $2,000 is meaningless
because Medic aid recipients can also retain a home, business, car,
personal property and many other assets of practically unlimited
value,'' say Moses and Rosenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Popular techniques for exploiting Medicaid loopholes include the
pur chase of a costly home, car and other assets _ even a new
wedding ring. Such items are not counted for determining Medicaid
eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the spouse of a Medicaid-bound patient could transfer
money into investments that don't bear interest _ switching from,
say, mon ey-market funds into zero-coupon bonds. Plus, attorneys
can set up trusts to shelter assets, a Medic aid-bound person can
pay children for their help, and even a divorce can be used to
shield assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that most seniors qualify easily for Medicaid
nursing home benefits and almost anyone, regardless of income or
assets, can qualify quickly without spending down,'' say Moses and
Rosenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin counters that it's harder for middle-class people to
get on Medicaid than the critics claim. But he admits that Medicaid
patients typically don't enjoy as many op tions as people paying
their own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get as many choices with Medicaid because not all
nursing homes take it,'' he said. ``You won't get a private room
while on Medic aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also assert that the quality of care with Medicaid is an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Medicaid) has a dismal reputation for access, quality,
reimbursement, discrimination and institutional bias,'' say Moses
and Rosenfeld. Because it pays nursing homes less than the cost of
providing care, they contend, ``Medicaid recipients often face long
waiting lists even for inferior facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   When a person becomes a nurs ing-home candidate, he or she might
not be lucid. That raises the possi bility that heirs, who may have
a financial conflict of interest in want ing to salvage an
inheritance, could condone inferior services or, at least, fewer
choices via Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term care insurance should be viewed as a means to preserve
options and personal control, sup porters say. Those options may
involve home care and stays at assisted-living centers that may be
more generous than what's provided by Medicaid. Medicare, by
contrast, pays for skilled medical attention during short-term
recuperative stays, not chronic assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term care insurance isn't the only possible solution. You
could simply build up your own health fund by investing money that
you would have spent on premiums. Even a $3,000 annual stake,
earning a 9 percent yearly rate in the stock market for someone
starting at age 60, will compound to more than $150,000 by age 80.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that people who haven't yet accumulated a large
nest egg might have trouble finding the discipline or extra cash to
start saving at age 60 or so, to say nothing of the tolerance for
making risky investments at that age. And with nursing-home costs
already around $50,000 yearly and climbing faster than inflation, a
$150,000 nest egg might buy less than two years of assistance by
then.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution involves more wel fare. In criticizing
long-term care insurance as too costly, the Urban Institute instead
advocates the ex pansion of Medicaid and other taxpayer-supported
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of government fiscal restraints, that suggestion
seems un workable, especially with the pros pect of a huge number
of baby boomers starting to retire in about a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government health-care expansions are highly doubtful because
of inade quate financing sources,'' say Moses and Rosenfeld. ``The
best advice is to lock in at least some catastrophic coverage as
early as possible.'' Please note that this is the first of two
parts. Second part moves Sept. 21. Russ Wiles can be reached at

AS TALKS GO ON, UAW EXTENDS CONTRACTS PAST MIDNIGHT EXPIRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ind.)   (bl)

</P>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ As labor talks covering the nation's
400,000 auto workers continued past the midnight expiration of
current labor contracts, the United Automobile Workers union
granted contract extensions that allowed auto factories to keep
humming without interrupting this year's record auto sales.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, the union extended Ford Motor Co. contract for an
indefinite time. Then it extended its contract with General Motors
Corp. Finally, minutes before midnight, the union granted an
extension to DaimlerChrysler Corp., ration, the company closest to
reaching an agreement with the union.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't soon enough to stop wildcat strikes at
DaimlerChrysler, which came as the union continued to put pressure
on the company in the hours before the midnight deadline. In St.
Louis, 2,800 workers building highly profitable Dodge Ram pickups
walked off the job around 8:45 p.m., along with 4,400 workers
building the company's bread-and-butter minivans, according to
David Barnas, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman. An hour later in Kokomo,
Ind., about 8,400 workers building transmissions and auto parts
walked off the job. Components built in those factories are used by
some of the company's biggest money makers, its four-wheel drive
sport utility vehicles. It is unclear whether the morning shift
report to work at those factories.
</P>
<P>
   A deal is expected first at DaimlerChrysler and is likely to
call for raises of at least 3 percent annually for the next three
or four years, for increased pension benefits and for strengthened
job security measures for workers, according to labor and industry
executives. Union and company officials have refused to disclose
details of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW typically reaches a deal with one of the companies then
insists the other two accept similar terms.

LINDA RON STADT, EMMY LOU HARRIS MAKE MAGIC ON RECORD, ON STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY RODGERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When the owners of two of popular music's most
distinctive female voices decided to finally record an album
together, they wound up in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ronstadt has deep roots in Tucson, and she had little
trouble luring close friend Emmylou Harris away from Nashville for
a five-week stay at the historic Arizona Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Transforming the library of one of the larger buildings at the
inn into a recording studio, the pair soaked up the atmosphere of
Tucson's oldest resort and crafted a magical album, Western Wall:
The Tucson Sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Inn is one of the last vestiges of what Tucson was
when I was a child growing up,'' said Ronstadt in a recent call
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually stayed in the house that was built by the owner of
the inn ... (the part) that she built for herself, which is now
part of the inn which they rent out. It's a lovely house with seven
bedrooms and two stories and a nice library, which is where we
wound up singing.''
</P>
<P>
   While road veteran Harris and the session musicians stayed at
the central Tucson resort in September 1998, Ronstadt _ who is
raising her two adopted children in the city _ commuted from her
nearby home.
</P>
<P>
   The inn's homey surroundings had a calming effect on both
artists, who have recorded scores of albums since the late '60s _
many in traditional studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about being in a house (to record),'' Harris
said in a call, also from New York. ``There's something about the
`living room thing' that everybody talks about.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronstadt enjoyed curling up in the 1930 inn's library between
takes ``because they have a lot of good books, and I always read
when I'm recording.''
</P>
<P>
   In their remarkable recording careers and away from the studio,
Ronstadt and Harris have been studies in both parallel and
contrast.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to possessing striking voices and physical
presences, both helped blaze the trail for today's Sheryl Crows and
Sarah McLachlans by leading bands in the male-dominated music
industry of the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Ronstadt and Harris have refused to be pigeonholed into musical
niches, instead challenging themselves with forays into new
territories.
</P>
<P>
   Their strong musical personalities helped forge a deep
friendship in the early '70s, when Ronstadt was recording wildly
popular rock albums and Harris was growing her country roots with
Gram Parsons and, later, her Hot Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to develop that sort of comrade thing that
happens when people are experiencing something that is (done by) a
relatively small part of the population,'' Harris recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't a whole lot of female singers going out there
and fronting bands. ... There's more now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think we're a strange breed in the fact that for the
most part we're interpreters in a kind of world of
singer-songwriters. And so we have a real appreciation for the song
and for finding songs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two have developed starkly different approaches to
performing and touring as their careers progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pair's current tour to support Western Wall,
Ronstadt declares, ``I've basically quit performing. I didn't
announce it particularly _ I just decided I didn't want to do it
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising her children, ages 5 and 8, is clearly Ronstadt's
priority:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I just stay home, and I'm a mom. And I love it. It's
harder work than anything I ever did before, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel that there's just no room for negotiating here.
This is what I have to do. I don't think you can leave children and
have them turn out OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, meanwhile, has developed a passion for performing and
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love performing, I love singing for people. I'd like to say
it's not an ego thing ... but just the process of connecting to
people with those songs. And, of course, I've always had fantastic
bands, and I love being around these people and hearing what they
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said her friend realized they'd need to tour in support
of Western Wall: ``She (Ronstadt) understands that you have to give
the record company a fighting chance and loves the fact it would be
the two of us together, and it would be fun _ that it's not just
being out there all on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   On their current concert tour, the two are performing the entire
album, as well as some hits from their Grammy-winning solo careers.
</P>
<P>
   Western Wall features an eclectic mix of songs by artists such
as Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen, Sinead O'Connor and Leonard
Cohen. Harris had a hand in writing three of the tracks, including
the offbeat single Sweet Spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to do a project together before we recorded the
last Trio record (with Dolly Parton) _ that was about six years
ago,'' Ronstadt recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmy had started out sending tapes to me and we started
talking about material. ... At some point, we decided to call Dolly
to see if she wanted to guest with us, and she said let's do
another Trio record.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that was the last thing that postponed our duet record. ...
So we waited until now, and then, oddly enough, as we started
planning this record, it became possible for the Trio record to
come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally said it's now or never _ we can't wait for the
planets to line up ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, Ronstadt caught the flu and was hit by
laryngitis as the Tucson sessions got under way. Many of her vocals
were added late in the process, while Harris relished the chance to
do most of her singing live with four talented session musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Ronstadt _ who has ventured far from her country-rock roots to
explore Spanish music, Nelson Riddle-arranged standards and
operetta with Pirates of Penzance _ unexpectedly returned to her
early sound with the toe-tapping new number He Was Mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to craft a vocal that I hadn't used ... in years. I was
really surprised that it came in, but it did. It's something that I
kind of knew instinctively _ I think it's just from listening to so
many Merle Haggard records.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who charted new territory in 1995 with her complex
Wrecking Ball album, enjoyed creating a ``left-footed, slightly
twisted'' album with Ronstadt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Spot is one of the oddest songs I've ever recorded _ and
I wrote it, with Jill (Cunniff of Luscious Jackson). But the whole
thing that Jill brought to it was so different than where I'm
coming from musically and rhythmically.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she enjoyed being close to home for the Western Wall
sessions, Ronstadt, 53, sounds disheartened when she talks about
her native state and the desert she loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heartbreaking thing for me because, of course, the
developers have come in and just destroyed it. It's an area that
should never have a high population because it's desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very beautiful. As soon as you mow it down and put up
those horrible tinkertoy houses that they build. ... All they're
doing is building slums, because those houses are going to degrade
so fast in the desert.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronstadt adds, ``They're building in such a way that prevents
community. I live right in the middle of town. I didn't buy into
that suburban thing, never have. And there still is a community in
the center of town if we can just hold out against the City
Council, which is trying to put a freeway through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Municipal government in Tucson is just mind-bendingly
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, Ronstadt is bent on making sure that her children
don't grow up stupid. She has banned television and computers from
her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television and computers are destroying nuclear families,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even like to let them (children) go and see movies. I
think that the media has such an extraordinary influence. Children
are very impressionable, and I think we're developing a whole
generation of borderline personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody should take their televisions out and break
them. It's not enough to turn them off.''
</P>
<P>
   She later lightens up, laughing: ``They'll (her kids) probably
grow up to be ax murderers, but I don't have a television in my
house and they still get too much (at other people's homes).''
</P>
<P>
   For Harris, 52, a major concern is what she calls a loss of
originality on modern country radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that it's a shame, considering how much great
music there is out there, that the country format has become so
homogenized to the point that there's hardly anything recognizable
from where it started.
</P>
<P>
   ``And music should not stay the same. ... But certainly if you
have people like Gillian Welch and Lucinda Williams and Steve Earle
_ and even the Trio didn't get any airplay or very little.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil Young could be played on country radio _ Bruce
Springsteen, not to mention a lot of the younger artists that are
coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I always believe there's hope ... and you're not going to
stop the creative spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   As Harris looks ahead to a new solo album and Ronstadt prepares
to produce a record spotlighting glass instruments from the past
three centuries, their listeners no doubt hope that Western Wall
was not a once-in-a-lifetime experience. &QL;

YANKEES, DOWN BY 5, COME BACK TO BEAT TORONTO, 10-6 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The grieving began in the Yankees' dugout in the
seventh inning Tuesday night, after Toronto assumed a 6-1 lead.
Looks like another loss, some of them thought. There were glances
at the one-sided Boston result on the scoreboard. Looks as if the
Red Sox will gain another game in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few appreciative comments when Ricky Ledee made a
scrappy base-running play in the eighth inning. Way to hustle,
Ricky, with the rest unspoken: Way to hustle when we're getting
killed. But then Chuck Knoblauch walked and Derek Jeter singled and
soon the Yankees were back to believing anything is possible for
them, even the seemingly impossible. Bernie Williams capped the
five-run rally in the eighth with a game-tying grand slam, and Paul
O'Neill ripped a grand slam the very next inning and the Yankees
won, 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   That broke the Yankees' four-game losing streak and maintained
their three-and-a-half-game lead in the American League East;
Boston defeated Cleveland, 12-3.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Yankees tried playing down the significance of the
victory; no one feigned professional indifference.
</P>
<P>
   In two innings, the Yankees reversed their slide. And Williams
and O'Neill _ perhaps the team's most important hitters _ helping
to reverse their recent slumping ways as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the midst of a free fall,'' said David Cone, who
started and threw well for six innings, without run support. ``And
it was getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre called it ``the biggest win'' of the year,
``and you look at the smallest reason.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about Ledee's hustle. The left fielder was on
first with one out in the eighth when Chili Davis bounced to second
baseman Homer Bush for what appeared to be an inning-ending double
play. Bush fielded the ball and intended to tag Ledee, but Ledee
stopped and retreated. Bush charged and Ledee dropped flat to the
turf; Bush swiped a tag at Ledee, missed and threw to first,
figuring the Blue Jays would have a play on Ledee at second. Carlos
Delgado, the Toronto first baseman, took the throw to retire Davis
_ two outs _ and fired to second for a tag play on Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   But Ledee dived safely into second, barely, keeping the inning
alive. No one on the field thought this would lead to anything.
Toronto had a five-run lead, Roy Halladay was pitching a great game
for the Blue Jays, the Yankees were beginning to look to Wednesday
to end their losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch battled Halladay, seven pitches, before drawing a
walk. Jeter singled through the middle, Ledee scoring, and the
Yankees _ who in recent days have been wallowing in their own
self-defeating frustration _ began to stir in their dugout. Jim
Fregosi, the Toronto manager, sensed this as well, and called on
Graeme Lloyd to pitch to O'Neill. Cone and Allen Watson watched on
television in the Yankees' clubhouse, each still consumed with
their unsuccessful appearances in the game, trading sob stories.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder, batting .201 against
left-handers, fought Lloyd, worked to put the ball in play, and
chopped a high bouncer in front of home plate. For an instant,
there was confusion between Lloyd and catcher Darrin Fletcher as to
who would make the play, and Fletcher stepped forward _ and dropped
the ball. Bases loaded, tying run coming to the plate. Lloyd was
out, and the hard-throwing Billy Koch was coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Williams stood in the on-deck circle, watching Koch warm up.
Williams had just one home run in his last 26 games, and he had
been feeling awful, as if he had let down his teammates. Koch threw
a fastball out of the strike zone, ball one. Williams stepped out
and concentrated: Koch had to throw a strike. Mariano Rivera
watched from the bullpen and said aloud: ``Come on, Bernie, he's
got to come to you. Hit it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch threw the fastball Williams expected, and Williams crushed
it, knowing instantly his slump was over, the ball sailing beyond
the wall in right field, a grand slam. Tie game. Cone and Watson
were yelling in the Yankees' clubhouse, the relievers were trading
high-fives in the bullpen. Tie score.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Bellinger ran hard on a ground ball to open the ninth
inning and reached first when Tony Fernandez threw high, and then
Bellinger took second on a passed ball. With one out, Knoblauch
rolled a ball toward the middle and beat the throw to first, with
one last burst at the bag. First and third and one out.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter drew a walk, loading the bases. Paul Spoljaric relieved
Koch, who immediately began screaming at the plate umpire, Laz
Diaz, angry about his interpretation of the strike zone, and Diaz
charged Koch; the two had to be separated. The Blue Jays were
coming apart, as the Yankees were coming together.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill had two homers in 135 at-bats against left-handed
pitchers this year. He wanted to put the ball in play, to deliver
the go-ahead run. Spoljaric threw him a breaking ball, O'Neill
turned on it, and immediately dropped his head as he moved to first
base. This is what O'Neill does when he knows he has hit a home
run.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Jeter jumped around happily. Other Yankees stepped out
of the dugout, screaming and clapping. Cone and Watson were yelling
again, and so were the relievers.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes to break out of a slump, Torre said before the
game, is one hit, one infield dribbler. Or, in the case of Williams
and O'Neill Tuesday night, in the case of the Yankees, a seemingly
meaningless bit of grit and a couple of grand slams.

ACROSS THE COUNTRY, FLOYD COULD WREACK HAVOC WITH BOEING BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The gusts from Hurricane Floyd are threatening to
reach across the country to disrupt Boeing's satellite business and
some of its other aerospace work.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane, already potentially one of the worst storms in a
century to hit U.S. shores, could wreak havoc at NASA's Kennedy
Space Center in Florida. That center is home to hundreds of Boeing
workers, three satellite launch pads and much of the work on the
International Space Station, which Boeing oversees as the prime
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   As Hurricane Floyd loomed off the coast Tuesday federal workers
strove to protect those assets, lashing down the launch structures
and the vehicles in them, sandbagging buildings and boarding-up
windows. If the hurricane tears through those protections the U.S.
government will likely pay the biggest price.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the government, not Boeing or other aerospace
firms, owns the vast majority of the facilities at the Kennedy
Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are optimistic,'' said Dwayne Brown, a spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ``If this thing hits
with the severity that some are predicting, we could be in some
serious trouble,''
</P>
<P>
   The greater threat to Boeing _ now that the company has
evacuated most of its employees _ is the potential the storm holds
to disrupt certain business operations, such as satellite launches.
The company already has postponed the launch of a Global
Positioning Satellite thanks to the hurricane, according to Walt
Rice, a Boeing spokesman on satellite issues, based in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Delta facilities at the Cape are at risk,'' Rice said.
``It is a threat to all facilities at the Cape.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA was forced to leave a Boeing-built Delta II Rocket, which
was scheduled to carry the GPS satellite into orbit later this
month, lashed to its launch pad. The Air Force owns the rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't launch then we lose the revenue from that
business,'' said Rice. ``The entire space industry will be affected
the same way. We've all halted launch preparations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the federal government has the most at stake. The Kennedy
Space Center is home to a host of high-priced space projects. For
example, four space shuttle orbiters, each worth between $1 billion
and $2 billion, are based at the center, according to NASA. The
orbiters aren't insured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be cheaper actually to ask Congress to appropriate
funds to build new ones than to have insurance policies on them,''
said NASA's Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Center is also home to much of the massive
International Space Station. As the private company overseeing the
project, Boeing has an interest in what happens to it during the
storm . But, the U.S. government and its foreign partners own the
assets in jeopardy, not Boeing, and thus they bear the biggest
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They build it. We own it,'' said NASA's Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's space assets are exposed at Cape
Canaveral _ at least in terms of most storms. Buildings at the
space compound are designed to withstand hurricane-force winds. The
problem is the facilities aren't designed to cope with the top
gusts that some are predicting Floyd will generate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one of the space shuttle assembly buildings can
withstand 125-mile-per-hour winds, while certain other facilities
can weather 105-mile-per-hour winds, NASA says. The problem is
Floyd's gusts have already reached more than 140 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NASA officials said it's possible the structures are
actually stronger than their official specifications.
</P>
<P>
   As the hurricane lashed through the Bahamas Tuesday, NASA
officials said they were taking every possible step to protect the
billions of dollars of federal space assets located in central
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   For example, NASA shipped 11 solid rocket booster segments used
on the space shuttle to Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also shipped out most of its workers, evacuating
13,000 employees. The move left between 80 and 120 volunteers to
man the center during the storm, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The folks have done everything possible,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   However, public and private officials said their concerns went
beyond the technology and infrastructure of the U.S. space program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a national asset,'' said Rice.
</P>
<P>

THIRD OF STATE IS MINORITY, CENSUS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   minority, the Census Bureau estimates in a report that depicts
the United States as an increasingly multiracial, multiethnic
society.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Hispanic population has grown by half since 1990,
surpassing 1 million in 1998, according to data being released
today. More than half the Hispanic growth occurred in Maricopa
County.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of the state's Black population was almost as fast, 47
percent, bringing Arizona's total to more than 169,000.
</P>
<P>
   And underscoring the rapid urbanization of Native Americans, who
make up the state's second-largest minority group, the Indian
population of Maricopa County last year ranked second in the
nation, just a few percentage points below that of Los Angeles
County.
</P>
<P>
   More than one in five of the state's 256,183 American Indians
now live in Maricopa County.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of Asians ranks them as the state's smallest
minority group, they are nearing a population of 100,000 statewide,
two-thirds of which is centered in Maricopa County.
</P>
<P>
   In percentage terms, Asians are the fastest-growing minority in
both the state (a 68.3 percent increase since 1990) and county
(75.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   With Arizona's total of more than 1.56 million minorities
statewide, ramifications span a broad array of social, political
and economic fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make all citizens of Arizona aware of the positive
implications of this emerging diversity,'' said Jesus Trevino,
founding director of the 2-year-old Intergroup Relations Center at
Arizona State University in Tempe. The center brings people of
different backgrounds together to interact and learn more about one
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old way was to look at it as a problem. But we can use it
as an asset,'' Trevino said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more this population has success, the more the state of
Arizona will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's minority concentration could well bring heightened
political clout to racial and ethnic groups, but the sheer numbers
are unlikely to translate rapidly into economic power, said Marvin
Perry, president of the Black Board of Directors Project in
Phoenix, which promotes diversity on corporate boards of directors
and policymaking bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``How well they participate in politics, not just in voting but
taking part at higher levels, should bring a heightened awareness
(of minorities),'' he said. ``But on the economic front, it will be
something a little bit more dicey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see them controlling major businesses in the near
future, but there probably will be an increase in minorities rising
to upper levels of corporate responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the minority population passed the 75 million mark
in 1998, meaning that more than one in four people is a minority.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities have increased at more than six times the rate of
non-Hispanic Whites, and the Census Bureau projects that by 2015,
the nation will reach the level at which Arizona finds itself
today: one-third minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an instructor in the College of Education, I think this
clearly has implications for teacher preparation,'' Trevino said.
Teachers must be given skills ``to work with students who are
different from them,'' he said. &QL; 
Ralph Romero, who administers federal grants for the state
Department of Education, pointed out that Arizona schools are
especially challenged because growth is stemming not just from
in-state residents and newcomers from other states, but from
foreign immigration as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are limited English-proficient students with special
requirements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The economic stability of the minority population is crucial to
the well-being of the state, several sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally those at lower income levels are at risk of failing
in school,'' Romero said. ``That's not to say that a Hispanic or
any other minority has any less of a capability to learn _ all have
the same capacity to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Leland Leonard, executive director of the Phoenix Indian Center,
said economic factors play the biggest role in bringing Indians to
the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of jobs on the reservations, contrasted with the booming
urban economy, has led to Maricopa County's gaining Indian
residents faster than either of the state's principal Indian
territories, Apache and Navajo counties.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nation's 10 counties with the highest Indian populations,
five are in Arizona. An estimated 54,415 Native Americans were
Maricopa County residents in 1998, making up 2 percent of the
county's population.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County, with 552,181 Hispanics, ranks ninth among U.S.
counties with the largest Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   Just under one in five Maricopa County residents, or 19.8
percent, is Hispanic. Statewide, the proportion of Hispanics is
22.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For other minority groups, data show:
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, including Hispanic Blacks, total 169,191 or 3.6 percent
of the state. In Maricopa County, the number is 116,937, or 4.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Asians total 98,214, or 2.1 percent of the state. The county's
67,242 Asians make up 2.4 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Whites, including Hispanic Whites, total 4,145,043, or 88.8
percent of the state, and 2,545,481 or 91.4 percent of the county. &QL;

PALMEIRO DELIVERS IN NINTH FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Minnesota Twins chose their poison and learned
that a dose of designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro can be lethal no
matter the percentages.
</P>
<P>
   Twins manager Tom Kelly elected to pitch to Palmeiro instead of
catcher Ivan Rodriguez with the game on the line in the top of the
ninth inning, and the left-handed hitter delivered a two-out,
two-run double to propel the Rangers to a 5-4 victory last night at
The Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing about our lineup,'' said manager Johnny
Oates, whose Rangers moved 6 1/2 games in front of second-place
Oakland in the American League West. ``Do you want to get shot? Do
you want to get stabbed? Do you want to get run over by a truck? Do
you want to get run over by a freight train?''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins opted for a '99 Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers appeared destined for a 4-3 loss. Twins right-hander
Hector Carrasco retired all six batters faced in the seventh and
eighth innings, but a leadoff walk to shortstop Royce Clayton set
the wheels in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly responded by summoning left-hander Eddie Guardado from the
bullpen for center fielder Tom Goodwin, the Rangers'
left-handed-hitting center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin advanced Clayton into scoring position with a sacrifice
bunt, but second baseman Mark McLemore _ who entered last night's
game hitting .141 (13-for-92) against left-handers this season _
hit a routine fly ball to right field for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly played the percentages from that point with right-hander
Mike Trombley available and warm in the bullpen. Kelly chose to
walk catcher Ivan Rodriguez intentionally with first base open and
let Guardado pitch to Palmeiro with the game on the line and the
winning run on first base instead of allowing Trombley pitch to
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is hitting .273 (6-for-22) against Trombley during his
career, with three doubles and one home run in his past 10 at-bats
against him. Palmeiro entered last night's game hitting .158
(3-for-19) with four strikeouts against Guardado.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics supported Kelly's decision, but the move
backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I throw out all the percentages and all the matchups,'' said
Palmeiro, who drove Guardado's 1-0 pitch off the wall in
right-center field. ``I just take it personally. It's the right
decision for them, but I get pumped up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro entered last night's game leading the major leagues
with a .380 batting average with men on base, and he provided his
club-record 19th game-winning run batted in this season.
</P>
<P>
   Those statistics suggest that Palmeiro can reach deep within and
find another gear when the occasion calls for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I do,'' he said. ``For some reason, I'm able to block
everything out, and everything seems to happen in slow motion for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Danny Kolb (2-1) earned the victory by retiring one
batter in relief, and closer John Wetteland recorded his
club-record 42nd save with a scoreless ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers _ who have won all 11 games from the Twins
this season _ will enter this afternoon's game with an opportunity
for their first-ever sweep of a season series.

   SACKLER-ASSESS (Washington) _ When the Smithsonian Institution
announced this month that a trove of Chinese art amassed over
nearly 60 years by an American collector, Dr. Paul Singer
(1904-1997), had been given to the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery here,
the details were rather staggering. It amounts to more than 5,000
objects, with a value estimated at $60 million, though, in fact, an
item-by-item assessment of the material is only just beginning. The
gift more than doubles the existing collection of the Sackler
Gallery, which was established in 1987 and constitutes, with the
neighboring Freer Gallery, the national museum of Asian art in the
United States. And in a stroke it transforms the Freer and the
Sackler into the largest repository for Chinese archaeological
material in North America. By Holland Cotter.

LETT OUT 8 GAMES FOR COWBOYS; CORYATT WON'T PLAY IN '99
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys will be without Leon Lett for eight
games, the penalty the NFL handed down yesterday for the Pro Bowl
defensive tackle violating the league's substance-abuse policy
again.
</P>
<P>
   Also, linebacker Quentin Coryatt, signed as a free agent in
April, will not play for the Cowboys this season. The former Texas
A&AMP;M star informed team officials yesterday that he has decided to
sit out this season because of chronic Achilles tendinitis and a
shoulder injury that required reconstructive surgery in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This double dose of bad news for the Cowboys defense came two
days after it allowed 504 yards and 35 points to the Washington
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Lett, serving his third drug suspension in five seasons, is
eligible to play Nov. 14 against Green Bay. Lett, who is suspended
without pay, may return to practice Nov. 9, but until then, he
cannot associate with coaches or engage in any activities with
players at the Cowboys Valley Ranch training complex.
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Lett would draw a one-year
suspension if he violates the substance-abuse policy again.
</P>
<P>
   Lett has been on ``indefinite suspension'' since March after
violating terms of the league's substance-abuse policy. According
to a source, he did so at the Pro Bowl or in the days immediately
after the Feb. 7 game in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Lett is in Phase 3 of the NFL drug program, which requires him
to be tested three times a week, 52 weeks a year. This time, Lett's
violation required NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue to determine the
length of the suspension. After Lett's previous two violations, he
received a preset four-game suspension in 1995 and a preset
one-year suspension over the 1996 and 1997 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said
yesterday. ``I respect the commissioner's decision. I understand
the amount of deliberation involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue had said he would decide on Lett's suspension ``before
the first game of the season.'' Jones said he understood the change
in the time frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason why the commissioner took the amount of
time that he did is that this decision sets a standard for how he
wants to handle `indefinite suspensions' in the future,'' Jones
said. ``The program is progressive punishment, and I believe it was
a concern of the commissioner to follow a one-year suspension with
a lesser suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cowboys officials privately say that, except for his
February slip, Lett continues to follow the guidelines of his
aftercare treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon does not have a dependency or an addiction; I know
that,'' Jones said. ``That's why I continue to give him the benefit
of the doubt and not just continue wanting him on the team. I'm
familiar with all facts and aspects \Rof Lett's case\S, and I'm
just disappointed \Rwith the length of suspension\S. But I do
believe that if you have responsibility, you have to pay the price.
Leon has done that. We're all big boys ... Now we have to move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-minute phone call Monday, Jones tried a last-ditch
effort to influence, or at least inform, Tagliabue of Lett's
progress. But apparently there was no changing Tagliabue's mind
over what came down yesterday as the official two words: eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from Tagliabue was sent to Lett at his Dallas address
by registered mail yesterday. Lett chose not to appeal the latest
suspension. He could not be reached to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you this: Leon certainly regrets what has
happened,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said: ``Both \RLett and Coryatt\S are
good players, but I'm excited about the guys we have here. If and
when Leon is back, then we'll be excited about him, too. Mentally,
I was prepared for \RLett to be gone\S one season, one week. ... I
was prepared for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt, 29, had not practiced since the first week of training
camp. He was signed in April after being released in August 1998 by
Indianapolis, where he played for six seasons. He was the No. 2
pick overall in the 1992 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the Cowboys received a roster exemption from the
NFL. Coryatt was put on the ``exempt, left squad list.'' He has
told Jones that he is willing to return his $1 million signing
bonus, which could be an indication he will retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the money with Quentin,'' Jones said. ``If it
was, I'd have a different approach to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will now put him on the ``retired list'' or waive
him at Coryatt's request or put him on ``reserve, left squad,''
which would keep him from playing for any NFL team this season.

WAKE-UP CALL SENT TO LETT, COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leon Lett was slapped with an eight-week wake-up call yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   For his sake, let's hope he doesn't snore through it.
</P>
<P>
   According to Owner Jones, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue wanted
to set a precedent for any future five-time violators of the
league's substance abuse policy. Tagliabue's message is a clear
one:
</P>
<P>
   Don't be a Leon.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as the Cowboys defense was concerned, the
commissioner could have been flagged for piling on. Add the news of
the Lett suspension atop the announcement that injury-riddled
linebacker Quentin Coryatt will not play this season, both coming
in the after wash of Sunday's 504-yard flogging in Washington, and
it has not been a bonny week for the Cowboys defenders.
</P>
<P>
   We knew they weren't going to be the bedrock of this Cowboys
team. We just didn't expect them to be a doormat.
</P>
<P>
   It would be rude to Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson to rank
what happened as one of the Cowboys' worst defensive performances
in the past eight seasons. Starting his first game for head coach
Norv Turner, Johnson threw for 382 yards, two touchdowns and was
never intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   He was rarely touched and only infrequently compelled to
scramble. Two of his best targets, Michael Westbrook and Albert
Connell, combined for nine catches and 296 yards, though the former
has been labeled as one of former GM Charley Casserly's drafting
mistakes and the latter has been shopped in possible trades.
</P>
<P>
   Lett might have helped. More accurately, he couldn't have hurt.
At least he could have been a stronger body to throw against the
109 rushing yards that Washington's Stephen Davis chugged for.
</P>
<P>
   But by now, the Cowboys defense knows the drill. Over the past
four seasons, Lett will have missed the equivalent of a full
season-and-a-half.
</P>
<P>
   In that same time, the Cowboys are a palpably ordinary 28-24
with only one victory in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   At what point does Owner Jones finally admit that Leon Lett
hurts this team, not helps it?
</P>
<P>
   He may have hurt it the most on last NFL Draft Day. For reasons
still unclear, Jones seemed convinced that Lett's latest suspension
would amount to no more than a wrist slap.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys never got a chance to pick defensive tackle Anthony
McFarland, snatched by Tampa Bay five picks in front of them. But
for some reason, they passed on every other true defensive tackle
for the remainder of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, we now see things like the grand experiment of moving
Alonzo Spellman inside for the first time in his NFL defensive line
career. The coaches pulled the plug on that midway in Sunday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Myers, meanwhile, was supposed to be the Cowboys' steal
of the 1998 draft. He has started only one regular-season game in
two seasons and didn't even suit up in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Without Lett, we also have come to realize what a mediocre
talent that tackle-mate Chad Hennings is.
</P>
<P>
   If a team can't consistently stop the run or pressure the
passer, it had better be prepared to score 41 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   With Lett gone and Deion Sanders still nursing The Mother of All
Toe Injuries, the only consistent playmaker on defense is safety
Darren Woodson. But there we go, pining for Leon again.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the Lett case has said that Leon's latest
indiscretion came at the Pro Bowl, which is coldly ironic in that
Lett's inconsistent play didn't merit a Pro Bowl trip in the first
place. It also brings up the curious question of why the NFL would
test for drugs at the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sad story, and yesterday was just another in a long list
of chapters. Jones reportedly tried on Monday to persuade the
commissioner to go lightly on his wayward defenseman. But Tagliabue
wanted to make five-time offender Leon an example.
</P>
<P>
   Five times Lett has violated the league's substance abuse
policy. So don't dump on the commissioner. The truly remarkable
thing about Lett's career is that through it all, he has remained
with the same team.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys stand by their man. Embarrassing, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Lett was injured in a preseason scrimmage. It should
have been a reminder to Owner Jones that Lett could vanish in a
blink. He had solid trade value in the summer of 1998, but the idea
was scoffed at because, as 20 or 30 emails rationalized to me,
``Leon is one of our best players.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider yesterday's announcement, therefore, a wakeup call, and
not just to Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Heard it?

BROWN, DODGERS BEATEN BY EXPOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Brown's right arm won't be what keeps him
from winning 20 games for the second time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. It appears the culprit will be the Los Angeles Dodgers'
offense. If you can call it that.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Brown had six remaining starts to win four games. He
since has allowed three earned runs in 17 innings _ and has two
losses to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Dodgers wasted another wonderful Brown outing by
getting one hit off Montreal right-hander Javier Vazquez in a 3-0
loss to the Expos at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez, who had a 6.43 ERA on the road this season, struck out
a career-high 10 batters in winning for the first time in four
starts. He walked one. Vazquez, 23, is 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   The lone hit he allowed was a clean single to left by Mark
Grudzielanek to lead off the fourth. The Dodgers hit three balls
out of the infield after that.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (16-8) yielded two earned runs and struck out six in his
fifth complete game of the season. He allowed nine hits, but for
the sixth start didn't walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   In his last start, Brown allowed one earned run and struck out
seven in eight innings against the Mets. The Dodgers lost 3-1. They
had two hits, but none after the fourth inning. Mets starter Orel
Hershiser retired the last 15 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   The only inning the Dodgers had a baserunner was the fourth.
Grudzielanek led off with the single, stole second with one out and
advanced to third on a passed ball. But, as is the Dodgers' habit,
the meat of the order left Grudzielanek there. Gary Sheffield
walked but Eric Karros popped out to second and Raul Mondesi
grounded out to third.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez retired the first nine batters he faced. The
fourth-inning interlude also gave a three-batter break to another
string of mediocrity and disinterest from the Dodgers hitters that
saw Vazquez sit down 17 straight batters.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the offense, Brown could be two wins away from 20, a
mark he hasn't reached since going 21-11 for the Texas Rangers in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the Expos game with a 6-1 record and 1.62 ERA in his
past 10 starts, and he was 8-2 with a 2.01 ERA in his last 14
starts at Chavez Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike some of his latest outings, Brown wasn't overpowering
or particularly dazzling against Montreal. He was, however, very
effective.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos took a 1-0 lead in the fourth when Peter Bergeron
singled to lead off. Bergeron, traded to Montreal along with Wilton
Guerrero and Ted Lilly for Carlos Perez last season, scored on Jose
Vidro's double to the fence in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bergeron who struck again in the sixth as the Expos went
ahead 2-0. Bergeron singled with one out and moved to second on
Brown's errant pickoff attempt. Vidro's single to center put
Bergeron on third and he scored on Vladimir Guerrero's
fielder's-choice groundout.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' defense didn't help Brown in the ninth when the
Expos extended their lead to 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero led off with a line drive to center fielder Devon
White, who broke in on the ball, only to have it carry over his
head for a triple. Brad Fullmer then singled to left to score
Guerrero.

FED POLICY UNDERMINES EFFORTS OF AMERICAN WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Are you overworked? Some who study America's work
habits say you are if you're an average working person.
</P>
<P>
   The concern initially surfaced in the early '90s, when a Harvard
professor focused on the phenomenon in a book titled The Overworked
American. The thesis was then viewed as a good-news-bad-news
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that our harder working ways would allow us to
catch up with the performance results of Japanese superworkers. The
bad news was the depressing prospect of our transformation into a
society of joyless toilers.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Juliet Schor's book was published, however, the
Japanese juggernaut hit the wall and never recovered. Meanwhile,
the U.S. economy has boomed throughout this decade. If the
expansion lasts until next February, it will become the longest
period of uninterrupted growth in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The price of this prosperity, though, has been longer hours with
the nose in close proximity to the grindstone, according to a
recent New York Times op-ed page article.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by the International Labor Organization, the article
noted, indicates that Americans have replaced the Japanese as the
superworkers of the world. American workers now put in 1,966 hours
of toil a year, which not only is 70 hours more than the Japanese,
the study noted, but also 350 more a year _ nearly nine 40-hour
weeks _ than their European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the study's validity, there is a certain irony at work
because the reward for all this effort is a Federal Reserve effort
to neutralize the resulting economic growth by tightening monetary
policy. The thinking at the central bank seems to be that all this
hard work is producing a dangerous prosperity that threatens
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, if there is one, is that workers are translating
their good fortune into enthusiastic personal consumption, which is
the primary fuel for economic growth. Their quest for financial
security also is driving much of the demand for equity investments,
thereby pushing the stock market to record highs and raising Fed
fears of a ``bubble'' on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what it's all about? If so, it's a cruel irony. In the
bad old days the underpaid and overworked proletariat got ground
into the dust with nothing to show for it except broken backs and
broken dreams. Nowadays, they share in the prosperity to a much
greater degree, but their ultimate reward is a regime that sees too
much prosperity as a curse rather than a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   American workers produce more value than any other on the
planet, and what do they get for the effort they expend to create
the highest standard of living in the world? They get a policy
rigged to undermine their efforts in the name of heading off an
inflationary threat that seems more phantom than real.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Schor says that if she were to write a sequel, she'd
call it The Even More Overworked American. Perhaps it would be
appropriate to insert the word ``underappreciated'' in there
someplace.
</P>
<P>
   If you're regretting not spending enough time with your family
while pondering such matters, here's something to keep in mind:
There's no known instance of anyone's dying words being, ``I wish
I'd spent more time at the office.''

NEVER have so many been so captivated by sheet metal.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happens when a race becomes a race _ the kind
that captivates fans and enthralls players. And that's what
happened Tuesday night at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   A scoreboard came to life. A piece of metal was the messenger.
</P>
<P>
   It was 8:37 p.m. _ the fifth inning at the Astrodome _ and the
Astros were slicing through another round of woeful Philadelphia
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Another double-digit, batting-practice kind of victory was on

the club record for consecutive wins, taking the streak to 12 with
Tuesday's 12-2 triumph.
</P>

   The real news was happening out behind left field, where the
heroes of the night _ guys named Scott Burford and Matt Johnson _
were gripping the hearts of 25,164 fans every time they reached for
a numbered slat of metal and slid it into the National League
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   When the box came open at 8:37 p.m., a gradual progression of
applause wafted across the Astrodome as a white ``2'' slid into the
Chicago Cubs' ninth-inning frame. The Cubs took a 4-1 lead over the
Cincinnati Reds with those two runs in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Some Astrodome fans stood and applauded as word spread, the
noise gradually getting louder and louder as fans pointed to the
outfield scoreboard. Astros players sitting on the bench noticed.
Players on the field, warming up for the inning to begin, noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught myself peeking out there a little more than usual,''
third baseman Ken Caminiti said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when a race becomes a race.
</P>
<P>
   With just 15 games remaining after this one and a 10-0 lead
against the Phillies on a school night, few fans left their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs cable when you have otherwise anonymous guys named
Burford and Johnson who can make your night or break your heart?
</P>
<P>
   This time things were looking good. What began as a three-game
Central Division edge over the Reds was looking to be four.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds had things well under control, even hitting a
two-run homer to help his cause. A six-run fourth had squished all
Phillies hopes.
</P>
<P>
   But then things started to look bad _ very bad _ and all too
familiar in this stretch run during which neither the Reds nor the
Astros have buckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating for them and frustrating for us,''
Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``Both teams have been
winning. But one team is not going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 8:48 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Burford and Johnson slid a yellow-colored ``2'' into the board,
this time in the Reds' ninth-inning box. The yellow meant the
inning was still alive. The Reds were down 4-3 but still batting.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd groaned. That's what happens when a race becomes a
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked up there and figured the Reds were going to come
back and beat them,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``That's
just the way it's been going.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell, who with Biggio was pulled
early from this laugher in order to get some rest, went up the
tunnel behind the Astros' dugout as the game was safely in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans can't bear to watch such dramatics. Bags couldn't bear
not to, sneaking into the Astros' clubhouse for a moment to watch
the Reds' final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when a race becomes a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting crazy,'' Bagwell said. ``There's 15 games to go _
that says it all right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 8:56 p.m., the ninth-inning scoreboard windows
opened again in left field. The final score was posted: Cubs 4,
Reds 3.
</P>
<P>
   A roar went up in the Astrodome. Caminiti looked over his
shoulder to the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, warming up for the sixth inning, didn't have to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the crowd and figured what it was,'' he said.
``Everybody gets into it when it's crunch time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what it became Tuesday night. When the Astros arrive at
the Dome tonight, there will be only 15 games remaining, and the
Reds will be four games back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four games is nothing,'' Biggio said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's better than three. And that's why even in a 10-run romp
you could feel the drama in the air _ and see it every time a metal
slat slid into place.

BOXER DIES, TWO DAYS AFTER BOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID BOYCE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Friends and family of Randie Carver had
held out hope since Sunday night that the Kansas City boxer somehow
would recover from an injury to the left side of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Through hours of bedside vigil at North Kansas City Hospital,
they prayed and sobbed and pleaded with Carver to fight his way
back from critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   So when the news came that Carver, 24, died at 10:30 a.m.
Tuesday _ apparently from injuries suffered in a supermiddleweight
title fight at Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel _ it was
the most devastating blow delivered all week.
</P>
<P>
   Carver's 23-year-old brother, Frankie, consoled another brother
who had broken down on his mother's shoulder. Barbara Carver, who
wore a T-shirt with the image of her son, sat with a friend outside
the hospital nearly four hours after he died, trying to come to
grips with the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and fellow boxers drifted in and out of the hospital all
day, many leaving in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my driving force,'' said Carver's trainer, George
Smith. ``I don't know what I'm going to do. He was my best
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at North Kansas City Hospital did not release the
cause of Carver's death.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Arnold, a neurosurgeon at the University of Kansas Medical
Center in Kansas City, Kan., who has treated sports-related head
injuries, said Carver's death most likely was caused by a blood
clot that formed after the boxer suffered blunt trauma to his head.
</P>
<P>
   Carver also could have suffered a tear in his brain, Arnold
said. A tear, particularly in his brain stem, also could lead to
death.
</P>
<P>
   When a boxer dies from injuries suffered in a fight, many
questions are asked. Should the bout have been stopped? Was Carver
healthy going into the bout? And above all, could his death have
been prevented?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this kid. I'd gladly trade places with him,'' promoter
Tony Holden said. ``I'm so numb, I'm not even comfortable defending
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Carver went into Sunday's fight against Kabary Salem as the
North America Boxing Federation supermiddleweight champion. He lost
in the 10th round of a scheduled 12-round fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a boxer walks up those four steps, anything can
happen,'' said Peyton Sher, a boxing matchmaker for 54 years. ``I
don't know if there is anyone to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Carver understood the risk. On Saturday afternoon, he
talked about the respect he had for anyone willing to box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of heart to get in the ring,'' Carver said.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime trainers such as LeRoy Green will never dispute that.
Green trained Carver for eight years as an amateur at the old Bell
Recreation Center in Kansas City, Kan. Sher knew Carver a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   Green and Sher watched the fight on television and noticed
something different about Carver right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look like Randie Carver from the first round on,''
Sher said.
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth round, in a brutal fight, Carver stopped moving
around. Holden and Smith attribute that to the numerous head butts
Carver received in the first three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You heard me yelling, `Stop the head butts,' '' Holden said.
``I think the one at the beginning of the fourth round really hurt
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Famed referee Richard Steele, who has worked 150 world title
fights, questioned how much damage a head butt could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, head butts cause cuts,'' said Steele, who
lives in Las Vegas. ``I don't think a head butt can cause brain
damage. Remember, the one who does the head butting is going to be
hurt also.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, Kansas City referee Danny Campbell looked
at tape of the fight. Campbell has refereed for 18 years and boxed
15 years before that.
</P>
<P>
   He said Salem did not head butt Carver enough even to be issued
a warning.
</P>
<P>
   By the fifth round, Campbell noticed Carver looked disoriented.
In the sixth round, when Salem barely pushed him, Carver fell
through the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he talked with Carver after each round.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said Carver looked exhausted in the eighth round.
Carver fell down once and was knocked down again on a light
straight left. In the ninth round, Carver could barely stand. And
in the 10th, when Salem actually missed on two punches, Carver fell
to the ground and could not return to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   As Carver rolled around, desperately trying to get up, it took
20 seconds before anyone reached him. Smith said professional
boxing rules prevented him from jumping into the ring before the
fight was officially stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Ross Strada said he thought Carver looked tired in the
late rounds but added that he couldn't stop the fight for that
reason. Ringside doctor Michael Poppa looked at Carver before the
10th round and declared him fit enough to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Steele said it was important for a referee to be neutral. Strada
has stated he considered Carver a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each referee who does a good job is not worried about who is
winning a fight,'' Steele said. ``When a kid is in trouble, you
can't have likes and dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a friend, you may think you are helping him but wind up
hurting him by letting the fight go too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Green and Campbell don't think what happened to Carver occurred
in the Salem bout but was an accumulation of seven bouts in the
last 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had tough fights back to back,'' Campbell said. ``I think
he's had too many rough fights.''
</P>
<P>
   It all started on Oct. 8, 1998, when Carver fought Mario
Iribarren to a tough 12-round draw. Carver's face was battered with
cuts around his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Carver then had two tune-up bouts before facing William ``Bo''
James at Harrah's on May 23. Carver won a 12-round decision to earn
the NABF supermiddleweight title. Again he left the ring with cuts
around the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Before facing Salem, Carver went eight rounds and won by
knockout on July 12 and returned to the ring on Aug. 8 for a
second-round knockout victory.
</P>
<P>
   Holden said that's a normal number of fights for a boxer. Still,
that's also a lot of potential for head trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any repetitive head trauma is dangerous,'' said Arnold.
``Boxers ought to have head gear the way bicycle riders and
football players have helmets.''

GAMING INDUSTRY STRIVES FOR MAINSTREAM ACCEPTANCE, PATRONAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ A photo of a man jogging along the picturesque
pathway in Kansas City's Richard L. Berkley Riverfront Park is
featured prominently in the American Gaming Association's first
Survey of Casino Entertainment, released Tuesday at the World
Gaming Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem like an odd image to associate with gambling,
but it bolsters the industry's argument that casino taxes make such
public improvements possible.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that the average casino gambler is most likely
a white-collar worker who has attended college and makes
better-than-average money.
</P>
<P>
   It also reinforces the industry's conclusion that the gambling
industry has become just another part of life in many states, where
it provided 325,000 casino jobs and paid more than $2.5 billion in
state and local taxes last year.
</P>
<P>
   More than 23,000 gaming professionals and others are in Las
Vegas this week for the industry's largest annual trade show,
sponsored in part by the association, which is the industry's trade
group and national lobbying arm.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, association President and Chief
Executive Frank J. Fahrenkopf said the survey of 54,000 U.S.
households also showed that ``the American public wants legalized
gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become part of the mainstream culture,'' he said.
``We've become part of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found overwhelming public support _ more than 80
percent _ for the notion that casinos and other gambling
enterprises must take an active role in discouraging compulsive
gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   The industry survey, however, did not examine deeply the
increasingly studied question of why people gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Findings from another recent national study, analyzed in the
current issue of Public Perspective magazine, suggest that fewer
Americans are gambling for fun in the 1990s and that in the last 20
years substantially more of them are engaging in wagering simply
because they hope to win money.
</P>
<P>
   The association's survey, conducted by national polling firms,
found that U.S. casino customers':
</P>
<P>
   - Median household income is $46,000, compared with the national
average of $39,000.
</P>
<P>
   - Education level includes at least some college for 54 percent,
compared with the national average of 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   - Employment is 45 percent white-collar, 27 percent blue-collar
and 13 percent retirees, which roughly approximates the national
breakdown. In 1998, someone from 29 percent of all U.S. households
visited a casino, and on average Americans visit a casino once
every two months.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found widespread acceptance of casino gambling as
adult entertainment, with only 25 percent of Americans agreeing
with the statement that ``casino gambling is morally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-two percent agreed with the statement that ``casino
gambling can be a fun night out.''
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis of other surveys, including two commissioned by
Congress in 1975 and last year, suggests that gambling is emerging
as a second vocation for some and as a get-rich-quick avocation for
others.
</P>
<P>
   The August-September issue of Public Perspective examined those
congressional studies and found that between 1975 and 1998 the
percentage of people who said they gambled to win money increased
from 44 percent to 66 percent, and the number who said they gambled
for the excitement or challenge of it dropped from 70 percent to 49
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that hard to believe,'' said Fahrenkopf, who had not
seen the analysis. ``That is just not supported by anything that I
have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenkopf also took issue with the methods of the 1998
congressional study, complaining that telephone survey findings
were mixed with random interviews of gamblers at U.S. casinos to
reach many of the conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   At the trade show this week, scores of the latest slot machines
and other player attractions are on display and for sale alongside
such mundane, back-of-the-house technology as cash- and
coin-counting machines and database software for casino managers.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities on hand range from retired Miami Dolphins head coach
Don Shula, who delivered Tuesday's inspirational opening address on
winning, to actress Barbara Eden and NASCAR superstar driver
Richard Petty, whose images grace this year's crop of new slot
machines from International Game Technology, the worldwide
industry's dominant game maker.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the stars of the show were Elvis Presley (or at least
his image) and Monopoly slots, now being played in many Missouri
casinos.

COWBOYS FANS SURE THAT TAGLIABUE HATES THE COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, you have spoken. You're divided on Leon Lett. You're not
divided on Paul Tagliabue. You have matters of concern about the
Cowboys. You're thinking big picture, one miracle finish down, 15
games to go, plenty of time to get in your shots.
\Nsubheds:FIRST SHOT This commish is the pits! He acts as though
he's on drugs. How long does it take to say ``no games'' or two or
even four? What a real jerk! Only a ``no-game'' suspension can save
his reputation, and then how about an apology and a resignation?
Randy Phillips Austin
\Nsubheds:BUCKSHOT Randy, sit down, take a deep breath. Because
Lett was just slapped with an eight-game suspension. On second
thought, you don't need to be hearing words like slapped.
\Nsubheds:SECOND SHOT I am a faithful S-T reader, but I am sick of
the newspaper space wasted on ``poor'' Leon Lett. He has proved for
the third time that he has no regard for an organization that has
made him a multimillionaire. If the rest of us peons who work for a
living fail one drug or alcohol test at work, we are fired. Period.
I truly hope this is the last word on the subject. It is mine. Good
luck, Leon ... and goodbye. Lee in Bedford
\Nsubheds:BUCKSHOT Oops, it looks like somebody just gave Lett
another paragraph. Goodbye.
\Nsubheds:THIRD SHOT I still disagree with having Michael Irvin on
the sideline with the game on the line. I think you need to have
your best receiver on the field at all times. I wonder if Chan is
using this as a tactic to light a fire under Michael? John Minor
\Nsubheds:BUCKSHOT Bottom line, it worked at Washington. Irvin was
fresh to make two late-game touchdown catches. Few words of
explanation were needed afterward, but then Chan Gailey's MO has
always been more like a Bic than a blow torch. \Nsubheds:FOURTH
SHOT Jerry Jones still has his work cut out for him. The ``Mona
Lisa'' restoration project needs a major overhaul on defense. The
Cowboys have the worst defensive line in the NFL. Leon Lett and
Chad Hennings couldn't bull rush an 80-year-old man! I'm not even
going to discuss the secondary. That pathetic unit speaks for
itself! Paul Patterson
\Nsubheds:BUCKSHOT At times Sunday, the Cowboys' D-line and
secondary did seem joined at the hip. In fact, maybe that was
problem.
\Nsubheds:FIFTH SHOT How can a team jump offside four times in 10
snaps with the opponent marching toward a tying touchdown? Redskins
coach Norv Turner claims Mark Stepnoski ``rolls the ball before he
snaps it,'' thus suckering three defensive linemen to jump. I'll
bet you anything that the same commissioner who came up with the
Erik Williams Rule (hands to the face) and the Emmitt Smith Rule
(no taking helmets off after a good play) will now come up with the
Stepnoski Rule (no rolling the ball before snapping it). All it
will take is a resurgence of the Cowboys to get the commish to put
a stop to it. I think Tagliabue is drafting up the new rule as we
speak! J. Terrell
\Nsubheds:BUCKSHOT Hey, J.T., all the Cowboys have done so far is
beat the Chokeskins. Doesn't exactly qualify as a resurgence.
\Nsubheds:SIXTH SHOT Lost in the hoopla about Troy Aikman's
comeback win and gaudy numbers were three INTs, two of them on very
bad throws into coverage. Brandon Noble/Nathan Davis looked like
the best pair of defensive tackles we had, especially ``no-size''
Noble. When did 285 pounds become small anyway? And where was Peppi
Zellner? Don Phillips
\Nsubheds:BUCKSHOT Look for Zellner to get face-time Monday night.
Noble isn't small, just short. Now those three Aikman INTs looked
real small after the game.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
This week, Reds outfielder Dmitri Young suggested if the Astros
were going to win a third straight National League Central title
they would have to play .900 ball the rest of September.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be careful what you wish for, Dmitri. With 19 days left in the
regular season, the Astros show no signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds pitched seven solid innings and hit his first
homer of the season and Ricky Gutierrez tied a career high with
four hits Tuesday night as the Astros extended their club-record
winning streak to 12 games with a 12-2 pounding of the Philadelphia
Phillies at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   After matching victories with second-place Cincinnati for much
of the past two weeks, the Astros finally were able to widen their
lead over the Reds, who lost to the Chicago Cubs 4-3 on Tuesday.
The Astros hold a four-game lead in the NL Central with 15 games
left and are a half-game behind Atlanta in the race for the best
record in the majors. It's also the Astros' largest lead since a
4{-game advantage June 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are 12-1 in September, their only loss coming on the
first day of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been crazy, 12 straight wins,'' Astros first baseman Jeff
Bagwell said. ``The Reds are getting a little bit frustrated.
Hopefully that's good for us. Maybe they'll start pressing a little
bit. Both teams are a little frustrated. We win 11 in a row and
gain a half-game. They win 10 out of 11 and lose a half-game. It's
nice to finally pick up a game. If we keep playing the way we're
playing, we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Astros could do no wrong _ and the Phillies could
do nothing right in dropping their 11th game in a row, matching
their longest losing streak since 1997. Philadelphia has lost 18 of
its last 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds kept the Phillies off the scoreboard for five innings,
and the Phillies' pitching staff threw extended batting practice
that allowed the Astros to build a 10-run lead after four innings.
</P>
<P>
   In six games with the Phillies this season, the Astros have
outscored them 52-18. The Astros are averaging 7.4 runs per game
during their winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the race intensifies,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said of the expected down-to-the-wire finish with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (16-11) turned in his third straight strong start,
allowing two runs and six hits over seven innings. He retired 10 of
the first 11 batters he faced, including eight in a row. He is 2-0
with a 1.27 ERA in three September starts.
</P>
<P>
   The righthander also helped his cause with a two-run homer in
the second inning, his first in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God August is over. Me and August have never gotten
along,'' Reynolds said of his 1-4 record and 4.17 ERA last month.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Astros scored, and 10 had at least one hit. Reynolds,
Daryle Ward, Carl Everett and Lance Berkman each had two RBIs. Bill
Spiers added a pair of singles, and Bagwell reached base safely in
all three of his plate appearances (two walks and a hit-by-pitch).
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez continued his tear with his second four-hit game in
the past week. He is batting .600 (12-for-20) during this six-game
homestand, which concludes tonight against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   By the fifth inning, Dierker elected to rest many of his
every-day players.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies starter Paul Byrd (14-9) allowed seven runs and eight
hits in three-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 3-0 lead in the second on an RBI double to
left by Gutierrez and a two-run homer by Reynolds, his third career
homer and first since Sept. 8, 1996. Reynolds leads all
major-league pitchers this season with 14 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Everett had an RBI double in the third inning to give him 100
for the season, the first time in his career he has reached the
century mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros broke open the game with a six-run fourth. Craig
Biggio singled in a run, Spiers hit an RBI single off reliever
Billy Brewer, Everett had an RBI grounder, Ken Caminiti had an RBI
double, and Ward hit a two-run single. The Astros had six hits and
sent nine batters to the plate in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about the Phillies that brings out the big
inning in the Astros, who have scored nine, five and six runs
(twice) in an inning against Philadelphia this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We executed well,'' Biggio said. ``Shane pitched a good game
and helped his own cause with a two-run homer. The little things
turned out to be the big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia got on the scoreboard in the sixth inning when Doug
Glanville led off with a triple and Ron Gant followed with an RBI
single to left field. Pinch hitter Wendell Magee singled in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman drove in the Astros' final two runs with a double in the
seventh inning.

PEREZ LOOKING TO HAVE A WINTER OF CONTENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Of all the things that contributed to Carlos
Perez's abysmal season _ to count them all would take the next few
days _ he goes back to something that never took place.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was embroiled in contract negotiations, Perez didn't
pitch last winter. He's not going to make the same mistake again.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said Tuesday he will pitch this winter in his native
Dominican Republic and will return to the pitcher he was before
this season. The left-hander also said he will return to the Los
Angeles Dodgers' starting rotation next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be better next year,'' Perez said. ``What a year. It's
bad. As soon as the season is over I'm just going to forget about
it. Your whole career, you're not going to go through it and not
have a bad year. This is my bad year. I'll be back next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad? OK, but disgusting, revolting, grotesque or nauseating are
apt descriptions, too. After all, when you sign a three-year, $15.5
million contract during the offseason, you're expected to win more
than two games.
</P>
<P>
   There were some people who thought Perez would have a better
season than teammate Ismael Valdes. But Perez, on the 60-day
disabled list after getting hit in the right leg with a line drive
in his last Triple-A outing, was brutal from his first start.
</P>
<P>
   He frustrated the club by going 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA before
being banished to Albuquerque. He infuriated Dodgers officials when
he missed a start in Montreal after mysteriously injuring his knee
the night before.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez, who was 33-35 with a 3.71 ERA in his first three
seasons, said it could have been different had in pitched in winter
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really hurt,'' Perez said. ``That was a mistake not to
pitch then. But I had to sign my contract. I didn't want to get
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for Perez to return home Thursday (as long as
Hurricane Floyd cooperates) and return to the states in a week. He
will continue his rehab in Arizona with the Dodgers' instructional
club before pitching in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go through the winter working hard and be ready for next
season,'' Perez said. ``When you pitch there, it sets up everything
going to spring training. Your arm is in better shape.''
</P>
<P>
   If Perez doesn't pitch well in spring, the Dodgers have the
option of sending him to Albuquerque next season.
</P>
<P>
   Exclusive club: For everything that's gone wrong for Raul
Mondesi this season, the Dodgers' right fielder is just one homer
and one stolen base from becoming the first 30-30 player in the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi stole two bases in Monday's win against Montreal to
reach the precipice of one of baseball's most exclusive clubs. He's
the only Dodger to hit 30 homers and steal 30 bases in a season. He
did it in 1997, when he hit a career-high 30 homers (which he tied
last season) and stole a career-best 32 bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's who he is,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``Steal bases, hit the ball all over, throw people out, get his
uniform dirty. I'd like to see him locked into that mode.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Johnson said he'll bypass rookie Eric Gagne's next
scheduled start in Colorado. Instead, Valdes with pitch Friday
followed by Chan Ho Park and Kevin Brown.... For the second
consecutive game Eric Young didn't start at second base. Craig
Counsell got the call a night after Alex Cora started.

<P>
   MERRITT ISLAND, Fla. _ After days of worry and preparation, with
much of the state's eastern coast boarded up and deserted, people
here in Florida braced Tuesday for an encounter with monstrous
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   But, even as the hurricane's outer bands began to buffet the
state's east-central barrier islands after dark, forecasters said
the eye of the storm might only skirt the Florida coast before
turning north to threaten Georgia and the Carolinas. Late Tuesday
night, the National Hurricane Center predicted landfall in
Wilmington, N.C., early Thursday and extended warnings to the North
Carolina-Virginia line.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the gusting winds brought occasionally heavy rains
through the evening as the storm neared the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said that, as they had cautiously forecast, Floyd
seemed to be turning more to the north, good news for Florida,
where more than a million people evacuated the east coast over the
past two days, but posing an ominous threat farther to the north.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, more than half a million people were on the move as
authorities ordered the evacuation of Savannah and low-lying
counties. In South Carolina, 800,000 people were ordered to leave
coastal areas, and even North Carolina declared a state of
emergency and urged residents of outlying islands to seek shelter.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the storm, a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to
140 mph and one classification lower that the strongest storms,
does not come ashore, meteorologists predicted that the state would
face hurricane-force winds strong enough to blow roofs off houses,
fell walls and topple trees.
</P>
<P>
   Max Mayfield, the deputy director of the National Hurricane
Center in Miami, said Tuesday night that the storm had weakened,
but warned against making too much of that. ``It's the difference
between being hit by a semi and being hit by a freight train,''
Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, President Clinton on Tuesday issued an
unusual pre-emptive declaration of disaster for the state, even
before the first palm tree had been pushed down.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, James Witt, the federal official in charge of the
storm relief efforts, said Tuesday night that the exodus of
residents from the coastal areas was one of the largest evacuations
ever conducted in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Clinton had declared Florida and Georgia disaster
areas even before the storm reached land, Witt said, ``The massive
evacuation is almost a disaster in itself,'' with its needs of
shelter, food and medical care for the thousands of people who left
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, warned that the northward jaunt of the storm probably came
too late to spare the east-central coast from what is still a
dangerous storm. One meteorologist predicted a ``weed-eater
effect'' as winds churn up the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd howled through the Bahamas Tuesday, knocking out power,
wrecking boats, knocking down trees and damaging houses, but damage
was not as bad as expected, according to e-mails from residents
there.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, more than 1 million people evacuated the east coast
on Monday and Tuesday, and as of Tuesday evening thousands were
still stranded in unmoving traffic on a variety of interstates and
toll roads. Interstate 4, Toll Road 528, U.S. 1 and other routes
were more like parking lots much of the day, as people fled inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to get the hell out,'' said Stephen Collins, who lives on
Merritt Island, between Cape Canaveral and Cocoa Beach, as he
gassed up his car at a convenience store on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the store's manager, A.K. Patel, put up hurricane
shutters and prepared to leave. ``I've got two kids,'' he said.
``We're scared.''
</P>
<P>
   In Charleston, S.C., where memories remain vivid from Hurricane
Hugo, which devastated the South Carolina low country 10 years ago,
a mandatory evacuation turned into an unthinkable traffic debacle
as state officials waited until late Tuesday evening to open the
eastbound lane of Interstate 26 to westbound traffic. Although the
evacuation order came at midday, police did not reverse the
eastbound lane on the primary westbound escape route until after 10
p.m., leaving tens of thousands of cars at a standstill for hours.
</P>
<P>
   All along the central Florida coast, waves were already chewing
into the beaches and washing over sea walls, but as dark fell the
worst of the storm was still miles off shore.
</P>
<P>
   Most people were long gone, and towns up and down the beach were
quiet and boarded-up. A few people made last-minute runs to the few
open stores for essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Rich is staying. After boarding up her own windows in
Melbourne, she made a trip to the store for provisions: a case of
Corona beer, a 12-pack of Pepsi and a carton of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how long we're going to be trapped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just highway traffic that snarled here. Floyd closed
most of the state's airports, leaving passengers stranded and
upsetting flight schedules around the country.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   State officials said that decisions made as early as Monday to
evacuate coastal areas were wise ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local governments did the right thing by asking for
evacuations early enough,'' said Gov. Jeb Bush. ``Floridians have
responded in the proper way.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 1 million people ordered to evacuate their homes
in coastal Florida, hundreds of thousands spent the night inland
wherever they could find a bed. The more fortunate, and more
wealthy, filled hotel rooms in Orlando and other inland cities, and
some drove as far the west coast, to Naples, Fort Myers and the
Tampa Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands filled high school gymnasiums, auditoriums and
churches, spending a miserable night on the floor or in folding
chairs. In Belle Glade, about 40 miles west of Palm Beach, more
than 500 people packed the auditorium of Glades Central High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all by myself with my four kids, and I was scared,''
said Pearlie Hill, 33, who abandoned her mobile home in this mostly
poor farming community for the stronger walls of the school. ``We
had no safe place to be. We all learned in school about the 1928
hurricane, so hurricanes scare us around these parts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, a hurricane crashed through Palm Beach County, flooded
the farm towns around Lake Okeechobee and killed nearly 2,000
people, most of them poor farm workers. Some 1,000 were buried in a
mass grave in a cemetery in Canal Point.
</P>
<P>
   Missoura Philpart, 49, brought her family of eight to the
shelter. ``My grandmama had to climb to the top of her roof when
that hurricane hit in 1928,'' she said. ``I was raised to fear
hurricanes.''
</P>
<P>
   To the east in Palm Beach County on Tuesday, the usually busy
Federal Highway was mostly quiet as the sun set and Floyd, finally,
began to blow into the state. The strip malls, their storefronts
covered over with plywood, were almost empty of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Loony, a mail carrier, tried to keep his Postal Service
jeep from being blown off the road by wind gusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're the only ones who had to work today,''
Loony said, before moving on with his baskets of mail, a real-life
example of that old slogan about neither rain nor sleet nor dark of
night. He did not seem pleased.
</P>
<P>
   But others were looking ahead for the possible consequences and
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, said that the cost of caring for the evacuated
people was going to be very great regardless of damage to the
coastal areas. One example he gave was the cost of calling up 2,000
members of the South Carolina National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   There were other costs that ordinarily do not come to mind, he
said, giving as an example warnings that he received from Southern
governors that ``they're right in the middle of harvesting cotton,
and it could have a devastating effect.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Boca Raton, as in other parts of Florida, the time for
preparation was past, and people hoped the forecasters' prediction
that the worst of the storm would go north of them, was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, it looked as if that was exactly what had
happened, and people here were grateful that lashing rain and winds
of 70 mph were the worst they saw of Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, I had this awful pit in my stomach,'' said Charles
Miehz, a retiree who lives in Boca Raton. As he, and many others
here, had watched the massive storm creep across his television
screen, it seemed as if it would swallow the whole state. But, as
the worst of the storm passed farther north, he finally took a safe
breath.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same in Miami, where Tiffany Zadi, a student at the
University of Miami, stayed up late at her parents' house in Cutler
Ridge, praying that the storm would pass Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Thank God,''' said Miss Zadi, who, along with her
parents, rode out Hurricane Andrew in their Cutler Ridge home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricane Andrew was a nightmare,'' she said. And Floyd seemed
so much bigger, so much more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane warning that went into effect Monday night in
Miami was lifted late Tuesday afternoon, allowing people to leave
emergency shelters and return to their homes. Mayor Alex Penelas
announced late Tuesday that schools and government offices would
reopen Wednesday, and that city services would resume normal
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, the best preparation they could think of was to
go for a swim. On Miami Beach's South Beach, a half-dozen hardy
souls dove into the waves at midday, while dozens of other braved a
hazy, gritty wind to watch them. John Tedesco, who lives in Miami
Beach, had already been there twice for nighttime swims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a little bit of fear you're going to get pulled
out,'' he said. ``You got to know your limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Becker, Tedesco's girlfriend, knew hers. She stayed on
shore, watching him like a sailor's wife perched in the widow's
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's nuts, I tell you,'' she said. ``He likes the rush of it.
And my heart stops.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Juan Andrada stood and took it all in.
Bare-chested and with a leathery tan, he was almost meditative as
he beheld the ocean. For 30 years, he worked as a steward on cruise
ships, including the Queen Elizabeth II. He was happy just to watch
what he knew could be a wicked, unforgiving sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always an attraction to the sea,'' he said. ``I can
see what people don't know. I have respect for the sea. I'm not
going in it. I know the force of the sea. Other people don't. There
is wind and water. That is electricity. For me, this is a great
miracle.''

FRESNO STATE, UCLA PLANNING A REUNION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Call it the Fresno Connection or the Fresno Farm
System, but there's no doubt UCLA has closer ties to Fresno State
than any team on its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The ties start at the top. Bulldogs coach Pat Hill played for
UCLA coach Bob Toledo at Cal State-Riverside in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA running backs coach Kelly Skipper was an honorable-mention
All-American tailback at Fresno State in 1988. He was a graduate
assistant for two seasons, then a full-time assistant for seven
before joining Toledo's staff last year.
</P>
<P>
   Skipper's brother, Tim, is the Bulldogs' starting middle
linebacker. He was a first-team All-Western Athletic Conference
selection last year as a sophomore. He has 21 tackles in two games
this season.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA defensive tackles coach Jethro Franklin was a two-time
All-American (1986-87) at Fresno State who sacked Bruins
quarterback Troy Aikman four times in a 1987 game at the Rose Bowl.
Franklin was a Bulldogs assistant for eight years, then joined
Toledo's staff this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bruins cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. is a Fresno
native who attended Edison High. He has several friends and former
teammates on the Bulldogs' roster.
</P>
<P>
   The connections should help UCLA prepare for Saturday's 7 p.m.
game at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to attack their schemes, and Jethro knows the defense
and Kelly knows the offense,'' Toledo said. ``You also attack
personnel, and we know it better than normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Origins of the platoon: Just as Toledo's talent-less years at
Pacific (1979-82) are the source of his recruiting zest, so too was
an Oregon experience the reason he platooned Drew Bennett and Cory
Paus for two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to get stuck without a (backup) quarterback,''
he said. ``When I was (offensive coordinator) at Oregon in 1988, we
were 6-1 when Bill Musgrave got hurt. We didn't win another game
after that. We didn't have a backup quarterback who could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer update: Receiver Danny Farmer will play this week despite
tweaking his sprained left ankle. However, Farmer is not at top
speed and hasn't regained his rhythm; he even dropped a touchdown
pass at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ankle isn't going to be healthy all year, and that's a
concern,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Showing promise: Reserve left tackle Bryce Bohlander, a true
freshman, will play 20 to 25 snaps each game unless injuries
dictate otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a heck of a player,'' Toledo said. ``It's shame he has to
play, but it may help him in the long run. He's very athletic, and
he's stronger than we thought he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting his kicks: Walk-on kicker Chris Griffith has made 3 of 3
field goals (33, 35 and 37 yards), and that's a pleasant surprise
for the Bruins considering the state of the kicking game when
training camp began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's improved tremendously over the last year,'' Toledo said.
``He was a walk-on and didn't have a strong leg. But he lifted
weights and got stronger. I'm very impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perturbed about parking placards: Toledo on the media's response
to the disabled parking scandal:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to me what (the media) are trying to do to our
program. What are they trying to prove? Why don't they let it die?
The kids have been punished. They've suffered severely. To bring it
up again and again is absolutely absurd.''

FOR USC, RESPECTABILITY MEANS BEATING UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Questions may linger about just how good USC is
after beating lowly Hawaii, but offensive lineman Travis Claridge
doesn't think skeptics will get any more answers from Saturday's
opponent, San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Claridge doesn't expect the Trojans to silence doubters
until the end of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to have questions about the team until we
beat UCLA,'' Claridge said. ``No matter who we beat. No matter what
the score is. People will have questions until the end of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   USC is a 20{-point favorite against San Diego State, meaning the
Trojans will probably gain little national respect even if they win
by a large margin. But Claridge is not looking past the Aztecs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they'll still be a good test,'' Claridge said.
``They've got a good defensive line.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie out: Sophomore tailback Malaefou MacKenzie will miss
the San Diego State game after straining his hamstring Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just bad luck,' MacKenzie said. ``I did it on the last
play of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie was bothered by a sore hamstring during training camp,
in part because of stress he placed on the leg while trying to
recover from a season-ending knee injury that caused him to miss 12
games last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is he is in jeopardy of reinjuring the hamstring
and needs a week off,'' Hackett said. ``I'm not going to feel the
pressure of putting him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   With MacKenzie out, Frank Strong and Sultan McCullough become
USC's short-yardage tailbacks. That could be interesting because
Strong has two fumbles in only six carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to take care of the problem,'' Hackett said. ``I'd like
to tell you a coach can do something, or you can buy a machine. If
he has another fumble, my patience will wear thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawley gets the start: San Diego State will make a quarterback
change and start Jack Hawley of L.A. Harbor College instead of
Brian Russell against the Trojans. Hawley completed 9 of 19 passes
for 86 yards in a 38-10 loss to Illinois, while Russell completed 8
of 21 passes for 93 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Papadakis gets extra year: Tailback Petros Papadakis, who
suffered a broken foot in training camp, said he has been granted
an extra year by the NCAA and will complete his eligibility next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker shuffle: There's been more movement with the reserve
linebackers, and it's becoming harder and harder to keep track of
who plays what position.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Aaron Graham has switched from No.2 middle linebacker
to No.2 weakside linebacker behind Markus Steele. Freshman Troy
Polamalu has gone from No.2 weakside linebacker to No.2 strongside
linebacker behind Sultan Abdul-Malik.
</P>
<P>
   And sophomore Henry Wallace, who was moved to weakside
linebacker just three weeks ago, is back at middle linebacker
behind Zeke Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheed returns: Defensive end Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed will
play this week after serving a one-game suspension for academic
problems. Abdul-Shaheed will split time with Matt Childers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried about losing my spot,'' Abdul-Shaheed said.
``We're in a rotation. As long as I have an opportunity to compete
that's all that matters.''

   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ It was blustery and wet Tuesday when the
Mariners left their hotel for Tropicana Field. Nobody was sure if
that was Florida being Florida, or if Hurricane Floyd was
approaching the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm's on everyone's mind, and everyone in their right
mind is going to think that way,'' left-hander Jamie Moyer said

   There were occasional high winds inside the dome Tuesday night,
and Moyer caused a lot of them. He struck out seven while pitching
his third complete game in seven starts, allowing a double, six
singles and a walk. The Devil Rays' only run was unearned, and
Moyer lowered his earned run average to a season-best 3.83 while
improving his record to 14-6.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr.'s two-run homer in the third inning, his
American League-leading 45th, gave Moyer all the runs he needed. It
was Griffey's third homer this year off Devil Rays starter Rolando
Arrojo, against whom he is 6-for-10 in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't pitch that bad,'' Griffey said. ``What did he give
up, four or five hits while he was in? (Four.) He just gave up one
low one and that was it. Other than that, he was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo was fine, but Moyer was brilliant _ and he finished with
a flourish.
</P>
<P>
   After getting Jose Guillen looking on an inside fastball, Moyer
fanned Aaron Ledesma with an outside changeup, 74 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners came out to congratulate Moyer, and Ledesma,
frustrated and baffled, flung his bat across the AstroTurf. It
skidded and landed by the first base coach's box.
</P>
<P>
   That's how hitters can react when Moyer is on.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ball's got a lot of movement; it's all over the place,''
said Ledesma, who was 0-for-4. ``It's tough to get a good swing on
a guy like that. He picks around the plate, and he's got some good
defense behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   The one run Moyer allowed came in the third inning. A single, a
stolen base and a throwing error by catcher Tom Lampkin put a
runner on third with two outs, and brought up the dangerous Jose
Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin rose for an intentional walk, and Moyer fired ball one.
In the M's dugout, manager Lou Piniella was confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where in the hell that intentional walk came
from,'' Piniella said. ``It didn't come from me. ... I've never
seen that in 30 years. I don't want to see it again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my fault,'' Moyer said. ``I probably overthought a
little bit too much. It wasn't that I didn't want to face him, it
was a matter of trying to be smart about it. Lou came out and said,
`What do you want to do?' I said it didn't really matter either
way, so let's face him.''
</P>
<P>
   On a 3-and-1 pitch, Canseco hit a bouncer between third and
short that never left the infield but went for a run-scoring
single. Moyer held the Rays to two singles the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching is location,'' said Lampkin, who doubled and scored
in the fourth. ``If that isn't evident by the way he pitches, I
don't know any better way to explain it. But he's the epitome of
`pitching-is-location.' Yeah, he's got a great changeup and a great
sinker, curveball and cutter. But he wins because of location, not
his pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Moyer is winning frequently. He is 6-1 with a 2.01
ERA in the second half, and has worked at least six innings in all
11 of his starts. Only once in those games has he allowed more than
three earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   That's a consistency few American League pitchers can match. To
Moyer, who started the year 1-4, it's about time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of bothered that I didn't have that consistency in
the first half,'' said Moyer, who had struggled by trying to be
more of a power pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to make a negative out of a positive, but I'm showing
myself today,'' he said. ``Not that I doubted that I could do it,
but it kind of bothers me that it's taken me so long to get into a
steady feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's victory followed the Mariners' four-game sweep by the
Baltimore Orioles, and came when the club was without its top two
setup relievers. Jose Paniagua has a mild groin strain, and Tom
Davey has minor tightness in his forearm.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners needed innings from their starter, and Moyer
provided.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of the series, Moyer presumably will count the
hours until the team's charter leaves for Seattle Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's play two more,'' he said, ``and get the heck out of
here.''

MORE UCLA PLAYERS ISSUE PLEAS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Four current and former UCLA football players
pleaded no contest Tuesday to illegally possessing handicapped
parking placards, but Chicago Bears quarterback Cade McNown's
attorney said the former Bruins star was injured and deserved the
special permit.
</P>
<P>
   McNown and four others were charged Monday as the embarrassing
scandal has spread to include 19 current or former UCLA football
players. Two more could be charged, said Deputy City Attorney Brian
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation found that handicapped parking violations have
been a widespread problem at UCLA and might have included NBA
players who work out at the school during the summer, Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been going on at UCLA for such a long time that it's
hard to pinpoint one person who's been initiating this,'' he said
following the arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a problem on campus. Now they're aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the City Attorney's Office was not pursuing any
cases beyond those involving the football players because the
investigation was limited to those with current placards.
</P>
<P>
   The use of parking placards came to light in January after a
campus officer noticed a car with an improperly placed placard and
questioned the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The five players charged this week, including McNown and
Washington Redskins running back Brian ``Skip'' Hicks, did not
appear Wednesday before Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Sam Ohta.
Their attorneys did not enter pleas, and Ohta set a Sept. 30
arraignment for the five.
</P>
<P>
   McNown and Eric Whitfield, 21, of Carson, were charged for
illegal possession of the placard and for using a doctor's name
without permission on the application given to the state Department
of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Oladele Ayanbadejo, 23, of Aptos, and Larry Atkins, 24, of
Kansas City, as well as Hicks, were charged with the illegal
possession offense and for using signatures of nonexistent
physicians on the DMV forms.
</P>
<P>
   McNown's attorney, Ronald Safer, contended that the NFL rookie
was injured in winter 1997 when he obtained the handicapped parking
placard. Safer said McNown was not aware of prosecutors'
allegations that the DMV form included the signature of a doctor
who did not give her permission and said McNown was never a
patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is disappointed in the system that he is charged with this
matter,'' Safer said. ``It deeply troubles him. He had led an
exemplary life.''
</P>
<P>
   Safer acknowledged that McNown was well enough to participate in
spring practice in 1998 while possessing the placard. But he said
McNown never used the placard to park in a handicapped spot and
understands the outcry within the disabled community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a sensitive and caring person. That's the kind of person
we're talking about,'' Safer said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said prosecutors stand behind their charges. ``We
looked at these cases long and hard before we filed. We believe we
can prove this case. There's no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The four who pleaded no contest through their attorneys Tuesday
were convicted on one count each of illegal possession of a
handicapped parking placard. In exchange for the plea, the City
Attorney's Office dropped the charge of using signatures of
nonexistent physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Those four are James Ghezzi, 22, of Mar Vista; Mark Reynosa, 20,
of Sylmar; Duval Hicks, 23, of Sherman Oaks; and Durell Price, 21,
of Newhall.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Craig Walendy, 21, of Westlake, was continued
to Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Ohta sentenced the four to the same penalties the judge gave
nine other current or former Bruin football players who pleaded no
contest to the same charge in July: fines and court costs totaling
$1,485 and 200 hours community service, with 100 devoted to working
with children in the Special Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Those nine are Ali Azziz, 22, of Sherman Oaks; Robert Thomas,
18, of Imperial; Damian Allen, 21, of Van Nuys; Marques Anderson,
20, of Long Beach; Oscar Cabrera, 21, of Highland Park; Ryan Nece,
20, of Palms; Ryan Roques, 21, of Mar Vista; Anthony White, 20, of
Sherman Oaks; and Deatra Clinton, 21, of West Covina. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

DAVIS MAY BE DONE AFTER BREAKING BIG TOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Mariners third baseman Russ Davis could
miss the rest of the season after X-rays before Tuesday's game
revealed a fracture of his left big toe.
</P>
<P>
   Davis fouled a pitch off the toe in his second at-bat in
Baltimore Monday night. He homered in his next at-bat and played
the whole game, but had X-rays as a precaution and the results
confirmed the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll play again,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
``Maybe he will, but it would be right at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis will have the toe re-examined in 10 days, and said he
hopes to play in the season's final week. He was surprised at the
extent of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm able to walk around, and everything looks normal,'' said
Davis, who is hitting .245 with a career-high 21 homers. ``Just
playing a game at 100 percent and doing things up on my toes,
pushing off in the field with my weight on my toes, it's pretty
painful. But I never expected to have a crack in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella plans to give Charles Gipson an extended look at third
base as long as Davis is out. Gipson, who could fit in nicely as a
utility player, will play winter ball in Puerto Rico after the
season to work on his hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ABBOTT SKIPPED: Right-hander Paul Abbott will miss Wednesday
night's scheduled start in Tampa Bay with a groin injury suffered
Friday in Baltimore. Ken Cloude, who won his only start since being
recalled from Class AAA Tacoma Aug. 30, will pitch instead.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott was lifted after seven innings and just 96 pitches in his
last start, and the M's went on to lose a 4-3 lead and the game.
This is the first injury this season for Abbott, who has a history
of physical problems and has had groin injuries off and on for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I absolutely had to pitch, I could,'' Abbott said. ``But
why put it in a situation where it might worsen it? It's hard to
miss a start, but it isn't my arm. It's just a strain that's going
to happen in the course of a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott will throw two bullpen sessions and get treatment before
his next start, which would fall next Monday against Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH FOR THE WINTER: Nearly a quarter of the Mariners' 40-man
roster will take part in winter ball this offseason. Besides
Gipson, pitchers Ken Cloude, Brett Hinchliffe, Sean Spencer and
Eric Weaver will play in Puerto Rico; outfielder Ozzie Timmons and
pitchers Ryan Franklin and Cam Smith will play in Venezuela; and
left-hander Jordan Zimmerman will pitch in the Arizona Fall League.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Raul Ibanez also may play winter ball, and though the
club would like to get infielder Carlos Guillen some at-bats _ if
only as a designated hitter _ in Venezuela, he still is recovering
from an April knee injury and has not been cleared to return.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Freddy Garcia (Venezuela) and Jose Paniagua (Dominican
Republic), who normally play in their respective home countries,
will rest this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Winter ball had one casualty for the M's last year, when Abbott
tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee covering
first base in Puerto Rico. But even sitting-on-the-couch winters
can be dangerous: early-'80s infielder Jamie Allen once hurt his
groin getting up off a couch.
</P>
<P>
   LINEUP SHUFFLE: The M's have used shortstop Alex Rodriguez as
their No. 4 hitter and Edgar Martinez in the No. 5 spot since the
end of July, but Piniella altered the lineup Tuesday. Rodriguez
returned to the No. 2 hole, in front of Ken Griffey Jr., and
Martinez moved to cleanup. Catcher Tom Lampkin batted fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to change it around, see if we can get on track
offensively a little bit,'' Piniella said. ``We haven't hit the
ball real well, so we'll shake things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Star break, playing their home games at
pitcher-friendly Safeco Field and with fewer veteran hitters, the
Mariners have batted .254 with 70 home runs. They hit .284 with 151
homers in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA BASES: The New York Mets acquired minor league pitcher
Justin Dunning from the Mariners to complete the June 18 trade that
sent pitcher Allen Watson to Seattle for Mac Suzuki. Dunning had a
4-4 record with a 5.61 ERA and two saves this season for Seattle's
Class A Wisconsin club. ... The Mariners' game with Anaheim on
Sat., Sept. 25, will start at 6:05 p.m. ... Piniella, on his belief
that the Mariners never would have developed pitching had they
stayed in the Kingdome: ``It's like trying to develop altar boys in
a pool hall _ it just doesn't mix.'' ... Griffey had some fun with
the Devil Rays' mascot, named Raymond, who carried a bull's eye
around his neck and taunted Griffey playfully from the roof of a
center field restaurant. Griffey obliged by throwing three balls at
Raymond, hitting him in the ankle once. The skit was dubbed
``Tiffey With Griffey!'' on the scoreboard. ... Tuesday was the
12th anniversary of Martinez's first career hit, a triple off
Cleveland's Reggie Ritter. Just 12 of Martinez's other 1,540 hits
have been triples.

NFL CRIES OUT FOR QB TO FILL ELWAY'S CLEATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Did anyone notice how freaked John Elway appeared
during the Monday Night Football game in which his former team
looked nothing like the two-time defending Super Bowl champs?
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying Denver's new quarterback, Brian Griese, tore
down everything Elway built during his
47-come-from-behind-victories reign. The kid was admirable.
</P>
<P>
   And no one is saying the Broncos are in the tank the way the
Bulls died the minute Michael Jordan packed up his patent leather
sneakers and took to the golf course and started those
long-distance telephone relationships with his cartoon friends.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing Elway in street clothes, unable to run the two-minute
offense and make things happen, was a serious dose of reality for
anyone whose ideal NFL scenario is that the guy behind center is a
guy who can take over a game and snatch a ``W'' out of the jaws of
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Elway may be happily retired, rich and ensconsed in his
post-football life as the ultimate Beer Man. (Did anyone notice
that Coors Banquet Beer has a higher alcohol content than Coors
Light?)
</P>
<P>
   But there is no getting past the fact that the NFL could still
be Elway's, considering the way he towers (in suit and tie) over
what's left of the league's quarterback club.
</P>
<P>
   These are the days in which a guy like Ryan Leaf should wake up
and feel the urge to kick himself, hard.
</P>
<P>
   To possess such a prototypical quarterback body _ not to mention
such a gargantuan signing bonus _ and to let it go to waste ...
especially when the NFL cries out for the heir apparents to an era
in which Elway, Dan Marino, Jim Kelly and Warren Moon lent the NFL
a strong-arme glamour that the league is eager to regain.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the season's first week did not provide a few choice
QBs the opportunity to take over during crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who is on his last legs, may have had his best game of
the season. Certainly, the scene was ripe for his Hall of Fame
thievery.
</P>
<P>
   But more than Marino's throwback night, the stage was set in
Week 1 for the next generation to make a splash.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Jake Plummer, Tennessee's Steve McNair, New England's
Drew Bledsoe and Green Bay's Brett Favre each led his team to
come-from-behind wins last Sunday, thanks to last-minute drives
they orchestrated.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Troy Aikman again looked like the Cowboys QB of old.
Aikman led Dallas on a comeback run that erased a 21-point
Washington lead at the end of regulation. Then, thinking he was
going to hand off to Emmitt Smith, Washington was fooled when
Aikman dropped back and nailed a TD pass in overtime to win the NFC
East rivalry match.
</P>
<P>
   The big guys made big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those types of drives are storybook drives,'' Green Bay coach
Ray Rhodes said after Favre shook off the pain of a bruised thumb
to lead Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Favre, in tears after the game, engineered an 11-play, 82-yard
TD drive capped with a 1-yard pass to Jeff Thomason in the final
1:51 with no timeouts remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the types of drives the Favres, the (Joe) Montanas,
the Elways make,'' Rhodes said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe with the absence of Montana, Elway and possibly even Steve
Young _ who looked like Steve Old in the 49ers' train wreck against
Jacksonville _ it is Bledsoe who will make the strongest bid to
become a QB legend.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jets devastated by the loss of Vinny Testaverde and
hurt by a tipped pass by backup Rick Mirer (he of the poor judgment
school of passing), Bledsoe engineered a nifty drive in the
Patriots' win over New York.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:01 left, Bledsoe took the Pats from the Jets' 49-yard
line to their 1 with three seconds left _ just enough time for Adam
Vinatieri to kick the winning field goal. Over the course of the
day, Bledsoe completed 21 of 30 passes for 340 yards, making
Patriots coach Pete Carroll gloat that Bledsoe is back to top form
after injuring his finger last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe is in his seventh season _ a perfect time for him to
take advantage of his talent and experience. NFL observers will
watch with great interest to see if Bledsoe can make good on all
he's got going for him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Jacksonville, another Washington state-tied QB
continues to make his mark. Mark Brunell already has showed supreme
professionalism in guiding the Jags to the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   After these QBs, though, there are a lot of mere mortals in
charge of running NFL offenses this season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's bad to watch scrappers like Jon Kitna try to
figure it all out in the face of hideous pressure.
</P>
<P>
   And not that there isn't redeeming value in watching likable
guys such as Doug Flutie to see if he can have another magical
season.
</P>
<P>
   And not that there isn't entertainment in tracking the progess
of big-ticket youngsters like Cleveland's Tim Couch, Indianapolis'
Peyton Manning or Chicago's Cade McNown, especially since the ranks
of the heir apparents to Elway's prototypical QB throne do not, at
this point, include a 6-foot-5, 240-pounder named Leaf, who should
be kicking himself.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Exposing massive wrongdoing and a cancer of
incompetence at Los Angeles Unified's highest levels, an internal
audit of the Belmont Learning Center released Tuesday called for
criminal investigations, civil lawsuits and the possible dismissal
of many top officials.
</P>
<P>
   Don Mullinax, the district's inspector general, charged that
officials _ including Superintendent Ruben Zacarias, former school
boards and consultants _ are responsible for allowing the Belmont
Learning Center to be built on a potentially explosive oil and gas
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This culture developed a practice denying responsibility,
deflecting (rather than responding to) criticism, and defending
poorly planned and executed LAUSD actions with regard to Belmont,''
Mullinax wrote in the report on a $200 million project that may
never be completed.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-plus page report, supported by more than 6,000 pages of
evidence, concludes that former school boards were hindered by a
lack of experience in the development of school facilities and
consequently violated state laws in the approval of the nation's
costliest high school.
</P>
<P>
   Finding an absence of policy and procedures to protect the
public's health and safety, investigators recommended overhauling
the district's environmental and legal departments and revamping
its site selection process for schools.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax advised the district to sue several consultants,
including the district's top outside legal counsel, O'Melveny &AMP;
Myers; the lead architect, McLarand, Vasquez and Partners; and
possibly the project developer, Temple Beaudry Partners, led by
Kajima Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   O'Melveny and Myers and Temple Beaudry Partners issued
statements denying wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The report also asserts the state Department of Education and
Governor's Office of Planning and Development failed to adequately
supervise the $200 million project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of our inquiry are very troubling,'' said
Mullinax, director of the LAUSD Internal Audit and Special
Investigations Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the report is that the school board was repeatedly
misled. Mullinax said his investigators were continuously left
wondering who was in charge because of rampant finger pointing
among the many bureaucrats involved.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax recommended the district discipline, if not fire, nine
employees who ``personally failed to exercise proper management,
supervision, and/or professional execution of their assigned
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential hit list, which includes the directors and former
directors of the district's facilities, and real estate,
environmental health and safety departments, is topped by Chief
Administrative Officer David Koch and Chief Legal Counsel Richard
K. Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Five former employees, including former Superintendent Sidney
Thompson and retired administrator Dominic Shambra, also were
singled out for blame. It was Shambra who was the driving force
behind the Belmont deal from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Turning his attention to the superintendent, Mullinax advised
the school board to remember ``Zacarias' failure to supervise the
Belmont project in a diligent, professional, and effective manner''
during his next performance evaluation, scheduled for January.
</P>
<P>
   After a five-hour meeting behind closed doors, school board
members issued a terse joint statement saying they had begun
discussions with outside legal advisers on how to proceed with the
recommendations. The statement, read by board President Genethia
Hayes, gave few details on what those steps might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the board, this detailed report, based on a substantial,
seven-month investigation, is the beginning of the process to take
corrective action that will safeguard the public trust in the LAUSD
and ensure fairness and accountability,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the rights of employees named in the report,
Hayes said, it would be ``inappropriate at this time for us to
comment further.''
</P>
<P>
   At the direction of the superintendent, all district employees
were forbidden to comment publicly on the findings. Zacarias'
office ``will be the only point of contact at this time for this
issue,'' said spokesman Erik Nasarenko.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a prepared statement, Zacarias rejected the
report's criticism of his performance. ``Ironically, I want to note
that I was the first one to recommend the appointment of an
inspector general for this district.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias held open the possibility of disciplining or firing
district employees named by the probe. He refused to take any
questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, a longtime Belmont
critic, lauded the work of Mullinax and his staff and called for
terminations of the district employees named in the report.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to hit the ball right on the head,'' Wildman said.
``I would hope that the board and superintendent take this report
seriously. Many of the people named in the report are still working
for the district, and that in itself is criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax and his team of attorneys and investigators were
empowered in February by the school board to investigate how and
why the district decided to build an enormous school downtown atop
an oil field marred by explosive methane gas and other dangerous
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school district's problems are much deeper than this one
problem,'' Mullinax said. ``The real reform will come only when
there is a change in the culture, when there is meaningful action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to hold public officials to the highest
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Having spent $1.2million on his review, Mullinax said a second
report delving into financial matters relating to Belmont will be
issued late this year. The follow-up investigation will attempt to
sort out where the $123million spent on Belmont has gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to find out who was watching the checkbook,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mullinax, numerous district officials were slow in
cooperating with investigators, and some repeatedly refused to
comply with demands for documents.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan said he hopes the report will be used to
make needed changes at the school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, today will be the start of real change. We can no
longer tolerate business as unusual at the LAUSD, especially when
it comes to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a wake-up call to those who would protect the
status quo,'' Riordan said. ``The findings of this report symbolize
the dysfunctional, Byzantine culture that exists at the school
district.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who gave significant campaign contributions to the
reform slate that recently took control of the school board, said
the findings should not only be used for accountability but also to
support meaningful institutional changes at the district.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the school board placed the fate of Belmont into the
hands of a blue ribbon advisory commission. The eclectic group of
eight commissioners, led by former District Attorney Ira Reiner, is
conducting a breakneck review of the pollution-plagued project.
They are scheduled to release a report in late October.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Belmont Learning Complex can be finished in a manner
that achieves the twin goals of public safety and educational
excellence, it should go forward,'' the audit unit report said.
</P>
<P>
   County Supervisor Michael Antonovich, a longtime Belmont critic,
renewed his call for a county grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unconscionable that our community could tolerate the
district's culture of finger pointing, backside covering and buck
passing by top LAUSD staff that leaves even Mullinax, after an
exhaustive analysis of Belmont, asking, Who is in charge of this
project?''
</P>
<P>
   Antonovich said he will ask his colleagues to pass a resolution
calling on the LAUSD board to adopt the report's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Hayden, a Los Angeles Democrat who wrote legislation to
get Mullinax subpoena power that will be used in follow-up
investigations, questioned the strategy recommended in the report,
calling it a ``beheading and not a surgical change of structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden argued that the $7 billion institution cries out for
institutional change. In particular, he said, the real estate and
acquisition branch needs to be separated from the educational
functions of the nation's second largest public school system.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he called the recommendation to consider getting
rid of top officials a ``breath of fresh air.'' Now, he said, the
board has to ensure that real change is made. ``Otherwise, who's to
say they won't build more Belmonts?''
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Bellomo, the top environmental consultant on the LAUSD's
recently formed School Safety Team, said the report was a
comprehensive look at the district's practices and could have a
positive effect on where the district goes from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the whole truth is finally coming out,'' he said.
``This is the time. If we're going to make changes, this is it.''

MORE UCLA PLAYERS ISSUE PLEAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Four current and former UCLA football players
pleaded no contest Tuesday to illegally possessing handicapped
parking placards, but Chicago Bears quarterback Cade McNown's
attorney said the former Bruins star was injured and deserved the
special permit.
</P>
<P>
   McNown and four others were charged Monday as the embarrassing
scandal has spread to include 19 current or former UCLA football
players. Two more could be charged, said Deputy City Attorney Brian
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation found that handicapped parking violations have
been a widespread problem at UCLA and might have included NBA
players who work out at the school during the summer, Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been going on at UCLA for such a long time that it's
hard to pinpoint one person who's been initiating this,'' he said
following the arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a problem on campus. Now they're aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the City Attorney's Office was not pursuing any
cases beyond those involving the football players because the
investigation was limited to those with current placards.
</P>
<P>
   The use of parking placards came to light in January after a
campus officer noticed a car with an improperly placed placard and
questioned the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The five players charged this week, including McNown and
Washington Redskins running back Brian ``Skip'' Hicks, did not
appear Wednesday before Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Sam Ohta.
Their attorneys did not enter pleas, and Ohta set a Sept. 30
arraignment for the five.
</P>
<P>
   McNown and Eric Whitfield, 21, of Carson, were charged for
illegal possession of the placard and for using a doctor's name
without permission on the application given to the state Department
of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Oladele Ayanbadejo, 23, of Aptos, and Larry Atkins, 24, of
Kansas City, as well as Hicks, were charged with the illegal
possession offense and for using signatures of nonexistent
physicians on the DMV forms.
</P>
<P>
   McNown's attorney, Ronald Safer, contended that the NFL rookie
was injured in winter 1997 when he obtained the handicapped parking
placard. Safer said McNown was not aware of prosecutors'
allegations that the DMV form included the signature of a doctor
who did not give her permission and said McNown was never a
patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is disappointed in the system that he is charged with this
matter,'' Safer said. ``It deeply troubles him. He had led an
exemplary life.''
</P>
<P>
   Safer acknowledged that McNown was well enough to participate in
spring practice in 1998 while possessing the placard. But he said
McNown never used the placard to park in a handicapped spot and
understands the outcry within the disabled community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a sensitive and caring person. That's the kind of person
we're talking about,'' Safer said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said prosecutors stand behind their charges. ``We
looked at these cases long and hard before we filed. We believe we
can prove this case. There's no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The four who pleaded no contest through their attorneys Tuesday
were convicted on one count each of illegal possession of a
handicapped parking placard. In exchange for the plea, the City
Attorney's Office dropped the charge of using signatures of
nonexistent physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Those four are James Ghezzi, 22, of Mar Vista; Mark Reynosa, 20,
of Sylmar; Duval Hicks, 23, of Sherman Oaks; and Durell Price, 21,
of Newhall.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Craig Walendy, 21, of Westlake, was continued
to Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Ohta sentenced the four to the same penalties the judge gave
nine other current or former Bruin football players who pleaded no
contest to the same charge in July: fines and court costs totaling
$1,485 and 200 hours community service, with 100 devoted to working
with children in the Special Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Those nine are Ali Azziz, 22, of Sherman Oaks; Robert Thomas,
18, of Imperial; Damian Allen, 21, of Van Nuys; Marques Anderson,
20, of Long Beach; Oscar Cabrera, 21, of Highland Park; Ryan Nece,
20, of Palms; Ryan Roques, 21, of Mar Vista; Anthony White, 20, of
Sherman Oaks; and Deatra Clinton, 21, of West Covina. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

 SOX-INDIANS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Red Sox fans are not likely to be massed, 10,000
strong, at Logan Airport when the weary sons of Jimy Williams
finally arrive home well after midnight Wednesday, the end of their
13-day criss-crossing of the continent finally at hand.
</P>
<P>
   But what these Sox have accomplished on this journey is no more
improbable, or less impressive, than what the Cardiac Kids of '67
did when they reeled off 10 in a row on the road and were hailed as
conquering heroes upon their return.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were two games ahead of the Oakland A's in the wild-card
race when this trip began in Seattle on Labor Day weekend. They
guaranteed themselves of being at least that far ahead when they
wake up Thursday morning by clobbering the Cleveland Indians, 12-3,
behind Ramon the Elder, reliever Derek Lowe, and a 16-hit attack
that featured Troy O'Leary's game-breaking three-run home run and
mocked any hint of battle fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Williams admitted the trip has taken its toll in one respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem I have is remembering my room number,'' he
said. ``I got on the bus back to the hotel Tuesday night and
couldn't remember my room number.''
</P>
<P>
   With the A's 13-6 losers to Baltimore Tuesday night and Pedro
the Younger _ who has never lost to the Indians _ set to follow his
brother Ramon Martinez to the mound for the trip finale Wednesday,
the Sox, now 8-3 in this trip/defining crucible, are in a position
to double their lead by the time they arrive home.
</P>
<P>
   With 17 games left, they lead the A's by three games for the
wild card while remaining 3 1/2 behind the Yankees in the AL East.
The Yankees essentially eliminated Toronto as a wild-card contender
by winning Tuesday night, 10-6, in a game they trailed, 6-2, with
two outs in the eighth. The Jays trail Boston by 6 1/2 games, seven
in the loss column.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys in here are aching and hurting,'' said Lowe, who
replaced Martinez with the Sox ahead, 7-3, with two on and two out
in the fifth, then retired all 10 Indians he faced to gain credit
for the win. ``You've got to put that aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when courage and the will to win kicks in, and we have
a lot of it in here. You can't ever stop. Our goal is to win the
World Series, which means there's a month and a half left. You have
to prepare yourself physically and mentally to keep pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who was all but dismissed as a helping hand 12 days
ago, when he pitched just three innings and was dropped from the
rotation one day later, came within one out of recording his first
win in more than 15 months Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ramon Martinez I saw today is the Ramon Martinez I know,''
said Jose Offerman, who was a Dodger teammate during Martinez's
glory days and helped his good friend and fellow Dominican Tuesday
night with four hits, two runs, an RBI, and a stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who was pitching only because Pat Rapp was home where
his wife is struggling with a difficult pregnancy, was lifted him
for Lowe after he walked two straight batters, raising his pitch
count to 94.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez may yet prove to be the saving grace for a rotation
that changes from minute to minute (When Williams was asked before
the game what the state of his rotation was, he responded with
Jimywocky: ``It's in Ohio, and Friday it will be in Boston.'')
</P>
<P>
   Could Martinez &AMP; Martinez be double trouble for the American
League down the stretch? Ramon broke into a broad smile at the
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother, he's going tomorrow,'' he said. ``I got a chance,
an opportunity to win a game last night. I hope I get another
chance, and I'm going to try and do better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, meanwhile, teed off on Dwight Gooden, who may have
pitched his last game as an Indian. There was widespread
speculation that Gooden, who has had a bad shoulder and is now 3-4
with a 6.38 ERA, is about to be released. In eight career starts
against the Sox, he's 0-5 with an 8.36 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon homered for the second straight night, this time with
Wilton Veras on board in the third with the first of his three
hits. The diminished Doc was dismissed with the Sox ahead, 4-2, in
the fifth after issuing an intentional walk to Nomar Garciaparra
with Reggie Jefferson on second. Offerman had tried to score on
Jefferson's hit, but was erased at the plate when third-base coach
Wendell Kim sent him home, even though charging center fielder
Kenny Lofton already had the ball when Offerman reached third.
</P>
<P>
   Indians manager Mike Hargrove brought in a lefty, Mark Langston,
to face O'Leary. But O'Leary bailed out Kim and crossed up Hargrove
by hitting a 1-and-0 pitch for his 27th home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just part of baseball, you know,'' said O'Leary, who
also singled home a run in the seventh for his first four-RBI night
of the season, giving him 99. ``You're always going to try to go
with the odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Has he changed those odds with his performance this season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't changed anything,'' said O'Leary, who over the
weekend attributed his home run off the foul pole in Yankee Stadium
to the ``luck of the Irish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who over the weekend clinched their season series
against the Yankees, the first-place team in the AL East, did the
same Wednesday night against the Indians, whom they have beaten six
times in nine meetings. Battle fatigue? Offerman shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where we're playing, we're in a position where we
have to win some games,'' he said. ``And that's exactly what we're
doing.''

BY DAVID R. BAKER AND GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Superintendent Ruben Zacarias rejected an
internal audit's finding that his leadership of the nation's second
largest school district contributed to problems plaguing the
Belmont Learning Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can in no way agree with the report's assertion that I
failed to supervise the Belmont project in a diligent, professional
and effective manner,'' Zacarias said.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a prepared statement, Zacarias _ his voice hushed
by a recent bout of laryngitis _ said he would implement the
report's recommendations and deal with its call for severe
discipline, including possible dismissal, of nine subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   But he argued he fulfilled his own obligations, saying he
immediately took steps to gain control of Belmont _ a $200 million
school construction project _ after taking office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent said he quickly disbanded the Office of
Planning and Development branch overseeing the project and
appointed a chief administrative officer to run the business side
of the district, including school construction.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Zacarias said he spearheaded efforts to create an
environmental safety team to provide ``quality technical advice on
environmental matters at Belmont'' and mandated no new school would
be built without approval from the state Department of Toxic
Substances Control.
</P>
<P>
   Don Mullinax, the district's top investigator, included Zacarias
on a list of 15 former and current Los Angeles Unified School
District employees who failed to ``exercise proper management'' in
regard to Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax advised the school board to consider Zacarias' role in
the scandal during his job review, which is scheduled for January.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias held open the possibility of disciplining, possibly
firing, district employees for their performance on Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I have not as yet had the opportunity to thoroughly
study the document, I am taking the report's finding and
recommendations very seriously and plan to respond in an
expeditious, forthright and appropriate manner,'' Zacarias said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, a frequent LAUSD critic,
defended Zacarias, saying the superintendent deserved credit for
starting the very process that led to Tuesday's report criticizing
his own performance.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than rush to demand Zacarias' ouster, Hayden said he
wanted to hear the superintendent's side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to give him a chance to explain himself,'' Hayden
said ``If he gets up there and says he was part of the previous
administrations but he supports reform and he embraces this report,
why should we fire him?''

RAMON MARTINEZ PITCHES IN
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-INDIANS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Does this look like a winning pitcher line to you?
</P>
<P>
   4 2/3 3 3 3 4 5
</P>
<P>
   It sure did to Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, he was the winning pitcher,'' declared the Red Sox
mentor, who had to make a painful decision to lift comebacking
Ramon Martinez with one out standing between him and his first
official major league victory in well over a year.
</P>
<P>
   But on these 1999 Boston Red Sox, individual goals are secondary
to the Big Picture. What mattered was that the Sox trampled
Cleveland by a 12-3 score Tuesday night at Jacobs Field, raising
their road trip record to 8-3 with the World's Best Pitcher
awaiting his regular turn Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big stat night for the Olde Towne Team. Jose Offerman
was 4 for 4 and on base five times. Troy O'Leary had a big
three-run homer and four runs batted in, leaving him one shy of his
first 100-ribbie season. Wilton Veras again proved himself
oblivious to the pressure of a two-tiered major league pennant race
with three hits. Trot Nixon, the apple of his teacher's eye
(``Trot's doing fine,'' beamed Williams. ``Trot's a good player''),
knocked out his 13th homer of the season. Derek Lowe set down all
10 Indians he faced.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hollywood story was the starting pitcher. Ramon Martinez
earned the gratitude and admiration of his manager and teammates by
giving a pitching-strapped staff a chance to win a big ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant Dominican embarked on this road trip with no
guarantees he would pitch again the rest of the season. Williams
had handed him the ball Sept. 2 (five hits and four earned runs in
three-plus innings against Kansas City), but the skipper had no
apparent intention of giving him another start until circumstances
got so bad that he almost had no choice. This was supposed to be
Pat Rapp's turn, but he was back in Louisiana. Kent Mercker was
unavailable because of torn rib cartilage. Williams no longer feels
comfortable with Mark Portugal, although he did feel daring enough
to allow the veteran an opportunity to pitch the ninth inning with
a nine-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Martinez had a conversation back in Seattle, at
which time the skipper told the hurler that he really didn't know
when, or if, he would be calling on him. The Martinez response was
to go out and work his slender butt off, and this made a tremendous
impression on his manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never told me I wouldn't get another start,'' Martinez
reported. ``He just told me it was a difficult situation, and I do
understand that we are in a pennant race and it is very difficult
for him to take a chance with me. But I never stopped working. I
worked hard every day, hoping I would get that chance, and I wanted
to take advantage of that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was one pitch and one dropped throw away from blanking
the mighty Cleveland Indians. He sailed through the first three
innings nicely, the only hit being a first-inning two-out double by
Roberto Alomar. With a man on first and two away in the fourth, he
made his one mistake, a fastball that was supposed to be in but
hung out over the plate. Jim Thome feasts on those type of errors.
He knocked the ball over the dead center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez deserved a better fate in the fifth, too. Sandy Alomar
led off with a shot into the left-field corner. O'Leary, an
underrated outfielder, played the carom perfectly and then uncorked
a throw that had Alomar beaten at second. But Offerman dropped the
throw. A ground ball to first moved Alomar over, and he scored on
an Omar Vizquel sacrifice fly. Martinez walked Robby Alomar,
bringing Williams to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was going to give me one more batter,'' explained
Martinez, whose pitch count was heading into the 90s by that point.
But I couldn't get that guy out.''
</P>
<P>
   He got ahead of David Justice, 0-and-2, but the wily veteran
wound up working him for a walk. Williams didn't want to take any
chances with what was then a 7-3 lead, so he replaced Martinez with
Lowe, whose sinker completely dominated the Indians for the next 3
1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The W would have been nice, but it wouldn't have made Martinez
any better than he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really pitched great,'' lauded Williams. ``It meant a lot
to our ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had better control tonight than in the first game,''
Martinez said. ``I felt relaxed. I don't even feel I had surgery. I
was relaxed. I just wanted to go out there and throw strikes, and
that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   He stuck with two pitches, his fastball and his changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had late life and late movement on both of them,'' said
Jason Varitek, who was catching the former LA 20-game winner for
the first time. ``With the one exception, when he missed, he was
off the plate or in. It was fun to catch him. He's a pure
professional in every way. You can see he's been pitching for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   He did exactly what Williams said he'd do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to seeing Ramon pitch tonight,'' the
mentor was saying before the game. ``I think he's gonna pitch a
good game.''
</P>
<P>
   As aware as Williams was of what the performance meant to
Martinez personally, what it ultimately meant was one more victory
for the Boston Red Sox. Williams deals with issues one day at a
time, as a local radio guy discovered when he asked Williams about
the possibility of Martinez being on the postseason roster, and
thus facing the Indians three weeks hence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play tomorrow,'' he said. ``That's all I can tell you.
We've got a scheduled game tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's got another Martinez going. As Jimy himself might say,
you can bet he was planning on sleepin' good.

REPORT BLASTS LAUSD'S CULTURE OF LYING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Belmont Learning Center scandal is
symptomatic of a pervasive culture of lying, finger pointing, power
games, disregard for the law and wholesale shirking of
responsibility that permeates top management of the nation's
second-largest school district, the Mullinax report concluded
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Los Angeles Unified School District has tolerated
repeated violations of policies and procedures without calling
employees to account, disciplining them or even mentioning
employees by name, said Don Mullinax, director of the district's
internal audit and special investigations unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was ever held responsible or accountable for their
actions,'' he said. ``A report would read, `A procedure was not
followed, next time follow the procedure.' No names were ever
mentioned, no one was held accountable, no discipline was given
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping today that will change, but it's not going to
happen overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The report validated what many critics have said is at the heart
of the district's failures in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we've been saying about the school district for
two decades,'' said Day Higuchi, president of United Teachers Los
Angeles. ``It speaks to a culture that's been in place for 30 years
or more. Now the people who should be accountable need to act. The
culture is about to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax, LAUSD's inspector general, launched his investigation
seven months ago, amid growing evidence that environmental problems
caused by old oil wells and widespread presence of explosive
methane gas at the Belmont site posed serious health hazards.
</P>
<P>
   His mission was to determine how the district decided to locate
what would be the nation's most expensive high school at $200
million without proper safety precautions, and to assign
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The former Senate investigator said he studied past district
documents regarding policies and practices covering several years
and interviewed 65 officials extensively.
</P>
<P>
   What he learned, he said, was that from a succession of school
boards and superintendents, the LAUSD evolved a culture that
allowed on-top managers to avoid all responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a general failure to demand professionalism from
district staff who in turn failed to properly oversee their
employees and outside consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The report said former school boards generally operated under
``rudderless'' policies for Belmont in terms of acquisition,
development and evaluation of environmental risks at the school.
</P>
<P>
   The boards ``tolerated a culture remarkably indifferent to
compliance . . . This culture developed a practice of denying
responsibility, deflecting (rather than responding to) criticism,
and defending poorly planned and executed LAUSD actions with regard
to Belmont,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Absent scrutiny from the top, LAUSD staff became so
undisciplined that ``turf rivalry and internal bickering'' became
so commonplace that they no longer were able to exercise their
responsibilities, including the oversight of consultants, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   As the district staff became increasingly cavalier, they
``misled'' the board on such vital issues as the environmental
risks associated with Belmont, even failing to warn board members
they might be in danger of violating _ and in some cases already
had _ state environmental and other laws.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax said the LAUSD's culture of ``denial and deflection''
was able to thrive, because no one ever demanded that anyone step
forward and take responsibility for projects, most notably Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax said that after 65 interviews and reviewing thousands
of documents it remains almost impossible today to know who
actually should have been responsible _ let alone who was
responsible _ for Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all said they were coordinators,'' Mullinax. ``They
pointed fingers. Hardly anyone took responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAUSD's habit of stonewalling remains so strong that at
least one official waited months before turning over documents, and
Mullinax said he's not convinced the LAUSD has fully complied with
the document requests even yet.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Roger Friermuth, a project manager
within the Project Management and Construction branch, did not
provide 11 boxes of documents to investigators until Aug. 10,
though they had been requested in March. Friermuth supplied one box
of materials in April, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Friermuth did not return calls for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends Friermuth be disciplined up to
termination, saying he failed to require the developer, Temple
Beaudry Partners LLC, to properly design and install a methane
barrier system beneath Belmont and also failed to obtain the proper
environmental assessment of excavated and removed contaminated
soil.

   LOS ANGELES: contaminated soil.
</P>
<P>
   Friermuth told investigators he had ``no say'' in the design and
construction of the facility and that he was ``not responsible''
for the environmental assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax said the district's lack of forthcomingness is
``endemic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a school district that does not want to cooperate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   An extensive log contained in the report reveals how difficult
the document acquisition process was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defensive and uncooperative behavior of some senior staff
within the district coupled with the hesitancy of many staffers to
release Belmont-related documents or cooperate with the
investigation made the internal auditor's job of ferreting out the
truth all the more arduous and time-consuming,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax said the district has been resistant to change for
years, but said even the most entrenched cultures can be changed.
He said that requires both consideration of the disciplinary
recommendations and more far-reaching structural changes
recommended in the report.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the employment of senior managers to be held
responsible for school facilities and environmental compliance, as
well as an independent counsel to the school board. That attorney
would give the board advice apart from that now provided by General
Counsel Richard Mason. The report said it had probable cause to
believe Mason failed to make sure the board did not violate state
environmental laws, failed to supervise outside counsel and failed
to cooperate with the investigation. Mason declined comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first step in restoring accountability and
credibility in the school district,'' Mullinax said. ``The report
is to the board. It's up to them to take action.''

DISNEY CONCERT HALL APPROVED
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Facing criticism that Los Angeles County would
subsidize the center to the tune of $12 million a year, county
supervisors gave final approval Tuesday to the downtown Walt Disney
Concert Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We the taxpayers are going to pay an additional $12 million a
year for 25 years for this,'' said Supervisor Gloria Molina. ``The
net county cost will be close to $550 million during the 65-year
life of this contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Supervisors voted 5-0 to approve final legal
documents related to the construction of the $18 million Cal Arts
Theater and the $231 million Walt Disney Concert Hall, the home of
the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Although the concert hall and theater construction costs are
financed through donations raised by Disney, the county is
responsible for the maintenance of the center and parking garage.
The largest maintenance costs will include those for utilities,
security and ushers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now confirmed that the county is also responsible for
maintaining the exclusive `Founders Room', a lounge within the hall
that only those patrons who have contributed over $35,000 can
enjoy,'' Molina said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Molina proposed a motion that would continue
approval of the concert hall until the supervisors agreed on
finding funding to expand the Los Angeles County/USC Medical
Center, which is seeking to build a satellite hospital with either
60 or 125 beds in Baldwin Park.
</P>
<P>
   But no one would second her motion.
</P>
<P>
   She said she voted for the concert hall because she has always
supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said the subsidy was justified
because the public will be enriched by the concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Disney Concert Hall is going to be the premier
philharmonic hall in the world,'' Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the cultural side, this is a very valuable asset for the
community,'' said Disney Hall board Chairman Bill Siart. ``On the
economic side, it's going to be an economic boom for Los Angeles in
terms of sales tax revenue and attendance fees paid to the
county.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction permits for the center are expected to be issued
this month.

<P>
   NORTH HOLLYWOOD _ Shotmaker Co., a struggling supplier of camera
cars, dollies and cranes to Hollywood producers, is expected to
launch a bold makeover today via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old company, which recently cut back its core
operations to a dozen employees, will unveil its strategy to change
course by unveiling www.TheShotmaker.com at the ShowBiz Expo trade
show in New York City. The site, which lists 2,000 vendors, is
targeted not at fans looking for merchandise but at the decision
makers in the fast-changing business of television and movie
productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the ideal vehicle to match producers and
directors with exactly the equipment and services they need
anytime, anywhere,'' said Philip Berardi, a veteran executive who
joined Shotmaker in June as president.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea is to take advantage of Shotmaker's name
recognition, contacts and reputation at a time when producers and
studios are scrambling for ways to cut costs, move more quickly and
find enough programming to meet booming demand.
</P>
<P>
   In short, as Berardi puts it, Shotmaker wants the site to be the
first place the industry's professionals go when they start the
search for equipment and services. It is being launched only a few
months after Burbank-based Matthews Studio Group unveiled a similar
site, but Shotmaker officials are enthusiastic theirs will stand
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``As glamorous as the industry is, it is not up to date in using
the Internet,'' spokesman Neil Berkman said. ``We believe that the
businesses that work on the Internet are the ones that cut costs of
distribution by reducing the distance between the buyer and the
seller.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shotmaker site, developed by A-Plus Marketing of Los
Angeles, features five basic sectors _ a database, interactive
guest forums, e-mail, Web site creation and video. The strategy
will be for Shotmaker to eventually generate significant revenues
by convincing vendors to let Shotmaker build and host their Web
sites and place their videos online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there are a lot of companies that will want to get
their product reels displayed through the site,'' said A-Plus
executive Brandon Stone. ``We're dealing with very visual
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea will be to make it easy for producers and directors to
compare options in more than 200 different categories ranging from
animation to helicopters to location scouting. And thanks to
low-budget breakthroughs like ``The Blair Witch Project'' and the
availability of digital cameras, Shotmaker officials believe the
market will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think filmmaking has become far more accessible than
previously and we're going to be involved with a much broader
market,'' Berardi said.
</P>
<P>
   Shotmaker, a subsidiary of publicly traded Camera Platforms
International, was founded in 1985 by director/producer Hal
Needham, best known for ``Cannonball Run'' and ``Smokey and the
Bandit.'' The company still manufacturers, sells and rents the
platforms, customized trucks, cranes, dollies and track that allow
camera operators to film car chases without bumps and shakes, but
its parent company is in poor financial shape.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Camera Platforms reported it had lost $812,000 on
revenues of $893,000 in the first six months of 1999 and disclosed
it was in default of all of its credit lines. The stock is
currently worth 18.75 cents a share, giving Camera Platforms a
market capitalization of $2.4 million. The company's majority
shareholder is Fleischman Investments, which brought Berardi three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been going through difficult times because the industry
has been in a slump,'' Berardi admitted. ``The rental parts of our
business are still viable but we had to look to go beyond what we
do to something bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Berardi may be able to find encouragement from Burbank-based
Matthews Studio Group, another production equipment player that
expanded onto the Web. Its long-slumping stock jumped once it
announced plans to launch ShowbizMart.com in June as a one-stop
site for producers, suppliers, crews and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews has been signing a wide array of deals, including
alliances with amazon.com and reel.com. It also sells 30,000
different memorabilia items on its site, including the red-hot
Pokemon merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews' stock, which moved over $10 prior to the site launch,
has been depressed since then as Internet stocks fell out of favor
and closed Tuesday at $4.50, down 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthews' prospects are better than ever and they keep signing
big names, so I don't think a new site like Shotmaker's will be a
problem,'' said Richard Cardillo, chief investment strategist at
Westfalia Investments in New York, which is one of Matthews' market
makers. ``It's a question of who is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews should be able to rise to $15 a share, Cardillo
believes, once Internet stocks regain their upward momentum.
``Matthews has been a victim of circumstances with people having to
sell the stock,'' he added. ``Fundamentally, nothing has changed.''

VAN NUYS AIRPORT TAKES OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAN NUYS _ Van Nuys Airport generated $1.23 billion in economic
activity last year, up 30 percent from 1991, and supported more
than 10,000 jobs, according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Keys to the facility's growth have been the improvement of the
Southern California economy and the rising use of corporate jets,
leading to an 8 percent rise in takeoffs and landings to 551,622 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the economy has been very good in Southern
California since the recession, and the airport and aviation
industries have done very well,'' said airport Manager Jens Rivera.
``The airport's close proximity to city business centers makes it a
natural choice of major business users.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by Wilbur Smith Associates, found $191.8
million in direct economic impact at or near the airport led by
$63.2 million for aircraft operators, $41.5 million for aircraft
services, $38.7 million for corporate operators and $18.8 million
for air taxis and charters.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed indirect impact of $96 million from the
312,700 visitors to the facility; multiplier revenue for
aviation-related businesses totaled $499.3 million, from money
originally generated through the airport; and nonaviation
multiplier revenue of $276.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this shows is the economic significance of the airport
beyond its actual margins,'' said Robert Rodine, airport committee
chairman for the Mid Valley Chamber of Commerce and a member of the
airport's citizens advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the job growth came in the aviation sector with a 22
percent jump to 6,584 jobs; nonaviation jobs edged up 3 percent to
3,443. The report noted that even though the number of total
aircraft based at Van Nuys has decreased, the rise in corporate
jets has spurred economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jet aircraft typically require 4 to 10 (or more) people
employed in a full-time capacity to fly, service and administer the
aircraft,'' the report said. ``These jobs are typically high-paying
skilled positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Williams, a homeowner living three miles from the airport
and a member of an appointed task force on airport noise, said the
report was inadequate because it does not address the issue of the
reduced value of real estate due to aircraft noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has been looking at the financial impact of airport
noise on property owners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also said the report shows there is plenty of demand
for business at the airport so that the louder Stage 2 jets, built
before 1983, could be banned from the airport without economic
hardship. The airport commission decided in July to allow Stage 2
jets already stationed at Van Nuys to remain there.
</P>
<P>
   The report was presented this week at the start of public
hearings at the airport on the issue of aircraft noise and the
facility's operating variance, which allows aircraft to exceed
standards in some areas. The administrative law judge conducting
the hearings will make a recommendation to the state Department of
Transportation, which issues such variances.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes on the heels of a move by Los Angeles World
Airports, which runs the Van Nuys facility, to set aside $15
million for soundproofing 150 homes and 900 apartments near the
airport. The work is expected to start next summer.

CHARTRAND MAKES IMPACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When they are growing up and dreaming of
reaching the NHL, players don't dream of such unglamorous roles as
checking forward or defensive specialist.
</P>
<P>
   But as he sized up his chances of reaching the big-time, Brad
Chartrand realized he wasn't going to fool anyone into thinking he
was the next Jaromir Jagr, Pavel Bure or Paul Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 24-year-old Chartrand is trying to make the Kings
as center on the team's third line, the ``stopper'' unit, to borrow
the terminology used by coach Andy Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Chartrand was more than a defensive specialist,
assisting on Garry Galley's overtime goal as the Los Angeles Kings
beat the Colorado Avalanche 3-2 before an announced crowd of 7,216
at the Forum. The Kings improved to 2-0 in the exhibition season
and dropped the Avalanche to 0-2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, I look at myself as an underdog,'' Chartrand
said when asked to evaluate his chances of winning a spot on the
Kings' opening-night roster. ``At the same time, I think I've shown
the coaching staff that, `Wow, this kid is for real.' All you're
looking for is an opportunity, and to try to seize the moment, and
I don't want to give them a reason to send me down.''
</P>
<P>
   The assist provided one more reason for the Kings to let
Chartrand stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good as a player,'' Chartrand said of the opportunity
he is getting to try to win a spot. ``It doesn't come without hard
work. That's what I try to stress in my game _ work ethic and
commitment to defense. When you do that, you get rewarded. I think
I earned the chance to be out there (in overtime).''
</P>
<P>
   Murray is well aware of Chartrand's abilities. Chartrand played
for Murray's Canadian national teams for two seasons, captaining
the squad in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Chartrand said he's getting a much better chance to make the
Kings' roster than he got a year ago when he was in Toronto's camp.
On Murray's recommendation, the Kings signed him as a free agent
this summer after he spent last season with the Maple Leafs'
American Hockey League affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Rule helps: Joe Sakic and Sandis Ozolinsh gave Colorado a 2-0
lead, with Rob Blake and Vladimir Tsyplakov scoring to send the
game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   With the teams testing the NHL's new 4-on-4 overtime rule,
Galley scored the game-winner with five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely opens up the ice,'' Galley said of the new rule.
``The league wants to see more wins, and to make the game more
exciting for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rule, if the game had been played in the regular
season, the Kings would have gotten two points in the standings,
the Avalanche one for a regulation tie.
</P>
<P>
   Roster trims: The Kings assigned defensemen Trevor Gillies,
Richard Seeley and Kevin Bolibruck and right wing Kevin Baker to
their Lowell affiliate in the American Hockey League, and sent left
wing Kip Brennan back to his junior team in the Ontario Hockey
League.

DODGERS SHUT DOWN BY ANOTHER NOBODY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At least the Los Angeles Dodgers didn't get no-hit
by Eric Milton.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they got one-hit by 23-year-old Montreal right-hander
Javier Vazquez in another ugly footnote to an even uglier season.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez struck out a career-high 10 and retired the last 17
Dodgers as the Expos won 3-0 Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' only hit was a clean single between shortstop and
third by Mark Grudzielanek to lead off the fourth. Two batters
later Vazquez walked Gary Sheffield but got out of the inning by
retiring Eric Karros and Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only inning in which the Dodgers had a baserunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cy Young out there,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Johnson should know. The Dodgers have turned their share
of mediocre opposing pitchers into reasonable facsimiles of
baseball's winningest pitcher. Losing to pitchers with inferior
statistics is now commonplace on a team that continues to follow
disturbing trends.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez (8-7) entered the night with a 5.41 ERA. On the road, he
was 3-4 with a 7.33 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez mixed his fastball with his curve and changeup to look
as seasoned as his counterpart, Dodgers ace Kevin Brown, who, as it
happens, is the last pitcher to one-hit the Dodgers. Brown did it
July 16, 1997, when he was pitching the Florida Marlins toward the
World Series (which is far from where the Dodgers will be next
month).
</P>
<P>
   ``I had good location with my fastball, had a good curve and a
good changeup,'' Vazquez said. ``That doesn't happen often, when
you have all your pitches working.''
</P>
<P>
   It does, however, seem to happen more regularly than one would
expect when the Dodgers are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek lined out to second baseman Jose Vidro to start the
bottom of the first. Vidro then ranged behind second to retire
Craig Counsell on a grounder for the second out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But other than Grudzielanek's single off a Vazquez changeup in
the fourth, there weren't any difficult plays. Just difficult play
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty good pitch (to Grudzielanek in the fourth),''
Vazquez said. ``He did a good job of staying with it. It was
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez's domination puts Brown (16-8) in a must-win situation
in his last four starts if he's to reach the 20-win mark for the
second time in his career. But the way the Dodgers' offense tends
to disappear, don't hold your breath until you turn Dodger blue for
that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   In his last start, Brown allowed one earned run and struck out
seven in eight innings against the Mets. The Dodgers lost 3-1 and
had two hits, but none after the fourth inning. Mets starter Orel
Hershiser retired the last 15 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   A nice outing, but done one better by Vazquez, who threw 111
pitches and barely broke a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the game he didn't have it and he got by with his
fastball,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said. ``In the fourth,
fifth inning, he found his curveball. It seemed like his fastball
wasn't the greatest, but he had the equalizer working with his
curveball and changeup. Makes your fastball a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado pitcher John Thomson (1-7, 7.95 ERA) could be in for
the experience of a lifetime. He opposes Brown at Coors Field on
Sunday.

AMONG THIEVES, NOTHING IS SACRED

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hang onto your valuables, folks, because the bad
guys are getting more desperate, or more creative.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, thieves made off with priceless bells from two
San Francisco churches.
</P>
<P>
   Now someone has ripped off the barber pole hanging over the
entrance of the Exchange Barber Shop on Pine Street in the
Financial District.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed up for work Monday morning and the pole was gone,''
says shop owner Ken Connell.
</P>
<P>
   The Exchange opened in 1926, and the pole had hung there for at
least 50 years. Connell had it reconditioned recently.
</P>
<P>
   A new pole costs about $650; the old ones are valuable antiques.
Connell is offering a $200 reward.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional red, white and blue swirly barber poles, Connell
notes, are symbolic of the time when barbers, who were also
blood-letters, hung their bloody towels to dry outside their shops.
``Though  &UR; I've  &LR; never done that,'' Connell says.
</P>
<P>
   THE ASHES of Joe DiMaggio Jr., who died August 7 of an asthma
attack at age 57, will be scattered over the bay Wednesday by a few
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Joey D, as his friends called him, was the only child of the
Yankee Clipper. And it's hard to say who had the tougher end of the
strange father-son relationship. For sure, that relationship was a
burden to both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Joe died March 8, a wealthy, dignified and deity-like American
hero and noted recluse. Joey D died in poverty, a Yale-educated man
who lived for a time in a freight container in Antioch, worked
occasionally in a scrapyard and not long ago was ticketed for
riding a bicycle while under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   When Joe lay dying in a Florida hospital, Joey D never visited.
He said later he would have come in an instant if his father had
asked for him. Friends say Joe felt he shouldn't have to invite his
son to his deathbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a disappointment to each other,'' says Sam Spear, a
Bay Area racetrack exec who was good friends with Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Neither father nor son could comprehend the other's demons. They
were never close, probably never played catch. Joe never came to
Joey's high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   To the end, Joey called his dad ``Sir.'' Family insiders say Joe
was jealous of Joey's closeness to his mother, Dorothy Arnold, and
to Marilyn Monroe, Joe's second wife.
</P>
<P>
   Sam tells of driving Joe around the backstreets of Martinez on
more than one occasion, searching for Joey, trying to make a
connection.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Joe died, Joey D dug out an old Joe DiMaggio bat
and took some cuts on the porch of his trailer in Pittsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, by now maybe the Clipper and his kid have it all
sorted out.

 GREEK ORTHODOX TO WELCOME NEW LEADER  &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to put a bitter power struggle behind them, leaders of
the Greek Orthodox Church in the United States are gathering in New
York this week for the enthronement of their new spiritual leader,
Metropolitan Demetrios of Vresthena, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Demetrios, 71, replaces Archbishop Spyridon, who resigned last
month after a conflict-ridden, three-year reign over the
1.5-million-member Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.
</P>
<P>
   Using the latest technology to influence ancient rites of church
succession, Spyridon opponents deftly employed the Internet to
rally opponents of the archbishop, who was accused of autocratic
rule and not respecting democratic reforms in the American church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been three years of strife and division,'' said
Metropolitan Anthony, the bishop of the Greek Orthodox Diocese of
San Francisco, who presides over a jurisdiction that includes seven
Western states.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony was among a group of U.S. bishops who traveled to
Istanbul in January to request that international church leaders,
including Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople,
replace Spyridon.
</P>
<P>
   While archbishops are usually appointed for life, Spyridon, 54,
did not take long to alienate bishops, priests, seminary
professors, &LR;  and some of the church's wealthiest benefactors,
setting the stage of  &LR; for a major power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon was the first Greek Orthodox Archbishop to be born in
the United States, but he had spent most of his church career in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you alienate the priests and the bishops, what do you
have left?'' Anthony asked. ``He also didn't understand the role of
laymen in the American church.''
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon clashed with two reform groups in the Greek Orthodox
Church working for greater self-government in the American church,
the Chicago-based Orthodox Christian Laity and Greek Orthodox
American Leaders (GOAL), a group formed to oust the archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``GOAL played a role,'' said Anthony. ``In this age of instant
communications, they used the Internet to bring problems to the
fore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Stephanopoulus, dean of the Cathedral of the
Holy Trinity in New York, and one many priests who publicly clashed
with Spyridon, agreed that computers hastened Spyridon's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``GOAL included a number of prominent lay people, and they used
the Internet to energize people across the length and breath of the
church. That's something new,'' Stephanopoulus said. ``Church
coalitions can be formed very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   GOAL's Web site, located at  &UR; www.voithia.org,  &LR; was founded in
the summer of 1997 by two Greek Orthodox laymen _ Harry Coin, an
industrial software developer, and a dentist, Dr. George Stevens.
Both were upset about the ouster of four seminary professors at
Holy Cross School of Theology in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, their site got over  &LR; more than 5 million
hits. Last month, when the Spyridon crisis reached a peak, the site
got more than 112,000 hits from more than 10,000 visitors in just
two days.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, leaders of the movement welcomed Demetrios and
announced that GOAL and Voithia were going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thank God for having made it possible for Voithia to play a
role in this struggle for the heart and soul of the church,'' they
said in their final posting on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon's successor, Metropolitan Demetrios Trakatellis, was
born in Thessaloniki, Greece, but taught at Holy Cross seminary in
Massachusetts from 1983 to 1993. Ordained as a priest in 1964, he
also served as an auxiliary bishop to the Archbishop of Athens in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to arrive in New York Thursday and be installed
Saturday at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will have a new beginning,'' said Metropolitan
Anthony, who plans to fly from San Francisco to New York tomorrow
to welcome Demetrios.

UNIQUE STUDY LOOKS AT BUSH DONORS, SHOWS FEW WORKING WOMEN ON 
 LIST
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two-thirds of recent donors to the campaign of GOP presidential
hopeful George W. Bush are men, but women _ particularly homemakers
_ have been the more generous contributors.
</P>
<P>
   That is the finding of a new computer analysis of Bush's newly
released campaign data by programmers at a Silicon Valley startup
company.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Bush's campaign became the first to post daily donor
information on his Internet website _ an innovation praised by
campaign finance watchdogs and technology buffs alike.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating how instantaneously Silicon Valley and its
fast-evolving innovations can affect the political scene, all
41,000 files of Bush's donor list were immediately put under the
microscope by programmers at Palo Alto, Calif.-based Inxight
Software.
</P>
<P>
   Using the company's new software program called Table Lens, the
programmers began chopping, shuffling and charting the July and
August donation data to illustrate exactly what it could show about
Bush and the people who give to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see lots of patterns very quickly,'' said Steve
Bernstein, director of marketing at Inxight. Among the firm's
findings:
</P>
<P>
   -- Two-thirds of Bush's donors are men, but the average donation
is higher for women.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Homemakers'' represent 5 percent of Bush's donors and write
the biggest checks. Their median donation: $1,000, or the maximum
legal amount for the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they are part of wealthy couples who donate to the
max,'' said Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   -- One in 4 donors to Bush's campaign in July and August had
given the legal maximum. But some got carried away entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 600 people gave donations during July and August that
put them over the legal limit _ and of those over the limit,
three-fourths are at least double the legal limit,'' the analysis
said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fifteen percent of the donors were retired, and they gave a
median donation of $50.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said the way Bush's Web site posted the data was
surprisingly amateurish and difficult to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Bush) donor data isn't all one big file _ it actually
started out in 18 little files, each of which you had to
download,'' said Bernstein. ``One of their files is a broken link.
You can't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's common on amateur Web sites, but for such a prominent
Web site on which they got so much coverage, they should have been
a lot more careful,'' Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Inxight CEO Robert P. Lee was quick to praise the Bush
campaign for making the data accessible, and he said he hopes the
company's analysis will help people make sense of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need an easier way to analyze this massive and
ever-growing amount of data.''

BIG RISE PREDICTED IN MENTAL ILLNESS AMONG ELDERLY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An ``unprecedented explosion'' in psychiatric problems among the
elderly is about to hit the country, and the U.S. medical system is
woefully unprepared, a panel of psychiatric health specialists
warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Boomers start reaching retirement age in 2011, the experts
noted, signaling a new generation of geriatric mental health issues
involving such problems as substance abuse, late-onset
schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and depression.
</P>
<P>
   A projected 15 million cases of psychiatric disorders, triple
the current caseload, are expected among those age 65 and older by
the time the post-war demographic wave crests in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   The health system already serves mentally ill older adults
poorly, according to a national ``consensus statement'' on the
problem, issued Tuesday by an 11-member panel in the Archives of
General Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Authors called for a long-term research and treatment plan to
cope with ``the upcoming crisis in geriatric mental health.'' They
forecast a 275 percent jump in psychiatrically ill elderly from
1970 to 2030, versus only a 67 percent increase in comparable cases
among those ages 30-44.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental illness in the elderly is underdiagnosed and
undertreated,'' said lead author Dr. Dilip Jeste, director of
geriatric psychiatry at the University of California at San Diego.
``If we do nothing about it, the cost will be social disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel outlined a 15- to 25-year plan to retool medical
schools and health providers to deal with psychiatric problems
expected to beset aging Baby Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Even detecting such conditions is fraught with difficulty among
older people because of gaps in research and age-biased diagnostic
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of our current perspective is based on studies of young
adults,'' the panel noted.
</P>
<P>
   Projections of a large increase in geriatric mental illness
follow other recent studies showing a relatively high incidence of
mental health disorders among those born during the post-World War
II boom. Factors include greater willingness to seek help, less
family support and higher risk of alcoholism and substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Drug problems were cited as a particularly telling example of
the aging face of mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   Use of illicit substances has rarely been considered much of a
problem before among the elderly. In the latest
government-sponsored studies, fewer than 0.1 percent of people
older than age 65 had used an illicit drug within the prior month,
compared with 3.5 percent of those ages 18 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   But that may start to change as survivors of the drug culture
spawned in the '60s and '70s reach old age. One recent study in the
journal Psychiatric Services, which Jeste co-authored, said
demographics alone dictate a steady rise in recreational drug use
and related problems among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The latest cross-generational data on drug-taking behavior
``suggest that some Baby Boomers have continued to use illicit
drugs as they age,'' the study noted, ``and due to their sheer
numbers we can expect larger numbers of current drug users to reach
age 65 and potentially impact treatment programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides illicit-drug use and alcohol problems, older people also
are vulnerable to problems caused by prescription medications _
problems that often show themselves in the form of psychiatric
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often overlooked,'' said Doug Hennig, a geriatric social
worker and founder of a new Web site  &UR; (www.agenet.com) &LR;  aimed at
aging adults and care givers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of health issues are going to have to be dealt with in
terms appropriate for this age group, including the mental health
issue,'' Hennig said.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding dementia, which is usually due to Alzheimer's and
affects about 10 percent of the elderly, current estimates show
that 13 percent of those over age 65 meet the standard criteria for
having a psychiatric disorder.
</P>
<P>
   That is ``a serious underestimation,'' according to Jeste and
his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, drawn from leading institutions across the country
including the National Institute of Mental Health, noted that
social stigma tends to discourage people from seeking treatment,
while current diagnostic methods tend to be skewed toward younger
people.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the experts said, many psychiatric conditions are
gauged in terms of their impact on work lives and other criteria
that become less appropriate as the population ages. The panel also
noted ``pervasive ageism'' among caregivers, citing one survey that
found only 35 percent of primary care internists felt confident
prescribing anti-depressants to elderly patients, while
three-quarters considered depression ``understandable,'' and hence
not worth treating, for people 65 and older.
</P>
<P>
   When all the complicating factors are taken into account, the
new consensus statement concluded that nearly 20 percent of today's
elderly have ``serious psychopathologic symptoms,'' not counting
those with delirium and other disorders considered secondary to
general medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   That number is expected to rise to nearly 22 percent as the
population ages. Besides more problems overall, the experts
envision higher proportions of patients in need of long-term care
because of earlier diagnoses of psychiatric conditions and
decreased mortality from physical illness.
</P>
<P>
   The panel called for a 15- to 25-year research agenda, a push to
train more psychiatrists and psychologists specializing in serving
an older population, fewer health-plan restrictions on prescription
drugs and outpatient services and ``a reduced social stigma against
the elderly mentally ill.''

 _ SF CHRON   Despite Glitch, Sales Strong for Dreamcast 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Stein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Despite a potentially devastating software glitch, Sega's new
Dreamcast video gaming system is racking up impressive sales at
retail outlets across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sega of America in San Francisco said $132 million in revenue
was generated from the sale of 372,000 Dreamcast systems since the
product first went on the market on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The figures include sales of the 19 games that can be used with
the Dreamcast system. Sega officials said for each $199 Dreamcast
system sold, consumers are buying about three games.
</P>
<P>
   The only hitch last week occurred when consumers complained that
some Dreamcast games simply did not work with the new console. Sega
officials admitted that a small portion of its games were hit with
a manufacturing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company was quick to point out the Dreamcast
console was unaffected, industry observers said the problem could
be more serious and affect the operation of many more games than
the company claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bellfield, director of marketing communications at Sega,
said the company expects to sell an additional 100 million
Dreamcast units by the end of this weekend. He said Sega's
distribution channel will be tapped out after that, but the company
expects to ship new consoles to retail stores by the end of
September or early October.
</P>
<P>
   Sega officials are pleased with the sales response so far,
especially in light of the disastrous launch of its Saturn system
four years ago. That gaming console sorely disappointed customers
and game developers with its high sticker price and buggy
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturn debacle caused Sega to see its share of the U.S.
gaming market fall from about 50 percent four years ago to about 1
percent today. Sega expects its market share to rise dramatically
thanks to the release of Dreamcast, although the current software
glitch could dampen those expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Sega's Bellfield said less than 1 percent of all games in the
latest release were defective and that the company was encouraging
customers to return those games to retailers for a refund or
exchange. ``If this was really a serious problem, we would not have
seen the kind of sales we have so far.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Funk, editorial director for gaming magazines Electronic
Gaming Monthly and Expert Gamer, thinks the software glitch _ which
affects the Blue Stinger, Sonic Adventure, Hydro Thunder and Ready
2 Rumble games _ may be more serious than Sega has stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just judging from reader e-mails, I'd say about 5 to 10
percent of those games are defective,'' he said. He adds that one
of his co-workers had to return five copies of Sonic Adventure
before he got one that worked.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential impediment to future Dreamcast sales is the
launch of Sony's next-generation PlayStation system in the U.S. for
Christmas in the year 2000. Sony gave consumers a sneak preview of
the upcoming system, know as PlayStation2, at a trade show in Tokyo
this week. ``The system looks outstanding,'' said Funk. ``Sony is
on target with its release date and has lined up a number of
software developers.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe some consumers may hold off buying Dreamcast
and wait for PlayStation2.
</P>
<P>
   Sega remains optimistic. Company officials said they expect to
sell one million Dreamcast units by the end of the year, and
generate half a billion dollars in sales for hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Saito, manager of the Toys R Us store on San
Francisco's Geary Street said demand is still strong for Dreamcast.
``We sold out our 200 consoles pretty much the first day,'' she
said. ``We're expecting our next shipment in early October and
already have a bunch of people on our waiting list.'' &LR;

 PG&AMP;E to Auction Dams Off
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Kenneth Howe &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
PG&AMP;E Corp. said yesterday it will auction off its vast
hydroelectric resources. The move comes less than two days after
failing to persuade the Legislature to allow it to transfer its
$3.3 billion system to an unregulated subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The decision could potentially allow bidders to acquire all or
some of PG&AMP;E's crown jewels, an inventory that includes 68 power
plants and 94 dams on 16 rivers that produces enough electricity to
power 4 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   However, PG&AMP;E's widely expected decision, disclosed in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing, was greeted with some
skepticism in many quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to see a fair auction, but I don't think they've
really given up their desire to transfer their hydropower hydro &LR; 
power  &LR; to a separate subsidiary,'' said Steven Kelly, policy
director for the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association
for more than 50 electricity producers in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having failed to convince the Legislature to let it transfer
the assets, PG&AMP;E had to follow up on its threat to auction off the
system,'' noted Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility
Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics think that PG&AMP;E may use the prospect of an auction to
prod the Legislature to reconsider the issue when it reconvenes in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout PG&AMP;E's nearly six-month battle in the Legislature to
shift its hydroelectric resources to a separate subsidiary, the
utility company said if it were not permitted to make the move it
would auction off the dams. It used that prospect in an attempt to
forge some agreement on the contentious transfer issue.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E's proposal would have affected the price consumers and
industry pay for electric power. That's because the proceeds from
the sale would go toward paying down some of PG&AMP;E's debts, which
arose from investments in nuclear power plants and power contracts
in the 1980s. Those debts are being paid by consumers through a
surcharge on their monthly electricity bills, an amount that is as
much as 40 percent of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But PG&AMP;E's proposal would also have affected the fate of 140,000
acres of Northern California forestland; critical water flows for
fish in numerous river systems; and as well as  &LR; the amount of water
to be used by farmers and country water districts.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the move would allow PG&AMP;E to secure control of the
system for far less than it is worth, then charge higher rates on
the hydroelectric power it produced.
</P>
<P>
   Having failed in the Legislature, PG&AMP;E's first step in an
auction would be for it to file with the California Public
Utilities Commission. A spokesman for the company said the utility
is likely to take that step but had not yet filed and offered no
timetable for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   But an auction is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Experts noted
that the PUC would have to hash over the same issues with which the
Legislature wrestled: how to balance the concerns of rate payers,
environmentalists, farmers, recreational users and others and avoid
giving any one company excessive market power over such a huge
amount of generating power.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's possible the Legislature will take up the issue
again when it reconvenes in January. ``It's hard to image the
Legislature and the governor giving up control of this issue that
affects so many constituents,'' said Hoge.

 &QL; 
Authorities have disclosed that a serial killer imprisoned in New
York State has been selling art, poetry and autographs to dealers
for resale on the eBay Internet auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Prison authorities this week revoked the art privileges of
Arthur Shawcross, 54, convicted of murdering 11 prostitutes in the
Rochester, N.Y., area. The authorities said that Shawcross _ who
was paid by the dealers with clothing rather than cash _ violated
state regulations prohibiting prisoners from operating businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Two Shawcross items _ a poem and a set of autographed index
cards _ are still for sale on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Shawcross is not the only serial killer whose handiwork is for
sale on San Jose's eBay _ not by a long shot. Just about every
high-profile serial killer of the past three decades is
represented.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes Richard Ramirez, the Southern California
``nightstalker''; Albert DeSalvo, the Boston strangler; John Wayne
Gacy, who killed young boys in Illinois; Ted Bundy, who specialized
in killing college girls; David Berkowitz, New York's ``Son of
Sam'' killer; Jeffrey Dahmer, the Milwaukee cannibal _ and many
more.
</P>
<P>
   In almost all cases, the items are limited to autographs or
letters. Artistic efforts, such as Shawcross', are few and far
between.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether any of the killers are offering their
wares directly or through a representative. Sellers of merchandise
on eBay are identifiable only by pseudonymous screen names.
</P>
<P>
   It also is unclear in many cases where the sellers got the
merchandise _ directly from the serial killers or from other
sources, such as collectors.
</P>
<P>
   A poem by Shawcross now offered on eBay is described as dating
back to 1993. The bidding had reached $18.50 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   A set of six index cards that Shawcross autographed is said to
have been collected by ``a female serial killer groupie.'' It has
attracted bids as high as $16.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer with the most serial-killer mementos for sale is
identified only as ``cc.'' The dealer did not respond to an
e-mailed request for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of EBAY15 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  You don't even have to be a serial killer to make it to eBay. An
autograph from Richard Allen Davis, killer of Petaluma schoolgirl
Polly Klaas, is being hawked for a minimum bid of $9.99. There were
no bidders as of yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Pursglove, a spokesman for eBay, said the company makes
``no moral judgments'' about the merchandise sold on its Web site.
If a serial killer's autograph is being sold by a private
individual who is entitled to sell it, eBay will not intervene, he
remarked.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added that if the merchandise was obtained in a way
that ``violates laws or prison regulations,'' eBay will ``shut the
auction down.''
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove said eBay's lawyers had been unable to get a
``definite'' statement about whether the two Shawcross items
displayed on the auction site are there in violation of any laws or
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   James Flateau, a spokesman for the New York prison system, said
Shawcross did not violate the state's Son of Sam law, which
prevents convicted criminals from profiting directly from their
crimes _ for example, with books or paid interviews about the
crimes themselves. The artwork, poetry and other merchandise did
not refer to the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republican New York state Sen. Michael Nozzolio said
the Son of Sam law should be broadened to prevent any moneymaking
activities by inmates. He said Shawcross was able to sell his
merchandise ``because of his crime.''

Q: What are the some of the new Internet sites that provide useful
information for entrepreneurs?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Web sites are popping up like porcinis, but not all of them are
palatable. There's a lot of information but often it is not
pertinent. And the site may have a hidden agenda, such as selling
you products or services or extracting personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is an increasing array of useful sites. Here
are a few of the newcomers:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Allbizdepot.com _ This Milpitas company launched its Web site
(www.allbizdepot.com) a week ago to offer free resources to
entrepreneurs. Its list of and connections to government resources
_ from federal agencies to the smallest California counties _ is
terrific.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it has the most comprehensive nationwide
directory of business-to-business services with thousands of links.
It also lets members download software and business forms for free,
post their own Web page and job listings and take advantage of
discounts on products and services offered by its online business
partners.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Allbusiness.com _ This San Francisco startup will launch its Web
site (www.allbusiness.com) this month. Started by Netscape veterans
and backed by Technology Crossover Ventures and other VC firms,
this company also intends to be the leading Web destination for
entrepreneurs looking for business information, services and
products.
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of other companies such as Bigstep.com and Onvia also
are striving to be the first stop for entrepreneurs wading into
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _Silicon Valley Bank _ The institution has launched a great
information site for high-tech startups (esource.svb.com). The only
problem is that you have to be a customer of the bank or a prospect
to access the information, which includes tips on recruiting,
employee benefits, space planning and real estate rental and
vacancy rates in the Bay Area and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some other useful small business Web sites with excellent links
to online resources are www.workingsolo.com, which also answers
startup questions and publishes a free monthly newsletter, and
Krislyn's Strictly Business Sites at
sites.krislyn.com/smallbiz.htm.
</P>
<P>
   If you like to do your own online hunting, two of my favorite
new search engines are Google (www.google.com) and LookSmart
(www.looksmart.com). The former, developed by Stanford graduate
students, uses sophisticated text-matching techniques to find pages
that are both important and relevant to your search so you don't
have to sift through so much junk. LookSmart of San Francisco has a
200-person editorial staff to cull and categorize the best sites.

   SACKLER-ASSESS (Washington) _ When the Smithsonian Institution
announced this month that a trove of Chinese art amassed over
nearly 60 years by an American collector, Dr. Paul Singer
(1904-1997), had been given to the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery here,
the details were rather staggering. It amounts to more than 5,000
objects, with a value estimated at $60 million, though, in fact, an
item-by-item assessment of the material is only just beginning. The
gift more than doubles the existing collection of the Sackler
Gallery, which was established in 1987 and constitutes, with the
neighboring Freer Gallery, the national museum of Asian art in the
United States. And in a stroke it transforms the Freer and the
Sackler into the largest repository for Chinese archaeological

pitted, single lane mountain road, with nothing above us and the
Mediterranean a sharp descent below. The road snaked around the
mountain and eventually delivered us at the base of a sunny, narrow
cove. There was an empty beach, a rundown shack and a small villa
wedged into the hillside. This was El Bulli. This was the Michelin
three-star restaurant everyone was talking about. The one that six
top American chefs _ Charlie Trotter, Todd English, Norman Van
Aken, Roberto Donna, Jean Louis Palladin and Douglas Rodriguez _
would all flock to this same week and the next, not for an event

<P>
   NY-CORNED-BEEF (New York) _ When I first came to New York, at
17, I pestered the school friend I was visiting until he took me to
Lindy's for corned beef and cheesecake. I figured that that was the
closest an Ohio kid was likely to get to the fragrant, seductively
shady world of Damon Runyon and Walter Winchell. Now newcomers to
New York _ not 17-year-olds, I guess, but 21- and 22-year-olds _
angle for tables at Balthazar or Nobu. Pals initiate them to Krug
instead of cream soda. Corned beef is alive and well, of course. It
shows up around the world, in one guise or another. But in New
York, where once it was king, good kosher-style corned beef is as
rare as nightingales' tongues. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ This oil-rich country was once known as the
``Saudi Arabia of South America.''
</P>
<P>
   Flush with revenues from the largest petroleum reserves outside
the Middle East, Venezuela rocketed to prosperity in the 1970s, its
per-capita income rising to the highest levels in all of Latin
America. Caracas boomed with towering skyscrapers, efficient new
highways and a subway system that shames New York City's.
</P>
<P>
   The country's growing middle class sent their children to
college at home and abroad, while hopping weekend flights to Miami
for shopping and entertainment sprees.
</P>
<P>
   But just as quickly as the oil bonanza appeared, the bubble
burst. Declining oil prices in the 1980s and 1990s have cast a pall
over a country that earns 80 percent of its export revenues from
petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment crept up, while an inflation surge in recent years
stifled purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   The situation reached a crisis in recent months as gross
domestic product, or GDP, contracted by nearly 10 percent for the
second consecutive quarter and unemployment jumped to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Venezuelans don't blame the vagaries of the market for their
problems: instead they place the fault squarely at the feet of the
country's politicians, saying they have squandered the prosperity
this nation tasted only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so angry with these politicians they want to kill
them,'' said Johnny Mendez, a Caracas taxi driver. ``The hate we
have here is so big. Eighty percent or our people are poor, but
they know Venezuela is a very rich country. The politicians have
stolen it from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Such anger is widespread, and fueled the rise of President Hugo
Chavez. Jailed after a failed coup attempt in 1992, Chavez
sidestepped the two major parties in a campaign last year that
swept him into office in a landslide. He promised a ``peaceful
revolution'' that would chase the corrupt and inept out of
government, while rebuilding the nation's institutions with a new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has worried international observers with his inflammatory
rhetoric, his friendship with Cuba's Fidel Castro and his duels
with the Venezuelan Congress. Some fear he is headed toward a
familiar role: the South American strong man, or ``caudillo,''
usually a military man who steps in and runs an ailing country with
a strong hand but little regard for the niceties of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But talk to Venezuelans in the street and they'll tell you they
want just such a leader _ a man with a ``mano dura,'' a ``firm
hand.'' Americans just don't understand, they say, because they've
never seen the levels of corruption and mismanagement familiar in
too many Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Americans think a dictator is like Fidel Castro,'' Mendez
said. ``But that's not what we mean. We want a dictator like Marcos
Perez Jiminez ,'' a Venezuelan caudillo in the 1940s who is
credited with setting the country on the path to modern prosperity.
``Democracy as we've had it has done no good. It's been a license
for the elite to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite a tumultuous first six months in office, Chavez
still draws enthusiastic crowds wherever he goes, and seems to
relish his populist image. A baseball player as a youth, he has
tossed pitches to visiting major-leaguers. He donates his salary to
a scholarship fund, visits poor neighborhoods and has done away
with a $100 school registration fee that prompted an enrollment
jump of 600,000 students in Venezuela's schools.
</P>
<P>
   He started a program that has put the nation's army to work
helping build schools and make other social improvements, and has
proposed a new agency that would make easy credit available to
mom-and-pop businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even if such efforts are a drop in the bucket compared to the
nation's labyrinth of problems, their symbolism isn't wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings us great hope,'' said Alexis Martinez, a Caracas
resident. ``He's tossing out the immorality and corruption of the
past 40 years, and he's helping the people who have been
marginalized for all those years.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's story is typical in recession-stricken Venezuela. For
seven years, he had a good job as a security guard, earning the
equivalent of about $500 a month. But his company cut back and laid
him off, so he has scrambled to start a new business sewing
clothes, learning the skill from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez will give us loans,'' he said. ``He's a man of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosana Sojo has also had employment problems. After graduating
last year from secretarial school, she could find no work in the
worsening economic climate. Now she sells lottery tickets on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Chavez because he doesn't waste time,'' she said. ``He
doesn't fall for anything. But now he must fulfill what he has
promised.''
</P>
<P>
   That caveat is clearly Chavez's biggest challenge. Having risen
to power by promising a radical break from the politics of the
past, he must also manage to turn around the nation's battered
economy. He has been helped by a recent jump in oil prices, which
has cut the nation's budget deficit, but he has also spooked
badly-needed foreign investment with inflammatory speeches about
turning back the clock on free markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has gained the status of God,'' Chavez told
reporters on a recent visit to Brazil. ``We, the leaders, are going
from summit to summit, and our people are going from abyss to
abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Chavez fails, if the economy fails to turn around,
Venezuelans say they won't regret giving the outspoken leader a
try. Things were so bad, they say, that any kind of change is an
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you tear down the house, there is dust and dirt,''
Martinez said. ``But if we tried to build a new Venezuela on a
rotten foundation, it would only fall.''

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ One week he's touring a poor neighborhood
where soldiers he has ordered out of the barracks are helping build
a new school for impoverished children. The next he's shuffling top
management at one of the hemisphere's major oil companies, sending
ripples through world markets.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he's unveiling a plan to jumpstart the faltering
small-business sector with a new credit agency. Then he's back to
sparring with the country's Congress, asserting the authority of an
assembly that aims to tear up the constitution and rebuild the
nation's political institutions from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Visionary social reformer or would-be dictator: both labels have
flown around Venezuela's breathless new president, Hugo Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation reeling from its worst recession in memory, in a
region rumbling with turmoil Chavez has shaken things up. After
leading a failed coup attempt in 1992, his landslide election
victory last fall and break-neck first six months in office have
captured the imagination of millions of Latin Americans while
unsettling business interests and stirring a buzz in diplomatic
circles from Washington to Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez is almost a mythical figure,'' said Carlos Sabino, a
sociologist at the Central University of Venezuela and longtime
observer of the country's politics. ``He is not cultured, but he is
very sharp. He proudly calls himself 'pata en el suelo,' which
means barefoot peasant, but he wears a red beret and some people
call him the Rambo of Venezuela. He is strong but humble. He is an
intuitive political animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Chavez takes his country of 23 million residents is a
matter of keen interest for Latin America-watchers. After a wave of
oil-fueled economic progress in the 1980s that was accompanied by a
shift toward free elections and away from oppressive dictatorships,
the region has plunged back into uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an experiment-in-the-making that's very important for all
of Latin America,'' said Jennifer McCoy, a Georgia State University
political scientist and director of the Carter Center's Latin
American programs. ``I think Chavez sincerely wants to help the
people and to create a democracy that is more responsive and
participatory. The risk is that if you rely too heavily on a large
mandate and popularity, you can lose sight of the checks and
balances that ensure power is shared among the different levels and
branches of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Several top Venezuelan officials were scheduled to meet with
Carter Center officials Sept. 17(CQ) in Atlanta to discuss their
effort to draw up a new constitution. Earlier in the week, the
delegation also was to meet with officials from the United Nations,
the U.S. Congress and Chase Manhattan Bank in an effort to counter
what they feel has been a wave of critical media reports about the
situation in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to provide them with the effective reality of what
is happening here and not the distorted (reality) that has been
published in some cases,'' Luis Miquilena, head of the National
Constitutional Assembly, told reporters here in Caracas before
departing for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have expressed concern over the country's
political instability, with a State Department spokesman urging the
preservation of democracy in Venezuela ``in substance as well as in
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns peaked earlier this month when members of the Assembly
_ a body elected in July and salted heavily with Chavez supporters
_ clashed with the nation's Congress. After a series of Assembly
decrees left the Congress nearly powerless, tensions flared as
frustrated members of the Congress scaled the fence to get back
into the building from which they had been barred.
</P>
<P>
   An uneasy truce emerged on Sept. 10 when the two bodies reached
an agreement brokered by the Catholic Church. The Congress will be
allowed to reconvene in October, while the Assembly will
concentrate on writing the new constitution, which could go to
voters for approval as early as December. Elections for a new
Congress would presumably be held shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the upheaval, Chavez has maintained his stunning
popularity, with opinion polls showing a consistent 70 percent
approval rating. Observers say his message of cleaning up a
notoriously corrupt political system and sharing the nation's
abundant oil wealth with the people has struck a profound chord
with a populace frustrated by a near 30-year decline in prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But things have gotten worse since Chavez took office. In recent
months, unemployment has skyrocketed to 20 percent, with some
estimating it may soar to 50 percent by the end of the year.
Economic output has shrunk dramatically, declining nearly 10
percent in the first half of 1999, while foreign investment has
dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our state is very rich, but our government in the past has
behaved as if it were the owners of these riches, not the
administrators,'' said Vicente Britos, head of Fedecamaras, the
national association of Venezuelan Chambers of Commerce. ``The
government has an obligation to guarantee that a considerable
amount of these riches are transferred to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 45, has built his political career on a promise to do
just that. Raised in Venezuela's interior, a rugged region of
cattle farms, he came from a family of poor schoolteachers. He made
his career in the military, rising to the rank of colonel in a
paratroop division.
</P>
<P>
   His coup attempt in 1992 ended in failure and he was jailed for
two years. After his release, he quietly began barnstorming the
countryside, hammering away about the need to toss out the corrupt
system built by the two political parties that have dominated
Venezuelan politics since the first free elections in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The message proved wildly popular. Venezuelans, who elected
Chavez in a landslide last November, are outraged that their
resource-rich country now suffers widespread poverty, with some
estimates showing as much as 80 percent of the population below the
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   The government, meanwhile, has become bloated with more than a
million employees, with rampant corruption at all levels. Many
agencies reportedly have no record of where their appropriations
go, while bureaucratic red-tape strangles attempts to start new
industries. There is a widespread belief that crooked politicians
have frittered away the nation's wealth. ``People want a savior, a
magical solution, and that's what Chavez offers,'' said Sabino.
``But that's where the contradictions lie. Chavez is a populist, a
leftist, but he understands he must have a strong economy and
foreign investment, and he can't get these without the facade of
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who took office in February, adamantly insists he has no
designs to set himself up as a dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one here can say they are persecuted _ absolutely no one _
by the government,'' he told reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers have compared Chavez to Peru's President Alberto
Fujimori, who swept to power in a crisis-wracked country in the
early 1990s, tossing out the existing government with army backing.
But some draw distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that Chavez, after failing to take power
illegally by a coup, has come back legally through elections,''
McCoy said. ``I think he is a new model. He has an elected
constitutional assembly that is asserting its powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear the assembly is little more than a rubber-stamp,
and that Chavez is moving toward an authoritarian regime. He has
proposed expanding the president's term to six years and allowing a
second term.
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern over some of his rhetoric and friendships:
Chavez appears to have close ties to Cuba's Fidel Castro, and has
invited Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Moammar Ghaddafi to an
oil summit in Venezuela next year. He even penned a friendly letter
to an infamous Venezuelan-born terrorist, ``Carlos the Jackal,''
who is serving a life term in a French prison.
</P>
<P>
   But any missteps perceived abroad are lost on Venezuelan voters,
many of whom seem captivated by Chavez's whirlwind pace working for
what he calls a ``peaceful revolution.'' He has cut government
spending, put the army to work on social programs, and solidified
his populist image with moves like getting rid of the presidential
limousine and turning over his $1,200-a-month salary to a
scholarship fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to raise the flag of tyranny,'' he has told
reporters. ``Our intention is to rebuild institutions, to
strengthen democracy. We respect our adversaries and their ideas.
We respect liberties. We persecute no one.''
</P>
<P>
   But just how long Chavez's popularity will hold up in the face
of the economic crisis remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have hopes, high hopes, and they will give him a chance
for a time,'' said Sabino, the sociologist. ``But how much longer
people can bear the situation I don't know. I think we will know
when the new constitution is in place. By the spring we will know
which way Chavez really will take us.''

<P>
   TIPS FOR TRAVELERS TO PUERTO RICO:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING THERE: Air connections are good to Luis Munoz Marin
International Airport in San Juan, with American Airlines the
dominant carrier from the U.S. Delta, TWA and United also fly
there. Cruise ships also dock in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING AROUND: Puerto Rico is served by all the major
American car rental companies, which have desks at the
international airport. Rates are comparable to within the U.S.,
with a full-size car going for about $50 a day. Taxis are numerous,
but can get expensive if you move around much. Driving a rental car
isn't a problem _ roads are well-marked with good signals, although
parking can be tough to find in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MONEY: Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the U.S. and uses
American dollars, making things very easy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TRAVEL DOCUMENTS: None required for U.S. citizens entering
from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  LANGUAGE _ Spanish is most common, of course, but nearly
everyone, it seems, speaks English, especially if they work in the
tourism industry. In the countryside a phrasebook would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CLIMATE _ Tropical, but surprisingly mild. The seabreeze keeps
things relatively cool, although be prepared with plenty of
sunscreen if you plan a beach visit. Average daily high
temperatures in San Juan are a mild 81 degrees in August, a
pleasant 75 degrees in January.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SECURITY _ Like most states with a significant population of
poor, petty theft is present. Use common sense and don't leave bags
unattended at the beach or airport. Don't flash big wads of cash in
public places and don't leave items inside a parked car; lock them
in the trunk or leave them at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHERE TO STAY _ For beachtime, Isla Verde near the airport has
plenty of new, modern hotels, some with casinos. This is about 10
miles from the historic Old San Juan district. The Condado is
another beach district closer to Old San Juan, but many of the
properties here are in the midst of remodeling. Old San Juan
features a few hotels, including a new, upscale Wyndham; a charming
converted nunnery called El Convento and a few smaller properties.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  OLD SAN JUAN TIPS _ If you drive in, park in one of the
municipal parking garages noted on most tourist maps. The streets
are too narrow and maze-like and parking is too much of a hassle
otherwise. Walking the district is a delight and not too taxing,
but wear comfortable shoes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  EATING OUT _ Puerto Rican food is a delightful mix of
Caribbean, European and Creole, and is served at fine restaurants,
many of which are in hotels. Every conceivable variety of American
fast-food is also available _ and ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  OTHER ACTIVITIES _ Scuba diving and snorkeling are excellent
and can be arranged through travel agents. Touring the small island
in a car can take a day or more, but will give you the flavor of
the old Puerto Rico of small farms and villages. Sidetrips to El
Yunque, a mountainous tropical rainforest, and the Arecibo
Observatory, a giant radio telescope where NASA searches for
extra-terrestrial life, are highly recommended.

<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ You sort of feel sorry for them.
Pasty-white tourists who arrive at Luis Munoz Marin International
Airport and go straight by shuttle bus to the shadowy confines of
the opulent casino-hotels that line large sections of the
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Days later they stagger back on the bus, pockets either bulging
with winnings or more likely picked clean by the ubiquitous slot
machines, and jet away back home, their Puerto Rican vacation a
cloistered, gambler's binge.
</P>
<P>
   You even feel a bit sorry for the ones who venture outside but
go no farther than the gorgeous _ but building-lined _ beaches of
Isla Verde or Condado, San Juan's two thriving beach districts.
</P>
<P>
   Because if beaches and blackjack are all you get out of a Puerto
Rican vacation, you're missing some of the most intriguing,
picturesque history this hemisphere has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Old San Juan _ a 20-square-block district of cozy streets, shady
plazas and Spanish colonial architectural gems _ beckons with
Caribbean lore and legend, a window into the fascinating early
years of European discovery and conquest.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't always a pretty history, what with massacres of native
Indians, vicious battles among warring empires and centuries of
exploitation. But the setting couldn't be more eye-grabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1521, the city perches atop a narrow, rocky island
guarding the mouth of San Juan Bay. Look inland and the vast bay
spreads out like a tableau, the modern San Juan suburbs rising in
the middle ground and Puerto Rico's green, forested mountains
towering in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Look seaward and the Atlantic Ocean crashes into the rocky coast
at the city's feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish were master fort-builders, and their handiwork
abounds in San Juan. Most of the island is ringed by a massive,
20-foot-thick wall, in places topped by streets, parks and plazas,
or dramatic buildings like La Fortaleza.
</P>
<P>
   Built in the 1830s to defend the bay, it was transformed over
the years into the residence and offices of the island's governor,
and now holds the distinction as the oldest continuously-occupied
executive mansion in the New World. Daily tours offer a peek into
non-working parts of the mansion, including the stunningly tiled
courtyard surrounded by arched-and-columned walkways.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks up the hill from La Fortaleza, through a small
plaza and up a shaded street with dramatic views of the bay,
visitors suddenly find a broad grassy field that leads to Castillo
San Felipe del Morro, a massive fort dominating the bay's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Known simply as ``El Morro,'' this huge fort has six levels of
gun decks and monstrous walls broken by battlements and turrets.
Built over several decades in the mid-1500s, it towers 140 feet
above the Atlantic. Through the years, Spanish soldiers used it to
repel attacks by competing empires, repulsing such luminaries as
Britain's Sir Francis Drake.
</P>
<P>
   The view from El Morro's battlements down San Juan's Atlantic
waterfront is breath-taking, with white-capped waves crashing on
the rocky shore. San Juan Cemetery, featuring elaborate statuary
and bone-white crosses, dominates the foreground, hugging a rocky
cliff. The city's wall stretches into the distance, leading to El
Castillo de San Cristobal, yet another fort built to protect the
island's eastern fringes.
</P>
<P>
   Along with their war-making, the Spanish thrived at
cathedral-building, too, and San Juan Cathedral is a shining
example of their New World handiwork. Plain stucco walls on the
outside give way to a vaulted, tiled interior where religious icons
and statues line the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon _ discoverer of Florida but
also Puerto Rico's first governor _ lies interred here, his remains
guarded by a virgin warrior. He may have needed her help when he
was alive: de Leon had running political battles with Christopher
Columbus' son, Diego, who felt his father's discovery of the place
on his second voyage in 1493 entitled him to rule Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   If 500-year-old politics gives you a headache, you can find
respite only a block away from de Leon's grave at El Convento. No
vows required for entry today, the place was built as a Carmelite
nunnery in 1651 but was converted this century into one of the
district's finest hotels. Dinner and drinks in the courtyard
restaurant are a treat, with formally-dressed waiters who give the
best in European-style service.
</P>
<P>
   But Old San Juan offers more than just history.
</P>
<P>
   Art-lovers will find numerous small galleries and antique shops,
often tucked into the courtyards of buildings with gorgeous iron
balconies and weathered wooden shutters. There is also upscale
shopping, with boutiques offering fine clothing and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   You can even bird-watch in Old San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Parque de las Palomas _ Pigeon Park _ offers close encounters of
the feathered kind, as hundreds of pigeons wait each day for
tourist hand-outs, often flocking all over the people feeding them.
If Alfred Hitchcock's ``The Birds'' gave you shivers, keep your
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to avoid is driving inside the district. The
narrow streets can turn into a maze best left to locals. If you're
staying at the beach, taxi in or take a rental car and park it in
one of the several municipal parking garages on the district's
fringes.
</P>
<P>
   The area is a delight to walk, even on hot summer days, as the
seabreeze keeps San Juan several degrees cooler than spots like
Miami or Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   So even if gambling or beach-combing is the main aim of your
Puerto Rican sojourn, consider at least a daytrip to Historic Old
San Juan. The jackpots may be of a different variety, but the odds
are better that you'll go home with something to show from your
trip.

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ You sort of feel sorry for them.
Pasty-white tourists who arrive at Luis Munoz Marin International
Airport and go straight by shuttle bus to the shadowy confines of
the opulent casino-hotels that line large sections of the
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Days later they stagger back on the bus, pockets either bulging
with winnings or more likely picked clean by the ubiquitous slot
machines, and jet away back home, their Puerto Rican vacation a
cloistered, gambler's binge.
</P>
<P>
   You even feel a bit sorry for the ones who venture outside but
go no farther than the gorgeous _ but building-lined _ beaches of
Isla Verde or Condado, San Juan's two thriving beach districts.
</P>
<P>
   Because if beaches and blackjack are all you get out of a Puerto
Rican vacation, you're missing some of the most intriguing,
picturesque history this hemisphere has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Old San Juan _ a 20-square-block district of cozy streets, shady
plazas and Spanish colonial architectural gems _ beckons with
Caribbean lore and legend, a window into the fascinating early
years of European discovery and conquest.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't always a pretty history, what with massacres of native
Indians, vicious battles among warring empires and centuries of
exploitation. But the setting couldn't be more eye-grabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1521, the city perches atop a narrow, rocky island
guarding the mouth of San Juan Bay. Look inland and the vast bay
spreads out like a tableau, the modern San Juan suburbs rising in
the middle ground and Puerto Rico's green, forested mountains
towering in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Look seaward and the Atlantic Ocean crashes into the rocky coast
at the city's feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish were master fort-builders, and their handiwork
abounds in San Juan. Most of the island is ringed by a massive,
20-foot-thick wall, in places topped by streets, parks and plazas,
or dramatic buildings like La Fortaleza.
</P>
<P>
   Built in the 1830s to defend the bay, it was transformed over
the years into the residence and offices of the island's governor,
and now holds the distinction as the oldest continuously-occupied
executive mansion in the New World. Daily tours offer a peek into
non-working parts of the mansion, including the stunningly tiled
courtyard surrounded by arched-and-columned walkways.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks up the hill from La Fortaleza, through a small
plaza and up a shaded street with dramatic views of the bay,
visitors suddenly find a broad grassy field that leads to Castillo
San Felipe del Morro, a massive fort dominating the bay's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Known simply as ``El Morro,'' this huge fort has six levels of
gun decks and monstrous walls broken by battlements and turrets.
Built over several decades in the mid-1500s, it towers 140 feet
above the Atlantic. Through the years, Spanish soldiers used it to
repel attacks by competing empires, repulsing such luminaries as
Britain's Sir Francis Drake.
</P>
<P>
   The view from El Morro's battlements down San Juan's Atlantic
waterfront is breath-taking, with white-capped waves crashing on
the rocky shore. San Juan Cemetery, featuring elaborate statuary
and bone-white crosses, dominates the foreground, hugging a rocky
cliff. The city's wall stretches into the distance, leading to El
Castillo de San Cristobal, yet another fort built to protect the
island's eastern fringes.
</P>
<P>
   Along with their war-making, the Spanish thrived at
cathedral-building, too, and San Juan Cathedral is a shining
example of their New World handiwork. Plain stucco walls on the
outside give way to a vaulted, tiled interior where religious icons
and statues line the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon _ discoverer of Florida but
also Puerto Rico's first governor _ lies interred here, his remains
guarded by a virgin warrior. He may have needed her help when he
was alive: de Leon had running political battles with Christopher
Columbus' son, Diego, who felt his father's discovery of the place
on his second voyage in 1493 entitled him to rule Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   If 500-year-old politics gives you a headache, you can find
respite only a block away from de Leon's grave at El Convento. No
vows required for entry today, the place was built as a Carmelite
nunnery in 1651 but was converted this century into one of the
district's finest hotels. Dinner and drinks in the courtyard
restaurant are a treat, with formally-dressed waiters who give the
best in European-style service.
</P>
<P>
   But Old San Juan offers more than just history.
</P>
<P>
   Art-lovers will find numerous small galleries and antique shops,
often tucked into the courtyards of buildings with gorgeous iron
balconies and weathered wooden shutters. There is also upscale
shopping, with boutiques offering fine clothing and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   You can even bird-watch in Old San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Parque de las Palomas _ Pigeon Park _ offers close encounters of
the feathered kind, as hundreds of pigeons wait each day for
tourist hand-outs, often flocking all over the people feeding them.
If Alfred Hitchcock's ``The Birds'' gave you shivers, keep your
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to avoid is driving inside the district. The
narrow streets can turn into a maze best left to locals. If you're
staying at the beach, taxi in or take a rental car and park it in
one of the several municipal parking garages on the district's
fringes.
</P>
<P>
   The area is a delight to walk, even on hot summer days, as the
seabreeze keeps San Juan several degrees cooler than spots like
Miami or Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   So even if gambling or beach-combing is the main aim of your
Puerto Rican sojourn, consider at least a daytrip to Historic Old
San Juan. The jackpots may be of a different variety, but the odds
are better that you'll go home with something to show from your
trip.

   TIPS FOR TRAVELERS TO PUERTO RICO:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING THERE: Air connections are good to Luis Munoz Marin
International Airport in San Juan, with American Airlines the
dominant carrier from the U.S. Delta, TWA and United also fly
there. Cruise ships also dock in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING AROUND: Puerto Rico is served by all the major
American car rental companies, which have desks at the
international airport. Rates are comparable to within the U.S.,
with a full-size car going for about $50 a day. Taxis are numerous,
but can get expensive if you move around much. Driving a rental car
isn't a problem _ roads are well-marked with good signals, although
parking can be tough to find in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MONEY: Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the U.S. and uses
American dollars, making things very easy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TRAVEL DOCUMENTS: None required for U.S. citizens entering
from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  LANGUAGE _ Spanish is most common, of course, but nearly
everyone, it seems, speaks English, especially if they work in the
tourism industry. In the countryside a phrasebook would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CLIMATE _ Tropical, but surprisingly mild. The seabreeze keeps
things relatively cool, although be prepared with plenty of
sunscreen if you plan a beach visit. Average daily high
temperatures in San Juan are a mild 81 degrees in August, a
pleasant 75 degrees in January.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SECURITY _ Like most states with a significant population of
poor, petty theft is present. Use common sense and don't leave bags
unattended at the beach or airport. Don't flash big wads of cash in
public places and don't leave items inside a parked car; lock them
in the trunk or leave them at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHERE TO STAY _ For beachtime, Isla Verde near the airport has
plenty of new, modern hotels, some with casinos. This is about 10
miles from the historic Old San Juan district. The Condado is
another beach district closer to Old San Juan, but many of the
properties here are in the midst of remodeling. Old San Juan
features a few hotels, including a new, upscale Wyndham; a charming
converted nunnery called El Convento and a few smaller properties.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  OLD SAN JUAN TIPS _ If you drive in, park in one of the
municipal parking garages noted on most tourist maps. The streets
are too narrow and maze-like and parking is too much of a hassle
otherwise. Walking the district is a delight and not too taxing,
but wear comfortable shoes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  EATING OUT _ Puerto Rican food is a delightful mix of
Caribbean, European and Creole, and is served at fine restaurants,
many of which are in hotels. Every conceivable variety of American
fast-food is also available _ and ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  OTHER ACTIVITIES _ Scuba diving and snorkeling are excellent
and can be arranged through travel agents. Touring the small island
in a car can take a day or more, but will give you the flavor of
the old Puerto Rico of small farms and villages. Sidetrips to El
Yunque, a mountainous tropical rainforest, and the Arecibo
Observatory, a giant radio telescope where NASA searches for
extra-terrestrial life, are highly recommended.

<P>
   MAJDAL SHAMS, Golan Heights _ The land is governed by Israel,
but Syrian President Hafez Assad carries the day in Afif Mahmoud's
barber shop.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian leader stares down from a portrait photograph on the
wall. Pictured nearby is the late Egyptian President Gamel Abdel
Nasser, the champion of Arab defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our leaders,'' said barber Mahmoud, 60. ``Everybody
here feels Syrian, not just me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Israelis consider whether to include the Golan Heights in
a peace offering to Syria, Mahmoud is among thousands of Golan
Arabs who say they are anxious for the day when Syria will again be
in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Syria used to use the Golan Heights to stage artillery attacks
on Israeli towns below. Israel conquered the plateau in 1967,
leading to the flight of tens of thousands of Syrians who lived
here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, new Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak promises to resolve
Israel's disputes and the aging Assad is reportedly anxious to get
the Golan back.
</P>
<P>
   About 16,000 Arabs live there, in separate towns from the 17,000
Israelis who have come to the Golan since 1967. Half the Arabs live
in this mountain-top town of Majdal Shams, just about a mile from
the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Arabs here are Druze, a secretive offshoot of Islam.
They are not as wealthy as their Jewish neighbors, but apparently
in better condition than Palestinians in the West Bank and The Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Palestinians under Israeli occupation, Golan Arabs
seem less openly bitter, perhaps because they have long expected to
someday return to Syrian control.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the occupation is barely visible here, but that it
pains them emotionally. The vast majority refuse Israeli
citizenship and those who take it are often ostracized.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis often say that the Druze in the Golan express support
for Syria only out of fear that Syrian security forces will someday
control the region. But, the Druze seem convincing.
</P>
<P>
   They say they are aware that Syria is dominated by a network of
secret police and has tight controls on everything from fax
machines to cellular telephones. They know, also, of Syria's sickly
socialist economy.
</P>
<P>
   But they say they will never feel like first-class citizens in
the Jewish state and they would rather be in Syria, where many have
relatives, despite its restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can take everything, even my cellular telephone,'' says
Talae Abu Akd, a 21-year-old Druze in jeans and black T-shirt,
while having a falafel sandwich. ``But, I'll be in my country. I
just want to feel better and see my family. Everything else is not
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Most long to see relatives in Syria and several hundred each
year are allowed to go to colleges there. They call relatives by
telephone or shout to them through megaphones on the border.
</P>
<P>
   They complain that Israel has confiscated most of their land and
appoints their municipal leaders.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In a bookstore stocked with school texts and Ninja Turtle
backpacks, owner Sakr Kang Abu Saleh gestures to his 12-year-old
son, Hilal, to explain the loyalty to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy in Israel is not equal. We don't have the same
democracy as others,'' he says. ``What I would call democracy is
when my son grows up in his own country and can be what anyone can
be, like a pilot or a government minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Those jobs in Israel almost never go to Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Saleh hopes merchants like him will be key intermediaries
between the Israeli and Syrian economies. At home, though, he makes
his choice known with the Syrian flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make clear to our children that that is our
country,'' he says.

   KIBBUTZ METZAR, Golan Heights _ Peace in the Middle East may
require Israelis to give up their peaceful lives in this plateau of
farmlands and war memorials.
</P>
<P>
   At this small communal farm, children are safe to run the
grounds alone, the air is clear and the water pure.
</P>
<P>
   But, there are reminders that this is disputed land. The stucco
duplexes are clustered around stone bomb shelters. A minefield is
nearby and Syria, the nation that wants this land back, looms just
across a valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to stay in the Golan, but we know it's not
realistic,'' says Rivka Dadon, 28, sitting with friends around a
picnic table. ``It's not fair, but if they tell me to go I will
go.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more, Israelis like Dadon see the political forces
turning against them and the homes they love.
</P>
<P>
   New Prime Minister Ehud Barak has vowed to make peace and Syrian
President Hafez Assad is said to be aging and eager for a deal.
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright this month came to the
region to try to start direct talks between them. U.S. officials
have hinted that the Golan will likely be the price for a deal with
Assad.
</P>
<P>
   The Golan Heights is a plateau graced with crop lands and
vineyards, but scarred by abandoned Syrian villages and Israeli war
memorials of twisted scrap metal.
</P>
<P>
   From this strategic high ground, Syria used to shell Israeli
towns below. Israel captured it in the 1967 war and held it in the
1973 war. As small as Rhode Island, the Golan saw more than 6,000
Syrians and almost 900 Israelis fall in just a few days of
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   About 17,000 Israelis live their now. Many came for the rural
serenity and the free land Israel offered as an enticement to
settle there. On rolling landscapes reminiscent of the American
West, they grow fruit, make popular dry wines and host thousands of
tourists from central Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Golan is also a land that tens of thousands _ estimates
range from 40,000 to 100,000 _ of Syrians fled during the fighting
in 1967. About 16,000 live there now.
</P>
<P>
   Most refuse Israeli citizenship and complain that Israelis now
inhabit and farm their family estates.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel claims the Golan Heights as part of Israel, the
United States, along with most of the world, considers it occupied
territory.
</P>
<P>
   But, there seems to be a mandate for peace. Even most Golan
residents voted for Barak knowing that he might withdraw from the
land where they've made their home.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show most Israelis clearly oppose a full withdrawal while
a majority might favor a partial pullback. However, if put to them
in a referendum as part of a deal with Syria _ as Barak promises _
Israelis would likely vote to hand over the land.
</P>
<P>
   Golan activists say that would be a tragedy. They say the land
provides Israel with security and much of its water supply. Others
counter that those concerns can be worked out with international
peacekeepers and a water treaty.
</P>
<P>
   To the chagrin of Golan residents, the Israeli attachment to the
region seems to be wavering as Israel tries to settle disputes with
its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my country left me,'' Ronen Maroni, 28, who bought
a house in the Golan just 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis have another front on their minds. The Golan is
seen as the key to ending Israel's unpopular 17-year war in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel occupies southern Lebanon to protect its border from the
Hezbollah guerrillas there. Syria controls Lebanon and it is
expected _ but not certain _ that Assad would rein in Hezbollah if
he could finally recover the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   The equation is simple for one of the Golan's pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that making peace and staying in the Golan is
just not practical,'' says Yoav Tsur, who came here 20 years ago
and helps run electric-generating wind turbines. Golan landmarks,
they tower like giant pinwheels near the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself first an Israeli and second a Golan
resident,'' says Tsur, 44. ``I have to do what is best for my
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Most residents disagree with Tsur, even refusing to talk about
whether they would accept possible government compensation to leave
their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Israel leaves the Golan Heights, the Arabs in a few years
can destroy the whole country,'' says Sammy Bar Lev, mayor of
Qatzrin, the Golan's biggest town.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can and here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A residents' committee is running a publicity campaign to hammer
home that point to their fellow Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The residents' case is based on distrust of Assad and is helped
by the Syrian president's demand that peace talks cannot start
until Israel agrees in principle to return the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of solutions once the two sides are
interested in a real peace,'' Avi Zeira, head of the Golan
Residents Committee, said. ``Syria is not interested in real
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But, outsiders say a safe deal can be made.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent trip to Jerusalem, U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
who has met with Assad several times since the mid-1980s, called
the security and water supply concerns ``details'' that can be
solved.
</P>
<P>
   The question, Specter said, is whether Israel is ready to part
with the land.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Israelis are split _ even within their own families.
</P>
<P>
   While Rivka Dadon, the Kibbutz Metzar kindergarten teacher, is
resigned to the prospect of a sad departure, her husband, named
Golan, is digging in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll get me out over my dead body,'' he says. ``We fought
on this land too much and lost too many soldiers to leave this
place.''
</P>

 &HT;    GHB: Makers of drug duck FDA regulationsBy Christopher Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is labeled as a solvent and sold by the shot in
some bars.
</P>
<P>
   Some people get it at vitamin and health food stores.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be 21 to buy it, but it packs a wallop that
leaves an estimated five to 10 people a day in Atlanta emergency
rooms, many of them comatose.
</P>
<P>
   When an Alpharetta, Ga., teenager overdosed on gamma
hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, recently, it sparked an investigation into
the drug's availability that is still continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration banned uncontrolled sales of
GHB in 1990, but sellers have found ways around the law. Some sell
the ingredients to make the easily formulated drug. Others sell
slightly altered legal chemical compounds, called GBL, BD or
2(3H)-Furanone di-hydro.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert J. Geller, the medical director of the Georgia Poison
Center, said that the active ingredients in those products turn
into GHB once ingested. They give the drinker the same euphoric
effects that make the drug popular among the rave party set and
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Those products are legally sold as solvents labeled with
healthful sounding names such as Vigorate, Enliven or Revivarant.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing standing between the distributors of those
products and FDA control is the thin paper label pasted onto the
front of the bottles. The FDA can only step in if the products are
sold or advertised for human consumption. Then it can fine or shut
down the distributors.
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor, a senior advisor for regulatory policy at the FDA,
said distributors know the FDA is watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have watched the labeling change based on the fact that the
industry is under a great deal of scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie and Bill Johnson of Alpharetta had never heard of GHB or
its related compounds until some friends of their 17-year-old
daughter Kelly brought her home unconscious last month.
</P>
<P>
   Their frightened questions about what had left their daughter
slumped in the seat of a car brought replies that may as well have
been in a foreign language. She and some of her friends drank from
a bottle of something called Vigorate. The bottle's label does not
have a manufacturers name on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was something they got at a health food store for
sleep deprivation,'' Bobbie Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the teenagers who brought Kelly home later told police
they drank it because a friends said it would get them high.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson's tried to wake Kelly, but she was unresponsive.
Bobbie Johnson dialed 911 and waited.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Johnson said there are no words to describe such a helpless
feeling of being unable to help his unconscious daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after paramedics arrived, Kelly's breathing slowed to a
dangerous level, a typical effect of an overdose. Paramedics put
her on a gurney, gave her oxygen and took her to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The paramedics told Bobbie Johnson they see it all the time. If
Kelly reacted like most to the overdose, she would wake up in a few
hours. She did.
</P>
<P>
   Others have not been so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA says more than 40 people have died from the effects of
the drug since the 1980s, including Michael Tiedemann in Florida
last year. Tiedemann, a 15-year-old honor roll student from Fort
Pierce, fell unconscious after taking GHB. He suffocated on his own
vomit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William McAlvany, an emergency room doctor at Atlanta's
Northside Hospital, said vomiting is a common side effect of the
drug. GHB can also depress breathing rates to dangerous levels,
which can starve the brain of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for him to see two to three cases a night.
Most are in their teens or 20s. Many come from bars, where they
have mixed GHB-based products with other drugs or drinking, which
makes the effects more potent and unpredictable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. J.C. Moore of the Fulton County police said, ``It's a deadly
game when you mix it with alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   When the FDA studied 32 cases of GHB related deaths, it found 24
of the dead had also been drinking or had taken other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and his squad have seen the drug mostly at dance clubs
among the teenage and college crowd. He also is familiar with the
legal substances that people buy to drink and said his officers are
powerless to stop the abuse.
</P>
<P>
   McAlvany said, ``It's amazing to me that this stuff is sold
casually all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the drug's ability to render a person comatose, there
have also been cases of it being used as a date rape drug, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Geller said that no one keeps reliable statistics on overdoses
because the products are not controlled substances. Some doctors
report them, others don't. He has some reports and estimated that
five to 10 people a day in Atlanta overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said her relief at Kelly's recovery turned to
exasperation at the teenagers and fury that they were able to get
the Vigorate. She does not understand why those products are not
regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said whether the sale is legal depends on how the product
is marketed. If a store clerk tells someone about its use to get
high, that is an illegal use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has begun to take some distributors to court, and there
is a bill in congress that will bring the products under FDA
control despite their labels.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson case attracted the attention of the Alpharetta
police.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Charles Fannon said that an undercover officer has visited
local stores and bought some of the solvents. The officer has asked
at the stores about drinking the substances and received advice, he
said. He said the investigation is not complete but he expects
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The undercover officer said the products containing the drugs
are usually kept out of sight and a person has to ask for them.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that the danger of drinking such products may be
lost on some because they are uncontrolled substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the minds of kids, I suspect that there is a perception
that a controlled substance is more serious than an non-controlled
one, even though at the end of the day, if it's scheduled or not,
it poses the same exact risk.''

 &HT;    Gimme that ol' time politics _ keep church and state separate
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Twoscore years ago voters debated whether the
United States was ready to elect the first Roman Catholic
president.
</P>
<P>
   John Fitzgerald Kennedy had good looks, charm, wit,
intelligence, a good education and a hero's war record, not to
mention a charming wife and a firm grasp of foreign and domestic
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy was a Catholic. Many Americans worried that Kennedy
might allow his personal religious beliefs to influence
presidential decisions made on behalf of the nation. Would the
Vatican call the shots in the White House?
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy understood these concerns. He addressed the issue
head-on. He respected the requirement to separate church and state
and would maintain that separation if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, 1999 presidential candidates feel the need to wear
their personal religious beliefs on their sleeves as a sign to
voters that their religion will indeed influence presidential
decisions they would make on behalf of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dylan was right. The times, they are a-changin' _ for the
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are not reluctant to show off their religious
credentials. Jimmy Carter, a Southern Baptist, talked about being
born again and admitted that he lusted in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, also a Southern Baptist, welcomes photo ops of him
in church or carrying a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore went so far as to set up a White House interview with
religion writers so they could spread the word about his religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last onescore years Republicans became the party most
eager to put their personal religious convictions on public
display.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan changed American politics when he made a quid pro
quo pact with America's religious right, a fervid assortment of
faiths that includes televangelists, evangelicals and traditional
religious conservatives who oppose Roe vs. Wade and abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Republican Party has become the bully pulpit for
evangelical religious beliefs with right-to-life a central dogma.
</P>
<P>
   Now Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan is
threatening to leave the Grand Old Party and take the religious
right and the right-to-lifers with him. He hints at running for
president in Ross Perot's Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are begging Buchanan to stay put. They fear
he will take enough votes with him to open the White House door for
another Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Republican leaders should send Buchanan a bouquet of
going-away flowers and tell him to not let the door hit him or his
Pitchfork Brigade in their backsides on their way out.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's conversion would ruin the Reform Party. But that's a
small price to pay if he siphons off into one high-octane container
all those voters who want to merge religion and state by
establishing their own religious tests as qualifications to hold
public office in America.
</P>
<P>
   Although he talks like a born-again evangelical fundamentalist,
Buchanan is an inflexible Roman Catholic who, unlike presidential
candidate Kennedy 40 years ago, desperately wants to combine church
and state in the White House and throughout government.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and the religious right want to shape government to
reflect their religious views, which means conservative Christian.
Buchanan displays reflexive hostility toward Jews and others of
non-Christian beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right picks up disproportionate power when it
attaches itself to a mainstream political party and dictates
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Public servants should follow President Kennedy's example _
don't wave religious flags for personal gain. Respect the need keep
church and state separate.

 &HT;    Kitty Crider's food column
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ SING YOUR WAY TO A BETTER DIET: I've been
jammin' on the way to work. Rap, hip-hop, swing, disco, marches,
pop _ you name it. Now, the lyrics, well, those are something else:
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrots, pumpkin, spinach and tomatoes;
</P>
<P>
   ``Broccoli, asparagus and sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cantaloupe, watermelon, mangos, hey!
</P>
<P>
   ``All are sources of Vitamin A''
</P>
<P>
   This catchy collection of fruit and veggie tunes promotes the
National Cancer Institute's message of five to nine servings of
such a day. This free, fun cassette is really well done. ``Jammin'
5 A Day Songs'' tout the benefits of Vitamins C and A, fiber,
broccoli, bananas, salad, phytochemicals and exercise in 10 lively
tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Geared toward elementary-age children and performed in part by
them, it is an educational program developed by Dole, as in the
pineapple/banana people. ``Jammin' 5 A Day '' can be ordered free
from www.dole5aday.com. And to Dole's credit there is no mention of
the company's name in the songs.
</P>
<P>
   However, we have a quibble with the tape's promotion of bananas
as ``loaded'' with Vitamin C. That's a stretch, say dietitians. A
banana does have 10 milligrams, or about 15 percent of our daily
requirement, of Vitamin C. But, it's hardly in the same class as an
orange, which has 60-80 mg., or 100 percent. The government,
however, is more lenient. Read on.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S A GOOD SOURCE?: A box of Keebler's Grahams arrived
recently. ``Now a good source of calcium,'' the label proclaimed
boldly. This is good; most women don't get enough calcium. I turn
to the nutrition label and find the grahams provide 10 percent of
the daily requirement. Isn't that low for something deemed a
``good'' source?
</P>
<P>
   That's a legal claim, says Dallas dietitian Barbara Gollman, a
spokeswoman for the American Dietetics Association. According to
government rules, a product that provides 10 percent to 19 percent
of a daily value can be called a good source. A product with 20
percent can be labeled ``high.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep that in mind as you see more and more nutritional claims.
</P>
<P>
   PARA SU FAMILIA: That's the name of a new line of cereals that
General Mills is marketing to the Hispanic population. The four
varieties are Frosted Corn Flakes, Frutis, Cinnamon Corn Stars and
Raisin Bran. The cereals, which have only half the sugar of some
leading sweetened varieties, are fortified with calcium, iron and
folic acid.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING TO THE AIR: Seven of the city's leading chefs will give
live demonstrations Saturday on KLRU (Channel 18, Austin cable 9)
from 1 to 6 p.m. Tune in to catch in action: Stewart Scruggs of
Brio Vista, David Garrido of Jeffrey's, Charles Mayes of Cafe
Josie, Rebecca Rather of Rather Sweet, Jeff Blank and Jay Moore of
Hudson's and Roger Mollet of Central Market.
</P>
<P>
   BIGGER THAN BAGELS: Tortillas have surpassed other ethnic breads
such as croissants, English muffins, bagels, pita, etc., in
popularity and show no signs of decline. Maybe it's all those
tacos, enchiladas and wraps. In 1998, Americans consumed 75 billion
tortillas.

 &HT;    Onion varieties steal the limelight
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In most recipes shallots are minced as a seasoning, but in this
recipe they are the star of the show. Roasted with balsamic
vinegar, they are so seductively sweet that I could eat more than
my share.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe calls for half shallots and half cipollini, but if
you can't find those Italian onions, just double the number of
shallots. Look for large, individual shallots rather than the
smaller ones which are sold in a clump.
</P>
<P>
   If you're willing to eat them out of hand like roasted garlic,
just pull off the papery outer skin and don't bother with peeling
them. But for a finer presentation, peel before roasting.
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED SHALLOTS AND CIPOLLINI
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   8 large shallots
</P>
<P>
   8 cipollini onions
</P>
<P>
   1 4-inch sprig fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   2 4-inch sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fine sea salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Clean the shallots and cipollini by removing papery skins. Trim
the stems and root ends with a paring knife but don't cut too
deeply. Make a small crosscut at the root end. Place the bulbs in a
shallow casserole.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the rosemary and thyme leaves from their stems, then
place in a blender or food processor with the oil, vinegar, water,
salt and pepper. Blend at high speed 3 to 5 minutes, until
combined. Pour the mixture over the shallots and cipollini and toss
with a spoon to coat well. Roast, stirring occasionally, for about
40 minutes, until they can be easily pierced with the tip of a
sharp knife.
</P>
<P>
   Serve these with roast pork or chicken or grilled fish, spooning
the extra juices over the meat.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe is from the Onion Harvest Cookbook by Barbara Ciletti
(Taunton, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   I won't lie to you. Peeling pearl onions is not something you
want to do on a regular basis. But this recipe using them makes a
big batch that will last a while.
</P>
<P>
   The neat thing about Martini Magic mixture of pearl onions and
olives soaked in vermouth is that you can dispense with the
vermouth when making a martini (or Gibson). Just plop them in the
glass.
</P>
<P>
   As cookbook author Jesse Ziff Cool says,``All you have to do is
ice the gin, kick off your shoes and remember how good life can be
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   MARTINI MAGIC
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 quart
</P>
<P>
   4 cups cold water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 basket small red or white pearl onions, about 15 to 25
</P>
<P>
   Ice water
</P>
<P>
   1 10-ounce jar pimiento-stuffed green olives, drained
</P>
<P>
   Dry vermouth
</P>
<P>
   1 fresh, hot red chile pepper (optional)
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan over high heat bring the water to a boil.
Meanwhile trim the root ends of the onions. Have a large bowl of
ice water ready.
</P>
<P>
   Drop the trimmed onions into the boiling water for about 5
minutes. You want the onions to be cooked but still have some
crunch. Drain and transfer to the ice water. When cool, drain and
peel. If fate is with you, you can squeeze the root end of the
onion and it will pop out of its peel.
</P>
<P>
   Sterilize a quart jar with a tight-fitting lid. Then layer the
onions, olives and lemon rind in the jar. Add vermouth to cover
completely and slip in the chile pepper if you want to spice up
your martinis. Cover and refrigerate overnight before using. The
mixture will keep for weeks in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   When making a martini use a vermouth soaked olive, onion or
lemon rind strip in place of a splash of vermouth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recipe from Onions, a Country Garden Cookbook, by Jesse Ziff
Cool. His recipe also called for slivered lemon peel mixed with the
onions and olive.
</P>
<P>
   Although sweet cipollini would be the onion of choice in Italy,
pearl onions can be used in this.
</P>
<P>
   Serve as a side dish with roast pork or turkey.
</P>
<P>
   CIPOLLINI STEWED IN OLIVE OIL
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds cipollini, peeled and lightly trimmed
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Combine the cipollini and olive oil in a small, heavy casserole.
Dilute the tomato paste in 1/2 cup warm water and add it to the
pot. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and simmer slowly,
stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes, until the cipollini are
tender and the sauce has thickened slightly. Serve hot or at room
temperature.

 &HT;    Undersized onions pack an impressive taste wallop
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you don't know a shallot from a scallion. A cipollini _
pronounce that chee-poh-LEE-nee _ sounds like a New York drink. And
a boiler might be something they toss down in a boomtown bar.
</P>
<P>
   They are the other onions, the little ones that Old World home
cooks and sophisticated chefs use to add flavor to everything from
stews to martinis.
</P>
<P>
   As the season shifts from produce that is fresh and green _ as
in the green onions known as scallions _ these little onions with
their papery skin deserve a place in the market basket.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that garden variety cooking onions may cost less
than $1 for a 3-pound bag, shallots ring in as a luxury. They may
come three to a little net bag for $1.49, or in bulk at $4.89 a
pound. But for cooks, they offer the sweetness of onions combined
with the depth of garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Cipollini are new to the American market, but not to Italian
cooks who braise the squat little onions in olive oil and tomatoes
or glaze them with a sweet balsamic sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl onions, on the other hand, have been around as long as
your grandmother and are savored as a seasonal specialty.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying box tells what to look for and how to handle
these other onions.
</P>
<P>
   ONION BOX
</P>
<P>
   SHALLOTS: _ The elegant and refined cousin in the onion family,
these little bulbs grow singly or, like garlic, in clusters. The
variety usually sold at supermarkets here are pink-skinned. They're
a bit harsh when tasted raw, but once cooked, shallots have a
delicate but pronounced onion flavor. French cooks rely on them,
tucking them into dishes such as coq au vin and making the shallot
essential to classic sauces such as beurre blanc _ the butter/wine
sauce _ and marchand de vin, the red wine steak sauce. Minced
shallots cook quickly. Avoid browning or they may taste a little
bitter.
</P>
<P>
   PEARL ONIONS: _ Because these 1-inch onions have been a
traditional staple on the Thanksgiving table _ inevitably creamed
in the fashion of yesteryear _ they are widely available this time
of year. The white ones are more common, but now red and yellow
ones are available as well. An assortment of colors makes for a
prettier dish.
</P>
<P>
   These mild little onions are used whole. First, they must be
peeled, and the easiest way to do that is to blanch them in boiling
water for 1 minute, then plunge into cold water for a quick chill.
When they're peeled, trim off any root fibers and cut a small X in
the root end before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   BOILING ONIONS: _ It's size that determines what these onions
are called, and they must be golf-ball sized. Look for them in
16-ounce net bags, at a price of $1.89. They're a good choice for
stews.
</P>
<P>
   CIPOLLINI: _ Found only occasionally in Dayton supermarkets and
farm markets. They are shipped by Frieda, the exotic produce
supplier in California, so look for the company's signature purple
label. Cipollini are sweeter than our yellow boiler onions, smaller
than our regular onions but larger than little pearl onions. An
acceptable substitute is a large shallot, peeled and used whole.

   LOCKHART, Texas _ How to move a 99 3/4-year-old barbecue joint,
in case you ever have to, in three easy steps:
</P>
<P>
   1. Do something winningly goofy and symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   It's this past ``Ash Monday,'' around 10 in the morning, and a
parade likely without precedent is about to commence. It starts at
the old Kreuz Market, which stands uncharacteristically dark and
empty. Present are Kreuz owner Rick Schmidt, sons Leeman and Keith
Schmidt, mutton-chopped pit boss Roy Perez, wives and assorted
media. They're here to move the fire from the old place to the new
Kreuz Market a quarter-mile north up the road.
</P>
<P>
   A reasonable person might be moved to ask: Huh? Can somebody get
these people a match?
</P>
<P>
   To which the owner might reply, You from up north or something?
Lighting the fire with matches is not the Kreuz Market way, and we
have to go back just shy of a hundred years to explain why. Let's
just say for now that this is a special fire that's been burning
for a hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Schmidt and Perez each hook the handle of the silver
barrelful of ash and smoldering embers and drag it through the
fabled old dining hall _ the one that used to have knives chained
to the tables _ through the front door and into the insistent
midmorning sun. They're met by an escort of no fewer than four
police cars and some 11 members of the media, including a crew of
four from CBS's ``48 Hours'' They walk briskly, purposefully (which
is pretty much how this bunch does everything) down the street,
past the Caldwell County courthouse and the antique shops. They
walk past the bank and the Chevy dealer, and people come out to
holler and wave at them, Roy and Keith, then Roy and Leeman, with
Rick Schmidt and his wife, Evelyn, following carrying long-handled
shovels. Rick's asked what he's doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the fire from the old original Kreuz to the new
original Kreuz,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   They haul the fire in the back door of the vast new restaurant,
where a couple of dozen friends, family and well-wishers are
waiting. Roy Perez positions a pair of post oak logs. Rick Schmidt
puts three shovelfuls of embers between them, adds some bark, fans
the embers with a flattened IBC brand root beer carton, says, to
himself as much as anybody, ``There she goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Applause.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why people are applauding: In the summer of 1900, Charles
Kreuz Sr. purchased part of a lot and opened a grocery and barbecue
business. Over the decades the barbecue overtook the grocery, and
in recent years Kreuz Market operated as a butcher shop and
barbecue restaurant. Edgar ``Smitty'' Schmidt took over in 1948 and
sold out to his sons, Rick and Don (the latter now retired) in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the joint's reputation grew, and it came to be
regarded as the best barbecue in Texas. A large part of the old
dump's appeal was its dogged adherence to primitive tradition: no
plates (unless you count brown butcher paper), no forks, no spoons,
no traditional side dishes, no escape from the smoke while waiting
in line, and anybody who asked for barbecue sauce was shot on the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   The post oak fire burning in the pits became central to that
devotion to tradition. Roy Perez would come in every morning before
dawn, get a shovelful of embers from the previous day's fire out of
a metal bucket, add some kindling and get the new day's fire
roaring. So it could be said _ and it was _ that the fire at Kreuz
Market had never gone out for over almost a hundred years. Because,
even if it might not be technically true, it makes for a very good
story.
</P>
<P>
   And the smoldering embers also became a too-obvious metaphor for
a tenant-landlord conflict. And when some unfortunate things
happened that forced Kreuz Market to move from the building it had
inhabited for a century, Rick Schmidt knew he'd have to take
everything he could from the old place to the new place, and
nobody's sure now exactly whose idea the fire thing was, but Roy
was its champion. Three little words, they decided, apply to this
fire, our fire:
</P>
<P>
   Does. Not. Convey.
</P>
<P>
   2. Don't make a big deal out of your last day _ let others do it
for you.
</P>
<P>
   Back up to the week before ``Ash Monday'' _ the last smoky gasp
for the old original Kreuz Market. Call it, to appropriate a phrase
from one of the faithful who couldn't be there, The Last Temptation
of Kreuz.
</P>
<P>
   Folks have been calling, sometimes at the rate of 10 or 15 an
hour, every day, arranging to come pay their respects. Business has
been up by 50 percent or more all week, and by 11 a.m. one morning
there's a line out the door of the old brick joint into the gravel
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Which is nothing unusual for a Saturday at Kreuz Market. But the
nostalgia on this day is thicker than the smoke. And the smoke _
let's just say the wind is doing tricky things and the smoke gets
so bad sometimes even members of the faithful are wondering if a
little change is such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If y'all hurry up you'll get your picture on the tee-vee,''
says John Butler of Austin, Texas, who just wanted to look around.
</P>
<P>
   The ``48 Hours'' crew is the TV presence. Austin filmmaker Ken
Lewin is here, too, shooting footage to make his short film on
Kreuz Market into an hour-long documentary. (Alas, he will run out
of film, which means money, on ``Ash Monday.'')
</P>
<P>
   You never saw so many people taking pictures of their lunch.
Flash bulbs are going off with a frequency that makes you wonder if
George W. Bush is somewhere in the room talking about cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Then the unthinkable happens. A group of four is eating with _
fraud! scandal! _ paper plates, knives and forks. Commanded to
explain this breach of protocol, a woman who identifies herself as
Adela Acosta of San Antonio, Texas, says cheerfully, ``That was my
idea. I'd been here several times and knew they didn't have any. So
I brought my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman in the party, shamed and humiliated, refuses to be
identified or quoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see that,'' says Leeman Schmidt. ``They're the same people
who sneak barbecue sauce in their purses.''
</P>
<P>
   They came from Lubbock. They came from Houston. They came from
Dallas and Fort Worth, just to say they were here, you know, when.
Victor Torres, who went to high school, even came from Chicago,
although the trip had a dual purpose _ he's also got a daughter
here.
</P>
<P>
   They're all talking about how their entire families would come
in for barbecue. They ask each other, `What generation Kreuz Market
customer are you?' It's clear that although the building and the
business were owned privately, all of Texas held emotional stock in
Kreuz Market.
</P>
<P>
   What happened was this: When Smitty died, he gave the building
to his daughter, now Nina Sells. Rick and Don, and then just Rick,
paid rent to Nina. The lease came up for renewal, and Rick and Nina
couldn't come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   And in a couple of weeks, if the plan comes off, Nina, her
husband Jim Sells and her son John Fullilove will open Smitty's
Market in the old Kreuz building.
</P>
<P>
   Same menu. Same dearth of amenities. Same meatus operandi.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always wanted what was mine,'' Rick Schmidt says, watching
the endless procession of barbecue pilgrims from his favorite spot
for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   A man who flew in from Dallas tells Rick Schmidt it won't be the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much money you want to bet?'' Rick shoots back, not
exactly smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Later he'll say that kind of talk makes him a little mad. He
knows it'll be the same because he's not changing anything. It's a
myth that these hallowed pits impart their smoky goodness through
decades of seasoning they have to be rebuilt every eight or 10
years. (The new ones, however, should last a long time.) One of the
first things Rick Schmidt did many months ago, when he knew the
market was on the brink of big change, was have an exact replica of
his biggest pit built. He burned it for a while, put on a brisket
and a shoulder, cooked them around five hours, put some beer on ice
and had the local barbecue intelligentsia in to pronounce judgment.
</P>
<P>
   These were old boys not apt to sugar-coat anything, and they
were skeptical to the extreme. And they ate that barbecue and said,
``Damn, Rick, it tastes like it come from downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Cut the ribbon and get ready for Y2Kreuz.
</P>
<P>
   And on the fourth day, it rose again.
</P>
<P>
   It's now Sept. 1. You can tell because it's carved in stone, or
maybe poured concrete, next to the front door of the new,
23,000-square-foot Kreuz Market for the new millennium:
</P>
<P>
   Kreuz Market
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Owners
</P>
<P>
   Rick and Evelyn Schmidt
</P>
<P>
   Contractor
</P>
<P>
   Buckner Builders Inc.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people wait outside on the new parking lot, which still
has that new parking lot smell. The banker's here, a couple of
cops, family and friends and merchants and even Johnny Frizell, a
much-loved character who worked in the old place for 34 years
before he broke his hip and had to go into a home.
</P>
<P>
   The bow and ribbon stretched across the front entrance are made
of butcher paper, and Rick Schmidt's fixing to go at them with a
carving knife. But a few words seem appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done one of these before _ what do you do?'' he
jokes. ``I hope I don't do another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, mostly it's big _ almost triple the capacity of the old
joint, which in theory could hold up to 250 carnivores ``if
everybody sat real friendly, cheek to cheek,'' Rick Schmidt liked
to say. The ceiling in the main serving and dining room here rises
more than 30 feet, keeping heat and smoke away from diners and the
crew. The look is utilitarian and not fancy _ lots of unfinished
wood and corrugated metal. The signs are faux-old, yellowed and
cracked and brand new. Nonetheless, the place avoids the Forced
Rustic aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Schmidt looks a little ragged, but the place is ready to
go. The furniture _ including wooden chairs with the Kreuz logo _
have arrived. Little paper boats of the Kreuz spice rub are on the
tables, as are bottles of Hill Country Fare Louisiana hot sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Graham is the first customer. This happens spontaneously _
just minutes before he'd said it wouldn't be him. But nobody else
wanted to be first, so there he was, getting his usual shoulder
slice from Ella Townes, behind the counter as always.
</P>
<P>
   Well? ``Well, the first piece is just as good as the last
piece,'' he says as the new Kreuz Market celebrates its 10th minute
of business. ``I reckon I'll be here every day. At least once.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Frizell is impressed, too, except for the fact that
``they got these damn fans. We didn't have any fans. Still, you get
some smoke so you know where you been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go all over the United States and you won't find a
barbecue place like this,'' he says. ``I bet you won't.''
</P>
<P>
   By lunchtime, the crew is up to its eyeballs in business.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him: q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that Puerto Rico had two islandwide
votes on the issue of statehood vs. independence, one in '93 and
the other in '98. What were the results?
</P>
<P>
   A: What the article reported was that islandwide votes on
statehood were pushed through in 1993 and 1998 by Gov. Pedro
Rossello, the most ardent statehood advocate ever elected there.
</P>
<P>
   But Puerto Ricans also voted on that issue in July 1967, with
four-time Gov. Luis Munoz Marin backing commonwealth status. Voters
had three choices: remaining a U.S. commonwealth; statehood; or
independence. In that plebiscite, 60.5 percent voted to retain
commonwealth status; 39 percent for statehood; and less than 1
percent for independence. The vote for independence wasn't
considered a true indication of support, however, because many
groups favoring independence boycotted the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1993, residents again voted in favor of retaining
Puerto Rico's commonwealth status, but by a narrower margin. The
tally: 48.4 percent for commonwealth; 46.2 percent for statehood;
4.4 percent for independence.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, voters had five choices: statehood;
commonwealth; independence; free association; and ``none of the
above.'' Once again statehood was rejected. The last option
actually received just over 50 percent of the nonbinding vote.
Statehood was favored by 46.5 percent. Independence won 2.5
percent, while commonwealth status and free association each won
less than 1 percent. The Popular Democratic Party had urged its
voters to choose ``none of the above'' as an expression of their
desire to retain the status quo, even though that was to retain the
commonwealth status. Party leaders objected to the wording of the
commonwealth option, which it said made the territory sound like a
colony.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I can't find any information about Fort Delaware, a northern
prison during the Civil War. Can you tell me anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Built on Pea Patch Island in the Delaware River, near
Delaware City, the fort housed political and naval prisoners from
the beginning of the war. According to the Historical Times
Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Civil War, it was this prison,
above all others, that captives dreaded. Brig. Gen. Albin Schoepf,
the fort's commandant, was called ``General Terror'' by his
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival in 1861 of 2,000 Confederate soldiers, shed
barracks were provided inside the wall surrounding the fort, on
ground several feet below the river's high-water mark. Dikes kept
water from washing over the ground, but it was damp and cold in
winter. After Fort Delaware was designated a permanent prison depot
and thousands more began arriving, new barracks were built, with
enough to house 5,000 prisoners completed by spring 1863.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, 12,500 Confederate prisoners were housed at the
fort, creating conditions so dangerously overcrowded that even the
Union surgeon general complained. In September 1863, of the 7,000
prisoners still at Fort Delaware, 331 died. In October, smallpox
broke out and the suffering and death increased. The last
Confederates weren't released until mid-July 1865.
</P>
<P>
   A major renovation of the fort that will allow visitors to stay
overnight in re-created Union officers' quarters is under way, but
no target date has been set, a park spokeswoman told Q&AMP;A. More
information: Fort Delaware State Park, 45 Clinton St., Delaware
City, DE 19706; 302-834-7941.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many houses have been built worldwide since the Habitat
for Humanity program began?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since its founding in September 1976, Habitat for Humanity
International has built and rehabilitated some 80,000 houses, with
the number changing every week.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently on various strong earthquakes, but
nothing was said about the one that occurred in Guatemala in the
'70s that claimed more than 25,000 lives. What about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The earlier report responded to a question asking about the
strongest earthquakes ever recorded. All were of magnitudes topping
8 on the Richter scale. The quake that struck Guatemala on Feb. 4,
1976, while undeniably devastating, measured a magnitude of 7.5,
according to World Almanac. It caused 22,778 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that Monica Lewinsky is selling handbags over the
Internet. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The former White House intern's line of handbags, marketed as
``Made especially for you by Monica,'' can be ordered through her
Internet site _ www.therealmonicainc.com _ and cost between $70 and
$130 each.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she took up knitting and sewing ``as the only way
to stay sane'' when she was more or less trapped in her Washington
apartment last year, forbidden by prosecutors to talk to anyone by
phone or e-mail. ``I went back to something I did in high school,
which was designing and sewing,'' she said in an interview with The
Associated Press. ``It's been nourishing for me emotionally to work
with colors and different fabrics.'' After she made her first
handbag, she said, all her friends wanted one, and the business was
born.
</P>
<P>
   A dollar from each bag will go toward various charities,
Lewinsky says, with the remainder of her profits going toward
paying off the debts she incurred from President Clinton's
impeachment scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really excites me is that this has nothing to do with the
president,'' she said in a report published in October's Marie
Claire magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My granddaughter, who is 13, lost her Social Security card.
How can she have it replaced?
</P>
<P>
   A: An application for a replacement card can be requested by
calling 1-800-772-1213. The applicant must present either original
or certified copies of documents proving her identity. Page 2 of
the application lists examples of acceptable documents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Johnny Carson? He was reported to have had
a heart attack, but I haven't seen anything since.
</P>
<P>
   A: Carson underwent successful quadruple heart bypass surgery in
March at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif. Three
weeks later he returned to his Malibu, Calif., home, with a
spokesman proclaiming th-- t the 73-year-old entertainer was
``doing great.'' Although tabloids reported that his health was
declining, he dismissed such a thought with this statement:
``They'll print anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The entertainer, who said he quit smoking more than seven years
ago, is now back on the Los Angeles social circuit and was well
enough to attend a recent tennis tournament there. He and his wife,
Alex, also were seen dining recently at Mr. Chow, a Los Angeles
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Carson attributes his rapid recovery to years of sensible eating
and lots of tennis.

inhabited for a century, Rick Schmidt knew he'd have to take
everything he could from the old place to the new place, and
nobody's sure now exactly whose idea the fire thing was, but Roy
was its champion. Three little words, they decided, apply to this
fire, our fire:
</P>
<P>
   Does. Not. Convey.
</P>
<P>
   2. Don't make a big deal out of your last day _ let others do it
for you.
</P>
<P>
   Back up to the week before ``Ash Monday'' _ the last smoky gasp
for the old original Kreuz Market. Call it, to appropriate a phrase
from one of the faithful who couldn't be there, The Last Temptation
of Kreuz.
</P>
<P>
   Folks have been calling, sometimes at the rate of 10 or 15 an
hour, every day, arranging to come pay their respects. Business has
been up by 50 percent or more all week, and by 11 a.m. one morning
there's a line out the door of the old brick joint into the gravel
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Which is nothing unusual for a Saturday at Kreuz Market. But the
nostalgia on this day is thicker than the smoke. And the smoke _
let's just say the wind is doing tricky things and the smoke gets
so bad sometimes even members of the faithful are wondering if a
little change is such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If y'all hurry up you'll get your picture on the tee-vee,''
says John Butler of Austin, Texas, who just wanted to look around.
</P>
<P>
   The ``48 Hours'' crew is the TV presence. Austin filmmaker Ken
Lewin is here, too, shooting footage to make his short film on
Kreuz Market into an hour-long documentary. (Alas, he will run out
of film, which means money, on ``Ash Monday.'')
</P>
<P>
   You never saw so many people taking pictures of their lunch.
Flash bulbs are going off with a frequency that makes you wonder if
George W. Bush is somewhere in the room talking about cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Then the unthinkable happens. A group of four is eating with _
fraud! scandal! _ paper plates, knives and forks. Commanded to
explain this breach of protocol, a woman who identifies herself as
Adela Acosta of San Antonio, Texas, says cheerfully, ``That was my
idea. I'd been here several times and knew they didn't have any. So
I brought my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman in the party, shamed and humiliated, refuses to be
identified or quoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see that,'' says Leeman Schmidt. ``They're the same people
who sneak barbecue sauce in their purses.''
</P>
<P>
   They came from Lubbock. They came from Houston. They came from
Dallas and Fort Worth, just to say they were here, you know, when.
Victor Torres, who went to high school, even came from Chicago,
although the trip had a dual purpose _ he's also got a daughter
here.
</P>
<P>
   They're all talking about how their entire families would come
in for barbecue. They ask each other, `What generation Kreuz Market
customer are you?' It's clear that although the building and the
business were owned privately, all of Texas held emotional stock in
Kreuz Market.
</P>
<P>
   What happened was this: When Smitty died, he gave the building
to his daughter, now Nina Sells. Rick and Don, and then just Rick,
paid rent to Nina. The lease came up for renewal, and Rick and Nina
couldn't come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   And in a couple of weeks, if the plan comes off, Nina, her
husband Jim Sells and her son John Fullilove will open Smitty's
Market in the old Kreuz building.
</P>
<P>
   Same menu. Same dearth of amenities. Same meatus operandi.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always wanted what was mine,'' Rick Schmidt says, watching
the endless procession of barbecue pilgrims from his favorite spot
for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   A man who flew in from Dallas tells Rick Schmidt it won't be the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much money you want to bet?'' Rick shoots back, not
exactly smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Later he'll say that kind of talk makes him a little mad. He
knows it'll be the same because he's not changing anything. It's a
myth that these hallowed pits impart their smoky goodness through
decades of seasoning they have to be rebuilt every eight or 10
years. (The new ones, however, should last a long time.) One of the
first things Rick Schmidt did many months ago, when he knew the
market was on the brink of big change, was have an exact replica of
his biggest pit built. He burned it for a while, put on a brisket
and a shoulder, cooked them around five hours, put some beer on ice
and had the local barbecue intelligentsia in to pronounce judgment.
</P>
<P>
   These were old boys not apt to sugar-coat anything, and they
were skeptical to the extreme. And they ate that barbecue and said,
``Damn, Rick, it tastes like it come from downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Cut the ribbon and get ready for Y2Kreuz.
</P>
<P>
   And on the fourth day, it rose again.
</P>
<P>
   It's now Sept. 1. You can tell because it's carved in stone, or
maybe poured concrete, next to the front door of the new,
23,000-square-foot Kreuz Market for the new millennium:
</P>
<P>
   Kreuz Market
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 1, 1999
</P>
<P>
   Owners
</P>
<P>
   Rick and Evelyn Schmidt
</P>
<P>
   Contractor
</P>
<P>
   Buckner Builders Inc.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people wait outside on the new parking lot, which still
has that new parking lot smell. The banker's here, a couple of
cops, family and friends and merchants and even Johnny Frizell, a
much-loved character who worked in the old place for 34 years
before he broke his hip and had to go into a home.
</P>
<P>
   The bow and ribbon stretched across the front entrance are made
of butcher paper, and Rick Schmidt's fixing to go at them with a
carving knife. But a few words seem appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done one of these before _ what do you do?'' he
jokes. ``I hope I don't do another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, mostly it's big _ almost triple the capacity of the old
joint, which in theory could hold up to 250 carnivores ``if
everybody sat real friendly, cheek to cheek,'' Rick Schmidt liked
to say. The ceiling in the main serving and dining room here rises
more than 30 feet, keeping heat and smoke away from diners and the
crew. The look is utilitarian and not fancy _ lots of unfinished
wood and corrugated metal. The signs are faux-old, yellowed and
cracked and brand new. Nonetheless, the place avoids the Forced
Rustic aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Schmidt looks a little ragged, but the place is ready to
go. The furniture _ including wooden chairs with the Kreuz logo _
have arrived. Little paper boats of the Kreuz spice rub are on the
tables, as are bottles of Hill Country Fare Louisiana hot sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Graham is the first customer. This happens spontaneously _
just minutes before he'd said it wouldn't be him. But nobody else
wanted to be first, so there he was, getting his usual shoulder
slice from Ella Townes, behind the counter as always.
</P>
<P>
   Well? ``Well, the first piece is just as good as the last
piece,'' he says as the new Kreuz Market celebrates its 10th minute
of business. ``I reckon I'll be here every day. At least once.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Frizell is impressed, too, except for the fact that
``they got these damn fans. We didn't have any fans. Still, you get
some smoke so you know where you been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go all over the United States and you won't find a
barbecue place like this,'' he says. ``I bet you won't.''
</P>
<P>
   By lunchtime, the crew is up to its eyeballs in business.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: A recent article mentioned Newton Minow's description of
television as a ``vast wasteland.'' When and where did he say that,
and can you give me some additional context?
</P>
<P>
   A: Minow, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission at
the time, made his now-famous statement on May 9, 1961, in a speech
before 2,000 delegates to the National Association of Broadcasters
convention in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he did not intend ``to idly observe this
squandering of the public's airwaves,'' he added a further
indictment of TV as ``a procession of game shows, violence,
audience participation shows, formula comedies about totally
unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism,
murder, Western badmen, Western goodmen, private eyes, gangsters,
more violence, and cartoons. And, endlessly, commercials, many
screaming, cajoling and offending. And most of all, boredom.'' He
explained later that the remark wasn't meant so much as a total
indictment of everything on TV as it was a way of explaining that,
in his opinion, TV wasn't realizing its potential for good. Minow,
a Democrat appointed by President Kennedy, was a little-known
bureacrat until he became a media darling _ in media other than TV,
that is _ for his comments. He quit the FCC two years later to go
back to law, saying he was making the move for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was vacationing in California at Lake Tahoe, I was
told that it is one of the deepest lakes in the United States. If
it isn't the deepest one, what is?
</P>
<P>
   A: At its deepest point, Lake Tahoe goes 1,640 feet down.
Oregon's Crater Lake tops it _ or should we say bottoms it _ at
1,932 feet at its greatest depth.
</P>
<P>
   Neither U.S. lake comes close to the world record holder, Baikal
in Russia, which in places is 5,371 feet (1.02 miles) deep.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Jerry Lewis' latest telethon received pledges of more than
$53 million. When was his first telethon, and what amount was
pledged then?
</P>
<P>
   A: His first telethon to benefit the Muscular Dystrophy
Association, on Labor Day weekend in 1966, raised more than $1
million in pledges. It was broadcast by only one station, in New
York. This year's broadcast was shown on about 200 stations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the Institute for Policy Studies? It was mentioned in
a recent article reporting on several staff members of the U.S.
House of Representatives who were visiting Iraq, contrary to the
wishes of the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Institute describes itself as ``the only multi-issue
progressive think tank in Washington,'' saying it operates four
programs: global economy; paths for the 21st century; sustainable
communities, and peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based organization's Web site _ www.ips-dc.org _
goes on to say that ``at a time when other think tanks celebrate
the virtues of unrestrained greed, unlimited wealth, and
unregulated markets, IPS is striving to create a more responsible
society, one built around the values of justice, nonviolence,
sustainability and decency.''
</P>
<P>
   The article you mention, by the way, made it clear that the
White House was not pleased about the visit of the congressional
staff members. It went on to say that the five got around a U.S.
ban on travel to Iraq by carrying special papers with their
passports for recording their entry and departure. None of the five
was willing to speak with reporters in Iraq or Jordan, the article
stated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported on both a Fox news broadcast and on MSNBC
that Louis Freeh was not the FBI director at the time of the
burning of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. Can you
confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's correct: Freeh was not the FBI director at the time.
The fire that killed many members of the sect occurred on April 19,
1993, when William Sessions headed the bureau. Sessions gave up the
post at the request of President Clinton and on July 19, 1993, was
replaced by Floyd Clarke, whose title was acting director. Freeh
was named the agency's director on Sept. 1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the design on the left side of the back of a $1
bill, showing a pyramid, an eye, and some Latin words, represent?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing explains that the Latin
words above the pyramid, Annuit Coeptis, mean ``He has favored our
undertakings.'' The Latin phrase beneath the pyramid, Novus ordo
seclorum, means ``new order of the ages.'' The eye represents the
eye of Providence, and a light around it illustrates ``spiritual
above material.'' The pyramid is unfinished, signifying that this
country needs to grow and build.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Lance Armstrong recently won the Tour de France as part of a
bicycle team sponsored by the U.S. Postal Service. Did the Postal
Service pay the team's expenses? How does it justify spending money
that way?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Postal Service is one of about 20 team sponsors, said
USPS spokeswoman Margot Myers. All the money from all the sponsors
is pooled to cover all the team's activities throughout the year,
paying for salaries, travel expenses, equipment and any other
expenses the team incurs. Some sponsors, such as USPS, pay money
only; others offer in-kind support, such as providing helmets or
other equipment; and still others provide a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Srvice views its sponsorship of the team strictly as
a business proposition, Myers explained. The USPS has a marketing
and sales development group that oversees this project, with an
annual sales goal that must be met in order to justify continuing
the sponsorship. For example, the group will make a pitch to a
company involved in cycling to use direct mail as part of its
advertising mix, or to use the Postal Service to fill some of its
orders. ``The idea is that we're able to generate enough additional
revenue in sales related to the sponsorship to more than cover the
cost of the sponsorship,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the reason for Peter Jennings' extended absence from
ABC World News Tonight?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was on a four-week vacation, said ABC publicist Eileen
Murphy. He was back on the air starting Sept.7.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will a house with a metal frame and metal roof that is
properly grounded to a copper rod about 2 feet in the ground be
protected from lightning?
</P>
<P>
   A: Factors involved in a building's susceptibility to lightning
damage include its height in relation to other structures in the
area, the proximity of large trees, and the materials used to build
the structure. In the structure you described, you should properly
bond all metal parts and provide adequate grounding to ensure that
any lightning strike would be conducted safely to the ground.
Adequate grounding requires at least two ground rods at opposite
corners of the building driven no less than 10 feet into the
ground. They should be installed by an experienced person licensed
to do such work.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners can get additional information from the Lightning
Protection Institute, 3335 N. Arlington Heights Road, Suite E,
Arlington Heights, IL 60004 (1-800-488-6864); or online at
www.lightning.org

 &HT;    Kitchen daredevils having too much fun with very hot things
 &HT;    (EDS: WITH SIDEBAR _ FEARLESS-RECIPES16-COX. Photos available.)
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Call them culinary pyromaniacs. Daredevils in
the kitchen. Jeff Blank and Jay Moore have set their chefs' hats on
fire more than a dozen times. They toss rattlesnake into the
skillet on a regular basis. They delight in roasting peppers with
the same kind of 6-foot flamethrower that Texas ranchers use to
burn the spines off prickly pear cactus for their cattle's
consumption. (And they just happen to know that if you turn the
propane bottle upside -down, the flame thrower will spit fire an
impressive 18 feet.)
</P>
<P>
   These guys are having entirely too much fun.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but it's just beginning, they insist.
</P>
<P>
   A flamboyant duo, Blank and Moore are the owner and executive
chef at Hudson's on the Bend, a 15-year-old restaurant in a
converted limestone house. They are also partners in the Hudson's
on the Bend Cooking School, as well as a line of sauces bearing the
restaurant name, a new book called ``Cooking Fearlessly,'' a
fast-paced video by the same title that will threaten Emeril, and
weekly televised food segments which will debut Monday in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Don't even pause to take a breath. These guys are rocking.
</P>
<P>
   With a 10-year history as a team, they act like brothers, egging
each other on, helping each other out, cracking up with laughter,
smarting off. It's all in the name of Texas food, good times and
good eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not fun, we don't do it. And it's all fun,'' says
Blank. Oh, sure, they get hot in the kitchen, they get pressured on
a packed restaurant night, they have dinner crises.
</P>
<P>
   But, says Moore, ``By us having fun back here (in the kitchen),
that enables us to lighten the stress load and put more of it out.
When it becomes work, I will say, `Adios.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not much chance of that any time soon. The ``two crazy guys at
Hudson's who will cook anything'' are out to persuade the rest of
us to jump fearlessly into the fire with them. Cooking fearlessly,
their motto, is about wild techniques, bold flavors, trusting your
instincts, breaking the rules, using your hands, ``cookin' with a
boogie back beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Saute an African lion? Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Take the shaker top off the bottle of Tabasco and pour a slug in
the orange ginger barbecue sauce? You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   Sneak two kinds of chiles into the brownie dessert? Absolutely.
``Put down your Prozac and pop a pepper,'' they quip.
</P>
<P>
   But lest you think these two fellas are totally out of control,
let us assure you that their hearty, big-portioned, bold-flavored
food _dishes like venison backstrap stuffed with smoked lobster in
a pool of guava sour cherry sauce _ consistently earn them spots on
the lists of the top restaurants in the area. And they have won
notice nationally as well: in The New York Times, Cooking Light,
Men's Journal, Chef's Magazine, Field &AMP; Stream and PBS' ``Best
Chefs of the West'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the Central Texas influences of Mexican, German,
Czech, cowboy and hunter cooking, they've earned their fame and
name:
</P>
<P>
   For their meat _ both wild game and tame. (Their reputation is
that they will cook anything once, even lion, kangaroo, zebra.)
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys could cook a horseshoe and make it delicious,''
says CBS news anchor and frequent Hudson's diner Dan Rather in the
foreword of their new book.
</P>
<P>
   For adventurous smoking, both planned _ like their trademark
smoked shrimp, avocado and goat cheese quesadillas _ and unplanned
_ like the time they fired up their 12-foot stone smokehouse with
too much gusto to cook a leg of antelope and the roof caught fire.
When it happened, they were being interviewed by a New York Times
writer, and the staff hurriedly put out the fire while Moore and
Blank tried to distract the reporter in the kitchen and keep her
from looking out the window. As the story goes, the antelope turned
out great, the article was a success, and the smokehouse got a
makeover.
</P>
<P>
   For growing their own herbs, edible flowers and greens long
before it was fashionable. And, these days, their garden is 14
-feet up in the air, on a rooftop to which they fearlessly climb
when they need a sprig of cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   These may sound like the antics of a couple of college kids, but
both are family men and seasoned chefs. Blank and his wife, Shanny
Lott, married eight years, have three children, 24, 21 and 19.
Moore, married to Kristi for 14 years, has two sons, 6 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   Blank, 49, is a self-taught chef who owned The Wineskin
Restaurant in Aspen, Colo., before opening Hudson's in 1984. Moore,
40, is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America with a
passion for Tabasco and sauces. He is the one credited with
refining the restaurant's sauces into a gourmet line that they hand
pack and sell through mail order and specialty stores in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago the two fellas began teaching monthly cooking
classes at the restaurant on Sunday mornings. Last year, after
Blank and his wife completed their unique straw-bale home on Lake
Travis, with both indoor and outdoor teaching kitchens, the classes
were moved there. The monthly classes (one on a Sunday morning and
one on a Thursday evening) frequently sell out weeks in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The fun and camaraderie of teaching the classes begat ``Cooking
Fearlessly,'' a 25-minute TV pilot of food and music.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with Deborah Harter of California, the partner of their
videographer, they opted to write a cookbook telling the history of
Hudson's, their cooking philosophies (both serious and irreverent),
recipes, anecdotes, techniques, quotes, musical suggestions, the
cooking school and promotion for their bottled sauces. They also
divulge for the first time the recipes for the most popular of
these sauces: the orange ginger barbecue, the tomatillo white
chocolate, bourbon vanilla praline, mango jalapeno, champagne herb
vinegar and guava sour cherry.
</P>
<P>
   Blank's wife, an artist, did a series of chef paintings for the
chapter dividers. Local food photographer Laurie Smith recorded
their cooking, food and antics with her camera. The result is a
self-published book that is a riot of color and photos, reflecting
the fun behind the food.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, everyone was laughing so hard in the flaming
toques shoot that they didn't knock the hats off quite fast enough
in one frame and the guys' hair singed a bit. Later that day, when
Blank went down to the bank to get a loan for the cookbook
production, the president commented that he smelled burned hair.
</P>
<P>
   Blank shrugged it off. ``Oh, we were lighting our hats on
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Which prompted the bank officer to comment, ``You were setting
yourselves on fire and you expect me to lend you money?''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the fiery duo got the loan and now the book,
``Cooking Fearlessly'' ($32.95). National release will be in
November.
</P>
<P>
   There is more on their plates. This month an Austin television
news show will begin running weekly food segments, featuring Blank
and Moore.
</P>
<P>
   None of that scares these guys. But what does have this fearless
duo just a little nervous is an appearance on the Food Network's
``Ready. Set . Cook!'' to be shot Sept. 26, for which they will be
given a mystery bag of groceries to cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if they give me taro root or octopus?'' muses Blank.
</P>
<P>
   No worry. Smoke it, pour the Tabasco to it, cover it in
tomatillo white chocolate sauce, light it. If they can't figure out
something, they know how to create interesting distractions and put
on a good show.
</P>
<P>
   But they admit there is one area of their showmanship they might
refine. This business about setting their toques on fire is giving
them bad hair days. So they've got the co-author's boyfriend
designing remote-controlled chef's hats that light up, something
that would look kind of flashy on TV. If it works out, they just
might give their matches a rest. Good news for their banker.

   In-Your-Face Grilling
</P>
<P>
   Watch some of these chefs in open kitchens cook and you might
see them touching steaks and other meats with their fingers as they
grill. They are practicing the touch method of doneness, checking
not only the temperature of the meat but the firmness of the
muscle. As the meat cooks, moisture is reduced and the muscle
becomes firmer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it takes a little experience, but try this face-testing
technique as you grill:
</P>
<P>
   Rare
</P>
<P>
   Touch your cheek, with a straight face (no smiling or it will be
overdone). The temperature of the steak will be between 110-120
degrees, and it will have a cool red center.
</P>
<P>
   Medium rare
</P>
<P>
   Touch your chin, still poker-faced.The internal temperature will
be 120-130 degrees, and the steak will have a warm, red center.
</P>
<P>
   Medium
</P>
<P>
   Touch the end of your nose. This is the texture of a medium
steak, with an internal temperature of 140-155 and a hot pink
center.
</P>
<P>
   Medium-well
</P>
<P>
   Touch your forehead, the area just above the bridge of your
nose.The internal temp will be 155-160, and and the steak will have
a thin line of hot pinkness in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Well-done
</P>
<P>
   Touch the bottom of your shoe. That's well done, with an
internal temp of 180 degrees and visually no pink. (However even a
well-done piece of meat should have some juice; it's not beef
jerky.)
</P>
<P>

and nose
</P>
<P>
   Smoked Shrimp and Flounder en Papillote
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle of chardonnay
</P>
<P>
   2 sheets parchment paper or foil, 16-by-12 inches (for the bag)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons shallots, minced (can substitute onion, leeks,
celery or jicama)
</P>
<P>
   2 flounder fillets, 5-6 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   6 shrimp (21-25 per pound size)
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs cilantro
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lime zest
</P>
<P>
   1 roasted poblano, julienned
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Put in baking sheet to preheat.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce wine in a small saucepan to 1/2 cup.
</P>
<P>
   Cut a large heart out of the parchment paper (Fold the paper in
half and cut half a heart shape, away from the fold). Repeat with
the other sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Butter the inside of each sheet thoroughly. Slightly off center
on the paper, sprinkle garlic and shallots.
</P>
<P>
   Top each parchment heart with flounder, shrimp, herbs, zest and
poblano, divided equally. Splash with reduced wine. Season each
with salt and pepper. Top with remaining butter.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the bottom, fold the edges over themselves (kind of
like folding a note in high school) sealing the entire paper bag.
One trick we sometimes use is to puff with a straw at one end of
the bag to make sure it inflates, then hold it closed with a paper
clip.
</P>
<P>
   Place on pre-heated baking sheet. Place in 350-degree oven for
9-10 minutes. Serve immediately. Serves 2.

   _ Recipes from 'Cooking Fearlessly'
</P>
<P>
   This is also a wonderful marinade for babyback ribs, portobello
mushrooms, chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Rib Eye Steak
</P>
<P>
   6 rib eye steaks, 14-16 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Shiner Bock marinade:
</P>
<P>
   12-ounce Shiner Bock, or your local or homemade dark beer
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   4 shakes Tabasco
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red onion, diced fine
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 2 limes
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon coarse brown mustard (Creole is good)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients except salt. Salt in the marinade draws
too much moisture from the meat over an extended time. Pour over
steaks and marinate from 4 hours to overnight. (Marinate the steaks
in an airtight plastic bag the day before grilling to achieve the
optimum flavor.)
</P>
<P>
   Cook the steaks over medium-high heat about 4 minutes each side
for medium rare to medium. (See ``In-Your-Face Grilling.'') Season
with salt to taste after cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.
</P>
<P>
   Ancho Chile Bock Beer Smashers
</P>
<P>
   5-6 ancho chile peppers, pureed
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds Idaho potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound sweet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound sweet butter, cubed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bottle Shiner Bock beer, or any big, malty beer
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   Soak ancho chiles in water to cover until soft. Remove stems,
ribs and seeds. Puree with 1/2 cup water in a blender to yield 1/2
cup ancho puree.
</P>
<P>
   Peel and boil Idaho potatoes and sweet potatoes until tender.
Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Warm the beer, cream and butter to slightly above room
temperature. Cold milk and cold butter cause the starch in the
potatoes to seize up, which is the main cause of glutinous mash
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Whip the Idaho and sweet potatoes together with electric mixer.
Add cream, chunks of butter one at a time, ancho puree, beer and
salt. Adjust salt flavor and keep warm until served. Serves 6-8.
</P>
<P>
   These reheat well with a little more butter added.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate Heat Brownies
</P>
<P>
   6 cascabel or ancho peppers
</P>
<P>
   10 oz. semi-sweet chocolate
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   6 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   2 cups unsalted cashews
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dried cherries
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Lightly coat 9-inch-square cake pan
with butter and dust with flour. Shake out extra flour.
</P>
<P>
   Submerge peppers in hot water in a bowl to rehydrate. Cover bowl
with plastic wrap and let stand for approximately 15 minutes. Drain
and remove seeds.
</P>
<P>
   In a double boiler, melt chocolate and butter over water at a
low simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Sift flour, cocoa, cayenne pepper, baking powder and salt
together and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Put seeded cascabel peppers in a blender and puree until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Place eggs, sugar and vanilla in a mixing bowl. Mix at high
speed until slightly thick, approximately 2 minutes. Add
chocolate-butter mixture and pepper blend to mixer bowl along with
eggs and sugar. Beat on medium high for 1 1/2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Next, add sifted ingredients and mix for one minute on medium
speed. Add sour cream and mix on medium speed for 30 seconds. Fold
in cashews and dried cherries. Pour into cake pan. Place in
preheated oven and bake for 45-55 minutes. Remove and cool for 20
minutes. Makes 10-12 big brownies. Best if served warm with
homemade ice cream and fudge sauce.

   Our corn pudding recipe is the restaurant's most requested
recipe _ bar none. We wish it were an original, but we cannot tell
a lie. It has been Jeff's mother's holiday standby for as long as
anyone can remember. She isn't sure where she found it, but thinks
it came from one of those innumerable Junior League cookbooks. At
any rate, we have changed it so many times over the years, we
suppose now it is more original than when we started. We like ours
a little on the spicy side, so we add cayenne and poblano peppers
along with the sweet mild peppers.
</P>
<P>
   You can make the batter the day before and store it in a bowl in
the refrigerator. Just give it a whisk before putting it in a
greased and floured casserole dish at baking time. This recipe is
so sturdy you can bake it early and hold it in a warm oven or in a
chafing dish.
</P>
<P>
   Corn Pudding
</P>
<P>
   Dry mix:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   Wet mix:
</P>
<P>
   6 whole eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 stick of butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   8-ounce can cream-style corn
</P>
<P>
   Veggie mix:
</P>
<P>
   1 medium poblano pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 medium red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 Anaheim pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh cut corn
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine all dry ingredients in a
bowl. Mix well and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a second bowl, whisk the eggs until blended, then add melted
butter, cream and cream-style corn.
</P>
<P>
   Blend the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients using a wire
whisk.
</P>
<P>
   Clean all three peppers, discarding the seeds and stems. Dice
into 1/4-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Add fresh cut corn kernels and the diced peppers to the mixing
bowl. Blend together.
</P>
<P>
   Coat a medium-size 9-inch-square casserole dish with butter or
light vegetable oil and dust with flour. Add the mix to the
casserole dish. The depth can vary from 1 inch to 2 inches. If the
mix is only 1 inch deep it will cook 5 to 10 minutes faster.
</P>
<P>
   Place in a preheated oven at 350 degrees and bake for 40 minutes
or until it is golden brown and firm.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 10-12.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that Puerto Rico had two islandwide
votes on the issue of statehood vs. independence, one in '93 and
the other in '98. What were the results?
</P>
<P>
   A: What the article reported was that islandwide votes on
statehood were pushed through in 1993 and 1998 by Gov. Pedro
Rossello, the most ardent statehood advocate ever elected there.
</P>
<P>
   But Puerto Ricans also voted on that issue in July 1967, with
four-time Gov. Luis Munoz Marin backing commonwealth status. Voters
had three choices: remaining a U.S. commonwealth; statehood; or
independence. In that plebiscite, 60.5 percent voted to retain
commonwealth status; 39 percent for statehood; and less than 1
percent for independence. The vote for independence wasn't
considered a true indication of support, however, because many
groups favoring independence boycotted the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1993, residents again voted in favor of retaining
Puerto Rico's commonwealth status, but by a narrower margin. The
tally: 48.4 percent for commonwealth; 46.2 percent for statehood;
4.4 percent for independence.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, voters had five choices: statehood;
commonwealth; independence; free association; and ``none of the
above.'' Once again statehood was rejected. The last option
actually received just over 50 percent of the nonbinding vote.
Statehood was favored by 46.5 percent. Independence won 2.5
percent, while commonwealth status and free association each won
less than 1 percent. The Popular Democratic Party had urged its
voters to choose ``none of the above'' as an expression of their
desire to retain the status quo, even though that was to retain the
commonwealth status. Party leaders objected to the wording of the
commonwealth option, which it said made the territory sound like a
colony.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I can't find any information about Fort Delaware, a northern
prison during the Civil War. Can you tell me anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Built on Pea Patch Island in the Delaware River, near
Delaware City, the fort housed political and naval prisoners from
the beginning of the war. According to the Historical Times
Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Civil War, it was this prison,
above all others, that captives dreaded. Brig. Gen. Albin Schoepf,
the fort's commandant, was called ``General Terror'' by his
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival in 1861 of 2,000 Confederate soldiers, shed
barracks were provided inside the wall surrounding the fort, on
ground several feet below the river's high-water mark. Dikes kept
water from washing over the ground, but it was damp and cold in
winter. After Fort Delaware was designated a permanent prison depot
and thousands more began arriving, new barracks were built, with
enough to house 5,000 prisoners completed by spring 1863.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, 12,500 Confederate prisoners were housed at the
fort, creating conditions so dangerously overcrowded that even the
Union surgeon general complained. In September 1863, of the 7,000
prisoners still at Fort Delaware, 331 died. In October, smallpox
broke out and the suffering and death increased. The last
Confederates weren't released until mid-July 1865.
</P>
<P>
   A major renovation of the fort that will allow visitors to stay
overnight in re-created Union officers' quarters is under way, but
no target date has been set, a park spokeswoman told Q&AMP;A. More
information: Fort Delaware State Park, 45 Clinton St., Delaware
City, DE 19706; 302-834-7941.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many houses have been built worldwide since the Habitat
for Humanity program began?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since its founding in September 1976, Habitat for Humanity
International has built and rehabilitated some 80,000 houses, with
the number changing every week.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently on various strong earthquakes, but
nothing was said about the one that occurred in Guatemala in the
'70s that claimed more than 25,000 lives. What about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The earlier report responded to a question asking about the
strongest earthquakes ever recorded. All were of magnitudes topping
8 on the Richter scale. The quake that struck Guatemala on Feb. 4,
1976, while undeniably devastating, measured a magnitude of 7.5,
according to World Almanac. It caused 22,778 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that Monica Lewinsky is selling handbags over the
Internet. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The former White House intern's line of handbags, marketed as
``Made especially for you by Monica,'' can be ordered through her
Internet site _ www.therealmonicainc.com _ and cost between $70 and
$130 each.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she took up knitting and sewing ``as the only way
to stay sane'' when she was more or less trapped in her Washington
apartment last year, forbidden by prosecutors to talk to anyone by
phone or e-mail. ``I went back to something I did in high school,
which was designing and sewing,'' she said in an interview with The
Associated Press. ``It's been nourishing for me emotionally to work
with colors and different fabrics.'' After she made her first
handbag, she said, all her friends wanted one, and the business was
born.
</P>
<P>
   A dollar from each bag will go toward various charities,
Lewinsky says, with the remainder of her profits going toward
paying off the debts she incurred from President Clinton's
impeachment scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really excites me is that this has nothing to do with the
president,'' she said in a report published in October's Marie
Claire magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My granddaughter, who is 13, lost her Social Security card.
How can she have it replaced?
</P>
<P>
   A: An application for a replacement card can be requested by
calling 1-800-772-1213. The applicant must present either original
or certified copies of documents proving her identity. Page 2 of
the application lists examples of acceptable documents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Johnny Carson? He was reported to have had
a heart attack, but I haven't seen anything since.
</P>
<P>
   A: Carson underwent successful quadruple heart bypass surgery in
March at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif. Three
weeks later he returned to his Malibu, Calif., home, with a
spokesman proclaiming th-- t the 73-year-old entertainer was
``doing great.'' Although tabloids reported that his health was
declining, he dismissed such a thought with this statement:
``They'll print anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The entertainer, who said he quit smoking more than seven years
ago, is now back on the Los Angeles social circuit and was well
enough to attend a recent tennis tournament there. He and his wife,
Alex, also were seen dining recently at Mr. Chow, a Los Angeles
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Carson attributes his rapid recovery to years of sensible eating
and lots of tennis.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: A recent article mentioned Newton Minow's description of
television as a ``vast wasteland.'' When and where did he say that,
and can you give me some additional context?
</P>
<P>
   A: Minow, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission at
the time, made his now-famous statement on May 9, 1961, in a speech
before 2,000 delegates to the National Association of Broadcasters
convention in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he did not intend ``to idly observe this
squandering of the public's airwaves,'' he added a further
indictment of TV as ``a procession of game shows, violence,
audience participation shows, formula comedies about totally
unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism,
murder, Western badmen, Western goodmen, private eyes, gangsters,
more violence, and cartoons. And, endlessly, commercials, many
screaming, cajoling and offending. And most of all, boredom.'' He
explained later that the remark wasn't meant so much as a total
indictment of everything on TV as it was a way of explaining that,
in his opinion, TV wasn't realizing its potential for good. Minow,
a Democrat appointed by President Kennedy, was a little-known
bureacrat until he became a media darling _ in media other than TV,
that is _ for his comments. He quit the FCC two years later to go
back to law, saying he was making the move for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was vacationing in California at Lake Tahoe, I was
told that it is one of the deepest lakes in the United States. If
it isn't the deepest one, what is?
</P>
<P>
   A: At its deepest point, Lake Tahoe goes 1,640 feet down.
Oregon's Crater Lake tops it _ or should we say bottoms it _ at
1,932 feet at its greatest depth.
</P>
<P>
   Neither U.S. lake comes close to the world record holder, Baikal
in Russia, which in places is 5,371 feet (1.02 miles) deep.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Jerry Lewis' latest telethon received pledges of more than
$53 million. When was his first telethon, and what amount was
pledged then?
</P>
<P>
   A: His first telethon to benefit the Muscular Dystrophy
Association, on Labor Day weekend in 1966, raised more than $1
million in pledges. It was broadcast by only one station, in New
York. This year's broadcast was shown on about 200 stations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the Institute for Policy Studies? It was mentioned in
a recent article reporting on several staff members of the U.S.
House of Representatives who were visiting Iraq, contrary to the
wishes of the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Institute describes itself as ``the only multi-issue
progressive think tank in Washington,'' saying it operates four
programs: global economy; paths for the 21st century; sustainable
communities, and peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based organization's Web site _ www.ips-dc.org _
goes on to say that ``at a time when other think tanks celebrate
the virtues of unrestrained greed, unlimited wealth, and
unregulated markets, IPS is striving to create a more responsible
society, one built around the values of justice, nonviolence,
sustainability and decency.''
</P>
<P>
   The article you mention, by the way, made it clear that the
White House was not pleased about the visit of the congressional
staff members. It went on to say that the five got around a U.S.
ban on travel to Iraq by carrying special papers with their
passports for recording their entry and departure. None of the five
was willing to speak with reporters in Iraq or Jordan, the article
stated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported on both a Fox news broadcast and on MSNBC
that Louis Freeh was not the FBI director at the time of the
burning of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. Can you
confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's correct: Freeh was not the FBI director at the time.
The fire that killed many members of the sect occurred on April 19,
1993, when William Sessions headed the bureau. Sessions gave up the
post at the request of President Clinton and on July 19, 1993, was
replaced by Floyd Clarke, whose title was acting director. Freeh
was named the agency's director on Sept. 1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the design on the left side of the back of a $1
bill, showing a pyramid, an eye, and some Latin words, represent?

   A: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing explains that the Latin
words above the pyramid, Annuit Coeptis, mean ``He has favored our
undertakings.'' The Latin phrase beneath the pyramid, Novus ordo
seclorum, means ``new order of the ages.'' The eye represents the
eye of Providence, and a light around it illustrates ``spiritual
above material.'' The pyramid is unfinished, signifying that this
country needs to grow and build.

   Q: Lance Armstrong recently won the Tour de France as part of a
bicycle team sponsored by the U.S. Postal Service. Did the Postal
Service pay the team's expenses? How does it justify spending money
that way?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Postal Service is one of about 20 team sponsors, said
USPS spokeswoman Margot Myers. All the money from all the sponsors
is pooled to cover all the team's activities throughout the year,
paying for salaries, travel expenses, equipment and any other
expenses the team incurs. Some sponsors, such as USPS, pay money
only; others offer in-kind support, such as providing helmets or
other equipment; and still others provide a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Srvice views its sponsorship of the team strictly as
a business proposition, Myers explained. The USPS has a marketing
and sales development group that oversees this project, with an
annual sales goal that must be met in order to justify continuing
the sponsorship. For example, the group will make a pitch to a
company involved in cycling to use direct mail as part of its
advertising mix, or to use the Postal Service to fill some of its
orders. ``The idea is that we're able to generate enough additional
revenue in sales related to the sponsorship to more than cover the
cost of the sponsorship,'' Myers said.

<P>
   Q: What was the reason for Peter Jennings' extended absence from
ABC World News Tonight?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was on a four-week vacation, said ABC publicist Eileen
Murphy. He was back on the air starting Sept.7.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will a house with a metal frame and metal roof that is
properly grounded to a copper rod about 2 feet in the ground be
protected from lightning?
</P>
<P>
   A: Factors involved in a building's susceptibility to lightning
damage include its height in relation to other structures in the
area, the proximity of large trees, and the materials used to build
the structure. In the structure you described, you should properly
bond all metal parts and provide adequate grounding to ensure that
any lightning strike would be conducted safely to the ground.
Adequate grounding requires at least two ground rods at opposite
corners of the building driven no less than 10 feet into the
ground. They should be installed by an experienced person licensed
to do such work.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners can get additional information from the Lightning
Protection Institute, 3335 N. Arlington Heights Road, Suite E,
Arlington Heights, IL 60004 (1-800-488-6864); or online at

MICROSOFT STARTS THE RECRUITING FOR ITS NEXT WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The browser war may be a memory, but executives
of the Microsoft Corp. conceded Monday that the company now faces
an even greater challenge in the next phase of the Internet's
evolution, as the role of traditional desktop software recedes and
the power center of computing shifts from the operating system to
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Software is increasingly becoming a Web-based service whose main
goal is to hasten the spread of electronic commerce over the
Internet. At an event here to sketch out in broad strokes
Microsoft's technical blueprint for Web software, the company's
president, Steven Ballmer, gave his most candid appraisal to date
of the hurdle his company faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at an inflection point,'' Ballmer said, adding that the
Web strategy announced Monday was ``as important if not more
important'' than plans the company detailed for the browser market
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll either come through this period with a strong following
or we'll be in trouble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer spoke at a conference here that marks the start of a
stepped-up drive by Microsoft to persuade software developers to
use its technology for building Web-based applications and
Internet-based commerce services. The company is positioning this
shift as a way for personal computer software to embrace the
Internet and is promoting its Windows DNA 2000 family of products.
</P>
<P>
   An initiative that includes several products scheduled to be
introduced in the next 18 months, Windows DNA 2000 is being billed
by Microsoft as a ``comprehensive platform that enables the Web
applications and services of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But to date, those are only words _ and the notion of a single
company establishing a software ``platform,'' or standard, that
becomes dominant will be difficult, if even possible, in the
diverse world of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, of course, controls the dominant software standard in
the personal computer industry with its Windows operating system,
which runs on 90 percent of PC's sold today. In the past, outside
software developers had little choice but to write their programs
to run on Microsoft's technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the basic technology standards on the Web are openly
available and not controlled by any single company. So Microsoft
has a much tougher job on its hands in trying to persuade software
developers to use its software for Web applications and Internet
commerce services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a new world in a sense,'' said Tod Nielsen, a Microsoft
vice president in the developers division. ``It used to be our
sandbox _ people wrote to the Windows API,'' or applications
programming interface, the software hooks that other programs must
use to run smoothly on the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives also conceded that the company has not yet
determined what its business model will be for making money as
software moves from desktop products to Web-based services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't know yet,'' Ballmer replied in response to a question on
the subject. ``But if you wait to have a business model in place,
you'll be the last guy in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the broad outlines of Microsoft's strategy were presented
Monday. For software programmers, Microsoft promises to deliver an
array of development tools and a full range of products to simplify
the writing of Internet applications.
</P>
<P>
   The products start with Windows 2000, a major overhaul of the
Windows NT operating system for corporate environments, which is
expected to be shipped later this year. Among other things, Windows
2000 is intended to help Microsoft compete against Sun Microsystems
and IBM in supplying the robust software needed to run the powerful
computers that serve up e-commerce Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company also briefed software developers on several other
products, expected to be shipped by the middle of next year,
including Microsoft Appcenter, software for running Web
applications on centralized data centers, or ``server farms.'' Most
other announcements concerned incorporating Windows DNA 2000
technology in new versions of its current products, like electronic
commerce and data-base software.
</P>
<P>
   To create its Web platform, Microsoft is using an Internet
standard known as Extensible Markup Language, or XML, in its new
offerings. XML opens the way to place more automated intelligence
in software by identifying, tagging and interpreting the kinds of
data in, say, an e-mail message or on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In one demonstration Monday, Microsoft showed how a program
using XML could be added to calendar software so it not only looks
ahead to alert the user of his wedding anniversary, but also links
to shopping software that includes his wife's gift preferences and
favorite stores.
</P>
<P>
   XML is an open industry standard. But the Microsoft pitch to
software developers is that such Web-based services will work best
if they use Microsoft's software and tools. Its different software
products, Microsoft says, will operate with the software of rivals,
but they will work better the more Microsoft software is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does restrict some of their choice, but we're getting rid
of some of the complexity for them,'' said Paul Maritz, group vice
president of Microsoft's developer group. ``And we think there's
value for that, and we charge for it _ but that's true for other
major software companies too, not just Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts say, Microsoft's strategy amounts to an
effort to control the standards for the Internet. ``The pure XML
standard available to everyone is one thing, but if most people use
Microsoft's XML implementations they become the baseline
standard,'' said Jeffrey Tarter, editor of Softletter, an industry
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it may be more difficult for Microsoft to seize the
Internet standards,'' Tarter added, ``but they have 15 or 20 years
of experience of gaining control of standards in computing. They're
good at it.''

$9.4 BILLION DEAL BETWEEN MOTOROLA AND GENERAL INSTRUMENT IN 
WORKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID BARBOZA AND LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola Inc., long a dominant player in the
semiconductor and cellular telephone markets, may be carving out a
new niche for itself in home entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   By negotiating to acquire the General Instrument Corp., the
leading maker of cable set-top boxes, Motorola is trying to be a
leader in merging voice, data and video applications and funneling
them directly into homes through one broadband cable device,
according to people close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, consumers could soon be equipped with a cable
television set-top box offering a variety of multimedia
applications, everything from telephone service and high-definition
television to high-speed Internet access and interactive video
games.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Motorola and General Instrument refused to comment
Monday on such a merger, which was reported in The Wall Street
Journal and The Los Angeles Times. But people close to the talks
said that as early as this week Motorola was expected to agree to
trade about six-tenths of a share of its stock for one share of
General Instrument, which would value the deal at $9.4 billion,
based on Monday's Motorola stock price.
</P>
<P>
   But initial reaction to the combination was negative as
investors sent the stock of both companies tumbling Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Motorola, which is based in
Schaumburg, Ill., fell $8.25, or 8.5 percent, to $90.375, and
shares of General Instrument, which is based in Horsham, Pa.,
dropped $2.8125, or 5.4 percent, to $49.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors in General Instrument apparently considered the
price Motorola was offering as too low, while some Motorola
shareholders apparently thought it too high, fearing the
acquisition could dilute earnings in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow the two companies said that even if
Motorola's earnings were hurt in the early stages of the merger,
the deal would eventually reap huge benefits by positioning the
company in the fast-converging market of cable television and
telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger makes a lot of sense for Motorola,'' said Kenneth
Leon, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``This is clearly the direction
Motorola wants to go in: they've been desperately looking for
another high-growth business, and digital boxes open up
opportunities for new features and services.''
</P>
<P>
   The move by Motorola comes as the world of media,
telecommunications and cable properties is being redrawn. Just last
week, Viacom Inc. agreed to acquire CBS Inc. That deal would create
the world's second-largest media company after Time-Warner Inc. And
over the last two years, AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest telephone
company, has transformed itself into the nation's leading provider
of cable television by swallowing up companies like
Telecommunications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say leading telecommunications, cable and
media companies are scrambling to find partners in the expectation
that many of the technologies will converge. Wireless phones,
televisions, video games and other devices will no longer have
distinct voice, data and video applications. They will be one _ or
at least linked through cable and wireless ports that can deliver
high-quality video and audio.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major focus for them is broadband technology,'' Mona Eraiba,
an analyst at Gruntal &AMP; Company, said of the prospective
Motorola-General Instrument deal. ``There are going to be set-top
boxes with cable modems and satellite technology. This is really a
chance to deploy the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is already the leading maker of cable modems, which can
deliver cable programming into the personal computer. Now, analysts
say, the company can combine that technology and its ability to
feed data into a set-top box and cable infrastructure devised by
General Instrument that delivers everything from interactive video
to electronic commerce capacities. Some analysts predict that new
set-top boxes will be equipped with pay-per-view access and a slot
through which a credit card could be swiped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at an inflexion point, everything is moving very fast,''
Ms. Eraiba said. ``And the set-top boxes sit at the crossroads of
many technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is now racing to that crossroads. After stumbling badly
because of a slowdown in Asia and a decline in the sales of
cellular telephones, Motorola has moved aggressively to return to
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the company has made sharp cuts in its work
force, upgraded its cellular handsets in a booming cellular
marketplace and moved quickly to beef up its software development
and to position itself in the Internet and home entertainment
markets.
</P>
<P>
   It has made agreements with Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems
Inc. to begin developing a ``wireless Internet'' network. The
company has also invested heavily in Teledesic LLC to produce
satellites to create an ``Internet in the sky'' system.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Motorola have rocketed more than 50 percent in the
past year, despite a troublesome investment in Iridium LLC, a
satellite telephone service now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Still,
company executives say Motorola is reaching into homes with cable
modems, set-top boxes and high-definition television sets, with
gentle whispers about the new buzzword on Wall Street: convergence.
</P>
<P>
   ``With set-top boxes they would have a control center that
delivers bytes the same way your electric company is delivering
watts,'' said Eric Buck, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``The big picture is that broadband pipes are going to
win out.''

Graphics world gets new tool 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They came expecting a new enhanced iMac, but what the
audience of publishers and graphic designers got instead was the
surprise announcement of a new computer built for them.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Steve Jobs, the mercurial interim chief executive of Apple,
had done it again. He used the recent Seybold trade show in San
Francisco to unveil a new development in his company's technology:
a new microprocessor chip called the G4.
</P>
<P>
   The chip offers computing speeds up to 500 megahertz. Jobs calls
this microprocessor the ``first supercomputer on a chip.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed of a chip in megahertz is not the total measure of how
fast the chip performs. The technical performance specifications of
this chip are nearly three times faster than those of the Pentium
III microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   The G4 is so fast, in part, because it includes something called
the ``velocity engine.'' It can perform multiple operations and is
especially good at handling streaming media such as video and
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Such an improvement is especially important to graphic
designers, who increasingly find themselves working with multimedia
projects like Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Apple's new G4 Power Macs are designed for this
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   To further enhance the appeal of the G4 to designers, Apple also
released at Seybold a new 22-inch, flat screen monitor. Some of
those who have used this monitor, called Apple Cinema Display, have
called its sharpness ``stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   The G4 will be available in two versions. Keeping them straight
can be a little confusing, given that they both carry the same
moniker, but here goes.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the two G4s is essentially a souped-up version of
Apple's current blue-and-white desktop machine, the G3. What's new
is the G4 microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the speed of the G4 will be 400 mhz, with more
powerful versions arriving in October. It will sell for $1,600, the
same price as the top of the line G3.
</P>
<P>
   The second version of the G4, dubbed Sawtooth, will include a
redesign of the motherboard, which is the central nervous system of
any computer.
</P>
<P>
   The redesign will add several improvements, including faster
hard drives, ports and wireless networking technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Sawtooth model, however, is not expected to ship until
November. It will sell between $2,400 and $6,500, depending on the
speed of the microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   While the G4s are more powerful than what most consumers need,
the model is important to Apple, anchoring the support of the
design and publishing industry, which long has been the company's
biggest supporter.

Sites help to find the right college By Bill Husted c.1999 Cox News

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ September has become the real start of the new year
for many of us. After years of going to school, September becomes a
natural beginning. If you or someone you know plans to start to
college in a year, this is the right time to begin planning _ both
for selecting the college and for preparing for the financial
burden college can bring.
</P>
<P>
   While the Web does not offer a replacement for campus visits and
sessions with your banker, it can be a valuable tool.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we'll take a look at some of the sites that offer real
help. The first is All About College at www.allaboutcollege.com/.
It makes a good starting spot because it offers a real variety of
information _ links and advice about financial aid, fraternities,
study abroad, student jobs and even some help on where to go for
spring break.
</P>
<P>
   The real meat here is in the section about individual colleges.
At this site, you'll find links to almost every public and private
college. The links _ arranged by state _ take you directly to the
school's Web page and to e-mail addresses for more information.
Don't expect a critical review of the college here. We'll find
those elsewhere. What you get is at least as valuable, a direct
connection to the colleges of interest and a fast way to find
almost any college on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The next site is a real knockout punch. It's the U.S. News &AMP;
World Report college site at
www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/cohome.htm. There are so many
features here that we'll just look at the unique ones. You probably
already realize that U.S. News is known for its reviews of colleges
in the print edition. That means this site draws from a solid
database of information.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features is the ability to do a side-by-side
comparison of two or three colleges. You simply type in the names
of the colleges that interest you and, at the click of a mouse, get
a very detailed comparison. And, because part of the information
you enter is your ZIP code, you'll also find out how long the
commute home would be for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Other features also take advantage of the magazine's store of
knowledge. You can use a pull-down menu to get a list of what the
magazine considers to be the best colleges or the colleges that
offer the most diversity or the ones that have the most
international students. You also can use a separate pull-down menu
to find out about topics such as considerations faced by older
students, what to look for when you make a campus visit and
information about distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   Spend some time on this page, because this is just a surface
scan of the features offered. Most parents and potential students
probably could make a decent informed decision solely based on what
is offered here.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is called Peterson's The College Channel at
www.petersons.com/ugrad/. The quality here also is top-notch, with
enough unique information _ including about financial aid and
preparing for college entrance tests _ to make this a worthwhile
addition to our college tour.
</P>
<P>
   Because higher education doesn't always mean a conventional
four-year program, there are links to information about such places
as culinary arts schools, nursing programs and schools that
specialize in training for the performing arts.
</P>
<P>
   One avenue of financial aid for students is the monetary
assistance offered by some ROTC programs. You'll find a link that
will help you learn if that's a viable option.

New biz magazine looks at entrepreneurs &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta has a new local business magazine, and it's
called Catalyst. The magazine's debut issue features a lead article
about five young entrepreneurs the writer says are shaping ``a new
Atlanta.'' The five are Andrea Arena, founder and president of 2
Places at 1 Time; Jeff Levy, founder of eHatchery; Alan Daniels,
chairman of RealEstate.com; Alexis Abramson, founder of Mature
Mart; and Tom Noonan, president of Internet Security Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Catalyst also features an article that asks whether Atlanta is
the Silicon Valley of the South. Not quite, the article concludes,
arguing that the city still lacks the name-brand companies, capital
and talent to claim the mantle.
</P>
<P>
   If you're stuck in a Nintendo game, unable to move to the next
level, you might want to check out the September issue of Nintendo
Power. This magazine, as you may guess from the name, features
nothing but stories about how to win games on Game Boy, Super
Nintendo and Nintendo 64. The current issue features tips on how to
play Gauntlet Legends, Gex 3, Re-Volt and Shadow Man. You'll also
find tips on color Game Boy titles such as Tarzan, Looney Tunes and
Deja Vu.

you need to save to finance a child's college education. Money is
available only for Windows-based computers.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's Quicken 2000 has similar features. In addition, it has

 &HT;    Even on Web, all eggs don't hatch
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So, who wants to be a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   You do, and you're pretty sure you don't have to spend 30
minutes sitting across from Regis Philbin on that TV game show to
be a millionaire. No, not you. You've got a better way.
</P>
<P>
   You have an idea for a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just any Web site. You're thinking about an e-commerce,
interactive, user friendly, full-service-technology solution,
filled with every whiz-bang gizmo and gadget all the big guys have.
It's a winner. You know it is. All you have to do is find somebody
to give you a few bucks to get this revolutionary site up and
running.
</P>
<P>
   Now, plenty of firms are willing to give money to fledgling
Internet companies, but they tend to want to see things like
business plans, profit-and-loss statements and all kinds of other
paperwork before they will throw millions of dollars at you. Sure,
it's unfair, but that's how it is.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Jeff Levy, one of the founders of Relevant
Knowledge, came along with an idea for a new Internet incubator
called eHatchery. The Atlanta-based company will work with Internet
start-ups to help them not only get their ventures off the ground
but also give them the day-to-day business savvy to run a company.
</P>
<P>
   His idea is very simple. Levy, founder of the Web measurement
firm Relevant Knowledge, which later merged with Media Metrix,
knows that even the best ideas have to be honed before you can ask
anyone, even your grandmother, for money.
</P>
<P>
   eHatchery's plan is to give entrepreneurs a grounding in
business practices and how the Internet industry works so ideas can
become companies that won't be laughed out onto the street when
they go looking for serious money.
</P>
<P>
   Although eHatchery makes it very clear on its Web page
(www.ehatchery.com) that the company is serious business, somehow a
``come one, come all'' feeling seems to have gripped everyone from
legitimate Web developers to the people who actually watch those
``Make tons of money on the Internet by selling the products we
tell you to sell'' infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   Calls and inquiries to eHatchery were pouring in, according to
one eHatchery staffer, and here at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, callers wanted to know how to contact Levy.
When they were told that the best way was via the company's Web
site, some people actually seemed surprised this was the Internet
incubator's preferred method of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Some callers to the newspaper were looking for a fax number to
send ideas to the company, but the rules for idea submission are
laid out on the Web site, and if you want to start a Web company,
filling out a form on the Web is a pretty good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong to think the only people who are calling
eHatchery or any other incubator or venture capital firm are people
with get-rich-quick schemes. Quite a few people out there are
working on what could be the next Yahoo!, WebMD or Relevant
Knowledge just waiting to be discovered. Once they have the tools
to do business and form partnerships, they could actually make it
big.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising response to eHatchery's debut says a lot of
things about how people still think about the Internet. Many people
still see it as the Wild West where anybody can ride into Dodge
City and become Marshal Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the millions of articles devoted to technology and the
Internet and all the people moaning about how commercial the Web
has become, some people still think a Web site is a ticket to
financial freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it for a minute. Even Yahoo! has trouble turning a
profit, and Internet service provider MindSpring has decided to
forgo making a profit in favor of expanding the company. Take a
look at the registration statement for Salon's initial public stock
offering. They say, for everyone to see, that they might never make
any money on the Web. Ever. And this is one of the Web's most
popular sites.
</P>
<P>
   EHatchery already has a few companies under its wing and
probably will sign on quite a few more. Many of them probably have
great ideas that one day will become household names to both
consumers and stockholders. But a pile of money and a vague idea is
not enough to make anyone an online millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes even a good idea and a pile of money aren't enough.

 &HT;    Mad air travelers get ticking
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to air travel, there is a lot to be
ticked about: runway delays, coach seating that feels more like
steerage and, perhaps especially, the use of the word ``deplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a site, www.ticked.com, to serve as your caustic
mouthpiece. The site is a collection of consumer-friendly,
anti-corporate rants about anything and everything annoying about
travel. It's Ralph Nader and Dennis Miller with a little Don
Rickles tossed in to put an edge on things.
</P>
<P>
   A recent ChrisCrossings column answered a question from a reader
who wondered when airlines were going to quit squeezing more seats
into the business and first-class areas and cramping the folks in
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree the economy-class passengers are flying like sardines.
I base that conclusion on the ever-shrinking distance between seats
... (which) has shrunk from about 33 inches to about 30 inches. But
there are other passenger comfort issues, such as reduced seat
width, overall quality and diminished air supply that all make for
a claustrophobic traveling experience. But passengers aren't
behaving very well either. A well-publicized string of ``air rage''
incidents has plagued the airline business for the last few years.
Reversing the air rage problem is easy: Just release passengers
from the vise grip that is economy class.''
</P>
<P>
   The site is free. It was created by Christopher Elliott, an
Annapolis, Md.-based free-lance travel writer who writes a column
called the Crabby Traveler for ABCNews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Site helps you become your dog's best friend
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you know someone who keeps a dog chained in the back
yard and rarely walks it. It's enough to make you wonder why the
dog was gotten in the first place, as a companion or a furrier,
more politically correct lawn jockey?
</P>
<P>
   A thoughtful Web site, www.howtoloveyourdog.com, tries to remove
some of the mystery from dog ownership and prevent decent people
from becoming bad owners.
</P>
<P>
   The site is aimed at children, trying to catch potential dog
owners before bad habits form.
</P>
<P>
   It was created by Janet Wall, a former San Diego elementary
schoolteacher. Wall decided to take lesson plans she designed to
teach students kindness, commitment and responsibility and apply
them to dog-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The advice is designed to cover a dog's life, from ``A New Dog''
through ``Losing Dogs,'' with ``What They Cost,'' ``What They
Need'' and ``Where They Come From,'' in between.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on ``A New Dog'' gives you an idea of the thoroughness
of the site.
</P>
<P>
   She points out several of the downsides of dog ownership,
mentioning that dogs can: get big, bark a lot, chew furniture, shed
and get sick on the rug.
</P>
<P>
   Wall also lists several questions that anyone considering dog
ownership should ask, including:
</P>
<P>
   Am I responsible?
</P>
<P>
   Am I kind and gentle?
</P>
<P>
   Do I have the extra time to spend with a dog?
</P>
<P>
   Do I want to spend 10 to 15 years with a dog?
</P>
<P>
   Does everyone in your house want one?
</P>
<P>
   Whitney to show art of 20th century America
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Intel and New York's Whitney Museum of
American Art are launching the second half of an online version of
a museum tour.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.artmuseum.net, features paintings from the
Whitney's The American Century: Art &AMP; Culture 1900-2000 exhibit.
The online tour will feature works from 1950 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The first part opened in April and it featured more than 100
objects on display at the Whitney. The part starting Sept. 26
features another 100 works and includes archival documents, images
and historical information about the era. The combined exhibit will
be online for three years.

 The Best Way: Everything Your Mother Told You About Cooking
May  Not Be True  Introduction by Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Culinary assumptions abound in the cooking world.
For example, we ``know'' these truisms:
<P>
   _ Dried beans must be soaked overnight before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Meat shouldn't be salted before cooking or it will lose too
much moisture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pork roast must be cooked to 170 degrees for flavor and
safety.
</P>
<P>
   In our new ``Best Way'' column starting today, the Food staff
will systematically challenge many of these truisms and techniques
that our mothers, friends and cookbook authors have told us were
true.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking has changed, but our assumptions often haven't. We have
better ovens that bake with more even heat. The freshness and
quality of produce and meats have improved. We can buy more
varieties of meats and vegetables that benefit from different
cooking techniques. Plus we have less time to experiment in the
kitchen to find out what works and what doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Best Way,'' the Food staff will examine preparation
presumptions and try to establish the most reliable way to cook
many of our favorite foods.
</P>
<P>
   Today we tackle the ultimate comfort food _ baked potatoes.
After testing, tasting and retesting we tried 16 variations before
coming up with the winner.
</P>
<P>
   We also developed a citrus marinade for chicken and pork to
determine the optimum time the meat should marinate and whether the
marinade should contain salt. You may be surprised at the results.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks we'll examine the dried bean question. We'll
share our findings on producing the creamiest, fluffiest scrambled
eggs; and we'll even tackle the best way to brew coffee.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a cooking question or a subject you'd like us to
investigate, we'd love to hear from you. We'll answer as many
questions as we can in print. Send it to Best Way, Food Department,
The Chronicle, 901 Mission St., San Francisco, Calif. 94103.

   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; By Elizabeth Brubaker &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  There's nothing simpler than a baked potato, or so
we thought until we started to figure out the best way to cook it.
We discovered that even slight changes in the cooking method and
temperature could make big differences in the final product.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-step process, we cooked medium-sized russet potatoes
14 ways, testing oven temperature, cooking time and cooking style.
We wrapped, oiled, buttered, salted _ and left some completely
plain. We even tried the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   In our series of taste tests, the Food staff agreed potatoes are
best when cooked in a 350-degree oven for 11/2 hours. Potatoes
baked at higher temperatures for less time had limp skins and dense
flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The most varied results, however, came from slight changes in
the cooking method.
</P>
<P>
   The potatoes cooked in foil were a disaster _ they tasted more
steamed than baked. The skin was limp and chewy, the flesh dense
and overly-moist.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbing the potato with oil produced a similar steamed effect,
but the flavor was better.
</P>
<P>
   And when microwaved, the potato turned into a shriveled, mushy
mess.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The plain potato, pierced with a fork to let steam escape,
produced the best results. Baked at 350 degrees for 11/2 hours, the
potato emerged with a great flavor and a light and fluffy texture.
In addition, the skin was crisp but chewable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AN APPEALING ALTERNATIVE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you want a change from the pure baked potato experience, the
potato rubbed with olive oil and coarse salt is a good choice. The
skin absorbs the flavor of the oil and the flecks of salt give it
added visual interest.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Food staff found that the potato rubbed with
butter wasn't as good as the one with oil. It was fluffier inside,
but the cooked butter flavor didn't improve the outside.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; FOR THE HURRIED COOK &LR;

   In a time crunch, you can microwave a potato for 5 minutes, then
finish it in a 350-degree oven for 10 minutes. The oven helps crisp
the skin and dry out the flesh so it's not dense and gluey like the
potato fully baked in a microwave.

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO  &LR; _ How much does meat benefit from being marinated
before cooking _ and what is the optimum amount of marinating time?
</P>
<P>
   In our search for the best marinade, we developed a citrus-based
mixture (see accompanying recipe) designed for pork tenderloin or
boneless skinless chicken breasts. Both were allowed to marinate
for two hours, four hours and 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   We also wanted to find out whether salt would draw an excessive
amount of moisture from the chicken breasts if it was part of the
marinade. So we made two versions of the marinade, one with salt
and one without.
</P>
<P>
   Once it had marinated, we sauteed the meat in the same amount of
oil over the same heat for the same length of time.
</P>
<P>
   We found that marinating meat, as expected, adds juiciness and
flavor. However, chicken absorbs marinades faster than pork
tenderloin.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Chicken breasts. &LR;  We preferred the chicken left in the salted
marinade. It had a zesty citrus flavor and was tender and juicy.
Marinating the chicken for a longer time didn't enhance either the
flavor or the texture.
</P>
<P>
   However, the breast left in the salted marinade overnight turned
out dry and stringy after it was cooked. We surmised that had the
chicken been whole or the breast not been skinless the flesh would
have been moister.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Pork tenderloin. &LR;  Food staffers liked the flavor and texture
of the pork tenderloin that had been marinated without salt for 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The pork tenderloin that had been left in a salted marinade for
24 hours was dry.
</P>
<P>
   Marinating the pork for less time _ either two or four hours _
wasn't worth the bother. If you want a marinade to add flavor, the
tenderloin has to soak for more than four hours.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ALL-PURPOSE MARINADE
</P>
<P>
   This recipe yields enough marinade for 2 pork tenderloins or 6
chicken breasts.
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely minced orange zest
</P>
<P>
   1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup hoisin sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup honey
</P>
<P>
   6 garlic cloves, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup very finely minced fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup minced whole green onions
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients in a nonreactive container. Add meat to
the container, cover and refrigerate overnight if you're not using
salt.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using salt, marinate in the refrigerator for no longer
than 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 21/2 cups.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The calories and other nutrients absorbed from marinades vary &LR; 
 &LR; and are difficult to estimate. Variables include the type of &LR; 
 &LR; food, marinating time and amount of surface area. Therefore, &LR; 
 &LR; this recipe contains no analysis. &LR;

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Silky Budini Burst With Flavor   By Michael Bauer 
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  You'll find many versions of savory cheese
custards, called budino, all over Italy, but in the Bay Area
they're rare. At Acquerello, Suzette Gresham has introduced
Northern Californians to this creamy delight, served with asparagus
and intensely flavored pea shoots.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Gresham's Parmesan Budino has rustic origins, it gets a
refined twist from baking in a slow oven.
</P>
<P>
   If pea shoots aren't available, simply omit them or substitute a
scattering of fresh peas or other young shoots. The budino's
wonderfully nutty flavor pairs well with just about any spring
vegetable. It's also good accompanied by an arugula or watercress
salad. In addition, it works equally well with Grana Padano instead
of Parmesan.
</P>
<P>
   Gresham first got this recipe from Todd English, the well-known
chef of Olives in Boston, but she's made it her own by adding a few
twists along the way.
</P>
<P>
   This is only one of the great dishes that Gresham and her
partner, Giancarlo Paterlini, have served over the last decade.
They've created the most refined Italian restaurant in San
Francisco. The formal, professional service and the excellent
Italian wine list are part of the reason the Wine Spectator has
named Acquerello the second best Italian restaurant in the nation,
behind Valentino in Santa Monica and ahead of Felidia in New York.
</P>
<P>

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 &HT;    Mavis Beacon's bottom line: Still a good typing program
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those of you who have been involved with computers for
15 years or so will be glad to know that Mavis Beacon still Teaches
Typing.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis looks as good as ever. Actually, she doesn't look like the
Mavis I remember from previous editions, but after all, this is
Version 10. How many Version 10s have you see lately? Not even
MS-DOS made it to Version 10.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund's Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is by far the
longest-lived program I know. The copyright goes back to 1987, but
somehow it seems older to me.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I can tell, nothing has changed, basically. After all,
typing is typing is typing, and this is amply illustrated by the
fact that Mavis' versions 5, 8 and 9 still are available. The
keyboard still is the same, unless you use one of those Microsoft
keyboards, and Mavis makes allowances for that.
</P>
<P>
   It also asks the student at the outset what sort of skills are
required _ ordinary typing or 10-key typing, in which one hand is
used to enter numerals only.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding how good you want to be, i.e., how much better
than the basic 40 words per minute, you enter Mavis' classroom and
take a test.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it makes a certain amount of cold, cruel sense to
force the student to type nonsense words; this presumably puts
everyone on a level field. Typing complete sentences might allow
some students to go faster than others, although this isn't a
competition. I suppose I'm just whining because Mavis cut me off
after the first of a dozen or so lines and said she had seen enough
to know how to tailor a program for me.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently I went to the bottom of the class, because we began
with our little hands on the home row, typing words like fasd, dsf
or safd. Mavis was most encouraging; I had the feeling that in
another 10 minutes of this, had I retained my sanity, her manicured
hand, short fingernails and all, would have emerged from the
monitor to offer me a piece of candy.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see that learning to type hasn't changed a whole lot
in 40 years or so, which is why I never learned. I taught myself
(the Warner method) and I can fairly fly with a good keyboard and
the wind in the right direction. Uncharitable editors would tell
you that I average five typos to the sentence, but in my view
that's what editors are there for _ and it would be churlish to
deprive them of work.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Beacon has a lot more than basic drudgery up her sleeve,
at least on the DeLuxe version. At the media center, you can go to
a practice center and type actual sentences (some of which might
even have some meaning to you). There are a number of subjects from
which to choose, from astronomy to poetry.
</P>
<P>
   You also can get the latest views on ergonomics for typists. You
can take a test to judge the ergonomics of your own setup. I shut
off the video before it was finished discussing my desk, chair and
so forth, but the general opinion seemed to be that only the
Hunchback of Notre Dame could long survive it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a whole bunch of typing games test speed, accuracy
and, in some instances, patience. By and large they are good fun,
and anyone using this program to learn typing will find them a
welcome break.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis is a strict taskmaster. You cannot swap in and out of the
program, and the task bar is unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   I would assume that Mavis Beacon has the software typing
tutorial market pretty much to itself by now. Certainly a lot of
typing programs have come and gone over the years, some of them
rather bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis V10 Deluxe lists for $50 and includes a soft rubber ball
for strengthening your hands (one at a time) and a rather strange
mouse pad with a big padded speed bump at one end. You should have
no trouble finding Mavis in stores, but in case you want to check
out the older versions, go to www.mavisbeacon.com _ it even has an
essay on the history of typing.
</P>
<P>
   I could not, however, find the answer to the biggest question of
all _ is Mavis Beacon merely the Betty Crocker of the keyboard, or
was she a real typing teacher?

 AT THE SOURCE: Heirlooms of the Orchard   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SEBASTAPOL, Calif. _  When it comes to enthusiasm for apples,
Johnny Appleseed has nothing on Stan Devoto. When this Sonoma
County grower describes his Gravensteins, Winesaps, Spitzenburgs,
Galas and Arkansas Blacks, you can almost feel the tart spritz of a
tree-ripened apple in your mouth and smell the heady aroma of an
apple crisp bubbling toward sweet perfection in the oven.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Devoto, a one-time home builder, and his wife, Susan, moved
to Sebastopol two decades ago they bought property that was filled
with apple trees. Susan Devoto enrolled in community college
classes to learn how to grow and care for apples, and the couple
leased additional acreage. In short order, builder Devoto had
become farmer Devoto.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the Gravenstein _ which reportedly traces its
lineage to Northern Italy _ ruled supreme in Sonoma County. In the
1960s, says Devoto, there were about 12,000 acres of apple orchards
in western Sonoma County alone (Devoto cultivated as many as 60).
Today, acreage is down to 4,000; the Devotos grow heirloom and
antique apples on 15 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The decline, Devoto says, can be traced to changes in lifestyles
and economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cans anymore, and few people make applesauce or bake
pies'' _ preparations to which the Gravenstein is uniquely suited,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   On the economic side, the equation is fairly fundamental.
Gravensteins are fickle, with many trees yielding good harvests
only every other year. The same land planted to wine grapes can
bring in 21/2 to six times as much money. The initial investment in
growing grapes may be high, but in the long run that's where the
profit is.
</P>
<P>
   The Devotos haven't joined the stampede. Instead, they have
developed a thriving business in cut flowers, which subsidizes the
apples.
</P>
<P>
   Devoto sends his apple and flower harvests to 12 farmers'
markets around the Bay Area, including San Francisco's Ferry Plaza,
San Rafael and St. Helena. These markets, along with some specialty
stores like Berkeley's Monterey Market and restaurants that
appreciate locally grown fruit with distinct qualities and flavors,
guarantee the survival of old varieties like the Gravenstein.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of commercial produce distribution, these classics
would surely face extinction, Devoto believes. They cannot be
harvested under-ripe _ as most large-scale crops are _ but are
hand-picked at their peak. That's what makes them deliciously
special _ and too perishable for the mass market that demands long
shelf life. Gravensteins, like most heirloom apples, start to
soften after a week.
</P>
<P>
   Devoto likes to explain these things to customers at the
farmers' markets he attends, often accompanied by one of his three
daughters, aged 9, 11 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Jolie is ``the most into apples'' and might just
follow in her parents' footsteps. Her dad says she bakes a fine
apple crisp and, showing early business acumen, often sells some of
it to workers on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether they end up with farming careers or choose
other pursuits, Devoto says farm life with its seasonal cycles and
dependence on nature creates a healthy environment for growing up.
And it enables him to be an active father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I start early,'' Devoto says of his work day, ``and I try to
knock off by 4:30. During the week, I don't miss any of the girls'
soccer games.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; An Orchard and Its Heirlooms &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Heirlooms are fragile. That applies to old and unusual fruit just
as much as it does to fine old furniture or china.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Devoto, who grows as many as 65 kinds of heirloom and
unusual apples on 15 acres in Sebastopol, can explain both why this
kind of apple _ Winesap, Gravenstein, Arkansas Black, Spitzenburg
(Thomas Jefferson's favorite) and Hawaiian (an apple with a flavor
resembling tropical fruit, developed in Sebastopol 50 years ago) _
has become rare, and why it's a fruit to be treasured.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastopol, he says, has the best growing conditions an apple
could encounter. The coastal climate with its cool nights and foggy
mornings, followed by warm afternoons, lets the apple mature at a
leisurely pace. Devoto does not have to irrigate his orchards _
another factor that contributes to the intense flavor and what he
considers the unsurpassed texture of these apples.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most supermarket varieties, Devoto's apples are not
picked until they are truly ripe. They can't be stored very long
before they get soft, so they don't fit the mantra of mass
marketers: shelf life, shelf life, shelf life. What's more, they
may have a few marks or look a little gnarled. Some of them are,
admits Devoto, cosmetically challenged.
</P>
<P>
   But _ ah _ the taste. ``I eat 10 apples a day,'' the grower
admits with a chuckle.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Schools in Ohio are virtually changing.
</P>
<P>
   Classrooms in Warren and Hamilton counties will move out of the
traditional school setting into homes, businesses, libraries _
anywhere there's a computer that has Internet access with the
start-up this week of a Virtual Learning Academy in Ohio. For the
first time in the state, it's possible to take high school courses
online.
</P>
<P>
   Other counties, including Montgomery County, are expected to
join in quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This educational delivery system can break down time and
distance barriers that have kept people out of the classroom,''
said John Boggess, superintendent of the Miami Valley Career
Technology Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults can take classes to enhance their jobs, students can
get special intervention for proficiency tests or take classes not
offered at their school.''
</P>
<P>
   Via the Internet, students learn from the best libraries,
museums, and information archives in the world, said Greg Berry,
president of The Citadel Group International, based in Maryland.
Citadel developed the learning academy and was hired to make sure
the lessons meet Ohio Department of Education standards, Berry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many courses are enhanced by graphics, stereo sounds and
multimedia pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The courses are set up so students can move at their own pace,
but still receive guidance from a teacher who is either at an area
school or available by e-mail or telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe you cannot substitute the face-to-face time with a
teacher. That element has to be incorporated into any kind of
learning,'' said Clifford A. Migal, president of the Great Oaks
Institute of Technology and Career Development, the joint
vocational school that serves, Hamilton, Highland, and Clermont
Counties.
</P>
<P>
   The academy includes two components: Learning Springs: On-line
curriculum for students grades five to 12. In Ohio, the fee runs
about $165 per student for unlimited access to a library of 80
courses that include basic education classes, proficiency
intervention and electives such as foreign languages. Adult
Learning: more than 600 courses that range from personal
development to computer classes to electrical schematics. Fees run
$150 per course with up to six months to complete. There's no
traditional start of the school year so students can sign up and
get started at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges offer courses on-line, but only three states _ New
York, Georgia and South Carolina _ offer Internet study. Citadel
has contracts with about 6,000 individual school districts to
provide coursework in some fashion on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio will tap into virtual classes through an initiative of the
Ohio Association of Joint Vocational School Superintendents. The
association voted in August to secure rights to the Citaldel's
curriculum in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw an opportunity for public education to use virtual
learning as a tool in a viably financial way,'' said Vince
Roessner, superintendent of the Warren County Career Center. ``If
we don't deliver this, somebody else will and they may not be as
altruistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Roessner and Migal volunteered to test the program for adults
and high school students in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Great Oaks got the head start with virtual classes offered to
161 students over the summer. Of those students, two failed, two
dropped the courses and 157 passed. About 83 percent of the
students got a C or better, Migel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a group who had already failed the class
once. You bring them back with a new delivery option and 157 out of
161 complete the class,'' Migel said. ``That's phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Great Oaks and Warren County career centers will begin to
offer virtual classes to adults in October. Roessner said virtual
high school classes should be on-line by the end of the year.
Credit from the classes counts toward a high school diploma and
would show up on a student's transcript no differently than if the
student went to school to pass the class.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County hopes to roll out adult programs in January,
Boggess said. The Greene County Career Center is investigating the
on-line courses but has no definite plan to start them,
Superintendent Marsha Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very interested in learning more,'' Leonard said.
</P>

 THE WORKING COOK: Prepared Food Shortcuts Allow for Even
Speedier  Cooking  By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Bay Area grocery stores are making it possible for
us to cook quickly without having to resort to frozen or heavily
processed foods. With all of the freshly prepared foods _ fresh
salsa, cleaned and deveined shrimp, prewashed salad mixes and
smoked tofu, just to name a few _ why not take advantage?
<P>
   However, some pre-prepared foods are better than others. Many
commercial pestos, for instance, have lost their fresh herbal
flavor by the time you get them.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to find the best products. Pasta Etc. brand pesto,
made in Sonoma, has no cheese or oil and is flavored with miso.
That may not sound like pesto at all, but its bright basil flavor
works very well in this week's Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe is simple but elegant enough for a dinner party
because of the way it looks _ luscious pink salmon atop golden
couscous, accented with green basil sauce. Quick pan-frying gives
the fillets a crisp crust and moist interior, and the pesto sauce,
mixed with lemon juice, cuts through the richness of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Another excellent prepared product is achiote paste. Widely used
in Mexico's Yucatan region, this seasoning base is made of ground
annatto seeds, spices, vinegar and sometimes garlic. Mixed with oil
and additional seasonings, achiote is an instant marinade that
gives intense flavor and an appealing saffron-red color to meat and
fish.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's 30-minute recipe, chicken breasts are marinated
in achiote, then quickly broiled. The chicken is placed on top of a
salad of crisp jicama and arugula dressed with lime juice and a
touch of cayenne, bringing the vibrant marinade to life.
</P>
<P>
   Like all lasagnas, the Now &AMP; Later recipe, Lentil and Butternut
Squash Lasagna, involves many steps. But it's worth every minute
you spend behind the stove.
</P>
<P>
   A vegetarian dish created by my non-meat-eating friend
Elisabeth, the lasagna brings together butternut squash, roasted
until creamy, with firm French lentils and intensely sweet
caramelized onions. A rich b &LR; e &LR; chamel sauce makes the layers float
on top of each other like clouds.
</P>
<P>
   When making a many-stepped recipe like Lentil and Butternut
Squash Lasagna, do all the prep work ahead of time. Chop the
vegetables and herbs, measure the liquids and grate the cheese
before you start cooking. Being organized allows you to cook many
things at once instead of trying to chop while minding something on
the stove.
</P>
<P>
   If you like, break up the preparation by cooking the b &LR; e &LR; chamel
and vegetables ahead of time, then layering the lasagna the next
day. To reheat b &LR; e &LR; chamel, add a bit more milk and heat it slowly,
stirring constantly. Do not allow it to boil.

 &LR; PAN-FRIED SALMON FILLETS WITH LEMON PESTO &AMP; COUSCOUS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons prepared pesto sauce (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 (10-ounce) package instant couscous
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 boned skinless salmon fillets, 5 to 6 ounces each and 1-inch
thick
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 lemon wedges
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   If possible, let the pesto sit at room temperature for 20
minutes before beginning preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the pesto sauce and lemon juice. Set aside at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the couscous according to package directions, adding 1/2
teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon olive oil to the cooking water. Keep
warm while while you prepare the salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Season the salmon fillets on both sides with salt and pepper.
Heat a large nonstick skillet until quite hot. Add 1 tablespoon of
the olive oil and heat until almost smoking. Cook 2 salmon fillets
flesh-side down over medium-high heat until crispy on the bottom,
about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the fillets and cook an additional 2 minutes. The fish
should be tender in the middle and crispy outside. Remove the
fillets from the pan and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan and repeat
with the 2 remaining fillets.
</P>
<P>
   Fluff the couscous with a fork. Serve the salmon on a bed of
couscous, dressed with the lemon-pesto sauce and garnished with
lemon wedges.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; Pasta Etc. pesto sauce (made in Sonoma), which has no
cheese or oil, works well in this recipe because it cuts through
the richness of the salmon.

 &LR; ACHIOTE-MARINATED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH JICAMA SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons achiote paste (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   4 boneless, skinless chicken half-beasts
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 to 2 limes
</P>
<P>
   1 medium jicama
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch arugula or other bitter greens
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the achiote paste, cumin, the 11/2 teaspoons salt
and the vegetable oil. Coat the chicken in this mixture and set
aside at room temperature for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape off any large chunks of marinade from the chicken
breasts. Place breasts on a foil-lined pan and cook directly under
the broiler until done, 7-15 minutes, depending on thickness. Check
for doneness by slicing through thickest part of one breast. If you
see any pinkness, continue cooking another minute or so. When done,
remove chicken from the oven and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the cayenne pepper, sugar, juice of 1 lime and salt to
taste in a small bowl. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the jicama in half, then stand each half on its flat end and
trim off the skin with a sharp knife. Cut the halves into 1/4-inch
slices, then stack them and cut them again into long julienne.
</P>
<P>
   Trim off and discard the woody stem ends from the bunch of
arugula and coarsely chop the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the jicama and arugula in a bowl and toss with the
dressing. The jicama should have a kick of cayenne and tart lime;
add more if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, slice each chicken breast crosswise into 4 large
pieces. Place the salad on a large platter and arrange the chicken
pieces on top. Serve with warm tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; You can find bricks of achiote paste in Latin American
markets or in supermarkets with large Hispanic sections.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Variation:  &LR; These chicken breasts are delicious on the grill,
or use a grill pan to get a smoky flavor and grill marks. You can
pump up the flavor of the marinade by adding minced garlic, some
fresh orange juice or a dash of tequila. The salad is even more
succulent with the addition of orange segments.

 &LR; LENTIL &AMP; SQUASH LASAGNA WITH CARAMELIZED ONIONS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   18 sheets lasagna (about 1 pound)
</P>
<P>
   Bechamel Sauce (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   The Vegetables
</P>
<P>
   7 pounds butternut squash
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 onions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   8 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon thyme leaves, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   The Lentils
</P>
<P>
   21/4 cups French green lentils (see note)
</P>
<P>
   2 celery stalks, cut in half
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, peeled and cut in half
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, cut in half
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Instrustions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the vegetables:  &LR; Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line
large baking sheets with foil or parchment. Halve the butternut
squash. Discard seeds. Brush the exposed halves with 2 tablespoons
of the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place the squash halves cut-sides up on the baking sheets. Bake
until the thickest part of the squash is tender when pierced with
the tip of a sharp knife, about 30 minutes. Do not let it get
completely soft. Remove from oven and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   When cool, scoop out the flesh into a bowl. Chunk into small
pieces and season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick
saute pan. Add the sliced onions and cook over medium-high heat,
stirring often, for about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme and
continue to cook until the onions are golden brown and very sweet,
15 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The lentils:  &LR; While the squash is roasting, place the lentils
in a small saucepan with the celery, carrot, onion, bay leaf and
salt. Add enough water to cover the vegetables completely. Bring to
a boil, then simmer until the lentils are completely tender, 15 to
20 minutes. Remove the vegetables and bay leaves, strain out any
liquid and adjust the seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The lasagna:  &LR; Cook the lasagna noodles in a large pot of
boiling salted water until al dente. Drain, then spread out to dry
on a baking sheet so the noodles won't stick to each other.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix together the squash,
lentils, caramelized onion and half of the bechamel sauce. Divide
this mixture into 3 equal parts.
</P>
<P>
   Place one third of the vegetable mixture on the bottom of an
oversized lasagna pan (or use an 8 x 8-inch pan plus a 9 x 13-inch
pan). Sprinkle with 1/3 cup of the Parmesan. Cover with a layer of
lasagna noodles. You may have to trim the noodles to make them fit
in the pan(s).
</P>
<P>
   Repeat the layers two more times. Spread the remaining bechamel
on top of the last pasta layer. Cover the sauce with the remaining
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until heated through and golden brown on top, 20 to 25
minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; French green lentils are available in upscale
supermarkets and specialty stores. Do not substitute any other
lentils, which become mushy when cooked.

<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; BECHAMEL SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   This recipe makes just enough sauce for the Lentil and Squash
Lasagna.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1/2 onion
</P>
<P>
   1 whole clove
</P>
<P>
   6 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   7 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   Pinch nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Salt and white pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the bay leaf on the outside of the onion half, then pierce
it with the clove to attach. Add this piquet and the milk to a
small saucepan. Reduce over medium-low heat for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the milk is reducing, make the roux. Melt the butter in a
heavy-bottomed saute pan over low heat. Slowly incorporate the
flour, stirring constantly. Continue stirring over low heat for 4
to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Strain the milk and discard the
onion pique.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the milk into the roux a little at a time. Bring to a
simmer and cook 15 minutes over very low heat, stirring often. Stir
in the nutmeg and season with salt and white pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Set aside at room temperature.

 &HT;    Networld+Interop conference opens doors
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia World Congress Center is, once again, a
good place for connections.
</P>
<P>
   This week it is home to Networld+Interop, the world's largest
technical conference focused on the burgeoning networking
technology that links the communications systems that carry voice,
video and data.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, various crews were still constructing booths and
exhibits for the approximately 500 companies that will showcase
their products. Also on the bill are a host of educational and
training sessions, as well as some high-profile talks by industry
heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   About 50,000 people are expected to attend _ more than half
coming from within 500 miles of downtown Atlanta, according to
Valerie Williamson, vice president and general manager of
Networld+Interop.
</P>
<P>
   Just who is coming?
</P>
<P>
   Most attendees are information technology professionals, she
said. For them, it does not seem esoteric to talk about virtual
private networks, digital subscriber lines, network intelligence,
remote access or extranets. It is likewise not alphabet soup to
speak of SQL, XML, SLA, IPSEC, ERP or NSP.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 percent of attendees work for corporations of more
than 1,000 employees, and the rest come from small- and
medium-sized businesses, Williamson said. ``That is why Atlanta is
so important. It's a high-tech hotbed of innovative companies using
technology to advance their own businesses overall. More and more,
technology is a strategic part of their operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Among general subjects for discussion this week are network
management, operating systems and security _ where Atlanta-based
Internet Security Systems joins Network Associations, Checkpoint
and others in offering solutions. Their booths are likely to be
crowded, Williamson said. ``When you are transferring your business
to an electronic business, you better make sure the first thing you
have is security.''
</P>
<P>
   The show floor will feature ``start-up city,'' a section of
about 50 new companies with cutting-edge technologies.
</P>
<P>
   As for training and tutorial sessions, the show features seven
different ``tracks'' focusing attention on different aspects of
networking. For instance, you could spend the week immersed in the
issue of transmitting voice using Internet protocol.
</P>
<P>
   One track is co-sponsored by the Metro Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce, said Jennifer McClure, spokeswoman for Ziff-Davis, which
owns the 10-year-old trade show.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show has been here annually for several years, this
is the first such arrangement with the chamber, she said. ``We feel
the Southeast is a growing technology hub and we want to forge
stronger relationships here.''
</P>
<P>
   Networld+Interop will be back in Atlanta next year, she said.
``We have no plans to leave the Georgia World Congress Center.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is the marriage of Interop and Networld, which came
together in 1995. The event is held twice a year in the United
States _ in Atlanta and Las Vegas _ as well as in Canada,
Australia, Singapore, Brazil and France.
</P>
<P>
   Keynoters today are Lucent Technologies Chief Executive Richard
McGinn and Intel Vice President Mark Christensen. On Wednesday,
Nortel Networks President Dave House speaks at 9 a.m., while at 5
p.m., the speaker is Network Associates Chairman and CEO William
Larson.
</P>
<P>
   For $50, a walk-in attendee can traipse through the exhibition
floor, listen to the keynote speakers and catch a few of the other
talks. To catch most of the more high-powered and technical
sessions, however, costs a bit more _ between $595 and $2,700.
</P>
<P>
   The conference runs through 5 p.m. Friday. The exhibition floor
opens today at 10 a.m.

 COOK'S BOOKS: Add a Touch of France to the Table   By Stephen Baker 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  It's a popular notion that Parisians dine on foie
gras and truffles every night, but Michael Roberts sets the record
straight with his new book, ``Parisian Home Cooking: Conversations,
Recipes and Tips From the Cooks and Food Merchants of Paris.''
<P>
   Roberts, who attended the Ecole Superieure de Cuisine
Jean-Ferrandi in France before opening Trumps restaurant in Los
Angeles, has spent long periods of time in Paris and knows it well.
</P>
<P>
   He demystifies French cooking by pointing out that while the
French rely on fresh ingredients they're not necessarily luxurious
ones. French home cooks might spend more time preparing food than
their American counterparts but their typical dishes are generally
fairly easy to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is an excellent storyteller and his descriptions of the
markets, people and cityscapes enliven the 175 recipes. The
anecdotes also point out the central role food plays in French
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' friends and professional colleagues in France
contributed the recipes and the accompanying _ and jealously
guarded _  &LR; astuces &LR; . These tricks of the trade help make the
recipes accessible and also highlight tips and techniques to make
them special.
</P>
<P>
   However, some recipes do require hard-to-find ingredients and
this can be a drawback since Roberts does not suggest alternatives.
Even though the Bay Area is a hotbed of gourmet foodstuffs and
produce, searching for the likes of veal top round and striped bass
fillets can be challenging.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, recipes like Eggs Poached in Tarragon
Cream _ which features a wonderful combination of flavors and
textures _ and Bibb Lettuce with Chicken Livers and Gizzards _
which turned me into a fan of the earthy-tasting innards _ are
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the recipes showcase the French flair with thrifty cuts
of meat, such as chicken livers, and with lesser-used vegetables
like turnips. With Roberts' help, Americans can bring this flair
and other secrets of Parisian home cooking to their own tables.

 &LR; BIBB LETTUCE WITH CHICKEN LIVERS &AMP; GIZZARDS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound chicken gizzards
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup brandy
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound chicken livers
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves or dried
</P>
<P>
   12 peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   3 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   3 whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, peeled
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   16 garlic cloves, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons aged red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon (do not use dried)
</P>
<P>
   2 heads Bibb lettuce, washed, dried and leaves torn
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   One day in advance, rinse the gizzards. Lay them flat on a work
surface, silverskin down. Beginning in the center, remove as much
silverskin as you can easily, cutting each gizzard in half. Place
the gizzards in a small bowl, mix with half the salt and half the
brandy, and place in the refrigerator for 12 to 18 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the livers and trim them of any green or discolored bits.
Place in another bowl with the remaining salt and brandy and place
in the refrigerator for 12 to 18 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, tie up the thyme, peppercorns, bay leaves and
cloves in a square of cheesecloth and place in a heavy 1-quart
casserole. Halve the onion from tip to stem, lay it flat, and slice
it lengthwise. Add the onion to the casserole.
</P>
<P>
   Drain and rinse the gizzards; discard the marinade. Add the
gizzards to the casserole, add enough oil to cover, and place the
casserole, covered, in the oven. Turn the oven on to 325 degrees
and cook for 11/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Drain and rinse the livers; discard the marinade. Add the livers
and garlic to the casserole and cook for an additional 30 minutes.
</P>

 CHRON  
 BAY AREA CLASSICS: Duo Revives Drewes Brothers   Stephen Baker  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Hop on a Muni J car, get off at 29th and Church
streets in the heart of Noe Valley and you'll spot shoppers
meandering in and out of Drewes Brothers Meats.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 110-year-old Drewes, along with Star Bakery across the
street, anchors a lively block-long business district. The
neighborhood is home to majestic St. Paul's Catholic Church,
renowned for the 1991 &UR;  &LR; film, ``Sister Act,'' starring Whoopi
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   But last fall, the community lost Drewes _ temporarily, that is.
</P>
<P>
   On October 15, owners Dave and Teri McCarroll closed the butcher
shop, which had shared space with Stellings, a video and mailbox
rental operation. The counters were cleared, the antique clock was
removed from the wall and the butcher sign was taken out of the
window. Stellings remained open under the proprietorship of Cecila
De Leon.
</P>
<P>
   But the block wasn't the same without Drewes, De Leon says.
Disappointed customers kept coming into Stellings and asking about
Drewes' disappearance. Soon, a sheet of butcher paper appeared on
the front of the building, filled with shoppers' pleas to reopen
the store.
</P>
<P>
   They got their way. Within two weeks, the butcher shop was open
again, run by former employees Isaac and Josh Epple.
</P>
<P>
   The Epples, who had worked at Drewes for years _ Isaac started
as a window-washer at the age of 16 _ wanted to reopen the
business, and building landlord Phil Tomasello gave them the
chance. Drewes was back, with ``Brothers'' added to acknowledge the
new owners' relation and the original Drewes, who were brothers as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The Epples also kept much of what made Drewes popular in the
first place _ the signature stuffed pork chops made with fresh
herbs, onions, garlic and sourdough breadcrumbs, and the house-made
meat loaf mix.
</P>
<P>
   Drewes also continues to carry salads, deli meats and cheeses,
sausages and a good selection of seafood, along with all the
butcher-counter staples &LR;   &LR; and free-range poultry.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers have added rotisserie chicken to their offerings,
and in the future plan to add entire take-out dinners and some
French wines to accompany them.
</P>
<P>
   The Epples feel a sense of place and purpose in bringing Drewes
back to the neighborhood. ``I like the homey atmosphere best . . . &LR; 
 &LR; I know probably 80 percent of the customers that come through the
door,'' Isaac says.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the bustle of daily activity, those customers return
often. As this Noe Valley community can attest, sometimes you don't
know what you've got until it's gone.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Washington Defines `Reserve'  &HT;       
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  California may be the nation's leader in terms of
wineries and wine production, but it lags behind Washington as a
pro-active state in getting some wine-related things done.
<P>
   For years, the wine industry has not been able to come up with a
consensus on the definition of ``reserve'' on a wine label and the
federal government has avoided writing a legal definition. But now,
the Washington Wine Commission, under the newly established
Washington Wine Quality Alliance (WWQA), has provided the nation's
first definition for Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the 2000 vintage, the word Reserve can only appear
on the label of 10 percent of a Washington winery's total
production or on 3,000 cases of the particular variety, whichever
is greater. In addition, any Reserve wine must be made up entirely
of grapes grown in the state of Washington. This move by the WWZA
is pro-consumer because it provides information to help wine-buyers
make informed purchases.
</P>
<P>
   WWQA members have also agreed to phase out the use of generic
wine terms like Bordeaux, Burgundy, Chablis and Champagne, a move
that shows confidence in the quality of local wines without relying
on foreign names to make the sale.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Pinot Chardonnay
</P>
<P>
   The big buzz in wine circles is the discovery by University of
California at Davis grape sleuths that Chardonnay and 15 other
grape varieties are related to an obscure French grape called
Gouais as well as to the prestigious Pinot Noir. DNA fingerprinting
made the discovery possible.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean we can go back to calling America's favorite
white wine Pinot Chardonnay? That was the term many wine people
used for the grape and the wine until Chardonnay started its rise
to stardom in the 1970s. But back then, experts said the Chardonnay
grape wasn't part of the Pinot family. Go figure.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Q: Janne Mahan of Menlo Park wants to know where to purchase
1995 Signorello Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.

   A: Signorello reports the wine is mostly sold out, but
Andronico's may still carry some. Or, call Linda at Signorello,
(707) 255-5990, for more help.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few weeks ago, a reader asked about the availability of
Barbera Blanc, a blush-type wine made from the Barbera grape.
</P>
<P>
   A: Readers have informed Potpourri that a Barbera Blanc called
Imbianco is available for $9.50 at Viansa Winery, 25200 Arnold
Drive in Sonoma and at Viansa's Lo Spuntino tasting room on the
square in Sonoma.

 &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Vintage 1999 has been one to watch closely since little has gone
according to schedule. Until recently, cool temperatures have kept
winemakers and grape growers in the vineyards to check for
ripeness.
</P>
<P>
   The stage that occurs just before a grape is fully ripe is
called veraison. At this stage the grapes are a good size and
weight and growers often use laboratory analysis to determine if
they're about ready to pick.

DEBATE ON INTERNET TAXES TAKES POLITICAL TURN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Politics and business appear headed for a clash when an elite
group of high-technology and government leaders appointed by
Congress to draft sales tax policies for the Internet meets in New
York this week.
</P>
<P>
   At their first meeting this summer, in Williamsburg, Va., most
in the group, the 19-member Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce, seemed to agree that Internet sales should be subject to
the same taxes levied on sales in the physical world. The key
question, they said, was how to devise a more uniform tax rate or a
system that would make it easy for companies, whether big or small,
to collect the taxes levied by more than 30,000 state and local
jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's chairman, Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, a
Republican with an aggressive antitax agenda, says he is not
convinced Internet sales should be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   That view has triggered suspicions among some business members
that their colleagues from the political arena may be inclined to
stifle any solution that could be construed as a new tax levy.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to a high-technology representative on the commission,
who asked not to be identified, said a workable solution was being
circulated that called for businesses to collect sales taxes on
Internet commerce if state and local governments agree to adopt a
single tax rate for each state or commit to new technologies in the
form of free, easy-to-use software to enable companies to calculate
any tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the commission members, plain as day, can see a deal
right in front of them,'' said the aide. ``But the commission staff
is pushing it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore denies trying to stifle debate on any proposal and says
he simply wants to insure that all sides get a fair hearing,
including whether sales taxes even have a place on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some folks who are in the commission and around the
commission who do not believe that this is the issue,'' Gilmore
said. ``They assume already that taxes should apply to the Internet
and electronic commerce, and they do not believe any discussion
ought to be held about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission was created last year as part of federal
legislation imposing a three-year moratorium on any new state or
local taxes on Internet access or sales.
</P>
<P>
   Composed of eight business representatives, eight politicians
from state and local governments and three members of the Clinton
administration, the panel was supposed to begin work in December.
But that was delayed when groups representing state, county and
city governments _ concerned about losing the tax revenues that pay
for many crucial operations _ complained that congressional leaders
had appointed too many business representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Adjustments were made, and those same state and local groups
expressed pleasant surprise when many of the key business members
sided with them at the commission's first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of AT&AMP;T;
Theodore Waitt, chairman and chief executive of Gateway, and David
Pottruck, president of Charles Schwab, voiced support for taxing
Internet commerce as long as a new, simpler and equitable system
could be devised.
</P>
<P>
   Although state and local governments the last four decades have
been unable to agree on a simple way to collect sales taxes from
mail-order companies, some are optimistic that the threat of losing
huge revenue opportunities from taxes on Internet sales might
inspire a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that the present system is a mess and needs to be
addressed through simplicity and uniformity,'' said Neal Osten,
director of the National Conference of State Legislatures' Commerce
and Communications Committee. ``We need to make it easier for
companies to comply.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also contains strong tax opponents, however, like
Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, who has
proposed using the insurgence of the Internet as an opportunity to
get rid of sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the commission can reach a consensus and draft a
comprehensive proposal for Congress by next year, Gilmore says that
at least it can clearly define the issues for Congress. In addition
to sales tax, the group is expected to study international tax
issues on the Internet and taxes on Internet access. He said the
group hoped to have a final report to lawmakers next spring.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Campbell's Is Tops For Minestrone Soup  &HT;        By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  For a quick lunch or dinner, canned soup can be a
lifesaver. The number of soups available take up row after row on
supermarket shelves, which means just about every soup imaginable
can be purchased in a can.
<P>
   Today's panel tasted six canned minestrones, as well as one
minestrone in a jar. We did not include any soups labled low-fat or
nonfat, though many of the soups were naturally low in fat.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the soups were concentrates and required the addition of
water. All were heated according to package directions.
</P>
<P>
   The panel liked a couple of the soups, but found most of them to
be bland and watery.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Campbell's Home Cookin' &LR;  (19 ounces, $1.89-$2.09 at many
supermarkets) took top honors. All panelists commented on the good
texture of the pasta and vegetables. One panelist thought the soup
was too oily, but another described it as a ``nice, clean soup.''
One would buy it, and four might.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's also took second place with  &UR; Campbell's Simply &LR; 
 &UR; Home &LR;  (24 ounces, $2.69 at many supermarkets), which comes in a
jar. Three panelists liked the ratio of vegetables and pasta to
broth, and one described it as ``tasting home cooked.'' But many
found the soup overly spiced with fennel or anise (the label does
not list which herbs and spices are used). One would buy it, two
might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the rest was  &UR; Progresso &LR;  (19 ounces, $1.99-$2.79 at
many supermarkets). Three panelists described it as bland, but most
liked the mixture of vegetables and beans. One panelist thought the
soup had a nice herbal quality, but another thought the herbs
tasted stale. One would buy it, two might buy it, and two would
not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Riviera &LR;  (19 ounces, $1.69 at many supermarkets) came in
fourth. All of the panelists commented that this very thick soup
had little in common with traditional minestrone. Some said it more
closely resembled split pea soup. However, four panelists liked the
flavor even if the texture was too starchy. One would buy it, one
might buy it, and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Pomi, Campbell's regular and Walnut Acres,
but they scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Roland
Passot chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in
Larkspur and Menlo Park; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and
Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are
tasted blind. &QL;

RENT OUT YOUR CHOICE OF SOFTWARE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By TOM STEIN  
c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Desktop software has always been a pain.
</P>
<P>
   For most consumers, loading new software on a personal computer
can be a frustrating, mind-bending experience. And the more
software you install on your PC, the more technical troubles you're
likely to have.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those infinite software upgrades to worry about,
not to mention all the uninstalling and reinstalling you have to do
when when you replace your old machine with a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, these software issues are a real deterrent to PC
use,'' said Jeff Tarter, publisher of Softletter, an industry
newsletter in Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a better way. A few high-tech giants, as well
as a host of small startups, are playing with the idea of renting
software over the Internet. Instead of trudging off to a local
retailer and plunking down $40 or more for the latest software
title, consumers could simply log on to the Internet and access the
software package of their choice _ sometimes for free, sometimes
for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: The software resides on a remote server in
cyberspace and is never loaded onto the individual's computer
desktop. Users would access the software on an as-needed basis and
pay either a per usage fee, a monthly subscription fee or,
sometimes, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Users also can pay to have their files stored remotely or can
transfer the files to their own computer hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, for instance, being able to rent, for a nominal charge,
a tax-preparation application. When you are finished, your tax
return is filed on your hard drive _ or possibly zapped directly to
the IRS _ while the application that created it disappears into the
cyber-clouds.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of renting software over the Internet is new to
the consumer market, it has already taken hold in the business
world. That's because corporations spent much of the past decade
trying to install complex software applications to run their
businesses. Some of these software projects took years to complete
and cost millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   To alleviate the problem, some companies are now renting access
to financial, manufacturing and sales software over the Internet.
As a result, a winemaker, for instance, can focus on growing grapes
instead of worrying about installing and maintaining complicated
software applications.
</P>
<P>
   Companies as varied as Robert Mondavi Winery and Samsung
Semiconductor spent a total of $150 million on software rentals
last year. That figure is expected to grow to $2 billion by 2003,
according to International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors are eager to tap into this market. Oracle Corp., for
one, has set up a separate business unit, called Oracle Business
Online, dedicated to software rental. Other companies in the market
include Corio and USinterworking, which rent out software from the
likes of PeopleSoft and SAP.
</P>
<P>
   And while the action to date has been on the business software
side, some industry experts believe the real potential of the
rental market is on the consumer side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't want to fret with technology in the home,''
said Clare Gillan, an analyst with International Data Corp. ``I
think you will see some big vendors make a play (in the software
rental market) because that is a way to own the consumer and have
control of the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems lent huge credibility to the notion of software
rental late last month when it acquired a company called Star
Office and said it would begin offering word processing and
spreadsheet applications for free over the Internet. The service is
aimed at both consumers and businesses. By giving away the
software, Sun is hoping to increase sales of its computer servers,
which host the software.
</P>
<P>
   Sun also said it would unveil a new Web site later this year
called StarPortal, where consumers can access applications similar
to those in Microsoft Office, the leading ``business productivity''
package.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the threat from Sun, Microsoft said it's working
on its own Web-based office productivity services. At first, these
rental services will take shape around Microsoft's Windows 2000
software and will be targeted at small businesses, not consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts believe it's crucial that Microsoft quickly address
the consumer market. ``The big question is whether Microsoft is
willing to change its revenue model and accept a near-term loss,''
said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that there are 100 million Office customers, who each
pay about $400 for the software in retail outlets. ``If Microsoft
wants to hold on to its market share, it has to provide a
compelling solution in the software rental space that is priced
right.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sun will offer its software for free over the Web, it is
still unclear what consumers can expect to pay for Microsoft
applications under a rental model.
</P>
<P>
   It's also crucial to note that, for several reasons, consumer
software rental is not yet ready for prime time. The first problem
is slow and spotty Internet access. Critics argue that most people
just won't tolerate waiting minute after frustrating minute to
access, say, an Internet-based spreadsheet document to crunch
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the rental concept to work, you have to give consumers
bulletproof applications,'' said Yogen Dalal, a partner at venture
capital firm Mayfield Fund in Menlo Park, Calif. ``If I'm a college
student using a Web-based word-processing application to write my
term paper, I won't be happy if my Internet connection crashes and
I lose all my data.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dalal and others believe software rental is inevitable,
they say it won't be a reality for another three to five years. By
that time, it's expected that most people will have high-speed
access to the Internet and that network connections will be more
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Another critical issue is privacy. How secure will consumers
feel if their private word-processing or financial documents are
stored remotely on an Internet server?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the idea of my personal files sitting on someone
else's server,'' said Rebecca Susser, a 30-year-old San Francisco
resident who has given the issue some thought. ``Also, if I'm on
the road and can't log on to the Internet, does that mean I won't
be able to do my work?''
</P>
<P>
   But Susser sees plenty of upside as well. ``Overall, the whole
rental aspect is very appealing,'' she said. ``I like the fact that
my software will always be automatically updated and that there
would be a plethora of programs I could use.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she is interested in high-end design software but that
she wouldn't use it often enough to justify forking out hundreds of
dollars. ``It would be really cool if could pay (a small fee) for
the software only when I needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, millions of people are accessing software _ albeit
small-scale applications _ over the Internet. Online giants like
Yahoo, American Online and Microsoft, as well as fledging startups
like Visto, offer e-mail and calendaring programs over the Web that
are hugely popular with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers speculate that the next logical step would be
for these companies to increase the number of Internet-based
applications in their portfolios and start charging a subscription
fee. Just as cable television operators offer consumers the choice
of basic, premium and pay-per-view services, a similar model could
be applied to software rental.
</P>
<P>
   Two startups that are clearly forging ahead in this direction
are Desktop.com in San Francisco and Arepa.com in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop.com, which will formally launch its service on September
20, wants to become, quite literally, the desktop of the Internet.
Today, computer users go to a single, centralized spot to access
all their software _ namely the PC desktop. The concept behind
Desktop.com is to give users that same convenience on the Internet,
whether they are trying to access games, finance or personal
productivity software.
</P>
<P>
   The company is building its own Internet-based applications, but
is also encouraging third-party developers to create software for
its platform. Desktop.com chief executive Katie Burke said the
site, at first, will cater to niche applications targeted at a
focused market, such as software that will allow long-distance
runners to log the number of miles they cover each week. The
service will initially be free to users.
</P>
<P>
   Arepa.com, for its part, is targeting the nearly 2 million U.S.
households that already have high-speed, or broadband, access to
the Internet. Subscribers to the service, which is now being tested
in select locations across the country, get instant access to
popular software titles, including educational, gaming and personal
productivity applications.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still experimenting with pricing, but subscribers
can expect to pay a few dollars to rent a particular application
for a day or two, or they can access a unlimited number of software
titles in a particular category for about $10 a month.

ONLINE RADIO TRIES THE ALL-TALK FORMAT 
 E-GAMBLING SOFTWARE GIVES PLAYERS AN EDGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An entrepreneur who made his name in rock radio almost 30 years
ago is now trying his luck at Internet radio.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Meyrowitz, 56, whose DIR Broadcasting in the early 1970s
created the syndicated radio series ``King Biscuit Flower Hour,''
plans to start a radio network on the Internet this week.
Recognizing that, so far, so-called streaming, or continuous, audio
is not always of the highest fidelity on the Net, Meyrowitz plans
an all-talk network, which he calls Eyada.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Herman, who was host of the morning show on the New York
rock station WNEW-FM for 26 years, is Eyada.com's program director.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Eyada.com will offer one channel of programming about
the entertainment industry, with 15 hours of programming each
weekday and four hours each on Saturday and Sunday evenings. The
lineup of hosts for the entertainment channel, which begins
officially transmitting on Wednesday, includes Lionel, host of
Court TV's ``Snap Judgment''; Richard Johnson, editor of Page Six,
the gossip page of the New York Post; George Rush and Joanna
Molloy, the New York Daily News husband-and-wife gossip columnists;
and Bob Berkowitz, the former host of Real Personal, a discontinued
sex advice program on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Eyada.com plans to introduce an all-talk channel for
sports, and it expects to add channels on teen-agers, women and
business by the end of 2000, Meyrowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyrowitz, who said he had raised just under $10 million from
private investors for the start-up, hopes to reach 20,000 listeners
a day, ranging in age from 20 to 40. The network intends to sell
both banner ads and audio commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Allen, a senior analyst for Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., criticized Eyada.com's planned programming, which
she said ``is not uniquely suited to the new medium.''
</P>
<P>
   She also predicted listeners would ignore the advertising. ``If
there's one thing that's clear, it's that Internet users do not
like ads and avoid them,'' Ms. Allen said. ``There's no reason to
think they'll listen to radio ads online.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Mooradian, a senior analyst for Jupiter Communications
in New York, said that if the network could establish its brand, it
might be able to create a niche for itself before the likes of Don
Imus and Howard Stern hit cyberspace. ``They're not online yet, but
I promise you they will be in a year,'' Mooradian said.

   E-GAMBLING SOFTWARE GIVES PLAYERS AN EDGE
</P>
<P>
   In the world of Internet gambling, participants routinely risk
large amounts of cash with Web site operators of uncertain scruples
who may run afoul of local anti-gambling laws. Now, Reliable
Software Technologies of Dulles, Va., has identified a new peril
associated with gambling online: badly engineered software.
</P>
<P>
   The company has found a flaw in one implementation of a game
known as Texas Hold 'em Poker that could enable a player to quickly
determine the exact ordering of every card in a shuffled deck while
a game was in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given this information, even the weakest of poker players
should know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em,'' Gary McGraw,
vice president for corporate technology, wrote to a security
mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   The distributors of the affected version of Texas Hold 'em Poker
_ ASF Software Inc. in Duluth, Ga. _ quickly corrected the flaw
when it was brought to their attention, but McGraw said similar
problems might still exist in this and other types of Internet
gambling software. At least three online casinos, planetpoker.com,
purepoker.com and deltacasino.com, appear to be using the
vulnerable version of the software, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ASF vulnerability lies in a faulty implementation of what is
known as a random- number generator to produce a shuffled deck of
cards before each round of play. The order of each shuffled deck is
completely determined by one number, known as the seed. In this
case, the program chose a seed based on the time, measured in
milliseconds since midnight. By synchronizing their program with
the system clock on the server generating the seed, McGraw and his
associates were able to narrow the number of possible decks to
about 200,000 possibilities. Then, given the cards dealt and the
community cards in the center, they could quickly compute which
deck was being used.
</P>
<P>
   This type of vulnerability has been well-known to security
experts ever since a similar problem was identified three years ago
in Netscape's implementation of Secure Socket Layer, a program that
enables secure connections with e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We published an exhortation on this back in 1996, so it's sad
_ but not entirely surprising _ to see more people falling prey to
this trap,'' said David Wagner, a computer security researcher at
the University of California at Berkeley who, along with his
colleague Ian Goldberg, identified the Netscape bug.
</P>
<P>
   Gamblers will spend an estimated $1.2 billion online this year,
according to Christiansen Capital Advisors, a research firm based
in New York.

BRIDGING TWO WORLDS TO MAKE DOWNLOADABLE MUSIC PROFITABLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An Internet startup company plans to introduce a
new Web site on Monday that is designed to bridge the competing
worlds of online digital music and the traditional recording
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Garageband.com will focus on the thousands of small and
struggling musicians and groups in the United States. Many have
found it impossible to sign with a major recording studio but have
also discovered that they cannot make a profit by giving their
music away over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Tom Zito and Amanda
Lathroum, with Jerry Harrison, a music producer who was a member of
the rock group Talking Heads, the San Francisco-based company says
it hopes to entice undiscovered musical groups with the promise of
recording contracts and distribution agreements.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it plans the use digital audience polling as a
way to improve the company's odds for releasing commercially
successful CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Garageband.com is taking a new approach to the Internet MP3
phenomenon, which has frightened the nation's $13.5 billion
recording industry with the specter of mass distribution of pirated
music over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is an Internet standard for the digital distribution of
music, and in the last two years it has spawned an explosion of Web
sites, including MP3.com, Shoutcast.com and Broadcast.com, offering
Web surfers access to music via their personal computers. But these
sites do not offer pirated copies of commercial recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they aggregate the works of musicians who produce their
own recordings and offer their music for free to anyone who cares
to download the MP3 files. And while some musicians use the sites
to promote their CDs, the vast majority do not have contracts with
record labels.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the interest and controversy the MP3 standard has
created, it has yet to generate a viable business model for
sustaining small and innovative musical groups, said Zito,
Garageband.com's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MP3 advocates say record companies are toast,'' Zito said.
``We believe record companies know a tremendous amount about
marketing and promotion and getting music into the hands of
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he argued, the value of all music downloaded over the
Internet last year was less than $1 million, suggesting that a
viable Internet music economy is a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the exact shape of such an economy is still being
determined as the recording industry and consumer electronics
manufacturers struggle to agree on a format that will protect
copyrighted music without alienating consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet offers recording artists the ability to reach
fans directly in a way that has never been possible,'' said Roger
McNamee, a managing director of Integral Capital Partners in Menlo
Park, Calif. ``Garageband has an interesting spin if they can
figure out a way to scale it without becoming just like the record
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the new company was formed last year when Zito
visited Harrison's home and saw a large pile of demo recordings
sitting on his floor. They had been sent by aspiring music groups
hoping that he would help them produce a CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me, `Is there anything good there?' Harrison
recalled. ``I responded, `How would I ever know? I will never have
time to listen to even a fraction of them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zito approached Ms. Lathroum, who was then an executive and
market researcher at the Netscape Communications Corp., and asked
if it would be possible to use the Internet to create an effective
audience rating system for music.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting Web service will permit musicians to upload
recordings that will be rated by music enthusiasts on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By next year, Garageband.com plans to begin awarding a recording
contract for the most popular music each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that this is an Internet version of Dick Clark's
``American Bandstand,'' but I'm pretty sure few people on the Net
are old enough to remember American Bandstand,'' Zito said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Garageband.com is hoping to attract listeners who are willing to
sample unknown recording artists by offering prizes like backstage
passes to concerts and visits to recording studios.
</P>
<P>
   But the emphasis will be on the people who make the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating an online community by musicians for
musicians,'' said Zito. ``Obviously, we believe the fans will come
where the musicians are, because that's where they'll hear the best
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only about 600 of the 30,000 CDs published each year
are profitable, Zito said. The promise of Garageband, he said is
that by employing sound statistical techniques he hopes to get a
reliable indicator of which recordings will be popular _ and
profitable.

GO AHEAD, QUIT. SEE IF i CARE. 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: America Online continues to bill me after I
canceled my account. Calling them doesn't do any good. My wife
finally got through to them, but they refused to do anything
because she was not the one who subscribed. I called and spent my
entire lunch period waiting for a pick-up. When that failed, I got
on their Web site and sent an e-mail. No answer. What do I have to
do to get my money back? Why doesn't some government stop this
fraud?
</P>
<P>
   _ American Offline
</P>
<P>
   DEAR AMERICAN: And which government would you suggest? China?
Albania? The Duchy of Grand Fenwick? Or how about my personal
favorite, Iraq? At least Saddam wouldn't be too much of a wimp to
use weapons of mass destruction to get your crummy 20 bucks back.
</P>
<P>
   Light an aromatherapy candle and relax, Ace. What we've got here
barely adds up to incompetence, much less fraud. Sure, AOL doesn't
make it easy to quit, but it CAN be done. I was able to quit once
just by leaving voice mail. But they pulled me back in ...
</P>
<P>
   From what you've told me, I'd say you're still a subscriber in
good standing because you never got the opportunity to quit.
Couldn't break through to a support operator after only an hour?
Poor baby. AOL's got about 17 gazillion subscribers and only a
comparative handful of operators to handle the load. And your wife
can't do your waiting for you. How does AOL know she's really your
wife? And e-mail? Forget it unless you have a receipt saying it got
there. Otherwise, you may as well have sent it to Barney the
dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Find yourself a comfortable chair and a good book, put on one of
those CDs with ocean sounds, then wait on infinity hold until you
get through to a real, live human being. Life's too short to waste
every day cheesed off at AOL. Uh, oh. What I really meant to say
was, ``That's the only way you're going to be able to deal with
those pinheads.''
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I recently reinstalled Windows 95. Now I find
that the color palette no longer supports 256 colors, which it did
prior to reinstalling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Colorblind
</P>
<P>
   DEAR COLORBLIND: Windows tries its best to identify all your
hardware when it installs itself, but here's a case where it
couldn't figure out what video card you have in your machine.
Instead of a specific video driver, it installed a generic piece of
crud that works, but just barely.
</P>
<P>
   Determine the make and model of your video card, then go to the
manufacturer's Web site for the right driver. If you've got one of
those goofy video cards that's built into the motherboard, go to
the computer maker's site and keep your fingers crossed. Sometimes
they have the individual drivers, but many times they make you
reinstall their complete software setup whether you want to or not.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: You do good work! Too bad the paper won't give
you more space!
</P>
<P>
   _ Another Fan
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ANOTHER: Oh, but they do! It's just that what you see is
all that's left over after the editors take their weed-whackers to
things. You guys would have loved the column about sending
anonymous e-mail to Sandra Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   (That last answer in no way implicates Dr. Bombay in any plot,
scheme or ruse to convince the talented Miss Bullock to give up her
career for him. Her attorneys may reach him at

KEY BLACKS GATHER AT WHITE HOUSE IN BID TO NARROW 'DIGITAL DIVIDE'
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to enhance the online skills of
African-Americans, a small but growing vanguard of black
information technology professionals has been exchanging e-mail and
visiting each other's Web sites. This week, they met directly for
the first time to launch a renewed effort to bridge the ``digital
divide'' that curbs minority access to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the White House to bring everybody together,'' said
Jena Roscoe, associate director of the president's office of public
liaison, who organized the two days of intensive briefings for the
African-American Internet community, which ended Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 participants from across the nation attended the unique
event, held in the ornate Indian Treaty Room on the fourth floor of
the Old Executive Office Building, where President Dwight
Eisenhower once held his news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The participants heard from a wide array of top White House
aides responsible for race initiatives, science,
telecommunications, and technology policy; electronic commerce,
economic development and minority community empowerment. Also
present were key figures from the departments of Commerce,
Education and Transportation, as well as the Federal Communications
Commission, the Small Business Administration and Minority Business
Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the briefings were closed to the press, the White House
allowed a Cox Newspapers reporter to sit in on some of the
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speakers were great,'' said Dionne Muhammed, whose
Atlanta-based site, www.AshantiTech.com, is ``dedicated to
increasing technology awareness in the black community'' and which
offers, among other services, free e-mail ``with an Afrocentric
flair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she added, ``the speakers weren't really necessary.
What happened here is that we finally put the faces together with
the Web sites. We were able to add the all-important human touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Derrick Brown of Marietta, Ga., executive director of
KnowledgeBase, a non-profit unit with a broad mission to foster
online training among minority students:
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience here has convinced me that ... our initial
investment must be to foster a stronger sense of community and
collaboration among the leaders of this movement. That is, we must
all see the same end, and channel our collective efforts towards
that end.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown also noted that further investments must focus on creating
technology centers in churches, schools and community centers as
well as opening access to capital markets. Subsequent investments
also must be made to continue developing compelling content
targeted at minority groups, ``produced by companies that we
collaborate to build,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will allow our (minority) leadership to build the
capacity necessary to make significant impact. We must teach each
other the leadership and entrepreneurial skills necessary to gain
access to these markets,'' Brown concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the closing reception, where the networking
efforts continued, the visitors, each of whom paid his or her own
way here, heard from Courtland Cox, director of the Minority
Business Development Agency, an arm of the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's big corporations are finally coming to understand
that they have to set up marketing strategies to deal with minority
groups,'' Cox said. ``There are now some 2 million minority-owned
businesses in this country and more of them need to get on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Cox previewed for the group a new U.S. Census Bureau analysis
due to be released Sept. 22. It shows, he said, ``that over the
next 50 years the U.S. population will grow by some 120 million and
that 90 percent of that growth will be minority.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2050, Cox said, 47.2 percent of all Americans will belong to
minority groups. The four states that will account by then for a
quarter of the overall population _ California, Texas, New York and
Illinois _ ``will all be majority minority,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of those projections, limited minority usage of the
Internet has created a ``digital divide'' between those who have
access to online services and other new technologies, and those who
do not.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department survey released last July revealed that
only about one in four black and Hispanic households owns a
computer with Internet access, compared with half or more of Asian
and non-Hispanic white households. That study also showed that
Asians are ahead of all other groups, including non-Hispanic
whites. Overall, the poorest and least educated Americans, as well
as single parents, have the biggest problem keeping up.

WEB VENTURE PUTS CLASS NOTES FROM COLLEGE LECTURE COURSES ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Students at Ohio State, Boston and Michigan State Universities,
take heart: you may never have to take notes in a lecture again,
nor will your counterparts on 59 other large campuses across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   An upstart Internet venture called StudentU.com is hiring
students this semester at 62 universities and paying them to take
notes in as many as 50 core courses per campus. The note takers
post their jottings, within 24 hours, on a central Web site. Among
the dozens of notes already listed are those taken Tuesday during
John Syer's course on world politics at California State University
in Sacramento and on Aug. 24th during Robert G. Schwebach's lecture
on financial markets at Colorado State University.
</P>
<P>
   The service, which first went online Wednesday, is free. And the
stenographers, most of them hired through their fraternities and
enrolled in the courses, are paid $300 a semester to open their
notebooks to the world.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of the site, Oran Wolf, a 27-year-old graduate of
the University of Texas at Austin, who hopes to earn a profit
partly through advertising, said he started the service to help
students augment their own notes or to help them catch up after a
sick day. But he conceded that his offerings could be abused by
those with less legitimate excuses, like chronic oversleeping or
lingering hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't believe students should skip class,'' Wolf
said Wednesday from his Houston office, as he admitted that he, on
occasion, had done just that. ``It is important for them to attend
the class, use this information as supplements to the course and if
they do that, they are going to make A's.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of critics who believe that the arrival of
Wolf's venture _ along with other Web sites that sell sample term
papers and synopses of great books _ signals nothing less than the
erosion of liberal education, if not civilization.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Edmundson, a professor of English at the University of
Virginia, one of the schools where Wolf has set up shop, believes
that the problem lies more with universities _ and their reliance,
often for financial reasons, on 300-student lecture courses _ than
on those trying to beat the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something sleazy about students taking notes and
selling them on the Web,'' Edmundson said. ``But if you can buy the
notes and satisfy the course requirements, maybe the course should
have been distributed as a book, rather than having this charade of
somebody standing up and going through a lecture that, for all
purposes, doesn't change from year to year, and doesn't allow
students the possibility of discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Wood, a professor of anthropology and the associate
provost at Boston University, which is also on Wolf's list, said
the university might consider taking legal action once notes from
the school appear on the site _ which, as of Wednesday, they had
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am troubled by it because I, like thousands of faculty
members, spent a great deal of time developing my courses within a
specific intellectual context, a context that I control,'' he said.
``For someone who is not educated in my field to offer what could
be erroneous versions of that material, without my permission,
strikes me as something which could potentially be illegal. It's
certainly offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said the seeds of his idea were first sown while he was
studying economics at Austin, when he had occasionally taken
advantage of a similar service there: for $30 per class, a private
note-taking firm would arrange for him to get paper copies of any
notes that he might have missed.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1995 and moving to Houston, he learned that
the university there had no such service, and so he founded his
own. Initially taking 10 hours of notes a day himself, he quickly
expanded his operation to include about 3,000 subscribers _ they,
too, paid $30 for each of 120 classes _ and about 40 note-takers.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said professors at the University of Houston were initially
wary of helping him and his note-takers gain access to classes, if
they were not enrolled. But he said he won them over when they
realized that attendance did not drop as a result.
</P>
<P>
   When Wolf discovered that such services were rare on other
campuses, he said he decided to take his operation national. With
an investment from Net Strategy, a Houston company that has
nurtured other Web companies, and a rolling banner of
advertisements that includes the Capital One Visa Platinum Card,
Wolf began recruiting note-takers at fraternities at 62 of the
country's largest colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not necessarily looking to hire top students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of your best note-takers aren't straight A students,'' he
said. ``They might have a kind of learning disability, a test
anxiety, where they don't do well on tests. But they might take 15
pages of notes on a given lecture. What I look for is a dedicated
student who attends class religiously.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among those who were tantalized by his offer to pay $300 per
semester, plus $200 for every five note-takers recruited, was Anje
Castro, 22, a senior at California State University-Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that it was a really, really easy way to make
money,'' said Ms. Castro, whose major is international business.
``I have to go to class anyway. It's a good incentive to take
better notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Castro was hired to provide notes on Professor Wendell
McCulloch's international law class, which she was already taking.
So far, her correspondence has been brief, given that the class has
met just once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already have homework,'' she wrote, on Aug. 31.
``Bummer....Just read in the book pages 1,2,5,6,10-12, 17, and
26-28. All are in chapter 1: Introduction to International and
Comparative Law.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Because he has assembled his operation so quickly, using
students already in courses, Wolf said he would not be asking
professors for permission to broadcast their notes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many are likely to be as surprised as Syer at Sacramento,
who learned from a reporter Wednesday that his introduction to the
world's 10 largest countries had been reproduced by an anonymous
note-taker for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not unalterably opposed to this dissemination,'' he said.
``I'd just like to know how wide my audience is. I'm going to get
up there and take on the policies of the U.S. government, the
policies of the Indonesian government, the policies of the Chinese
government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think this is something that is going to be quoted
globally,'' he said, ``it may change what I say''

 By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To judge by Red Hat Software Inc.'s red-hot stock price and
press clippings, one might conclude that software gigagiant
Microsoft Corp. is in for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat is the little North Carolina company that has run up a
$5.6 billion market capitalization by peddling a version of Linux,
the increasingly popular low-cost computer operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But mention Red Hat and Linux to Aubrey Edwards, group product
manager for Microsoft's forthcoming Windows NT upgrade Windows
2000, and he seems almost on the verge of stifling a yawn. ``When
you look at the hype versus the reality today,'' says Edwards,
``there is a big disconnect.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he is whistling in the dark. But then, Microsoft has been
here before.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Java? That was the radical new technology of four years
ago, an upstart product that threatened to smash Windows once and
for all.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the labs of Sun Microsystems Inc. and intended at first
to run cable TV controller boxes, Java wasn't an operating system
like Windows or Linux. Instead it was a much broader system that
challenged some of the most basic principles of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, computer software is very closely linked to the
hardware running it. The Windows operating system is specifically
designed to work with computers that contain Intel Corp.
processors. Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh machines use the
PowerPC chip, a different type of processor made by Motorola and
IBM. Windows software can't work with a PowerPC chip, and Mac
software won't talk to an Intel Pentium.
</P>
<P>
   Java attempts to get around all this by creating a ``virtual
machine,'' a piece of software that can run on all kinds of
different computers, from palm-sized data organizers to room-sized
mainframes.
</P>
<P>
   Java programs run in the virtual machine, and so in theory,
never again would programmers have to write different versions of
the same program for every different type of computer. ``Write
once, run everywhere,'' was the battle cry of Java advocates; Sun
even copyrighted the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, companies that had been battered by competition from
Microsoft embraced Java as a way to get back into the game. Corel
Computer Corp. said it would rewrite its WordPerfect office
software suite entirely in Java, so it would run on any computer.
Lotus Development Corp. announced eSuite, a set of lightweight
office software programs in Java, for use on corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   And even Microsoft in late 1995 agreed to license the Java
technology from Sun.
</P>
<P>
   (That license agreement spawned a bitter and still-pending
lawsuit between the two companies, with Sun claiming Microsoft is
trying to make unauthorized modifications to Java.)
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate dream for many computer users was software that
would render Windows irrelevant and shrink the power of Microsoft
forever.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't worked out that way. Corel killed its Java office
suite, and while Lotus officials refuse to provide confirmation,
several computer-industry publications have reported that eSuite is
also getting the ax.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's difficult to find any major Java programs on
business or home desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, says Sun's vice president of software marketing,
George Paolini. ``It hasn't happened because it hasn't needed to
happen,'' he says. ``There's no reason to rewrite an entire office
suite in Java.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially not when it turned out that Java programs
consistently ran much slower than programs written in the
traditional way. Java also had built-in limitations that made the
programs safer to run on corporate networks, but also less useful.
For example, Java was originally designed to prevent users from
saving files to a computer's hard drive _ a good security
precaution, but worse than useless for word processing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Java was touted as a key tool in another heavily hyped
movement toward ``network computers.'' Instead of keeping software
on each machine, people would use small, cheap computers that would
get all their software from a central server. Java is well-suited
to this approach.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad nobody wanted to buy network computers. Their
unpopularity was yet another blow to the Java movement. ``I think
that this network computing idea will be a major success, but it
may be years before it becomes a major success,'' says Rick Ross,
president of the Java Lobby, an organization of Java programmers.
``A lot of companies will go bankrupt waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Java is far from dead.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, there are still thousands of software
developers cobbling together Java programs, but for purposes quite
different than the overthrow of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Programs such as WordPerfect and other word processors are
called ``client'' applications, and are run by ordinary users. Java
hasn't caught on in that arena. But it turns out Java is a good way
to write programs that run on servers, the powerful machines that
work behind the scenes, running corporate networks and the
Internet. Server-based Java programs make it easy to exchange data
among many types of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Novera Software Inc. in Burlington, Mass. is one of many firms
that make Java software tools to help companies link up their
networked databases. ``It's an excellent language in which to work
to integrate disparate back-office applications,'' says Novera
cofounder Tim Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly there's no need to mourn for Java's fate. But its
success as a sort of welding tool for computer networks is a long
way from the early visions of Java partisans.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Microsoft executives and they'll tell you that a similar
fate awaits Linux. Charles Fitzgerald, director of business
development in Microsoft's software development unit, says the
Linux hype has already peaked. ``Cold hard reality is coming to
bear,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald points to recent benchmark tests by the research firm
Mindcraft Inc., which found Windows NT performs a variety of tasks
faster than Linux. And he says Linux is notoriously complex and
hard to use, making it a poor choice for any but the most
sophisticated users. And Microsoft's Edwards says that Linux lacks
many advanced capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are categories where Linux is a strong
competitor,'' Fitzgerald admits. For example, he says it makes a
good server for delivering World Wide Web pages. But Fitgerald says
Linux still isn't ready for the heavy-duty tasks that Windows 2000
is designed to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Troan, director of engineering at Red Hat, freely admits
that the buzz over Linux has gotten a bit too loud as the price of
his company's shares has been bid up from 14 on the first day of
trading last month to 84 1/8 at the end of last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Troan says Linux has already avoided one of Java's biggest
mistakes. The first releases of Java were crude and buggy. ``People
set it up as though the first release of immature technology was
going to go out and take over the world,'' Troan says. Linux, on
the other hand, came to public attention after years of buffing and
bug-fixing. Linux was running successfully on thousands of
computers long before the media hype began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably an adolescent now, instead of a toddler,''
Troan says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Java experience suggests that it's too early to say
what Linux will do when it grows up.

BEST SITES FOR STOCK RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID EINSTEIN   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is there a Web site I can go to when researching a stock that
consolidates all recent news articles, analyst remarks, etc.? I'm
tired of going through the incredibly time-consuming task of
looking at all the individual sites such as Charles Schwab and
TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   A: A number of sites offer free basic information about public
companies, such as news, stock price and financial performance and
earnings estimates. Among the best I've found are Marketguide
(www.marketguide.com) and MSN's Money Central Investor
(www.investor.com). However, if you want research from analysts,
you're going to have to pay for it _ anywhere from $10 to $75 for a
report on a specific company. The leading site for that kind of
stuff is Multex.com (www.multex.com). They offer a free trial, so
you can check the service out before signing up.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching Porn
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am receiving four to six porn offers per day in my AOL
e-mail. Being a 60-year-old grandmother, I have no interest in
these offers. But I can't seem to figure out how to get off the
lists. I tried using AOL member services but can find no option for
stopping unwanted mail. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Join the crowd. Millions of America Online users _ including
me _ get porn pitches every day, along with lots of other
unsolicited offers for things like get-rich-quick schemes.
Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about it because AOL is
powerless to prevent spam. (That's Internetese for junk mail.) You
can use AOL's Mail Controls (keyword: mail controls) to block
messages from specific addresses or domains. But spammers get
around this by continually changing their addresses. And on top of
that, new spammers are appearing every day. If you feel like
registering a complaint, you can do so online (keyword: notify
AOL). Perhaps if enough people protest, AOL will get the message
and do something.
</P>
<P>
   Bookshelf Pirate
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I bought my new computer a few months ago, it didn't
come with Microsoft Office 97. Rather than buy the software, I
borrowed a CD from a friend and installed it. The problem is that I
want to use Bookshelf Basics but it's on one of the Office discs
that I didn't install. I don't want to borrow the software again.
So the question is, where can I find the Bookshelf software?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because you're a software thief, I probably shouldn't even be
answering your question. But I'll tell you what _ I'll help you out
if you promise not to install software from any more borrowed CDs.
The latest version of Bookshelf, called Bookshelf 2000, is
available as a stand-alone program that you can get for as little
as $15 after rebate. It includes a dictionary, a thesaurus, a book
of quotations, an almanac, an atlas and some other stuff. Once you
get it, use the dictionary to look up the word ``pirate'' and
you'll see a picture of yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Courtesy Copy
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a large organization of people to whom I wish to send
the same e-mail message (meeting schedules and time) several times
each month. Is there a way to do this so that people getting the
messages won't see the names of other recipients?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. Create a group in your e-mail address book for all the
people on your list. Then instead of sending messages to the group
using the To: box in your e-mail window, enter the name of the
group into the space for the BCC (blind courtesy copy) option. That
way, each recipient will see who sent the message but won't know
who else got it.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you gone to the Web site of your favorite
search engine? Hundreds? Thousands? Here's a way to streamline the
process so that you can invoke the search engine directly from
Internet Explorer 5. Click the Search icon on IE 5's toolbar, then
click Customize at the top of the Search window that appears on the
left side of the screen. In the Customize Search Settings dialog
box that appears, click the button labeled Autosearch settings.
Then use the drop-down list to choose a search provider for address
bar searches. Once you've done that, you can use the search engine
simply by typing your query into the IE 5 Address space and hitting
the Enter key. Very cool.

COOKIES POSE A NEW THREAT TO PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two quarters you handed over for this paper won't cover my
salary. It's the advertisements that really pay the freight at a
newspaper. So I'm sympathetic to Internet companies looking for new
ways to earn ad revenues for their Web sites. Still, one must draw
a line somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite technology news Web sites is marred by a
series of wretched ads for some benighted electronics firm. The ads
feature dismal-looking women displayed in what are supposed to be
come-hither poses.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of wincing at the sight of them, I downloaded free
software (Windows and Unix only) to solve the problem. Internet
Junkbuster (www.junkbuster.com) can filter out many on-line
annoyances. It's not as simple to use as commercial filtering
products like SurfWatch or Cyber Patrol, but the price was
unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   Having installed the Junkbuster, it was easy to block unwanted
ads. By clicking on one of them with the right-side mouse button,
and then clicking on the word ``properties,'' I got the Web address
of the ads. By typing this into Junkbuster, I ensured that the
nasty images would trouble me no more. All I see is a blank space
where the grimy photos used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Other ads on the page are not affected. But after chatting with
Jason Catlett, creator of Internet Junkbuster, I began wondering if
I should block many more ads. It's not the photos that trouble me _
it's the cookies.
</P>
<P>
   You remember cookies _ the little bits of data left on your hard
drive by some of the Web sites you visit. Cookies enable you to log
on to many sites only once. Next visit, the site finds the cookie
on your hard drive and logs you in. Cookies make Web surfing
simpler, but Catlett sees them as a threat to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   I generally scoff at such paranoia. Cookies can only be read by
the company that gave them to you, and they only contain personal
data if you provide it. For instance, Yahoo's cookie identifies me
because I willingly gave the information to Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   But Catlett warned me that it's not that simple any more.
Consider firms like DoubleClick Inc. and 24/7 Media Inc. These are
firms that display many of the ads you see on popular Web sites.
These sites put cookies on your computer whenever they flash an ad
on your screen. These cookies are checked whenever you visit
another site with a DoubleClick or 24/7 ad. The ad company now
knows which sites you've visited and which ads you've seen. That
helps them decide which ad to show you the next time you visit a
site.
</P>
<P>
   This is old news. And in its original form, it posed no threat
to privacy, because the advertiser's cookies identified you as a
number. DoubleClick or 24/7 didn't know your name, address, phone
number, or e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   But soon they will. Ever buy a product and register it over the
Internet? Then there's a good chance your name and address are on
file with 24/7. The firm has an arrangement with Intelliquest
Information Group Inc., the company that handles most on-line
registrations. Intelliquest puts a cookie on your computer when you
register your latest purchase. Then the company shares the cookie
and your personal data with 24/7. Starting early next year,
whenever you visit a Web site with a 24/7 ad, the company will know
you're there. Visit enough 24/7 sites, and the firm can compile a
dossier on your comings and goings. DoubleClick plans to introduce
a similar feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gives us the ability to profile groups of people,''
says 24/7 chief executive David Moore, ``so we're showing diaper
ads to women and, say, football ads to men.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore says consumers must grant permission for his firm to
create a profile. He said users can contact 24/7 and have their
names removed from the database. Moore said 24/7 will not sell data
to other firms. Besides, he added, ``the folks who have really
strong feelings about privacy are few and far between.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm one of them. Maybe 24/7 will behave itself, but we have only
its word for it. European nations have data privacy laws. But in
America, firms can pretty much do as they like.
</P>
<P>
   Firms like 24/7 and DoubleClick think they can make millions
from consumers' personal data. Well, they'll get no help from me.
I've contacted both companies and opted out of their databases. If
I were really paranoid, I'd use Internet Junkbuster to block all
ads sent from the two companies. But I won't. After all, these guys
have to make a living too.

ANOTHER SALVO FROM SUN AGAINST MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)``We are going to cut off their air supply. Everything
they are selling, we're going to give away for free.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   That's what Microsoft Corp. vice president Paul Maritz was
allegedly telling computer industry executives in 1996 _ comments
that were allegedly made with reference to Microsoft's then-rival
Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But these back-room comments could have been made very easily
last month by Sun Microsystems chairman and chief executive Scott
McNeally with reference to Microsoft itself.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sun announced it was purchasing Star Division, a
California software publisher, and that it was going to take Star's
flagship product, Star Office, and give it away for free over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Sun said it was making this move to further
stimulate the growth of the Internet. Sun's stated theory was that
if more high-quality software is available on line, more people
will use the Internet, which in turn will force more service
providers to upgrade their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Since an overwhelming number of Internet servers are made by
Sun, more servers translates into increased profits for the Silicon
Valley hardware manufacturer. ``It's all part of our vision of open
network computing,'' said McNeally.
</P>
<P>
   But this reasoning is disingenuous at best. What we're really
seeing is yet another salvo in the very personal, decade-long
battle between McNeally and Gates. And unlike the Java war, this
salvo could really strike home.
</P>
<P>
   Where Microsoft gets 40 percent of its revenue from sales of
Microsoft Office, Sun makes nothing from the sale of desktop
application programs, and very little from the sale of software.
Giving away Star Office won't hurt Sun's current sales very much.
But it could ultimately slaughter Microsoft's cash cow.
</P>
<P>
   Program-for-program, Star Office is similar to the Professional
Edition of Microsoft's Office 2000, which has a street price of
$480. Star Office comes with a word processor similar to Word, a
spreadsheet similar to Excel, a presentation program similar to
PowerPoint, a data base program, a calendar, an e-mail program, and
a Web browser. None of these programs are as good as their
Microsoft counterparts, but most are good enough for the typical
Office user.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Star Writer, which is largely a clone of Microsoft's
Word 95 word processor. Star Writer can open standard Microsoft
Word files, edit them, and save them out. It will handle Word's
paragraph styles, numbered paragraphs, bulleted lists, and many
other formats. You can create tables, set bookmarks, and create
footnotes. Beginner users will be hard-pressed to find significant
differences.
</P>
<P>
   But intermediate and advanced word processor users will soon
find big differences between Word and Writer. That's because there
are literally thousands of little variations that aren't
immediately obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Undo. There is an Undo button that you can click in the
Microsoft Word spell-checker, allowing you to recover from
inadvertently changing one word to another or accidentally adding
an incorrectly spelled word to your spelling dictionary. Word's
normal Undo facility also can take you more than an hour back in
time. Writer doesn't have an Undo in its spell-checker, and its
normal Undo facility goes back just 25 steps.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a whole lot of annoying little bugs in Star
Writer. For example, if you create a new document and type two
hyphens in a row, Writer replaces them with a backslash!
</P>
<P>
   Other points of criticism include Star's documentation, which is
minimal, and the program's speed, which is sluggish at times.
</P>
<P>
   Star's drawing programs are serviceable, but they can't hold a
candle to Adobe's PhotoShop and Illustrator.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Internet programs, I would recommend avoiding both
the e-mail system and the browser. The e-mail program is awkward,
and the browser won't display many sites properly, especially those
that use frames.
</P>
<P>
   Star Office is an attack against Microsoft in another way as
well. The program alters many Windows default settings, patching
out Microsoft's programs and substituting Sun's. Among these sneak
attacks:
</P>
<P>
   --Download StarOffice 5.1, and you'll also download a copy of
Sun's Java runtime environment as well. StarOffice claims that it
requires Java to enable all of its features, although I can find no
proof to support this claim.
</P>
<P>
   --When you install Star, it becomes your default Web browser and
e-mail client, even if you tell the program that you are using
Internet Explorer and Outlook Express. To get to your old browser
you'll have to call it up manually.
</P>
<P>
   --Finally, when you run StarOffice, the program takes over your
computer's screen, going so far as substituting Microsoft's Start
button with its own. You can turn off this feature by unchecking
the menu item ``Integrated Desktop''.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Windows, Sun is also making Star Office freely available
for the free Linux operating system, as well as for Sun's Solaris.
This will undoubtedly be another huge boost for Linux, where the
lack of Microsoft-compatible productivity apps has been a major
stumbling block. Sun's reasoning seems to be that whatever helps
Linux hurts Windows.

as well.

REFORM PARTY GAIN WOULD BE GOP GAIN, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All these Republicans who are in a dither because Pat Buchanan
is talking about leaving their party need to get a grip. Instead of
begging Buchanan to stay and stewing about what will happen if he
goes, Republicans should be helping him pack.
</P>
<P>
   Ridding itself of Buchanan and the divisive mentality he
represents can only help the Grand Old Party in its efforts to
recapture the presidency in the 2000 election. Buchanan's
departure, in fact, would be a perfect example of addition by
subtraction.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan is a colorful character. He has some ideas that are
interesting, and even a few that are worthwhile. But he can never
escape his well-earned public image as a champion of intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   It's an image that he earned over the years as a commentator in
the media and as a political operative in the administrations of
Presidents Nixon and Reagan _ and that he cemented forever when he
stood before the 1992 Republican Convention and sounded the call to
arms for a cultural and religious war against all those who dare to
disagree with his views on an array of social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Democrat Ronald Reagan used to explain his switch to
Republicanism by saying, ``I didn't leave the Democratic Party; it
left me.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan could say the same about the Republican Party, and he'd
be correct. The party did leave him _ and the party is better off
for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The on-again/off-again host of CNN's ``Crossfire'' has been at
odds with his party for years. He may as well make the split
official.
</P>
<P>
   He not only damaged President Bush's 1992 re-election campaign
by turning that year's GOP convention into a virtual hatefest, but
a mere four years later Buchanan wounded Bob Dole's candidacy by
winning the New Hampshire primary. The defeat made Dole a sitting
duck for subsequent attacks by Steve Forbes _ attacks that
undoubtedly erased any chance that Dole might have had to upset
Bill Clinton in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   With friends like Pat Buchanan, the Republican Party doesn't
need enemies.
</P>
<P>
   So why don't the Republicans just tell Buchanan, ``See you
later'' or ``Don't let the door hit ya,'' or ``Don't call us, we'll
call you''?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the Grand Old Party lives in fear of the ghost of
Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans _ some of them, anyway _ are absolutely convinced
that Perot's independent candidacy in 1992 cost Bush the election
and put Clinton in the White House. The truth is, Perot siphoned
votes almost equally from Bush and Clinton; for all practical
purposes, he was not a factor in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   But it drives Republicans crazy to think that their president
just plain lost the election to the likes of Slick Willie Clinton;
it evidently eases the pain to imagine that this alien force known
as Perot somehow disrupted the natural order of things.
</P>
<P>
   And now, irony of ironies, the longtime Republican Buchanan is
thinking of bolting to the Reform Party _ a political organization
that had its roots in Perot's independent presidential campaign in
'92. If Buchanan becomes the Reform Party's presidential nominee in
2000, many Perot-haunted Republicans fear, he could seal the
election for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released this week showed Buchanan winning just 6 percent
of the vote in a three-way contest with Republican front-runner
George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore. And I'm
guessing that 6 percent is a considerable overstatement of
Buchanan's potential support.
</P>
<P>
   If the wishful thinkers who have embraced the Reform Party _ and
who fantasize that this half-baked organization can become a
serious player in American politics _ want to crown Pat Buchanan as
their standard-bearer, well, I say they are welcome to him. They
deserve each other.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is indisputable. Any damage that Buchanan might
do to the Republicans in the 2000 election would be inconsequential
when compared to the enormous increase in credibility and
respectability that would accrue to the GOP by eliminating such a
high-profile troublemaker from its ranks.

   LEAD: Lead poisoning of children always has been a problem in
Kansas City, but it's only been in the past couple of years that
health authorities have taken a really aggressive approach to
prevention. Armed with federal grant money, new equipment and
tougher laws, hundreds more children now are being tested, and
dozens of homes are being cleaned of lead. Health authorities have
had to work at changing attitudes of doctors, who didn't think lead
was still a problem. And they have had to seek out and train
contractors to do the remediation work. In some Kansas City zip
codes, as many as 26 percent of kids tested have high blood lead
levels, which can reduce IQ and cause learning disabilities, high
blood pressure and kidney damage. Graphics. Photos. Alan Bavley.

   FAR: Four days after Michael L. Farris cut off his electronic
monitor Independence police stopped him on a routine check. They
let Farris go because they did not know that he had cut his
monitor. In fact, it took state probation officials nearly a month

to death. We'll ask the family as well as state and local officials
to respond to this discovery. Trisha Howard and Joe Lambe. 15-20.

 &HT;    SHELBY FOOTE EXPLAINS THE SOUTH TO CAPITOL HILL
 &HT;    Duplication alert: Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle
categories
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over a breakfast of bagels and bran muffins, with
nary a grit nor biscuit in sight, Shelby Foote was educating a
Capitol Hill audience about the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having lost a war, we've known a tragedy that other Americans
have not experienced, certainly not until Vietnam,'' explained
Foote in the Mississippi drawl that narrated Ken Burns' PBS
documentary on the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have gained from it (is) a true sense of tragedy which
I think accounts, in part, for the dominance of Southern writers in
the history of American literature, particularly in this century,
since Mark Twain.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote, perhaps the world's best-known Southern historian, was
the first in a series of speakers who will address congressional
audiences on regionalism in the American culture at the behest of
William Ferris, chairman of the National Endowment for the
Humanities (NEH). Ferris is seeking federal funding for the
creation of ten regional humanities centers to ``nurture the
roots'' of Southerners, New Englanders, Westerners and other
American geographic groups who share a sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes Bill, we'll try to get you a little more money,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Republican who hails from
Mississippi, as do Ferris and Foote.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement of the U.S. Capitol and later at NEH
headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, Foote spoke of regional shame
and redemption, of race and roots and family, of how he ``will be
eternally grateful to God Almighty for letting me be born and
raised in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of the three-volume classic ``The Civil War: A
Narrative'' and five novels, including ``Shiloh,'' Foote grew up in
Greenville, Miss. In this Delta town, he said, there were ``about
as many people writing books as reading them.'' His closest friend
for over 60 years was the late novelist Walker Percy. Foote now
lives in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memphis has always been the capital of the Mississippi Delta
even though it is in Tennessee,'' said Foote.
</P>
<P>
   In the Delta, ``you can see forever, until the land rolls out of
sight. It is as flat as a pool table with topsoil 40 feet deep,''
he recounted. ``It is a place where farming is the main thing and
it is thought to be good to hold on to land.''
</P>
<P>
   In his boyhood, he said, ``Old men were not willing to turn
management of the plantation over to their sons. 'Those crazy fools
would would lose it.' As a result, you had 70-year-old men sending
45-year-old men out for cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they did to their sons. What they did to their
sons-in-law you just won't believe,'' he said. ``But no Delta girl
ever left home. When she got married, she brought her husband back
with her. She couldn't live away from the Delta, couldn't
breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Storytelling and love of the language are Southern traits, of
course, but Foote said it is history rather than drawls or overalls
or pick-up trucks that defines the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``We carry a burden,'' he said. ``We wouldn't be what we are if
we hadn't been what we were.''
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of slavery may always haunt the region, he reckoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South has sins on its soul that it will never be able to
get clear of, but so has the nation,'' said Foote. He said
emancipation was handled sinfully bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told 4 million people 'You're free. Hit the road','' he
said, providing no preparation or assistance for coping with a new
life.
</P>
<P>
   But he said a stronger nation was forged from the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War is an example of good coming out of evil,
strength coming out of suffering. The American Civil War is when
this country became this country. The Revolution made us an
independent nation. The Civil War decided what kind of country we
were going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And losing that war did a lot to create the cultural South.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know why the South is so interested in the
Civil War,'' he said. ``I've been in about 50 fist fights in my
life. And the ones I have the most vivid memories of are the ones I
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ``instantaneous communications'' of television, radio
and the Internet, there has been a ``homogenization'' of the
American culture that has lessened regional differences, Foote
said. But the South retains some distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something of the code of the Southern gentlemen has survived
and differentiates us,'' he said. Southern children still say ``Yes
sir'' and ``No ma'am'' to grown-ups. Cars still pull to the side of
the road to let a funeral procession pass. Manners matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southerners can be insulted. With some Easterners, it's
impossible,'' said Foote, describing Yankee conversations that
would have concluded with an invitation to step outside if
Southerners were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good society where people can go around cursing
each other with impunity,'' he explained. ``There ought to be some
risk involved.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, he agrees that the South is probably more violent than
other regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds a certain verve to life, but I'm not sure it's worth
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of people from other regions has diluted Southerness,
he said. ``Atlanta is about as Northern as it is Southern. Florida
is Northern.''
</P>
<P>
   But the South is famous for hospitality -- at least to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a stranger, you're welcomed in a sort of distant
way'' while the homefolks size you up, he said. ``If they like you,
intimacies develop. If they don't like you, the Southern deep
freeze sets in.''

&HT;     FORECASTERS HAD WARNED OF A BUSY HURRICANE SEASON THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A grim forecast of hurricane disaster, made by a controversial
meteorologist and a federal emergency official earlier this year,
appears to be coming true as Hurricane Floyd rolls along the East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, William Gray of Colorado State University has
racked up an impressive reputation as a hurricane forecaster. And
his forecast for 1999 _ that it would be a worse-than-normal
hurricane year _ certainly resembles the season now unfolding as
Hurricane Floyd bears down on the southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, ``Floyd could be `The Big One' in the hurricane
community,'' said a leading expert on the societal impact of
hurricanes, Roger A. Pielke Jr. of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   East Coasters can't say they weren't warned. On June 13, James
Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
while addressing the Annual Conference of Mayors in New Orleans,
urged them to prepare for an especially bad hurricane year.

   ``This is your obligation to your communities who bear the brunt
of disaster, to a nation who bears the cost of helping you rebuild
and, just as much, to yourselves, leaders whose ambitions for your
administration could be overtaken by a single storm,'' Lee warned
in his speech. He based his concerns on forecasters' expectations
of an especially severe hurricane year.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1998, Gray forecast four major Atlantic hurricanes for
the autumn of 1999. He based the forecast on global weather trends
that have, in the past, been correlated with increased hurricane
activity, among them the continued La Nina conditions in the
Pacific, weakened high-altitude winds and the position of the jet
stream.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane forecasters including Gray, now a media celebrity who
couldn't be reached Tuesday, have gained confidence in recent years
in their ability to forecast seasonal hurricane incidence.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason is the discovery of an apparent close link
between El Nino and La Nina years in the Pacific and hurricanes in
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are still trying to understand the precise links
between weather in the two oceans. They suspect that Atlantic
hurricanes tend to be fewer in El Nino years _ years when Pacific
waters are unusually warm _ partly because those years also bring
strong, high-altitude easterly winds. Those winds blow apart
tropical storms before they expand into hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Partly for this reason, Atlantic hurricanes are fewer in number
_ according to theory, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, those same high-altitude winds are weaker during La
Nina years, when Pacific waters are cooler. Hence, in theory, more
Atlantic hurricanes grow to full size during a La Nina year, as
Floyd has done this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced that Gray has a crystal ball for
hurricane forecasting. One is Kevin Trenberth, a noted
climatologist at the Boulder research center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of what he's (Gray) done is good, and some of it is
rather questionable,'' Trenberth said. ``He's a seat-of-the-pants
meteorologist, (but) he's not a good (weather) statistician. . .
.The general consensus in the (scientific) community (is) that some
of the things Bill Gray (does) are in the realm of art rather than
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Gray's forecasts are valid or just lucky guesses,
improved hurricane forecasting is essential partly because a
super-hurricane could cause cataclysmic damage.
</P>
<P>
   In a research paper published last year, Pielke, of the National
Center for Atmospheric Research, and colleagues ``made the comment
that it's just a matter of time before the nation sees a $50
billion (damage-causing) hurricane,'' he recalled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a $50 billion hurricane, you need two things: a
tremendously powerful storm, and . . . the storm to make landfall
in a populated area. With Floyd out there, we have _ potentially _
those ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane that wrought $50 billion in damage, or worse, could
seriously damage the U.S. insurance industry. It might also have
ripple effects on the rest of the U.S. or world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Hurricane Hugo in 1989, ``no hurricane had resulted in
claims in excess of $1 billion,'' Loretta Worters of the Insurance
Information Institute in New York said Tuesday. Then along came
Hugo, which caused $4.2 billion in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Worters said, ``Before Hurricane Andrew struck south
Florida in August 1992, many experts thought the worst possible
windstorm would cause no more than about $8 billion (damage).'' Yet
Andrew was close to about $16 billion. The resulting damage claims
forced numerous insurance firms into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   And if a hurricane hit a major metropolitan area such as Miami,
damage claims could exceed $50 billion, Worters added.

<P>
   CHENGDU, China _ Will it be a love legend of the new millennium,
or a case of affections thwarted by geopolitical manipulation,
menacing illness or even the curse of incest?
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like themes in a weepy Chinese opera.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tune in to the tube or hike to the local bookstore to
find the outcome of this melodramatic tale.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your eyes on Zoo Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Those outrageously cuddly fur balls, the panda cubs Lun Lun and
Yang Yang, are innocently nuzzling each other and ambling around
their mini-forest in this southwest China research base, blissfully
ignorant that politicians and scientists have hung their future in
suspended animation.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the panda pair that Zoo Atlanta holds clouded hope
of receiving on Oct. 7 has become a saga entwining power politics
with conflicting codes of conservation and the fragility of the
panda itself.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the pandas will go, whether they will stay, whether they
can mate, all are open-ended questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The over-arching problem is nothing more or less than the
fencing our two governments have been going through regarding
Kosovo, regarding Tibet, regarding Taiwan, regarding missiles in
North Korea,'' zoo director Terry Maple acknowledged in a telephone
interview from Atlanta. ``These are serious political issues.''
</P>
<P>
   They are serious enough that the Chinese government has not yet
given the actual go-ahead for the two pandas to be loaned to Zoo
Atlanta under the 10-year agreement of ``intentions'' signed by
officials of the zoo and of the China Association of Zoological
Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Final approval could come any day. Or never.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it will be very quickly processed. Maybe it will go
very, very slowly,'' said Xie Zhong, secretary general of the China
association in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chinese government spokesman, who refused to give his
name, warned not to expect word until after the Oct. 1 celebration
of China's 50th anniversary of the revolution, an event consuming
the attentions of officials countrywide.
</P>
<P>
   China's Byzantine bureaucracy requires endorsements of panda
loans by the Ministries of Construction, Forestry and Foreign
Affairs, which then must jointly petition the State Council, the
counterpart of a president's cabinet in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Premier Zhu Rongji himself must sign off on the deal is
an issue of semantics, because the ultimate approval is a decision
of international political consequence made at the highest levels
of China's governing elite.
</P>
<P>
   And that merely underscores the importance of the delightful
rolly-polly creatures whose sad-looking eyes and deceptively clumsy
gait have endeared them to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the panda is considered a national treasure. Abroad, this
endangered species is a symbol of the harm humankind has done to
its environment and must repair before nature's clock ticks
premature closure on preservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A more crass filter produces a somewhat different view: to the
Chinese, the panda is better than gold as a piece of barter, while
foreigners see dollar signs in those poignant black eyes that will
pull in ticket receipts to support conservation, research or other
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants a piece of the panda, and the Chinese government
manipulates that desire to the hilt.
</P>
<P>
   That said, things nonetheless are looking up for Atlanta.
Eventually, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Maple of the Atlanta zoo is convinced final approval is only a
matter of time, although he doesn't guarantee the United Parcel
Service plane ready to ferry the two-year-old bundles of spunk will
take off for America as scheduled in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a little optimism rising because of the trade talks,''
he said, referring to the negotiations on China's painfully long
endeavor to enter the World Trade Organization. After a cordial
meeting last weekend at a New Zealand conference, China's President
Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered their
negotiators to press ahead, a development viewed as a positive turn
in badly deteriorated relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pandas could be a very positive thing for relations
between the countries. That's the way I hope it will turn out,''
Maple said.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the pandas do board UPS's Boeing 767 painted _ how
else? _ with the visage of a panda, Zoo Atlanta will continue its
cooperative project with the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda
Breeding, the place Lun Lun and Yang Yang were born and now romp.
The cooperation will include a generous infusion of dollars from
Atlanta to the Chengdu base _ $1
</P>
<P>
   million a year for the 10 years of the panda loan.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantans will do behavioral research here and in Atlanta,
recording the interactions of pandas on an almost daily basis from
the day of their birth. They began watching Lun Lun and Yang Yang,
among others, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Things still may not proceed precisely as Zoo Atlanta once
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Yang Yang has been feeling poorly. And that is not
at all unusual for pandas. They look big and strong, but actually
suffer physical problems ranging from a minuscule birth weight of
five or six ounces _ they essentially are born before fully
physically developed _ to a perpetually delicate digestive system.
</P>
<P>
   The latter results from the fact that early in their three
million-year history pandas used to be carnivores. They pioneered
modern health trends by adopting a vegetarian diet, but their
bodies never made the switchover to properly process their almost
exclusively bamboo meals.
</P>
<P>
   In the wild, they may eat an average of 40 kilograms (88 pounds)
of bamboo shoots a day, but most of it passes right through their
bodies in an average of 150 droppings rather than being digested.
</P>
<P>
   With so much focus on the survival of newborns, people tend to
forget that rough-and-tumble pre-adolescents like Yang Yang also
are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the sub-adult the survival rate is very low,'' said Zhang
Hemin, director of another Chinese panda breeding center in the
forested mountains northeast of here. He cautioned that they need
close attention, but was confident they can be reared to vigorous
adulthood. Interviewed at his center in the Wolong Nature Reserve,
Zhang proudly said his place has 100
</P>
<P>
   percent survival of pandas that manage to reach six months of
age.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Yang's illness was indeed a digestive problem that kept him
sidelined for more than two weeks in August and so far, in
September. He spent most of the time sprawled like a sack of
potatoes in his barred cage in the gray concrete sub-adult house
here at the Chengdu research base, suffering from diarrhea and lack
of appetite.
</P>
<P>
   American Sarah Bexell, a zoologist and education specialist from
the Atlanta Zoo who has been working here on the research project,
lamented one day during Yang Yang's illness that the staff could
hardly tempt him even with fresh bamboo shoots they collected from
the mist-shrouded grounds of this leafy, wet research center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chewed it up and then spit it out. He didn't swallow more
than three mouthfuls,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't worried about it (potential illness) until Yang Yang
got so sick. They are vulnerable animals. When you watch them you
can't believe it because they are so big and rolly-polly and
playful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   A Zoo Atlanta nutritionist and veterinarian have been consulting
long-distance on the case, and antibiotic shots got him well enough
for daily yard work-outs early last week.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Yang's female companion Lun Lun was evidently bummed out
about his absence from the play yard, despite the fact that a pair
of twins around the same age kept her company. Zoo Atlanta also is
monitoring the twin pandas as part of the behavioral study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lun Lun has been pining for him,'' Bexell said. ``The first
few days after Yang Yang was separated from the group, Lun Lun
spent a lot of time wanting to get back to him. It's what we call
'door directed behavior.'''
</P>
<P>
   She referred to the tendency of all three animals, Lun Lun and
the twins, to frequently sidle up toward the building where Yang
Yang was at rest, rather than wander around the wooded yard where
they climb the jungle gym, slosh around water pools or clamber down
a four-foot incline to the empty concrete moat where they
invariably fall asleep.
</P>
<P>
   On the one day Yang Yang did come out to play, Lun Lun ignored
him for 15 or 20 minutes, until a keeper running around the
enclosure with her guided Lun Lun over to her playmate who was
belly-up on the jungle gym.
</P>
<P>
   Lun Lun boosted herself up the logs, and the two proceeded to
nuzzle and spar and, well, apparently communicate. That is, until
they got a bit too rambunctious and Lun Lun tumbled to the ground.
She ultimately headed for the moat, and Yang Yang finally followed
her there for a companionable snooze.
</P>
<P>
   Such sociable interaction transfixes humans, but diminishes as
pandas reach adulthood, when they aggressively bark and bleat at
each other and often must be separated. By the time they are
sexually mature at the age of five or six, they may tolerate each
other only at Lun Lun's once-yearly mating time.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta researchers will have some crucial decisions to make
before the pair reaches panda adolescence _ with the help of a
panda paternity test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two pandas are both sub-adults, both two years old,'' said
Yu Jianqiu (pronounced, ``You Jee-en chyou''), deputy director of
the Chengdu research base. ``Maybe we can breed them there. We
chose these two pandas because they can breed, because their
families are separate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also maybe we can get money from Atlanta to help us get more
equipment here for research of diseases and for reproductive and
genetic research.''
</P>
<P>
   The money part is a pretty sure thing. The breeding is not.
</P>
<P>
   Yu does not admit the possibility, but Atlanta zoo personnel
suspect that Lun Lun and Yang Yang may be too closely related to
mate without causing the genetic consequences of in-breeding. In
fact, they may share the same father.
</P>
<P>
   When Yu hauled out China's ``Stud Book'' that chronicles which
pandas have sired which, where and when, he looked surprised to
find that Yang Yang was not listed. The book stopped at the
beginning of September, 1997, and Yang Yang was born September 9 of
that year.
</P>
<P>
   With the troubling question-mark over Yang Yang's parentage, Zoo
Atlanta has trained staff and docents not to tell visitors that
mating the pair is a sure thing, according to Bexell, who
co-authored the education program.
</P>
<P>
   Director Maple acknowledged DNA testing eventually will
determine the relatedness of Yang Yang and Lun Lun. Although
researchers chose these two pandas because they are compatible and
it seemed mating ``was an option,'' he said the discovery of the
potential barrier will not block Atlanta's research program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense it is important in that we want these two to
become breeders. Whatever we do in managing them, in watching them
and other animals we're observing in Chengdu, we want to understand
better the process by which pandas become socialized and become
appropriate breeders and appropriate parents,'' he said. ``But we
didn't acquire them just to breed them. We acquired them to study
them.''
</P>
<P>
   If this pair is returned to China to breed with more genetically
appropriate pandas, Maple said he assumes Atlanta would receive a
replacement pair to breed and to study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the panda program in essence is in perpetuity,'' he
said. ``We want to be in China as long as we're doing good there.
And we want to continue to observe and study pandas.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Getting this far has been a 13-year crusade for Maple, one he
said began when former President Jimmy Carter told China's late
leader Deng Xiaoping in 1986 that Atlanta would love to exhibit a
panda or two.
</P>
<P>
   The quest was interrupted by a ferocious international
controversy begun a few years later when Western conservation
groups balked at China's rent-a-panda policy of grabbing up
animals, sometimes from the wild, to loan to Western zoos happy to
pay six-figure prices for three-month to six-month visits that
would draw millions of visitors and multi-millions of
</P>
<P>
   dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic then was hot and heavy despite the March 15, 1984,
declaration of the panda as an endangered species. A mere 1,000
pandas are estimated living in the wild, and about another 100 are
in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it had only been in 1936 that the panda won western
hearts with its first public appearance in America. The panda
supply line was severed once the revolutionary government took over
China in 1949 and quickly cracked down on panda hunting and export.
It used the animal only as a goodwill ambassador to friendly
governments.
</P>
<P>
   So when China opened up again to the world and made its first
short-term loan for a fee in 1984, western zoos clamored for more
pandas. And they got them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 the World Wildlife Fund-U.S. filed suit to stop the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service from granting import permits until it
adopted regulations designed to protect the vulnerable panda.
Conservationists wanted to discourage the taking of pandas from the
wild by allowing only the import of captive-bred animals, and to
force American zoos to do more than simply
</P>
<P>
   put the creatures on display for big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Only after a decade were the regulations finished, and Atlanta
became the first zoo to get an import permit by complying with new
federal demands requiring top-of-the-line physical conditions,
scientific research and contributions to environmental protection
in China.
</P>
<P>
   With luck and continued perseverance, Lun Lun and Yang Yang will
get to Atlanta. And they may even mate and produce little giant
pandas.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be surprised if, by then, they aren't speaking to each
other any more.

   CHENGDU, China _ If there's anything trickier than making panda
babies, it's tracking panda papas.
</P>
<P>
   Is Yang Yang's dad Lan Lan or Lin Lan?
</P>
<P>
   Or some other male panda whose seed may have been frozen in a
sperm bank for several years?
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, how come Yang Yang's keepers insist on calling
him Jiu Jiu?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers of Zoo Atlanta would love to know his pedigree.
But because of a Chinese panda breeding phenomenon inelegantly
referred to as a ``cocktail,'' Yang Yang and Lun Lun could be
half-sibs _ or just good friends.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, Yang Yang, the male of the pair, is not listed in
the ``Stud Book'' that traces giant panda lineage. The book stops
about a week or so before his birth on Sept. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Yang was born here at the Chengdu Research Base for Giant
Panda Breeding, so there is no doubt about his mother. She is Ya
Ya. And her lineage is illustrious, including her renowned
grandmother Mei Mei, who produced so many offspring that the
Chinese designated her the ``hero mother'' and gave her a special
posthumous exhibit in the museum here.
</P>
<P>
   The complication is that Ya Ya not only mated naturally that
spring before Yang Yang arrived _ at the tiny size of 173 grams, or
6 ounces _ but that she also was artificially inseminated with what
Western zoologists call a ``semen cocktail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did artificial insemination with several different males,''
acknowledged Yu Jianqiu, (pronounced, ``You Jee-en chyou''), deputy
director of the research base.
</P>
<P>
   Yu said he didn't think it possible that among the sperm donors
was Lin Lan, whose sperm has been identified as producing Lun Lun,
the female of the young panda pair Atlanta wants to borrow for the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't say why it's not possible, but just not.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Snyder, head of Zoo Atlanta's panda research, said in an
e-mail message that she managed to track down Ya Ya's natural mate,
a male called Lan Lan, and she thinks she has traced one donor for
the artificial insemination. But that doesn't solve the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese practice multiple breeding attempts in an effort to
produce multiple offspring or at least one solid pairing of egg and
sperm. And they have improved the pandas' poor breeding record.
</P>
<P>
   But with only about 100 pandas in captivity, around half of them
males and many too young to breed yet, the pool of available sperm
isn't huge. That is why Western wildlife experts prevailed upon the
Chinese to create the ``Stud Book'' that they hope will prevent
breeding of closely related pandas.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously there are glitches even with the book, though DNA
testing will identify genetic heritage before any mating in Atlanta
could take place.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion is the profusion of names some pandas
accumulate. Officially they get numbers, but also usually are named
in the zoos or research centers where they are born.
</P>
<P>
   The may get additional names, if a well-to-do Chinese or
foreigner decides to ``adopt'' one and pay $5,000 or so for a least
a year's upkeep. For that, the donor gets a brass plaque and the
privilege of naming the animal.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Yang, for example, was first named Jiu Jiu (pronounced,
``Jyo Jyo'') by his keepers. Holland's Province of Friesland,
Chamber of Commerce of Friesland and Van Hall Institute ``adopted''
him at the age of one and named him Yang Yang.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, the Chinese keepers still call him Jiu Jiu.
</P>
<P>
   They also call Lun Lun by her original name, Hua Hua. She was
adopted by a Taiwanese rock star Su Huilun, who modestly applied
the last part of her own monicker to the panda.
</P>
<P>
   The critical factor in tracking a panda's ancestry is knowing
that original name, or even better, the animal's number.
</P>
<P>
   Lun Lun, for example is in the ``Stud Book,'' but you won't find
Lun Lun listed.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Hua Hua. Or if you're really in the know, find 452.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CUPEY ALTO, Puerto Rico _ The lush vegetation that threatens to
overwhelm the shanty houses it is growing between fools you at
first, the way a fighter can when he feints one way before
delivering a crushing blow from another angle.
</P>
<P>
   You take a look around at the small homes, many of them
dilapidated, and it is clear that poverty lives here between the
plant life. But there is no sign at first of the kind of grinding
despair or fermenting danger that is the breeding ground of great
boxers.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty is as necessary a component in the creation of a
champion prizefighter as a sharp jab, quick reflexes, or a brave
heart. There have been exceptions, such as Gene Tunney, but they
are rare. The rule says you don't find fighters in Beverly Hills
unless they're committing a burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing is the harshest of sports, and so it seems to demand a
hard upbringing to weather it. Men fight because they have no other
choice. They fight because that is what they have known from the
time they were small boys trying to make their way through hard
places. In comparison to the streets they walk in their daily
lives, the boxing ring seems a safe haven, so they go there intent
on destroying another man's will almost without realizing the
danger of the undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   But in this neighborhood not far outside San Juan, where the
humidity and unemployment are high, there are few outward signs of
such a life. There is no high-rise feel of a big-city housing
project. No sense that danger is lurking not far beneath the
surface calm.
</P>
<P>
   Then the police officer standing in front of Felix Trinidad's
old school steps out of a guard shack wearing a bulletproof vest
and removes all doubt about where the International Boxing
Federation welterweight champion of the world learned to fight.
</P>
<P>
   He learned here, in the streets of Cupey Alto, where there are
drugs and guns and violence, just as there are in East Los Angeles,
the neighborhood that spawned the great challenge of Trinidad's
life, Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad will face that challenge Saturday night when he fights
the World Boxing Council champion in Las Vegas to unify the
welterweight title. That night, perhaps the two best fighters in
the world will meet, a fire raging inside each like flames licking
up dry timber. It is a fire born in East Los Angeles and here in
Cupey Alto, where the school guard wears a bulletproof vest to
greet a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tito came here, his father could already see his son had
something, like a raw diamond,'' recalls Carmen Carratini, who
taught young Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad social studies and history in
the seventh grade. ``I tell all my students they can be great, like
a doctor or a lawyer, but Tito began to know he'd be great early.
There was a smell. A look. A feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time Tito won the title, I went to the airport to
greet him. It was so emotional. I love Tito! In this town, Cupey,
we are close. I have lost 22 of my students (to street violence or
drugs). This is a place that has problems, like so many places. I
lost my own child a month ago to a motorcycle accident. It is sad,
but I think God is so good to me to give me a student like Tito.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all so glad a son of Puerto Rico is making the best of
it. That night with Oscar, it will be like a son making history.
You can teach history, but Tito will be in sports history. Never
before has a newspaper come here looking for the story of one of my
students. That is a gift from God.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many folks in Cupey Alto make history, nor do reporters
often come to the Juan Antonio Corretjer School for their stories.
Life here is too hard for that. There is no time for dreaming when
you're slipping on a bulletproof vest to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   Or when you're passing by one on your way to school.
</P>
<P>
   But Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad was always different. He dreamed and
his father dreamed with him, and now all of Cupey Alto is dreaming.
Dreaming of how they will dance in the streets when he comes home
with all the title belts, dance all the way from the airport in San
Juan to Tito's mother's house up on the hill, where the boy was
born to a man who dreamed of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don Felix Trinidad, the father of the champion, was once a
featherweight fighter himself. He made no name in the world of
boxing, but he learned to use his fists early, and although he
would feed his family by building swimming pools, that was not his
trade. The trade he would pass on to his son was working with his
hands in another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything his father did, the son wanted to do the same
thing,'' Carratini recalls. ``He wanted to build swimming pools and
make them as good as his father's.''
</P>
<P>
   Tito Trinidad may have been content had he done that, but his
father had other plans for his son's hands. Those hands were to
strike out at the world, to take its measure. Those hands were made
to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very early in his amateur career, you could see he was
different,'' Don Felix says, pride and acceptance of fate in his
voice. ``Tito had a lot of stamina. A lot of courage. And very good
skills, even as a boy. He started very young.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad started the way so many boxers do, before he knew any
better. He started before some other sport could take him away from
boxing because he wanted to be with his father, and his father
wanted to be in a gym. So the boy followed the man to the hardest
place there is in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson once said of prizefighting, ``You play sports, but
you don't play boxing. Who goes to the playground to fight?'' The
fact is, only fighters do, and only a few are blessed to fight like
Tito Trinidad. Often, like him, they fight that way from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``His first fight was when he was 10, so he was almost always
the youngest,'' his father explains. ``He was just like you see him
now. Somebody knocked him down, he got up and knocked them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a champion at 80 pounds, 95 pounds, 100 pounds, 119
pounds, 126 pounds, 132 pounds. He was always the champion. He was
11 when he won his first championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The father could dream big dreams because of that, and the son
has lived them, winning 35 straight fights and the IBF welterweight
title as a professional. As he grew tall and thin in the sun, the
boy kept fighting without complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the streets or at school, like so many others. Only where
it counted. Only in tiny gyms, inside roped-off squares where his
father was always at his side to encourage him.
</P>
<P>
   But the father was smart. He pushed, but not too hard. He
cajoled, but not too often. Along the way he convinced him of his
greatness without demanding he show it too often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard him once say he didn't want to fight,'' the
father insists. ``He was never under any pressure. You have to
remember, Tito only had 57 amateur fights (51-6). No 200-300 fights
like some kids. I let him go along. I didn't push him. I was very
conscious that if you push him to the extreme, it could go, as you
say, and he could lose interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boy never lost interest in his father's dream. Instead,
he made it his own. Up on the hill, at the end of a winding road
where the family farm had been, he grew up believing he would make
history, just as his father said.
</P>
<P>
   Never once did he waver. Never once did he rebel. Instead he
fell in love with long runs and putting his hands in other boy's
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father fought (Salvador) Sanchez once in Texas,'' says
Juan Gomez, Trinidad's cousin and the caretaker of the hill where
now ``12 or 14'' of Trinidad's family members live, scattered in
houses he has paid for. ``That's a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   As he speaks, Gomez stands in front of a sturdy stucco house
Tito remodeled for him that sits yards away from a second house
under construction. Down the hill sits another, and 10 yards away
is another.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Up the hill they come. The bikers. They're
more than 20 strong. Their helmets gleam in the midmorning sun.
Their shades mirror the metallic gloss of their engines. Gloved
fingers grip handlebars. And some broad shoulders display the logo
of one of their clubs _ the Boston Stranglers.
</P>
<P>
   But where's the roar of engines? The smell of exhaust from
multiple chrome pipes? The menacing macho of Harleys?
</P>
<P>
   There's only a cheerful putt-putt buzzing in the air as two
dozen motor scooters snake their way up a hill on a Saturday
morning. Here above an auto museum with a view of Boston, area
scooter enthusiasts meet several times a month to go for daylong
rides and to share scooter stories and passions.
</P>
<P>
   What's the attraction?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always a Harley-Davidson man until I got a scooter,''
says Dan McCallum of Merrimack, N.H. ``A scooter is simplicity at
its finest. Scooters have a matronly look to them. From behind,
they have hips, a come-play-with-me air about them,'' he says,
pointing to his meticulously maintained emerald green Vespa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scooters have finesse. They aren't loud, and they're
nonthreatening. They aren't like mopeds. Scooters can go 70 m.p.h.
and you can get a real adrenaline rush riding them. Motorcycles are
fast and bulky. Scooters allow you to have a slow cruise. A cruise
back in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Going back in time means, for some scooter riders, returning to
the '60s when the mods in snappy clothes swooped through English
streets on Vespa scooters. To other devotees, especially club
members born in Italy, it means going back to the old country and
memories of riding in the country, with your girlfriend's arms
wrapped around your waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my first scooter when I was 15, and I wanted one,'' says
Michael Charles, 29, of New Canaan, Conn., who started the Classic
Scooter Club of Boston in 1995. ``I liked the shape of it. It
looked futuristic. It was not something you saw every day. And then
I saw the movie, and I knew I had to get one.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is ``Quadrophenia,'' a British cult film about a 1964
confrontation between the Vespa-riding mods and the
black-leather-jacketed rockers in a small seaside town on the coast
of England. The scooter that Charles ``had to get'' was a little
Vespa 90 that he paid for with money he earned mowing lawns. He
painted it, polished it, took it fishing. Then he went off to
college. The scooter remained behind in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Boston University in 1992 and following
the local music scene that was rooted in the '60s, he met other
scooter enthusiasts and they started riding together. Thus began
the club, which now numbers 30 to 40 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to ride once or twice a month,'' says Charles, who now
owns what he refers to as the top of the line _ a Vespa GS made in
1957. ``I knew I was onto something the day Fred went riding with
me and a friend. It was his first time riding with others, and he
yelled out, `This is the most fun I've ever had.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred'' is Fred Wilson, 74, of South Boston, who was born in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, this really is it. I'm not crazy,'' added Charles.
``This man is old. He's lived his life. And here he's saying this,
riding a scooter, is the most fun he's ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles now comes up every other weekend from southern
Connecticut to ride with his club friends.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no numbers available scooter popularity in
this country, club members believe that the pastime is growing
because there are many more shops that sell parts. And scooters
have begun appearing in ads, for Toyota, Washington apples and
Filene's, among others.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Gerber, who has ridden scooters for 35 years
in 70 countries and is an amateur scooter historian, 50,000
scooters were sold in this country in 1957, with a dip to 30,000 by
1964. Boston, San Francisco, and New York were the main American
scootering centers. (The vehicles remain a popular way of getting
around Europe and Asia.)
</P>
<P>
   The early '60s were the years of an emerging counterculture _
the beats. It was a time when people sat in coffeehouses discussing
Camus and Sartre and the films of Bergman and Fellini. A time when
an Italian scooter symbolized European sophistication and a
departure from the American way of big-is-best consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   However, it wasn't just the beats who rode scooters. A young law
school student, Michael Dukakis, was one of many area students who
traveled through Boston on a scooter, says Gerber. And the nation's
first collegiate scooter club was formed at Harvard, even though
club members were constantly at odds with the school's
administration over the right to park their Vespas and Lambrettas
in Harvard Yard.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the scooter craze came with the introduction of
another import _ the Honda motorcycle, from Japan. Scooters took
another body blow in the early '80s when the Environmental
Protection Agency outlawed further imports because of polluting
emissions. The only scooters on the road today made it to these
shores before the restrictions became law.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Dertouzos, 29, of Boston, says he bought his Vespa from a
friend who found it in a neighbor's garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mess,'' says Dertouzos. ``It only had half an engine.
But restoring it was pretty easy. I didn't need a manual and it
certainly didn't cost much. I have to laugh at the guys . . . on
$30,000 Harleys. I think there's a lot more style to a scooter.
They may not be macho, but there's a certain romance about them.''
</P>
<P>
   So states this 6-foot-8-inch scooter fan who also happens to own
a BMW motorcycle. Dertouzos says riding a scooter allows you to
look around and enjoy the sights _ especially on Newbury street or
in Harvard Square. Driving his Beamer takes a lot of concentration,
he says, making sightseeing and girl watching minimal. ``Shooting
around the city on a scooter,'' he says, ``is easy because they're
so nimble, and you can go up on the sidewalk and talk to people
sitting outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's fun to go 110 m.p.h. on a motorcycle . . . with the
rush of wind in your face, but riding a scooter is more quirky and
a lot safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodbury, 29, became interested in scooters in the late
'80s because he was ``into the mod thing and ska music.'' He bought
a 1961 Vespa 50 from a friend who had stored it in the back of a
closet. He bought three more bikes just for parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then I thought I owned something really rare,'' says
Woodbury. ``I thought I was the only one around with a scooter.
Then I read about a rally in upstate New York in Scootering
Magazine,'' a British publication.
</P>
<P>
   He put his scooter in his hatchback, headed north to the rally,
and was amazed to find 100 other scooter nuts. On his return to
Boston, he started the Boston Stranglers. There are six hard-core
members plus five others who are less involved.
</P>
<P>
   Woodbury says he commutes every day. He owned a Honda motorcycle
for several years, but finds scooters ``perkier and more fun to
drive. Just like it's more fun to drive a standard car than one
that's automatic. There's more control and the center of gravity is
better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to hate scooters,'' says Misty Woodbury, who's married
to Woody. ``But now I really like to ride. We go to rallies in New
York and Toronto. You can get into a groove on long trips and it's
very pleasant. But there's also a downside. Going to Canada, my
engine seized up twice. They get too hot. They're small two-stroke
engines, like outboard motors.''
</P>
<P>
   And they're great attention getters and conversation pieces.
</P>
<P>
   As one scooter rider says, ``It's just like walking the dog.
Scooters engage people.''

IT'S AN ERA OF MASSIVE MASS MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When Viacom and CBS announced a $37.7 billion merger last
week, some analysts saw it as a career-capping triumph for master
deal maker Sumner Redstone, the 76-year-old Boston-born cinema
entrepreneur turned media magnate.
</P>
<P>
   But others saw the deal as an alarming escalation of a trend in
which Redstone is joining a very small clique of corporate titans _
including News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch, Disney-ABC's Michael Eisner,
and Gerald Levin of Time Warner _ who control a huge fraction of
everything Americans hear, see and read in the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by recent Federal Communications Commission moves relaxing
cross-ownership restrictions, US media companies are rapidly
concentrating ownership over television networks, movie studios, TV
and radio stations and cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   The Viacom-CBS deal, announced Tuesday, creates a global
conglomerate with nearly $20 billion in annual revenues from CBS,
Paramount Pictures, the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing house, the
Infinity Broadcasting radio network, cable channels including MTV
and Nickelodeon, and the country's biggest billboard business _ not
to mention five amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``is simply the latest example of a tendency toward
monopoly control of the entire culture by a very small group of
very large corporations,'' said Mark Crispin Miller, a New York
University media professor and head of the Project on Media
Ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an undemocratic development. The whole media system is
enthralled to moneyed interests in a way that is unprecedented,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is difficult to calculate an exact number, industry
analysts agree that the overwhelming majority of everything
Americans see on television over the course of a week is now
developed by six or seven huge companies, some of which are likely
to continue merging.
</P>
<P>
   Just four companies alone _ Time Warner, Walt Disney Co., News
Corp. and Viacom-CBS if combined _ control the following
entertainment and news outlets:
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS, Fox News, ESPN, Turner Broadcasting, Sky Broadcasting,
Star TV of Asia, Warner Bros., the WB television network, the UPN
network, Paramount Pictures, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox,
Time-Life magazines, The New York Post, The Times of London; book
publishers HarperCollins, Simon &AMP; Schuster and Hyperion; and the
Warner music labels.
</P>
<P>
   The question that is challenging to answer is whether this is
necessarily a bad or alarming thing.
</P>
<P>
   From a business standpoint, the CBS-Viacom combination was
widely hailed as a brilliant move, bringing together two strong,
rich companies that fill each other's weak spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our union will be king,'' declared Redstone, who continues to
maintain a Newton residence. ``We will be global leaders in every
facet of the media and entertainment industry, financially strong
from day one, with an enviable stable of global brands'' and huge
opportunities to cross-promote each division's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some media magnates who are known to have a political
agenda, Redstone is seen chiefly as an investor and promoter who
believes that ``content is king'' but does not have a strong
preference for what the content should be.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS-Viacom deal could be seen as a symptom of a media
nuclear-arms race spawned by changing viewer habits.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thistle, a former Boston television news director who now
runs the broadcast journalism program at Boston University, noted
that networks have been under intense pressure to join bigger
companies and get into cable ventures because their viewership has
steadily eroded.
</P>
<P>
   By way of example, Thistle noted that last Tuesday night at 9:30
p.m., more than 65 percent of Greater Boston households watching TV
were tuned in to something other than a station affiliated with the
big three national networks, Fox, UPN or WB. The Nielsen ratings
numbers do not account for some untold additional number of people
who five years ago might have been watching TV but were up surfing
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional prime-time audience is nowhere to be found,''
said Thistle.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, combinations like CBS-Viacom, Disney-ABC and
Time-Warner-Turner could be seen not so much as efforts to dominate
the flow of electronic information, but as defensive moves to keep
a critical share of a steadily more atomized television and
entertainment audience.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of Viacom and CBS, bringing together a national
network with a company that has a big studio presence, has
parallels to ABC's teaming up with Disney's network, creating an
arsenal of programming for both ABC and The History Channel on
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all three of the old-line networks have made major moves
into owning cable networks as a way to hold on to viewers, fewer
and fewer of whom tune in over the air.
</P>
<P>
   And amid the cacophony of media outlets crying out for
attention, for CBS-Viacom to have a radio outlet and 210,000 US
billboards to promote its movies, news and television shows becomes
a crucial tool to break through to an mass audience besieged by
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that makes it hard to judge the impact of corporate
control of entertainment and, perhaps more importantly, news is
that, literally, most of us do not know what we are missing.
Observers have some reasonable theories but are generally hard-put
to say what news stories have not been aired because of
profit-minded conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   A survey commissioned by Miller's group, run by well-regarded
pollster Celinda Lake, found last December that 64 percent of
Americans surveyed think that consolidated ownership of TV networks
has ``some or a great deal of effect'' on the variety and type of
programming shown, although the question did not get into the
nature of that effect.
</P>
<P>
   One example cited was a decision by ABC News ``20/20'' producers
last year not to pursue an investigation of child molestation and
lax security at amusement parks, including Walt Disney World, the
flagship property of ABC's corporate parent. But ABC sources have
said the story had shaky sources, and it was an ABC producer who
unilaterally made the decision not to drop it _ perhaps to avoid
angering Disney bosses, but not because of direct orders.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hewitt, the veteran executive producer of CBS's ``60
Minutes,'' told The New York Times last week that except for a 1995
decision not to broadcast an interview with a tobacco company
whistleblower that could have led to a costly lawsuit, ``I've never
seen us knuckle under to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller said he thinks the media have fallen down pursuing
one of the major stories of our time _ the concentration of
capitalist power in not just media but finance, defense contracting
and industry.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many media critics have said television networks
provided only spotty coverage of the congressional debate over the
1996 Telecommunications act, focusing chiefly on its impact on
telephone and cable service while largely ignoring its provisions
to give TV station owners digital spectrum airwave space worth up
to $70 billion, much of it usable for non-TV communications
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The only big national network that is not now part of a media
conglomerate, NBC, is owned by a different kind of powerful
multinational business empire: General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't hearing the news about the big conglomerate
ownership,'' Miller said. ``Advertising-driven media tend to be
noncontroversial and tend not to be offensive to moneyed
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   But Solveig Singleton of the Cato Institute, a
libertarian-oriented Washington think tank, said, ``Government
control of the media or media conglomerates is still a much bigger
threat to people's liberty than the media conglomerates are.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Singleton added, ``In some cases it may be very important
to have a big, powerful company to expose something like corruption
at the highest levels of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing availability of information over the Internet, now
used by 40 million Americans, represents ``this enormous bottom-up
phenomenon. There are very low barriers to getting into the public
comment business. The really important thing is to keep that market
as open as possible rather than to say, `OK, big is bad, so if you
are big, we are going to restrict and regulate you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   However, veteran public television journalist Bill Moyers, in a
recent PBS special called ``Free Speech for Sale,'' said the First
Amendment does mean ``government can't keep you from getting your
two cents into the public debate. But what the framers of our
government didn't reckon with is that two cents doesn't buy you
much free speech these days . . . If you really want to be heard
today, we're talking big money.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS News president Andrew Heyward said despite the shrinking
number of corporate owners, television viewers today enjoy an
unprecedented diversity in programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more different kinds of news and information
available to viewers than there ever were before,'' Heyward said.
``Even in the so-called golden days of network news, there were
huge areas of life that were being woefully undercovered, like the
women's movement. I think there was a very narrow definition of
what was considered news.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that newspaper ownership has been
consolidated on a scale somewhat comparable to TV channels and
production studios; The Boston Globe joined The New York Times Co.
in 1993, which also includes 21 smaller newspapers and a magazine
group. National chains such as Gannett, Knight-Ridder and
Scripps-Howard control hundreds of US newspapers, most of which
have no local competition.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat
who is the ranking minority member of the House telecommunications
subcommittee, has vigorously opposed recent FCC moves he says will
dilute the long-enshrined principle of diverse, local ownership of
media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``These mergers are like nuns: They don't travel alone. I am
sure you are going to see three or four more of these huge
megacombinations happen,'' Markey said, adding with a laugh:
``Eventually it will all get bought by AT&AMP;T, and then it will all
get bought by Microsoft, and then all of us in America will be
working for the same company.''

   As Gomez surveys the property, pointing here and there, he tells
a visitor who is living where.

   Here . . . long before that house had a satellite dish beside it
big enough to bring in a NASA broadcast. Here . . . long before a
bigger house had been built around the old shell. Here . . . on
what has become hallowed ground in Puerto Rico, the boy grew to be
a man by running down that hill and through the lush green.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, running in the heat. Running and throwing his
fists and hearing of the night his father fought the great Sanchez
and never asking why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I been here 27 years, and Tito is 26,'' Gomez says, making
clear he has the proper perspective to speak on the subject of his
cousin. ``He always got up on his own (to run). He was always ready
in the morning. Nobody had to wake him up. His father never had
problems with him. Tito always liked cross-country. He liked to
dance and ride horses. But since the first day he started fighting,
he never hesitated for one moment.''
</P>
<P>
   He never hesitated, so by the night he stopped Angel Romero in
Miramar with a blinding flurry of punches in the second round on
May 10, 1990, Felix Trinidad's fate was sealed.
</P>
<P>
   For good or ill, he was a fighter.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   When Trinidad returned to Puerto Rico after defending his title
against Pernell Whitaker in February, he was a conquering hero.
Although Whitaker had grown old since the night De La Hoya whipped
him two years earlier, he was still the great Whitaker to the
people of Puerto Rico, and their man had beaten him easily, as he
had so many before.
</P>
<P>
   He had not knocked out Whitaker, but he had beaten him soundly
and set the stage for the showdown that will define the career not
only of Trinidad but also of De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   It is their moment, a moment being talked about as the greatest
welterweight confrontation since Sugar Ray Leonard faced Thomas
Hearns 20 years ago. Perhaps it will be, but on this day Felix
Trinidad is far from the confrontation to come.
</P>
<P>
   He is sitting in a beautifully appointed villa overlooking the
ocean at the Wyndham El Conquistador Resort &AMP; Country Club in
Fajardo, a beachfront town an hour from San Juan. It is here that
he and his father came to prepare for De La Hoya. Here where he is
surrounded not with the poverty that spawns most fighters but by
the wretched excess they dream of.
</P>
<P>
   Up the side of a mountain climbs a cable car that takes hotel
guests from their rooms to a pool and the ocean below. In front of
him is a private marina, where a boat owned by the hotel will take
you to a private island owned by the hotel where sun worshippers
can bathe nude.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from Cupey Alto, not in miles but in life's realities.
Few of Trinidad's neighbors ever come to a place like this unless
it is to go to work. In a sense, that is why he is here, too.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad's father cut a deal with the Wyndham Hotels &AMP; Resorts
people that had his son train at several of their properties before
landing here. Always the workouts were private, but the people
would line up 100 yards away after he was done to have a picture
taken or get an autograph from an athlete many on the island
compare to Puerto Rico's greatest athletic legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone puts my son next to Roberto Clemente, that is a
great honor,'' Don Felix says. ``He was one of the best
representatives of Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   With that honor comes the pressure to fulfill it, however. Few
people here even consider the possibility that Trinidad might
return home without De La Hoya's WBC belt, so he fights not merely
for himself and his father's dream but for all Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   This Trinidad understands, promising at a large press gathering
in Fajardo that he will dispense with De La Hoya in six rounds.
That no one else has come close to doing that in De La Hoya's 31
straight victories means little to him because this fight is
against the hero of an island and the savior of a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think Oscar has a chance with Tito?'' asks Gilberto Luna
after spending a day taking people to the gym where Trinidad
usually trains in Bayamon _ a gym that is named after the great
champion Wilfredo Gomez. ``Forget about it. There will be a big
party here when he comes home. It will last a week.''
</P>
<P>
   That belief is everywhere, even in the minds of the father and
the son. As the latter stands in front of his villa on the evening
when he is scheduled to head to Las Vegas, he looks at the brown
heavy bag hanging by a chain 15 yards from the ocean and laughs at
De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   On it is painted white letters, and in the middle is a large
white shape. As you get closer, it is clear what the shape is.
</P>
<P>
   It is a chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Above it is written Oscar ``Chicken'' De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   On the dusty back window of the van Trinidad is about to get
into, someone has scribbled, ``Chicken De La Hoya.''
</P>
<P>
   The nickname, coined by a New York sportswriter with an ax to
grind with De La Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, is everywhere around
Trinidad. Few believe it, though. Maybe even Trinidad doesn't. But
it has become fuel for the flame that began in Cupey Alto 26 years
ago and drove a young boy to become a champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how they call him the last few months,'' Trinidad says
when asked if he truly believes his opponent is afraid. ``At one
time he acted like a chicken. He didn't want this fight. We'll see
how he acts Sept. 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad says this through a translator, even though he has
studied English for a year and understands far more than he lets
on. He is wary of people he believes are in De La Hoya's corner but
is safe in the belief that his people are all behind him.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a burden to carry, he says, but one to be joyous
about. When Sept. 18 comes, he will carry that burden with the
strength of his people behind him, and he will prove that his
critics and even his promoter were wrong about him. He will show
then that his father was right about the rough diamond he sent
Carmen Carratini 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of my career, (promoter) Don King didn't
recognize my worth,'' the fighter says. ``Don King never got me the
recognition I deserved worldwide, like De La Hoya got. That is the
luck of promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping back then to sign autographs for a half-dozen hotel
workers who have politely waited for more than a half-hour and then
to have his picture taken, another Tito Trinidad reveals himself
for just a moment.
</P>
<P>
   He is in a fighting pose now, throwing phony punches for a
photographer, when he suddenly unleashes a blinding barrage. His
hands move, but you can barely see them. They come like a hard
rain. Then he looks at a reporter and throws one last flurry,
saying with an assassin's grin on his face, ``No mas, Golden Boy!''
</P>
<P>
   It is then you see he is like Cupey Alto. He fools you at first
with his soft voice and shy smile, but he comes from a place where
school guards wear bulletproof vests. A place where fighters grow.

   GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. _ Lila Berle and her crew of two _ a
teenage boy who has been trimming brush from fences and a man who
is the only full-time employee on the sheep farm _ have just picked
up lunch from the North Egremont post office and deli.
Uncharacteristically (it takes too much time), Berle suggests
driving up to the top of a hill and picnicking under a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Below, the scene can take your breath away. In the midday sun,
sheep are napping under the shade of trees. The tractors are lined
up, their hoods just poking out of a barn. There isn't a thing out
of place. Berle likes order, and she's been working on it since she
bought the rundown, bankrupt farm nine years ago. Some trees were
removed and some planted. A silo came down. One barn was renovated
and another is in process. And all the ugly old repairs, like
aluminum sheeting on one side of a corral, have been pulled off.
</P>
<P>
   Berle, who hardly ever sits still, seems almost peaceful. And
then she spots something below and the calm is gone. She grabs a
shovel out of the back of her SUV, heads down the hill, and starts
digging. She returns with a weedy-looking burdock plant and tosses
it into the bushes. ``These are a scourge,'' she says. ``I'm a bear
about these.'' Burdock, she explains, gets tangled in sheep's wool,
and she prides herself on ``beautiful, clean wool.''
</P>
<P>
   Lila Berle, 62, was born to farming. She and her family own vast
tracts of protected land in the Berkshires, though none where sheep
graze. People out here say that her family's land is some of the
most beautiful acreage in the state. But when Berle saw this
defunct dairy farm, overgrown and badly in need of a cash infusion,
she decided to buy it, fix it up, raise sheep, and bale her own
hay. She named it Stonehedge. Five hundred Rambouillet (some
crossed with Romneys and Border Leicester) graze on 300 acres. The
lamb goes to New York to specialty butchers; the wool is sold to
one of the fussiest wool shops in the region. Berle works from 7
a.m. until sundown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will not find any person who knows sheep like she does,''
says George Wislocki, president of the Berkshire Natural Resource
Council in Pittsfield. ``If anyone can make money at sheep farming,
it would be Lila.''
</P>
<P>
   Add a level of energy not often found in women half her age.
Once lunch is over, Berle seems antsy. She has taken too much time.
She hops on a tractor and goes whipping around her fields for an
hour and a half, leaving 24 round bales of fresh hay in her wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a ball,'' she says. ``I love the land and I love
the animals. I'm extremely passionate about it. There's something
rhythmic about farming. In the summer, haying and dealing with
lambs, crops to keep, mothers to feed. You learn a lot about life
and death _ about patience. You never know what the challenge will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Old friends like what they see. ``Lila came into her own,'' says
Wislocki, who has known her some 30 years. ``She knows who she is,
and she's very pleased to be that person.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheep farm suits her, says Laurie Norton Moffatt, director
of the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge. ``She lives it, she
breathes it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moffatt says that Berle hays the museum's 25 acres twice a year.
``Our visitors are absolutely enthralled. And they have no idea who
she is. She likes it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The lady on the tractor, it turns out, was a Rockwell board
member for 7 years and president for another 10 during its move to
new premises. Berle has been, over the years, deeply involved in
many aspects of the Berkshire community, its arts, its land, its
churches, and its schools.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep farm is different. It's all hers. She insists it isn't
physically taxing. Running Stonehedge takes time and a certain
passion. ``I want to inspire other women to do this,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Which she will.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Lila Wilde Berle bought her first four animals in 1984 when she
was raising meat for her own table. By the time she was 50, she had
quite a few, she says.
</P>
<P>
   She was raised at High Lawn Farm in Lenox, one of the largest
dairy farms in the area, known internationally for its Jersey cows.
Since both of Berle's parents, Colonel H. George and Marjorie Field
Wilde, died within the last few years, High Lawn is now managed for
the Wilde family heirs. Wilde won agriculture breeding awards for
his Jerseys. Berle's mother, granddaughter of William D. and Emily
Vanderbilt Sloane (the furniture merchant whose family owned W. &AMP;
J. Sloane) could simply look at a cow and see if something was
wrong, says Berle.
</P>
<P>
   After Smith College ('58), Lila Wilde married Peter A. A. Berle.
Peter Berle is former commissioner of environment for New York
State, headed the National Audubon Society for 10 years, and is now
host and creative director of the ``Environment Show'' on Northeast
Public Radio. He farms part time, raising Angus cows for beef. This
year, says his wife, ``he made 50 bales of hay.''
</P>
<P>
   But who's counting?
</P>
<P>
   The Berles raised four children, and the job brought Lila
immense satisfaction. ``It's the most rewarding thing I've ever
done,'' she says. ``I have seven grandchildren, who I just love, so
I'm very blessed.'' All are young, and when they visit, they play
with the sheep. One Berle daughter, Beatrice, went into farming;
she raises organic vegetables and goats for cheese in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a family who has always challenged itself,'' says
Wislocki, the Resource Council president. Lila Berle ``comes from
race horses. She knows she works hard, but that's what she believes
it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Wislocki says that the sheep farm is unusually efficient. By
frost, Berle will have collected 850 bales of fresh hay to feed the
animals, plus another 5,000 smaller rectangular bales of dried hay.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass.: ... dried hay.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The drought didn't affect her because it rained at the critical
moment. While others around lost crops, Berle says, ``this is the
best hay crop in years.'' So good that she'll hardly need grain for
the animals, which is what she's aiming for. Grass-fed lamb is
quite different from grain fed. Grass-fed is leaner, firmer, tender
but not fatty. Like sheep in some regions of France, Berle's nibble
wild thyme in the summer and watercress in the spring, but she
can't detect either perfume or pepper in the meat.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't use hormones, additives, or antibiotics, so she has
market possibilities all over the Berkshires. Instead, she sells
about 80 percent of the sheep to Greek and Lebanese specialty
markets in New York each spring. Spring lambs weigh about 40 to 50
pounds (regular weight is twice that). They go whole to market,
where they're often bought to spit-roast over a wood fire for the
Orthodox Easter celebration. The remaining sheep grow to full size,
and they go to auction or they're slaughtered and butchered into
standard cuts, which Berle sells from her freezer to private
customers.
</P>
<P>
   She delivers her wool to Green Mountain Spinnery in Putney, Vt.,
which is known for its top-quality wool. ``We refuse any wool that
has burdock, hay, or chaff,'' says the Spinnery's Donna Coughlin.
``You can't get a good price for wool unless it's clean.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lila Berle will rid her land of burdock if she has to pull
the plants out one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Which she does.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fresh round bales of hay Berle has made this afternoon are
wrapped in white plastic within hours of being cut. The giant white
drums, stored for winter at the edge of the fields, look, from a
distance, like mounds of melting snow. Closer, they have the
pleasant smell of a beer brewery.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh hay bales are more common in Europe than they are here.
``The sun hasn't taken the nutrients out,'' says Berle. Called
haylage, to distinguish them from silage (they don't require a
silo), these bales are simply fodder whose air has been pressed
out. Once wrapped in plastic for storage, the hay goes through a
slight fermentation process _ that's what causes the beer aroma _
that prevents it from spoiling.
</P>
<P>
   Berle collects grass for haylage in a German Deutz Fahr baler
hooked onto the back of her tractor. As she drives around, the drum
on the baler picks up the grass and packs it until nothing more
will fit. Berle stops the tractor and the machine continues to
work, first tying the bale, then releasing it onto the field. The
wet bales are picked up by Joel DeGaramo, who lives and works on
the farm. DeGaramo follows Berle with a wrapping machine attached
to his tractor, which lifts up a bale and tosses it around in the
back while a large roll of opaque white plastic winds around it,
forming three layers. It looks like a ball of yarn being rewound.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means I can put out a heck of a lot of grass without
barns,'' says Berle, who has poured money into shoring up
dilapidated barns.
</P>
<P>
   She brings a visitor around to one side of the long pen where a
couple of dozen wildly woolly sheep have stuck their noses into the
side of a bale of fresh hay. ``Look, it's so delicious. The lambs
love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Berle holds her hand out to one of the two Maremmas who guard
the sheep. These dogs, she explains, have been bred for centuries
in Italy to protect sheep from wolves.
</P>
<P>
   The others watch a flock in a pasture a mile away. Those dogs
won't let her near them, she says. ``But it's much better to have
them not friendly. They're working dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes at night DeGaramo hears the dogs barking and knows
they're at work. Coyotes are nearby, and there are other dangers.
``A lot of animals coexist here,'' says Berle. ``There are deer,
baby foxes, lots of rabbits this year. We love the deer, but they
eat my clover.''
</P>
<P>
   A fox with three pups got three of Berle's small sheep, and
Berle didn't do anything about stopping her. Pressed about it, she
admits that it's a weakness of being a woman _ and a mother. She
allowed the mother fox to get some food for her babies.
</P>
<P>
   Berle doesn't trot out this soft side very often, but her
mothering instincts are often called into play. She pulled a weak
lamb out of the flock and took two playmates with it, so the weak
one could become strong without feeling isolated. Weak lambs are
prey not only for coyotes but for the Maremma puppies as well,
explains Berle. ``The younger animals don't flock up,'' says Berle.
The young guard dogs don't want them around.
</P>
<P>
   Several grandchildren are arriving soon, and Berle has to leave.
Before she gets down from the tractor, she wants to empty the baler
into the upper field to feed the sheep some fresh hay. She calls
down and offers the visitor a ride. ``Plenty of room,'' she shouts.
</P>
<P>
   No, there's not. But Berle is burning to show off her view of
the world, which is worth the bumpy ride. ``It's so empowering.
When I first got on a tractor, I understood why men run them all
day. They're so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   She bumps along the road until the sheep are in view. ``You get
up here and you can do anything,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And she has.

THE PRIMARY PICTURE IN N.H.: CLOUDY AND STORMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican Party has never seen anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane George is flattening all that stands in its way,
eroding not only the beach heads tentatively held by Republican
rivals but dominating the Democrats' two-man field as well.
</P>
<P>
   The tidal surge of early New Hampshire polling puts Bush atop
Mount Washington and leaves the others sloshing around the lower
elevations. Hurricane George dictates the numbers on the Democratic
side as well, where New Hampshire Democrats have elevated diffident
insurgent Bill Bradley to within a whisker of matching Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to be with what looks like a winner is the simplest
explanation of a complex phenomenon. Bush keeps looking more like
one as Gore's sheen of invincibility rusts before our eyes. The
bulk of the GOP's constituencies at the national level are falling
over one another to declare why Bush is acceptable to them. Five
months out from New Hampshire's primary, 14 months away from the
election, the news media have crowned Bush as all but invincible.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, running only 4 points back of Gore in the Globe-WBZ
poll and 5 points back in the CNN-WMUR canvass, has struck gold
with white suburban males, of which New Hampshire has plenty. The
Gore folk glumly point out that Gore leads Bradley 4-1 among black
males nationally. But there are few black males in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the big AFL-CIO endorsement that is expected soon by
Gore will help in the later, larger industrial state primaries, but
does little for him in New Hampshire. And if it is true that a
national environmental outfit is going to break with Gore and come
out for Bradley, that puts a dent in the Tree-Huggers-for-Al
chariot.
</P>
<P>
   But before we nail the plywood over Gore's New Hampshire HQ,
let's take a longer-range look at his prospects. The satellite
photo is a lot friendlier to Gore, and a bit more ominous for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   --Of likely voters in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, only
19 percent of Democrats have a negative view of Gore. That
unfavorable figure pops up to 32 percent among independents, who
can vote in one or the other of the party primaries. But that
suggests that Gore's problem is not Gore per se but the Clinton
fatigue factor and some gamy aroma hanging around from Gore's
fund-raising exploits.
</P>
<P>
   --Pat Buchanan's flirtation with the third-party ploy helps Bush
in the short run but hurts the GOP in the end. A Buchanan-Ross
Perot cabal would drain more votes from the GOP than from the
Democrats, perhaps tipping key electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   --Bradley has to win somewhere, early, to justify his numbers
and sustain his fund-raising. ``Somewhere'' is now New Hampshire.
Gore can survive an opening-night loss there; Bradley cannot.
</P>
<P>
   --The landscape changes for Bush as well as Gore. The Manchester
Union Leader is cozying up to Steve Forbes. The paper's blowtorch
editorials helped Pat Buchanan win last time. But Pat is heading
for the exit to go third party. That makes the free-spending Forbes
leader of the conservative pack chasing Bush. With Buchanan and
Senator Bob Smith fleeing the GOP, that could make billionaire
Forbes a serious challenger _ enticing independents to vote in the
GOP contest. That would indirectly benefit Gore.
</P>
<P>
   --The Democrats' delegate selection formulas favor Gore.
So-called `superdelegates,' the clout of unions, and all the mayors
and governors who have supped at the White House trough for seven
years, will stick with Gore or risk losing White House access for
Year 8.
</P>
<P>
   --It is hard to construct a scenario whereby Bradley wins the
nomination short of a Gore meltdown, a failure of nerve, or a
disastrous debate. Gore has never lost a big-time debate. He may be
a stiff on the stump, but he's a killer in the clinches and TV
closeups. Bush has nowhere near the debate experience Gore has
mastered. Bradley is a lot better than Bush, off his Senate
training, but where does Bradley have time to catch Gore, no matter
who wins New Hampshire?
</P>
<P>
   --The front-loaded primary schedule, with big states crowding up
close to New Hampshire's wake, means that both races will likely be
over by St. Patrick's Day. This gives huge advantages to Bush and
Gore. And Gore's incumbency is a priceless factor.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's poll lead ``remains shaky . . . viewed in
his party as dependable but not exciting . . . (he) faces a
grueling endurance contest as he seeks to hold off growing threats
. . . unable to garner support from (the) rank and file . . . as he
becomes more outspoken, he runs the risk of stumbling into other
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   All these quotes are from The New York Times _ from 12 years ago
_ and they refer to then Vice President Bush, like Gore today, a
veep hampered by the image of being a coat-holding stick figure, a
pale imitation of the charismatic president who towered over him.
Bradley is going gangbusters in New Hampshire, but gangbusters
there may not be enough. A not unrealistic ticket? Gore-Bradley.
Just a thought.

relished only by omnivorous 12-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Gone from the restaurant are the bins where once Quarter
Pounders languished under heat lamps. Instead there are video
screens that track orders and high-tech toasters that can brown a
sesame-seed bun in 12 seconds, 43 seconds faster than a
conventional toaster.
</P>
<P>
   While customers at the drive-through window can verify an order
on a new video screen, most changes, aside from a new paint job,
may not be immediately visible.
</P>
<P>
   But what customers should experience is a better burger as
behind-the-scenes automation frees employees to lavish more care on
preparing food.
</P>
<P>
   Burgers used to be ``mass produced,'' says Selhi's boss, Bob
King, owner of six McDonald's franchises. Now meals are ``hot and
fresh and cooked the way a customer wants.''
</P>
<P>
   From the mid-1950s to the mid-1980s, McDonald's ruled fast food,
a category it virtually created. But now the 44-year-old
Illinois-based chain of more than 25,000 restaurants worldwide is
in the midst of a middle-age makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to defend their turf against intensifying competition
while adjusting to changing consumer tastes, McDonald's restaurants
are spending an average of $85,000 apiece on improvements designed
to result in a higher quality meal.
</P>
<P>
   Toasting buns in 12 seconds may not sound like a big deal, but
all the incremental fine-tunings add up to ``one of the most
significant change in McDonald's history,'' says Sid Boorstein,
owner of four McDonald's franchises.
</P>
<P>
   A drive down just about any main drag in America shows how much
tougher competition has gotten in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, there are the Golden Arch rivals, such as Burger
King and Wendy's. Together, the three chains operate about 25,000
hamburger stands in the United States, meaning market saturation
has the potential to slow growth.
</P>
<P>
   Competition also comes from new sources. With salad bars and
takeout meals, more and more supermarkets are trying to take a bite
out of America's fast-food dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And in New England, McDonald's franchisees face a unique
challenge with big breakfast competition here from Randolph,
Mass.-based Dunkin' Donuts. For many McDonald's franchisees in
other parts of the country, breakfast can be the most lucrative
meal.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case in Boston. But with the new cooking system,
McDonald's franchisees can be more aggressive at breakfast. Among
other things, the system can support a larger menu, including a
recently launched line of bagel sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   As competition has gotten tougher, consumer tastes have changed.
Some folks eschew fast food entirely for more healthful fare, and
diehard trenchermen have become even more demanding.
</P>
<P>
   No longer satisfied with just burgers and fries, fast-food fans
want better service, better quality, and more menu choices _ and
they want it right away.
</P>
<P>
   This desire for even faster fast food may explain why purchases
made at the drive-through window often account for 60 percent of
sales at many McDonald's restaurants, says Boorstein, who also
chairs a cooperative of franchise owners who operate 315
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's has always been fast. It's the quality that's been at
issue. Two years ago, McDonald's sought to dispel perceptions of
its mediocre food by introducing new computerized cooking systems
that mean each meal is ``made for you.''
</P>
<P>
   (With roughly 13,000 domestic restaurants, it took time for the
``made-to-you'' changes to be rolled out nationwide; the changes
are just about completed.)
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, a single cook prepared McDonald's burgers, then
kept them hot in a bin. If a cook overestimated the pace of
business, food had to be thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, burgers are crafted by a team of sous
chefs. Cooked meat is kept hot in a heating cabinet, but a sandwich
isn't assembled until an order is placed.
</P>
<P>
   For McDonald's, the new system reduces waste and improves profit
margins, franchisee King says. For the customer, the new system is
intended to yield an ``individualized'' sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want extra onions and no pickles?'' King says. ``The
system has the flexibility to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-food purists might detect similarities to Burger King's
flame-broiled credo of ``have it your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing ideas is nothing new in the fast-food business, says
Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc., a restaurant consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burger King does one thing, and McDonald's has to respond, and
vice versa,'' Paul says.
</P>
<P>
   The early read on the ``made-for-you'' program has been
positive. For its most recent quarter, McDonald's Corp. said
profits were up 45 percent largely because of increases in overseas
sales. But domestic cost-cutting was also a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Made-for-you'' has been a ``good success'' for US McDonald's
franchisees in other parts of the country, Paul says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a competitive necessity because the bar keeps
getting raised,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive pressures may be why Burger King Corp., the
Miami-based division of Diageo PLC, recently announced its own
makeover, which includes a new logo and a revamped kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new kitchen will take us well beyond the `have it your
way' concept,'' says Burger King spokeswoman Kim Miller.
</P>
<P>
   For McDonald's, talking about better Big Macs is one thing;
convincing adults that the quality has improved is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the cooperative of McDonald's franchisees has
increased its advertising budget to $18 million from $14 million.
Created by Boston ad agency Arnold Communications, the campaign for
the cooperative has the theme of ``You get more for your money
because McDonald's treats you right.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest ads in that campaign talk up ``outrageous values''
and ``every day deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoting 39-cent hamburgers on Wednesdays and 49-cent
cheeseburgers on Sundays, the ads look to drive traffic to the
restaurants so customers can experience the ``made-for-you''
changes for themselves. The hope is that customers will be
sufficiently pleased to make many return visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real breakthrough for us,'' says Boorstein, who
adds: ``If a customer hasn't been to a McDonald's lately, they
haven't been to a McDonald's.''

 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Madonna is not exactly complaining that Lucent
Technologies has made him, on paper at least, a near-billionaire by
offering to buy his small high-tech company for more than $1.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that a sense of mission _ not money _ is what
has propelled him and his colleagues at Excel Switching Corp., a
Hyannis, Mass. maker of versatile telecommunications equipment that
nine years ago numbered only a dozen people. Then, they worked over
an auto-body shop, trying to ignore paint fumes as they wrote
software.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna is the latest of several Massachusetts entrepreneurs who
have hit what some now call ``the Lucent jackpot'' _ when the
concept a little company has perfected proves so compelling a giant
eager to protect its dominance comes visiting with offers of
hundreds of millions of dollars in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Tuesday's closing price, Madonna stands to get $1.02
billion in Lucent stock when the Excel deal closes, perhaps before
year's end. Virtually all of his 460 employees own Excel stock as
well, and some stand to reap mini-fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   But Madonna is far more eager to talk about his corner of the
Internet world than he is about stock options. In a new age of
overnight Internet millionaires, Madonna stands as a comparatively
rare example of someone who did it, so to speak, the hard way.
Madonna has labored for more than a decade to build a company that
actually makes money ($27 million net income on $123 million sales
last year), rather than months pumping up a concept. Finally, Excel
became irresistible to New Jersey-baed Lucent, the world's biggest
telecommunications equipment manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who knows him knows he deserves this,'' said Matt
Trask, a software executive. ``He's the hardest working guy I know.
I think he's probably seen by a lot of people in the Cape (Cod)
high-tech community as something of a god now.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent Madonna is pleased with the Lucent deal _ a big
part of him and his family wishes they could all go back to
obscurity _ it is because he sees Lucent as a kind of platform to
reach the whole world with a radically new approach to building
devices for people and machines to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excel is very much on a mission of changing an industry,''
Madonna, 39, said as he took a break from a Boston meeting with
software writers who develop new uses for Excel's so-called
open-platform, programmable switches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often said we were dancing with the elephants out there,''
Madonna said of the challenge of competing with some of the world's
biggest and richest telecommunications equipment companies,
including Lucent, Northern Telecom, Siemens, Alcatel and Ericsson.
``Now we're harnessing one of the elephants and riding it.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the company has more than 200 customers in 70
countries. ``To get into the mainstream, we believe we could have
done it as stand-alone, but it would have taken longer,'' said
Madonna, adding that ``to have that red circle, the Lucent logo on
our products, can go a very long way'' in increasing market
credibility and attracting new customers. (It is undecided whether
the Excel name will continue to be used after the deal closes,
which could be as soon as December.)
</P>
<P>
   Excel is one of a half-dozen Massachusetts companies Lucent has
moved to buy over the past year as it tries to stay at the leading
edge of the dizzying world of Internet communication.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to some recent Lucent acquisitions, however, Excel is a
graybeard. In June Lucent made a $900 million bid for Nexabit, a
company with zero revenues but well-developed plans to sell 1
billion-bit-per-second data switches. Two years ago Lucent grabbed
high-speed switch maker Prominet of Marlborough, Mass. for $200
million just seven weeks after it shipped its first product and 20
months after its founding.
</P>
<P>
   Excel's impact on telecommunications can be compared to the
impact personal computers had on computing 15 years ago. Until
recently, companies buying telephone switches have had to buy the
equivalent of preprogrammed mainframe computers from giants like
Lucent and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   Excel builds smaller, flexible devices that, like personal
computers, can be programmed to perform a vast array of functions
or resold by companies such as Motorola and QualComm as part of
customized telecom packages.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its bid for Excel, Lucent officials said they are
convinced ``open platform'' switching is a wave of the future, a $5
billion market by 2003. Analysts contend Lucent feared it risked
becoming a doomed dinosaur like Digital Equipment or Data General
if it ignored the trend away from jumbo mainframe-like switches.
</P>
<P>
   By selling use-as-you-want switches, Excel has also spawned a
thriving business for programmers and companies like Priority Call
Management and Converse that use Excel products in advanced
voice-mail and other services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of the concept that the world is full of smart
people'' who will dream up new uses for telecommunications switches
that a giant company might be slow to realize, Madonna said. For
example, Excel's products are being used to develop systems that
allow people to use their wireless phone as an extension of their
home phone, or transmit text messages synthesized into speech.
</P>
<P>
   One other key advantage of Excel products is what is called
``scaleability.'' Instead of buying the electronic equivalent of a
hangar from Lucent, a start-up company offering local or
long-distance service or prepaid calling cards can buy a few sheds
_ and add more as business grows.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna, who grew up in what he describes as a ``blue-collar''
background in New Britain, Conn., graduated from the University of
Connecticut with a degree in biomedical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work for a Cambridge, Mass. company designing what
was in the early 1980s the world's largest CAT scan medical device,
but always felt that ``I wanted to work for a startup company.'' In
1984 he joined LanTel, a company in Orleans, Mass.with a dozen
employees developing office telephone switches.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the company moved to Marlborough, Mass., then went out
of business _ leaving Madonna at age 28 jobless, but ready to found
Excel. It started operations in early 1988 with a half-dozen people
in 500 square feet of space over an auto-body shop in Southborough,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the cheapest place I could find to rent,'' Madonna
said. ``It wasn't bad if they weren't painting cars while you were
trying to write software.'' The company's sales quickly reached
millions of dollars a year, helped by 1988 federal deregulation
moves allowing Baby Bells to sell voice mail and other premium
services.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna always wanted to get back to the Cape, and in 1990 found
space over a Chinese restaurant in Sagamore Beach. ``Instead of
smelling paint fumes, like we did in Southborough, we were smelling
egg rolls,'' said Madonna, who frequently slept at the office
during back-to-back seven-day workweeks.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, the company had grown to where it needed new
space in Hyannis for its now 400 employees, plus another 60 in
sales and development offices in New Hampshire, Orlando, Fla.,
Dallas, Tokyo, and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The company went public in November 1997, not because it needed
cash _ it had tens of millions in the bank _ but to raise its
public and Wall Street visibility given its location well off the
high-tech beaten path.
</P>
<P>
   Excel's manufacturing and development offices do not immediately
suggest a billion-dollar business. The nondescript Independence
Park site might as well be in a South Carolina industrial park as
on the Cape Cod of salty-air fame; Excel's neighbors on
Perseverance Way include Jeff Bacon Auto Service, Bourque Heating &AMP;
Cooling, an awning shop and a sand quarry.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucent deal has been greeted with pride by Madonna's
colleagues in the fledgling but fast-growing high-tech community,
who see the Lucent deal validating the image some promote of the
Cape as ``the Silicon Sandbar.''
</P>
<P>
   Trask, the president of Communica, a 50-person software firm
that also runs the CapeCod.com Web information site, said,
``There's a sense that Bob has once again shown us the way. He's
the poster boy for the region.''

HARCOURT GENERAL'S SMITH GOING OUT ON A LOW NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Smith, the tough-as-nails leader of Harcourt General
Inc. for three decades, will likely make his last public appearance
before shareholders as the company's chief executive this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 74, created a family fortune worth more than $800 million
and huge wealth for investors who bought into companies he has run
over many years. Harcourt General shares have outpaced the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500, sometimes by wild margins, over a long stretch
beginning in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who shares Smith's famously hard-nosed focus on stock
values would be unhappy with Newton, Mass.-based Harcourt General
and other related companies over the past three years. It's not the
blaze of glory every executive hopes to go out on.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how the stock market has boomed since September 1996, a
period in which the S&AMP;P 500 soared by 108 percent and the Nasdaq
stock index gained 145 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt General stock has actually gone down in value during
that same period, generating a total-return loss of 14.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One of Harcourt General's biggest assets, its 53.9 percent
interest in pricey retailer Neiman Marcus Group Inc., has fared
even worse. The publicly traded Neiman Marcus stock has slumped by
32 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of GCX Cos., the General Cinema movie theater and venture
capital business spun out of Harcourt General in 1993 but still run
by the Smiths, are down 10 percent in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Now Smith, who will continue as Harcourt General's chairman,
plans to step down as the company's chief executive in six weeks
and make way for, literally, the next generation. Smith's son,
Robert Smith, and his son-in-law, Brian Knez, will take over as
co-CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   At a special meeting Harcourt General asked shareholders to back
a plan that will yet again reshape the interests of a company that
has a history of changing businesses like a corporate chameleon
(remember the bottling business?).
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone approves.
</P>
<P>
   A proxy analysis firm that advises institutional investors has
recommended shareholders vote against a proposal that would
increase Harcourt General's pool of authorized shares. The reason:
The company's relative stock performance over the last three years
wasn't good enough to justify it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, they came very close,'' said Ed Seaton, an
analyst at Institutional Shareholder Services who recommended
voting against the proposal. ``You have to draw a line in the sand
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company has tied the authorization to a plan to spin off
its Neiman Marcus stake to Harcourt shareholders. No increased
stock authorization, no Neiman Marcus spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt General has painted the two tactics as part of a larger
strategy to make the company's stock a pure investment in the
publishing business. Once separated from any retailing interests,
Harcourt General wants to be able to issue more stock to fund
acquisitions or raise cash with the aim of building up its
publishing ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives believe Harcourt General stock is paying the
price for two recent cash acquisitions that have watered down
recent profits, paying $854 million for National Education Corp. in
1997 and $416 million last October for Moseby Inc., a professional
health science publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through a period where we've made two very
significant additions and indicated they would be dilutive to
earnings in the near term,'' said spokesman Peter Farwell. ``I
think we've paid the price for it in the stock market. But we're
convinced it was the right thing to do for the company in the long
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus is another problem. The stock has been nothing
special for a long while now and recent sales numbers have been a
big disappointment. Our question: If you can't sell really
expensive stuff to rich people in this economy, when exactly can
you make it happen?
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, we just got our hands on the Neiman Marcus
Christmas catalog the other day. Among the highlights: a song
written and performed for you by tuxedoed bandleader Peter Duchin
($35,000); a 181-carat diamond necklace ($450,000); and a Boeing
business jet ($35,250,000). There's a save-the-rainforest option
($35 per acre) for anyone feeling too guilty.
</P>
<P>
   GCX Cos., though no longer a part of Harcourt General, is a
publicly traded company with many of the same old shareholders.
After the Smiths, mutual fund manager Mario Gabelli is the biggest
investor, owning nearly 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The problem at GCX: Revenues from its movie business have been
stagnant or even declining despite international expansion. Its
unusual business model, investing the cash in venture capital
deals, is interesting but unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   One investment in its stable, Internet retailer
Mothernature.com, is in registration to go public and could be a
big hit.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, Harcourt's plan to focus on publishing and its
new generation of Smiths are what shareholders are counting on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has a chief economist. So does BankBoston. And when the
two banks finally merge, there will be room for only one chief
economist.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Fleet announced the job would go to Wayne Ayers, who
currently holds the position at BankBoston. Nicholas Perna of Fleet
will leave to write and teach.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers, 52, has been with BankBoston for 21 years, nearly 10 as
chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a bigger challenge,'' said Ayers, who will now be
responsible for tracking the economies of New York and New Jersey
as well as New England.
</P>
<P>
   Perna said he took himself out of the running for the top job
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I have been thinking about for some time,''
he said. Perna said he has no specific plans but envisages writing
articles and possibly books about economic subjects.
</P>
<P>
   A likable fellow with a rare ability to translate economics into
simple English, Perna will be missed, especially by journalists
scrambling to make sense of difficult economic stories on deadline.

 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEPPERELL, Mass. _ From where Carl Hills is standing, on his
120-acre farm here, he's at the edge of an acre-and-a-half field of
tomatoes with fruit-heavy rows of apple trees behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take them out this winter,'' says Hills.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the tomatoes, but the apple trees.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, he says, the tomato field will be rotated into corn
next spring, but the apple trees will just be ``pushed over'' and
hauled away _ and the land where they are now probably put into
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not on some Long Island truck farm where this is to
happen, but an old New England apple orchard, which the Hills
family took over from the Kimball brothers (keeping the name,
Kimball's Fruit Farm) a generation ago. It sits high on a ridge of
apple country land that straddles the Massachusetts-New Hampshire
border, with a clear view northwest to the Monadnock Range.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not your big, red, juicy hybrid tomatoes, Big Boy,
Beefsteak, and the rest. What Hills will be tearing out his apple
trees for are ``heirlooms,'' old tomato varieties with distinctive
tastes and exotic names like Black Prince and Green Zebra, Mortgage
Lifter, and Arkansas Traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Hauled into town, 300 to 400 pounds' worth at a time, the
heirlooms fetch $1.60 a pound at the nine farmers' markets in and
around Boston that Hills or his wife, Marie, or his two sisters,
Wendy and Sheri, have staffed every week this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the 10-pound boxes that Hills delivers in the early
mornings to wholesale ``commission men'' for $15 end up going for
$25 a box to pricey restaurants in the city.
</P>
<P>
   And those prices, Hills says, ``aren't holding people back.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-sellers by far are the Green Zebras, a three-ounce
fruit that ripens to an amber-green with darker green stripes,
which the seed catalogs describe as ``sweet yet zingy.'' ``I can't
grow enough of them,'' Hills says.
</P>
<P>
   Other good sellers _ and attention-getters _ are the Black
Prince, originally grown in Siberia; the Brandywine, a large
reddish fruit originally developed by Amish farmers; and the Yellow
Peach, whose fuzzy skin somewhat resembles that of a peach.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening on Hills's farm is part of a growing national
trend, according to Jaime Gooch, managing editor of American
Vegetable Grower, where heirloom tomatoes were the cover story in
the August issue.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend triggered, Gooch says in a telephone interview from
Willoughby, Ohio, ``by the consolidation of the food industry.''
With supermarket mergers, Gooch says, ``it's becoming harder for
the smaller growers to get their produce into the supermarkets, so
they're focusing on niche markets.''
</P>
<P>
   And in that general niche-market trend, Gooch says, ``heirlooms
are a big thing, because a lot of consumers aren't happy with what
they're finding on supermarket shelves'' _ the tomatoes picked
green in California and Florida ``and blasted with ethylene gas to
ripen them.''
</P>
<P>
   And once shoppers see a colorful array of heirloom tomatoes,
Gooch says, ``they go nuts for them.''

   Carl Hills's father, Harold, who is now 79, took over the farm
from the Kimball brothers when Carl was a teenager. Tacked up now
on the wall inside the farmstand, out on Route 122 just before
Pepperell turns into Hollis, N. H., is a faded snapshot of a
half-dozen long-haired teenagers, shirtless and smiling broadly
into the sun. Carl Hills, now 43, is in the middle, and they were
the farm crew one summer back in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   What Hills remembers from those summers is how the crew
manhandled as many as 600 bushel boxes of apples every day during
the height of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the crew is five young men from Jamaica who live in a
dormitory up over the farmstand. On a good dark-to-dark day, three
or four times a week, they will pick up to 1,500 pounds of
heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   Hills did two years at the University of Connecticut's
agriculture school and came back to work the farm _ as an apple and
fruit farm _ for his father.
</P>
<P>
   But when he took over the farm on his own nine years ago, Hills
says, ``I told my dad, no way I'm going to take over the farm on
that basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was he thinking that there might be something else, but
it was increasingly apparent that there wasn't much of a future in
apples.
</P>
<P>
   Already there was competition from the year-round season in
Washington State and a looming threat from China, which is now
dumping apple juice concentrate on the American market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Hills says, ``we have to beg wholesalers to take our
apples,'' especially in a bumper-crop year like this one, when the
trees are so laden with fruit that ``if we'd had a wet summer, we'd
have a lot of broken limbs.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was after the Hillses started going to farmers' markets
that he discovered the niche market of heirloom tomatoes, along
with a market for new and unusual varieties of apples like Ginger
Gold and Elstar, which Hills is planting now _ and won't be tearing
out this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We listened to what people were asking for,'' Hills says, and
looked at what other farmers were selling.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hillses, particularly Carl's wife, Marie, work hard to
promote their niche product at the farmers' markets. At the markets
Marie Hills staffs, like Sunday's at the Charles Hotel in Harvard
Square, she'll eagerly explain the particular qualities of the
various varieties and perhaps hand a sample to a wavering customer.
</P>
<P>
   If the journey from traditional apples to heirloom tomatoes
rightly begins in the field _ the field next to the rows of apple
trees that will come out this winter _ it properly ends at the old
apple-packing house behind Hills's farm stand.
</P>
<P>
   Hills remembers coming in there as a child with his mother, when
she used to bake doughnuts to sell to the dozens of local women who
sorted and packed apples in the late fall chill.
</P>
<P>
   The only reminder of those days is the plugged-up opening for
the old wooden stove, which never warmed the room enough to let the
women take their coats off.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are large wooden pallets on the floor on which are
laid out, by color and variety, the previous day's heirloom
picking.
</P>
<P>
   And they're laid out that way, Hills explains, so that in the
late afternoon on days before he'll be heading into Boston, ``I can
make up real eye-catching boxes'' _ those 10-pound open-faced boxes
of heirlooms, destined to catch the eyes of restaurant chefs.

ORTHODOX CHURCH BARS PAPAL VISIT TO GREECE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a sign of ecumenical tension, leaders of the Greek Orthodox
Church last week ruled out a pilgrimage to Greece by Pope John Paul
II until the Roman Catholic pontiff apologizes and offers penance
for centuries of antagonism between Orthodox and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope can come to Greece as a head of state but not as a
religious leader,'' Metropolitan Kallinkos, spokesman for the Holy
Synod of the Greek Orthodox Church, said after a meeting of church
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope cannot visit Greece as the head of the Catholic
Church before asking forgiveness and doing penance for the
interventions by the church in the Orthodox world from the epoch of
the crusades until today,'' Kallinkos said.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, in a letter published in June, expressed his desire
to visit Greece as part of trips to biblical sites in various
nations to mark the start of the third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, the pontiff sought to recall the New Testament
account of St. Paul's sermon on the Areopagus that symbolizes the
whole of humanity's encounter with the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Greek Orthodox leaders rejected the pope's idea of a visit as
soon as the letter was published and formalized their opposition
last week. But the Vatican and the Greek government are striving to
avoid a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Edward Cassidy, president of the Pontifical Council for
Promoting Christian Unity, who was in Greece last week to attend a
religious symposium, said John Paul had not yet asked to visit
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope does not desire to come to Greece soon,'' Cassidy
said. ``It is a desire for the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said John Paul ``will be
welcome in Greece like every head of state,'' but added that he did
not want to interfere in ecclesiastical matters.
</P>
<P>
   But the Roman Catholic archbishop of Athens said the controversy
has hurt ecumenical efforts. ``The criticisms of a visit by the
pope have set back dialogue between Catholics and Orthodox by 10
years,'' said Archbishop Nikos Foscolo.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in the Greek Orthodox Church said they want John Paul to
apologize for the schism of 1050 that divided the Orthodox and
Roman churches; the Crusades, which led to the conquest and sacking
of Constantinople in 1204; and the Council of Lyons in 1274, which
unsuccessfully attempted to unite the Greek and Roman churches.

   --``See You at the Pole,'' the annual event in which young
people gather to pray for their schools, has been expanded this
year to include activities by adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``See You at the Pole'' will be held Sept. 15. Millions of
students are expected to pray at their schools at 7 a.m. local
time. While the event is aimed at public school students, others
can participate.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., have
heightened interest in the event this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there's more of a need felt by people in the
church to pray for our schools, to pray for our children,'' said
Doug Clark, director of field ministries for the National Network
of Youth Ministries, a San Diego-based organization that has helped
coordinate ``See You at the Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   This year adults will be involved, the Sunday before the event,
with a ``Challenge 2000 Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's setting aside services on the weekend before `See You at
the Pole' to pray for students and teachers to represent God
faithfully on the campus throughout the year,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   --Greek Orthodox churches across the country took up a special
collection at liturgies to help victims of Tuesday's earthquake in
Greece that killed dozens of people and left thousands homeless.
``I appeal to you now as beloved spiritual children: please lift up
your voices in prayer and open your hearts in love at this time for
our brothers and sisters in Athens in their hour of need,'' Bishop
George of New Jersey, archiepiscopal vicar for the Greek Orthodox
Archdiocese of America, wrote in a letter to the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   --Religious leaders of various faiths will be part of a
delegation of about 80 Massachusetts immigrants who will travel to
Washington on Friday to lobby Congress to support bills to soften
the effects of 1996 legislation that curtailed government benefits
for immigrants. The delegation is organized by the Massachusetts
Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   --The Women's Ordination Conference, a progressive Roman
Catholic group based in Fairfax, Va., has released a national study
focusing on women who feel called to the priesthood. The Vatican
has said repeatedly that the priesthood is closed to women because
Jesus chose only men as his apostles. But Rome's stance has angered
many liberal Catholics, particularly in Western Europe and the
United States, who believe the church's position is unfair.

TROTTING OUT OLD STEREOTYPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just before the US Open final between Martina Hingis and Serena
Williams, CBS's John McEnroe said: ``The Williams sisters are so
(itals)physically gifted(unitals). I mean particularly Serena, who
is just absolutely incredible to me. I mean I never, ever seen a
17-year-old girl, to be honest, I've rarely seen a 17-year-old guy
on the tennis circuit who looks as (itals)strong(unitals) as she
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's a very imposing task for Hingis. And what she
(Hingis) has done is (itals)worked hard and get herself(unitals)
stronger physically. She's incredible in the sense that she's a
step or two ahead of almost other human beings on the tennis court.
She sees things that most people don't, that virtually no one sees.
She's like a (itals)chessmaster(unitals) out there. She's a step or
two in front of what you're (itals)thinking(unitals) she's going to
come up with. She comes up with angles that are almost
unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe's colleague, Mary Carillo, added that Hingis, ``had to
get physically fitter because, she's so bright as John's been
saying, but you (itals)can't coach(unitals) someone to be four
inches taller.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the stage was set, not just just between Williams and
Hingis, two young stars, but also for whether this would be another
disgusting display of racist stereotyping. It seemed that listeners
were doomed to hear that Williams was an uncoachable, born Amazon
while Hingis was the physically deficient but bright and
hard-working chessmaster.
</P>
<P>
   An hour and a half later, Serena Williams not only won the
championship, but respect for her hard work and brains.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the seventh seed in the tournament, defeated the
top-seeded and world's top-ranked woman, Hingis, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
Williams said afterward, ``I was really mentally tough out there. I
wouldn't give in to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's deft placement of deep shots to the corners, and
crosscourt winners made believers out of the broadcasters. It is
important to note that her tough mind was not developed at preteen,
white-run tennis camps and the lonely, myopic junior circuit
littered with burnouts. It was developed at home by parents Richard
and Oracene, who kept Serena and her sister Venus away from the
pressure cooker until their mid-teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought I was a fool,'' Richard Williams said. ``But I
wanted them to get their education and know their history. Those
girls believe in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the match started, McEnroe, Carillo, and Bill Macatee began
believing that Serena Williams was more than just shoulders to die
for. Early in the first set, she hit the ball so well that McEnroe,
Carillo and Bill Macatee started talking about how ``confident''
she looked.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the first set, they began talking about her
``maturity.'' Noting how Williams had frozen Hingis with several
aces with a strategic placing of serves, Carillo said, Williams
``goes for for the 115s (115 mile-per-hour serves) largely down the
middle of the court where the net's 6 inches lower. Smart.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe said Williams played ``very intelligently, so far.''
This was a more conditional credit for intelligence, which hardly
compares to Hingis being called ``bright'' as a permanent state.
But at least McEnroe displayed a learning curve about Williams even
as he said Williams was ``learning quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   In a tense second set, the broadcasters were remarkable for
comments that did not distinguish between the two players. When
Williams played well, she ``hustled'' was ``very smart'' and had
``great technique.'' If she played poorly, she had ``lots of
nerves'' or was ``feeling the pressure.'' If Hingis played well,
she was ``very, very smart,'' ``dug deep'' or was ``plugging
away.'' If Hingis played poorly, she was ``not in charge,'' ``not
imposing herself'' or ``stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracene Williams said ``In tennis, you have to have a head.
Anything mental will get to you.'' As Serena Williams went up 3-1
in the tie-breaker, McEnroe recognized for a last and critical time
that Williams indeed had a head. ``It appears Serena has weathered
the storm (itals)mentally(unitals). She's positive again. She's
(itals)forgotten(unitals) about it (an earlier, blown chance to win
the match).
</P>
<P>
   As Williams held the title trophy, she never received the
permanent attributes of intelligence that Hingis received. Nor was
Hingis ever described as ``physically gifted,'' even though it
should be obvious that the world's top player has to have
world-class reflexes. The broadcasters never mentioned, as did a
New York Times editorial, that Hingis, just like the Williams
sisters, hits her ground strokes with ``incredible power.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the match's end, Williams was no longer merely a born,
bronze Amazon. She was smart, hustled, displayed great technique,
and was a mental fighter. Given how sports broadcasters have in the
past degraded black athletes by praising only their physical gifts,
this was a pleasant advance. McEnroe, Carillo, and Macatee lost the
first part of their broadcast on stereotypes. But they rallied to a
second-set tiebreaker. Time will tell if they can win the second
set, weathering the storm of racist assumptions to tell us that
Serena Williams, like Hingis, is ``bright.''

JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL: COUNTER PUNCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ This has been a breakthrough year for Jose
Maria Olazabal, but he knows it could have been much better if he
hadn't carried the concept to such literal extremes.
</P>
<P>
   In April, he put the capstone on one of the most remarkable
comebacks in the history of sports _ never mind just golf _ when he
captured his second Masters title, his first since it appeared he
might never walk again.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, Olazabal made himself eligible for yet another
comeback when he celebrated a first-round 75 in the US Open at
Pinehurst by smashing a wall in his hotel room and fracturing his
right hand. He missed the cut in the first four tournaments he
played after his latest convalescence _ the British Open, the Dutch
Open, the Buick Open, and the PGA Championship _ and he qualified
for his sixth European Ryder Cup berth largely on the strength of
April's storybook performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ever candid, Olazabal readily acknowledges that embarrassment
must share the centerfold with exhilaration in his 1999 yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great in the sense that I won a major event,'' he
says. ``But if you take that away, the second half of the year,
I've really struggled. I made a stupid mistake, and I've paid the
price for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Olazabal believes he is fully recovered (``the doctor said
it would take 6-8 weeks''), and he's optimistic again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some good tournaments left where I can
hopefully do better,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The big one is the Ryder Cup. At 33, Olazabal will be one of a
handful of veterans upon whom captain Mark James will rely against
the United States Sept. 24-26 at The Country Club in Brookline. So
as reckless and ridiculous as his latest ordeal may have been, it's
a snap compared with what he endured before _ and thought he might
have to endure for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat like this year, 1994 was an out-of-control elevator
ride for Olazabal. That April, he reached his career zenith when he
held off Tom Lehman down the stretch to win the Masters. While the
route to that grail wasn't as inspiring as this one, it was close
in implausibility.
</P>
<P>
   The son and grandson of greenskeepers, Olazabal had grown up
along the San Sebastien golf course in Fuenterrabia, Spain, where
he still lives. Despite his proximity to a 7,000-yard classroom,
Olazabal could find only one tutor. Himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, golf was not very popular in Spain,'' he says.
``The members only came on weekends. The rest of the time, I had
the whole course to myself. I learned the game on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   It took him a while to get started. He was all of 2 years old
when he first picked up a club, and at the advanced age of 5, he
made a major adjustment in his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played lefthanded when I began,'' he says. ``Then I switched
to righthanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise move. Olazabal developed into a junior prodigy, turned pro
at 19, and the following year, became a mainstay on the European
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   His game and fame went international with his Augusta triumph,
but before 1994 was done, he began experiencing something that can
be rather inconvenient for a golfer. He had trouble walking the
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw different doctors,'' he says. ``The situation got worse
and worse. I got a Ryder invitation in 1995, but I turned it down
because I wasn't physically fit.''
</P>
<P>
   That qualified as peak condition compared with the following
year, when Olazabal missed the entire season and golf became a
distant second priority to mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reached the point where I couldn't walk at all,'' he says.
``I figured that I was done, that I'd never have a chance to play
again.''
</P>
<P>
   He would have been happy for a chance to get out of bed again
when he finally consulted a Munich physician, Hans-Wilhelm
Muller-Wohlfahrt, who diagnosed the problem: rheumatoid
polyarthritis in both feet.
</P>
<P>
   It was debilitating but not incurable. Olazabal began working
with Muller-Wohlfahrt in September 1996, and by the following
February, he was back walking 18 holes a day for pay, in the Dubai
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still wasn't 100 percent,'' he says, ``but it was a start.''
</P>
<P>
   The culmination came this past April, and even his
self-inflicted setback can't tarnish his green jacket. He has
always placed intense emphasis on the Ryder Cup, and he helped
Europe retain it two years ago, but he can't help having a slightly
different perspective on the Brookline matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very sad if we lost,'' he says. ``But for me,
winning the Masters again was a major achievement. Nothing can top
that.''
</P>
<P>
   If he wins a third, at least he probably won't have to worry
about an excruciating aftermath. He's just about run out of
extremities to hurt.

CHINESE ARCHAEOLOGY EXHIBIT TO DISPLAY SOME 200 OBJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A replica set of 65 ancient bells will ring Sept.
19 when a new exhibition of more than 200 archaeological treasures
from China opens at the National Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Golden Age of Chinese Archaeology'' is billed as a sequel
to the spectacular exhibition of Chinese archaeological discoveries
at the gallery 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That show resulted from the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the United States and China; the current
exhibition comes as signs from both nations point to a relaxation
of recent tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, sponsored by the Eastman Kodak Co., will be at
the Gallery until Jan. 2. It will then be moved to the Museum of
Fine Arts in Houston for display from Feb. 13 through May 7, 2000,
and to The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco from June 17 through
Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The objects exhibited include 165 discovered since 1973 in tombs
and buried troves, selected by the guest curator for the
exhibition, Dr. Xiaoneng Yang of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in
Kansas City, in cooperation with Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the exhibited objects _ which have never been
shown outside of China _ illustrate the achievements of Chinese
culture from 5000 B.C. to the tenth century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   They have demonstrated to scholars that Chinese civilization
advanced through a gradual blending of regional cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The works exhibited here represent great achievements in
Chinese archaeology,'' said Earl A. Powell III, National Gallery
director. ``The study of these works has made possible the
reconstruction in far greater detail than ever before the cultural
meaning of ancient works of art in their own time.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is arranged in historical sequence and includes
sculpture, ritual objects, furniture, coffins, textiles and
decorative objects made of clay, jade, stone, bamboo, ivory,
lacquer, gold, silver, bronze, glass and silk.
</P>
<P>
   Pictographs on two of the earliest ceramics are believed to be
forerunners of later Chinese writing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more striking objects include sinister masks and a
standing figure from the 1300-1100 B.C. period, jade burial suits,
and six life-sized warriors from the 7,000-strong terra-cotta army
discovered in 1974 in the third century B.C. tomb of the ``first
emperor,'' Qin Shi Hwangdi.
</P>
<P>
   A strange, cranelike figure with deer antlers is one of a number
of prominent items from the fifth century B.C. tomb of the Marquis
Yi of Zeng, a small state south of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze bells that will formally open the exhibit are
replicas of a set found in his tomb. Twelve Chinese musicians will
play traditional music on them and on other instruments from that
period in performances on Sept. 17 and 18, as well as at the
opening.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery's East Building is at Fourth Street and
Constitution Avenue in downtown Washington. It is open Monday
through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on Sundays from 11 a.m.
to 6 p.m. Admission is free.

SUSAN BUTCHER: WIFE, MOTHER _ SLED-DOG RACER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever a woman paid homage to her passion and purpose, musher
Susan Butcher did it when she named her newborn daughter after a
favorite dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned everything together,'' said Butcher of Tekla, the
beloved husky who was one of the first dogs she lovingly acquired
after arriving in Alaska in 1975 and going on to become a four-time
winner of the grueling 1,049-mile Iditarod dogsled race.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Butcher is learning everything anew with her
preschool daughter Margaretha Tekla, a lively 4-year-old known by
her middle name who is taking lessons in beadwork from an
Athabascan Indian and thinks everyone in the world has 100 dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is definitely living the childhood I wish I would have
lived,'' said Butcher, now 44, in a telephone interview from
Fairbanks, ``but I am absolutely positive she is not going to be a
dog musher. I'm expecting her to be as different from me as I am
different from my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Butcher was raised in Cambridge, Mass., attending
Buckingham Browne &AMP; Nichols School and knowing her way around
Harvard Square, it was always the country that sang to her heart
and animals that touched her soul. (As a first grader she wrote an
essay highlighted by the unambiguous phrase ``I hate the city.'')
First it was summers in Maine, where she could run with her
mixed-breed dog, Cabee; later, doing carpentry and farm work in
Nova Scotia; then on to a brief stint of veterinarian studies at
Colorado State University and finally, perhaps inevitably, on to
wide-open Alaska, where she has been living in spartan simplicity
for 25 years. No lines at the supermarket, no wailing sirens on
city streets, and if she's stuck behind two or three cars at a
stoplight in Fairbanks ``it's like, oh man, the traffic is heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those 25 years have been spent in Eureka, which is not
really a town but more like a few cabins near a river of the same
name about 150 road miles northeast of Fairbanks. In 1985, Butcher
married David Monson, a fellow dog sledder; they, along with Tekla,
still live there much of the year in a one-room, 15-by-19-square
foot cabin with no running water or electricity, eating their meals
in a separate cabin nearby because it's so small.
</P>
<P>
   In what is partly a concession to their daughter's needs, Monson
and Butcher recently built a house in Fairbanks _ complete with
kitchen, to Tekla's amazement _ in which they plan to live about
half the year when Tekla reaches school age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the schooling I'm worried about, it's the
socialization,'' said Butcher, pointing out there are ``zero
children'' in Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few other changes since Tekla was born, too.
Butcher, who competed in her first brutal Anchorage-to-Nome
Iditarod in 1978, set a record in 1990 when she finished in 11
days, 1 hour, 53 minutes and 23 seconds. In between, she became the
only person to win three years in a row with victories in 1986,
1987 and 1988; altogether she finished 15 times in the top 10. She
last attempted the race in 1994, the year before Tekla was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a good mother and be a good Iditarod racer at the
same time, not to a young child,'' she stated flatly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Butcher's legendary devotion to her dogs, and the
energy and single-mindedness it took to train them, 14 to 16 hours
a day, seven days a week, to run 1000-plus miles through the brutal
Alaskan wilderness, is not unlike that of a mother preparing her
child for the rigors of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just with the dogs 24 hours a day; the relationship you
have with them is just so intense,'' said Butcher of her Iditarod
years. ``To anybody's vision, looking at what I do now with the
dogs would say it's very intense, but I know the difference. Now
it's a job, concentrating training into eight hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Iditarod aside, Butcher has not disappeared from competitive
mushing. She still races at least 10 times a year in events from 10
to 500 miles (``shorter stuff,'' she calls it), and still raises
dogs at their Trail Breaker Kennels. And when Tekla is a little
older, Butcher plans to once again hit the trail that made her
famous; the trail on which a moose in 1985 attacked her team,
killing two of her dogs and knocking her out of the race; the trail
on which a musher is lucky to get two hours of sleep a day for two
weeks in temperatures that commonly plummet to 50 below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much want to go back to it,'' she said. ``I miss it a
lot. All this other stuff is fun, but it's just playing around.
(During the Iditarod), you almost become one with (your dogs).
They're your workmates, your pets, your everything. It's something
almost indescribable to someone who hasn't experience what happens
during a race. You're depending on them, they're depending on you.
For your lives. You understand that, and they do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Butcher was affecting other lives as well, blazing trails as
metaphorical as they were physical, but she thought little and
talked less about it at the time. She wanted to be accepted as a
musher, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the time it was happening I didn't look at it at all
and didn't think it was necessary to look at it at all,'' she
recalled. ``I was very aware that I was a woman and that this was a
big thing for women, but I didn't want to be given any special
treatment. I just wanted to be viewed as a musher.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers once complaining to a girlfriend about how tired
she was of all the problems. Of course you're exhausted, the friend
said; you're opening doors on a daily basis. ``I went, oh,'' said
Butcher. ``I wasn't able to think of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she has a daughter, who already mushes with her own two-dog
team and speaks to them like a pro. (``She's very direct with
them,'' said Butcher. ``I crack up to hear her use my authoritative
voice with the dogs.'') And what she wants for her is not really so
different than what she wanted for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a moment that it wasn't a labor of love,'' she
said of the exhausting, often solitary years she spent readying her
dogs to race. ``That's my biggest dream for her, that she find her
passion.''
</P>
<P>

(On Wednesday, Sept. 15, Susan Butcher received the 1999 Pioneer
Award from the New England Women's Fund at its second-annual New
England Women's Sports Award Reception in Boston. In addition to
announcing the second class of inductees into its Hall of Fame, the
organization also honored sports reporter Lesley Visser with its
Media Award, Laurie Flutie with its Philanthropy Award and the New
England Blizzard basketball team with its New England Today Award.)

COLTS' MORA PRAISES BLEDSOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jim Mora finished looking at the tapes, he joined the Drew
Bledsoe bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as good as anyone in the league right now,'' said Mora,
the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, who will be in Foxborough
Sunday trying to defend the Patriots' wide-open passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's young and at the peak of his game,'' Mora continued.
``The other quarterbacks (mentioned as being among the best) are
older and not as good as they used to be. This guy is making every
throw. I'm really impressed with the way he responds in clutch
situations. And he shows such great leadership on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put him together with the talent they have at wide
receiver and you have an exceptional pass game. It's one that can
eat up yardage in big chunks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts had a big win of their own Sunday, beating the highly
regarded Bills at home, 31-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a very good game and Buffalo did not play the way
they can play,'' said Mora. ``We are better as a team than we were
a year ago, but we are still not there yet. We have the makings of
a good team in the future if we can keep all of our key players,
but right now I still think all of the other teams in the division
have the edge on us.
</P>
<P>
   ``This division is the best in football, and I think everyone
has to be impressed with what Miami did Monday night. When you beat
Denver in Denver, the way they did, when Denver hadn't lost at home
in something like 24 games, then that is impressive. They are
probably the team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora's offense was playing better at the end of last year when
rookie Peyton Manning started to get a second look at some teams.
Manning has continued to progress and in a couple of years he and
Bledsoe may be hyped as the two best passers in the game. Manning
is helped this season by the addition of running back Edgerrin
James, the Colts' first pick in the draft, and a better defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we have made the most progress,'' said Mora. ``On
defense. I brought in Vic Fangio to be my defensive coordinator and
he has done a fine job. We're much more aggressive on defense than
we have been. Then we picked up some players in free agency on the
defensive side who were better than the ones we were playing with a
year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest surprise in the upset of the Bills was Doug
Flutie being sacked five times. Flutie was sacked just 12 times in
13 games last year, so the Colts' new defense has the capability of
rushing the passer better than it did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bills running back Thurman Thomas was hurt on the first play of
the game when he jumped to catch a high pass from Flutie and was
rocked by cornerback Ty Poole. Thomas was hit head-on in the ribs,
bruising his kidney, and is out six weeks. Flutie apologized to him
after the game for throwing such a poor pass and exposing him to
injury. Thomas said he never saw Poole coming.
</P>
<P>

   Because of the hurricane off the east coast of Florida, the
Dolphins had to land in Fort Myers, on the west coast of the state,
at 6 a.m. following their big win over Denver Monday night, then
take a two-hour bus ride back to Miami. Coach Jimmy Johnson gave
the players the day off Tuesday, and most of them used it to
prepare their homes for the storm. Johnson himself headed for
nearby Williams Island, where he has his boat docked, to remove
anything of value from it. Rookie Rob Konrad, of Syracuse and North
Andover, did a good job for the Dolphins, catching a touchdown
pass, running well inside tackle when he had the chance, and
blocking for the tailbacks. ``All in all, considering it was my
first game, I was pleased,'' said Konrad, who was hunkered down in
his apartment waiting out the hurricane. ``I was very nervous
before the game. I looked at game film in our hotel during the
afternoon, and that made me more nervous. Maybe I should have
watched TV and relaxed. But when I got to the pregame warmup, I
started to feel better. The atmosphere was electric. Monday night
football. Retiring John Elway's jersey. All during the week, Dan
(Marino) was telling me to stay calm and stay patient. He said the
same thing in the game. I caught that touchdown pass in the first
half and that was great. They blitzed two defensive backs, and one
covered me coming out of the backfield. After I caught the ball and
turned around, there was no one there and I started to prance. When
I got to the end zone, I gave it a big-time spike. I waited a long
time for that. We weren't allowed to do that at Syracuse.'' Konrad
gave himself a grade of ``B to B minus'' for the game. It had to be
a wonderful start to his NFL career. Beating the defending
champions on their home field in your first game. It doesn't get
much better than that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski said the Miami running game
was the difference. ``A year ago when we beat them (in the
playoffs), they couldn't run the ball on us. This game they did.''
Miami overpowered Denver at the line of scrimmage. The Broncos set
their defense to stop the passing of Marino but had to adjust when
Miami consistently moved the ball on the ground. Then Marino hurt
Denver with play-action passing, which also reduced the pass rush.
Marino's ability to get rid of the ball quickly under pressure
stymied any hope the Broncos had of blitzing him successfully . . .
Some Dolphins left Denver with the impression that Terrell Davis is
injured more than the Broncos are letting on. Davis hurt his
shoulder in preseason and reportedly had two MRIs. Davis carried
the ball just 19 times for 61 yards, and when Miami had built a
substantial lead early in the fourth period, coach Mike Shanahan
took Davis out of the game. Denver is not the same team when Davis,
the best runner in the league, is not controlling things on the
ground . . . The Jets' situation is even worse than it appears.
Starting quarterback Vinny Testaverde is gone for the season. So is
No. 2 runner Leon Johnson, who spelled Curtis Martin in certain
situations and returned punts. Pro Bowl receiver Wayne Chrebet
won't be back for at least five weeks. Nose tackle Jason Ferguson,
their best defensive lineman, is out six weeks with ankle and knee
injuries. And they still don't know when tight end Eric Green, who
hurt his neck Sunday, will be able to play.

   1. ALMODOVAR AND HIS WOMEN When Pedro Almodovar learned that the
Hollywood Madam, Heidi Fleiss, once employed a prostitute who went
by the name of Norma Jean Almodovar, he was amused. (And before
that, the woman worked for the police.) Only in Almodovar's
strangely ordered universe would a cop-turned-whore seem honest.
Nearly all of Almodovar's films since his 1980 feature debut are
populated with transsexuals, porn stars, drag queens,
sadomasochists and drug addicts. It's the unconventional subject
matter - freaky characters, sex, drugs - that has helped ensure the
success of his movies in the United States. By Jonathan Van Meter.

3. HAIR AND NAIL SALONS MAY SPREAD DEADLY VIRUSES Nail and hair

   HURRICANE FLOYD
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-MAIN _ Main news story on Hurricane Floyd. (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   w/ FLOYD-COAST _ Scene wrap of what is happening along the coast
that doesn't make the main. Is Tybee Island near Savannah under
water, as suggested was possible? How's the lighthouse at St.
Simons? Did the storm surge rush up the Savannah River and
rechristen River Street? (Staff, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-EVACUATE _ Will there be another wave of evacuations
today? How are road conditions? Stories of strife or heroes
emerging? Will those who stopped in middle Georgia shelters on
Tuesday try to head farther north. May wrap scenes from shelters.
(Staff, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-FORECAST _ Short box on what kind of weather follows this
storm as the clean up begins. (Staff, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-HOSPITALS _ As Savannah and environs clear out, hospital
patients are being moved, too. From neonatal cases (which went to
the Medical College of Georgia) to the elderly, patients are being
sent north and west from coastal Georgia. Augusta hospitals are
overwhelmed. And, one of the problems is that staff from the other
hospitals do not come with the patients. (Staff, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-INSURANCE _ Tips on reporting storm damage, dealing with
your insurance company, etc. (Quinn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-SHELTERS _ Early indications are that the Red Cross and
GEMA didn't match up too well on getting the shelters stocked and
opened before people got there. Problems were especially apparent
in middle Georgia, from Macon to Dublin. (Jones/Osinski, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-FLA _ The storm. Even though Hurricane Floyd essentially
missed Florida, it triggered what may be the biggest evacuation in
history. Hundreds of thousands fled _ and are still fleeing -_ in
Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, where they are braced for
impact expected Thursday morning. It's still a monster storm and
whatever it hits will be hurt. In Tallahassee, emergency managers
say they pretty much knew yesterday afternoon that it wouldn't hit
Florida, but they didn't want to call back hundreds of thousands
jamming I-10 and other highways and send them back because what if
it wobbled back left? The agony of when to leave and when not to
leave strikes again. (Moffett, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-FLADAMAGE16 Wrap of the damage. Beach erosion, property
damage, death, destruction? Start right away assessing damage to
public and private property; going out with inspectors. How about
all those big Boca homes going up in Delray Beach. Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-FLAECONOMY _ What was the economic impact of the storm,
everything from Home Depot's increased sales, full hotels, etc.
(SSmith, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-INTERNET _ ATLANTA _A look at how the internet has evolved
into a more sophisticated emergency tool with each disaster.
Mention various websites and check how email traffic and chat room
talk has increased. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-VETO _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and congressional
leaders plan a large, elaborate ceremony Thursday to veto the GOP
tax-cut plan. The event likely is only the first of several vetoes
in coming weeks, and illustrates how the power of the pen is
putting Clinton, a year ago seemingly in danger of imminent removal
from office, in position to once again best Congress in a battle
over tax and spending policy. (Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   RILEY-EDUCATION _ WASHINGTON - Education Secretary Richard Riley
delivers his annual ``state of education'' address Wednesday at a
National Press Club luncheon. lede uncertain. (Mollison, Cox News
Service). 15.
</P>
<P>
   TESTS-LATINOS _ WASHINGTON - Some states and school districts
that use high-stakes tests to decide whether students can advance
to a higher grade or graduate from high school use them in a way
that discriminates against Latino students who are still learning
English, according to a report released and discussed here
Wednesday by Clinton's official Presidential Commission on
Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans. The report is said
to identify ``unacceptable practices'' and offer ``guidance for
effective policies.'' (Mollison, Cox News Service). 20.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-BUSINESS _ WASHINGTON _ A day after the State Department on
Wednesday issues its list of countries that travelers should avoid
because of Y2K concerns, a look at what the list means for
Americans working abroad and business travel. (Geewax, Cox News

</P>
<P>
   STRAY911 _ PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Like many people who want a prompt
response, Jay T. McCarty added a 911 after his phone number on the
page he sent his girlfriend near dawn on Aug. 29. The three digits
somehow resulted in a phone call to the Palm Beach Police
Department. Officers arriving at the ground-floor Hammon Avenue
apartment from which McCarty had called found McCarty with crack
pipes and other drug paraphernalia, as well as a 12-gauge shotgun
and .22-caliber rifle, both loaded. (Schusler, Palm Beach Daily
News).
</P>
<P>
   GHB _ ATLANTA _ Teens use gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) as a party
drug. GHB developed as an anesthetic but never approved for use in
U.S. It was being sold to weightlifters in 80s and 90s as a muscle
booster and sleep aid til FDA banned sales. Chemists changed a few
components to slip through the law, and substances with same active
ingredients still available, or its easily cooked at home thanks to
availability of chemicals and internet instructions. Common
overdoses, including a recent one in alpharetta where a 17-year-old
girl went into respiratory arrest after sipping some while hanging
out with friends. they got the substance at a health food store,
where it is being sold still as a solvent and labeled ``not for
human consumption. FDA says they have trouble controlling the
substance because it is not illegal to make or sell, only to sell
it as a drug or food supplement. If it's labeled as a solvent, you
can buy and sell all you want. (Quinn, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED..
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   UN-SUPPORT _ One of the goals of Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation is
to build more support for the United Nations. That may not be an
easy task. The U.N. is under fire in some circles in America, which
is already far behind in its dues payments. And the Clinton
administration has often seemed to circumvent the organization. As
the U.N. General Assembly begins a new session and a new U.S.
ambassador begins his duties, we talk with Atlanta-based experts
about the issues confronting the organization and what is needed to
rebuild support. (Graham/Melvin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, Sept. 16:
</P>
<P>
   GIANT-CANE (Undated) _ Nobody can remember the exact moment the
giant cane, Arundo donax, went from being a nuisance to a state of
emergency, but the day it lifted up a bridge in Norco, Calif.,
might do for starters. The magnificent, 30-foot plant has been used
for everything from fencing by the Spanish conquerors to an
ornamental garden grass. But over 20 years, it has muscled out the
native cottonwoods and willows that once thrived along the banks of
the Santa Ana. Slurping up nutrients pouring into the river from
seven tertiary sewer plants, arundo can grow 7 inches a day. By
Anne Raver.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   TREE-STUDIOS (Chicago) _ Barton Faist is a soft-spoken artist
who is battling to save his studio and home here in Tree Studios, a
wondrous amalgam of gables, carved heads, stained-glass windows and
chiseled aphorisms, a project dreamt up by a turn-of-the-century
philanthropist for struggling artists. The owners have been trying
for 17 years to sell the increasingly valuable property to
developers. This week, fearing the result of this relentless clash
of new and old, the World Monuments Fund named Tree Studios one of
the world's 100 most endangered places, right next to Machu Picchu
in Peru and the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, Egypt. By Tracie
Rozhon.

<P>
   HOUSE-LIGHTSHOW (London) _ It's called Excessive Sensual
Indulgence, Isabella Blow said, gleefully cranking up the
electronic sequencer that regulates the pulsating fountain-shaped
light sculpture in the Vampire Room of her new house in London's
Waterloo. By day, nothing about the conventional Georgian facade of
the former artisan's cottage Ms. Blow shares with her husband,
Detmar Blow, an art dealer, prepares visitors for the blazing
modernity of the interior nor the eccentricity of its inhabitants.
By night, however, passers-by are often startled by the merrily
demented light show emanating from the curtainless ground-floor
windows, creating the impression that the house is throbbing with
pleasure. By Christopher Mason.

</P>
<P>
   BOULEY-DANUBE (New York) _ Tastefulness is not something David
Bouley is used to worrying about. On the plate, it hasn't been a
problem for the chef and owner of the four-star Bouley Bakery. But
Bouley is standing in the vestibule of his new 3,800 square foot
restaurant, Danube, worried about the Brazilian granite that he
thinks look like Gustav Klimt paintings, the 3,000 copper leaves
that canopy the gold-leafed ceiling like the Secessionists' dome in
Vienna and every other detail of the $1.8 million dollar
establishment, opening here on Monday. By William L. Hamilton.

   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Leslie
Land.
</P>
<P>
   NARROW-SEATS (Boston) _ When the Boston Red Sox announced the
long awaited and highly controversial plan to replace venerable
Fenway Park, the team made much of the deficiencies of the old
ballpark. At the top of the list, the most criticized feature of
the old stadium, was the narrow seats. ``In our surveys, seating
was the largest single issue for fans who come to more than three
games a year,'' said Kathryn St. John, a spokeswoman for the Red
Sox. ``When the park was full, people were literally overflowing
their seats.'' In the new stadium, fans will enjoy an 18- or
19-inch seat instead of a 14- or 15-inch one. By Phil Patton.

   HOME-IMPROVEMENT (Undated) _ The Home Improvement column. By
Edward Lipinski.

STANFORD PRESIDENT TO STEP DOWN 
</HEADLINE>

 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Saying it is time for a ``season of refreshment
and renewal,'' Stanford University President Gerhard Casper
announced his resignation as head of one of the top universities in
the nation after seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work of the university is work that cannot be done unless
it is continuously reconsidered,'' Casper said in a statement. ``I
believe it is about time to bring fresh perspectives to bear on the
president's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Casper, 61, announced his decision to step down next summer at a
Tuesday meeting of department chairs. The constitutional law
scholar said he will leave his position in August to take a
sabbatical and then return to Stanford to teach undergraduate
classes. The university's Board of Trustees will appoint a search
committee to choose Casper's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been credited with a number of accomplishments
during his tenure, Casper announced his retirement amid criticism
over the problem-plagued merger of Stanford's teaching hospital
with UCSF hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   When the hospital system's top two officials resigned last
month, Casper joined UC President Richard Atkinson in asking their
staffs to come up with a plan to restructure the 2-year-old UCSF
Stanford Health Care system by Oct. 1. The joint venture predicts
losses of $60 million for this year.
</P>
<P>
   UC Regent Frank Clark, who opposed the merger, said he was
``absolutely overwhelmed and shocked'' by Casper's resignation.
Clark said he has the highest respect for Casper, who he said was
never a vociferous supporter of the merger before the Board of
Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Casper barely addressed the merger issue in his resignation
statement, but he vowed to devote much of his last year as
president to Stanford's relationship with UCSF ``in the expectation
that shortly we will determine our future course.''
</P>
<P>
   Casper leaves Stanford under considerably less scrutiny than his
predecessor, Donald Kennedy, who resigned in 1991 amid embarrassing
allegations that the university had overbilled the federal
government by as much as $300 million for carrying out research
projects. University officials denied the overbilling but paid back
some of the money.
</P>
<P>
   When he became Stanford's ninth president in 1992, Casper
immediately set out to repair its reputation. He pushed the Justice
Department to conclude its two- year investigation and sought ways
to wean the university from government research grants.
</P>
<P>
   Turning his attention to the campus, he oversaw the repair and
retrofit of buildings that were damaged or threatened by the 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake and focused on developing new guidance
programs to help undergraduates and students applying to the
university.
</P>
<P>
   Casper's call for a re-examination of the undergraduate program
shortly after he took office sparked considerable debate and led to
a crackdown on grade inflation, tougher language requirements and
more stringent science requirements for many students.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving at Stanford, Casper was provost at the
University of Chicago from 1989 to 1992. From 1979 to 1987, he was
dean of its law school. He had joined Chicago's Law School faculty
in 1966 after two years as an assistant professor of political
science at UC- Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Casper earned $375,622 in salary and benefits last year, placing
him 10th overall among the nation's university presidents,
according to the Stanford Daily.

CATHOLIC DIOCESE SUES DEFROCKED PRIEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service)  
 c.1999 ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco has filed
suit against Monsignor Patrick O'Shea, a defrocked Roman Catholic
priest who has also been accused of molesting altar boys and other
children.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accused O'Shea _ former pastor of Holy Name of Jesus
Church _ of embezzlement and fraud and demanded the return of a
quarter-million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   During a 16-year span, O'Shea, 66, ``engaged in a continuous and
sophisticated fraudulent scheme of embezzlement and conversion of .
. . funds,'' the suit alleged.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shea would open ostensibly legitimate church bank accounts,
then channel money to his own use, buying property and paying debts
while falsifying financial reports to the archdiocese, the suit
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, which accused O'Shea of stealing nearly $252,000,
was filed last week in San Francisco Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, the archdiocese said that O'Shea last year formed a
``restitution trust'' which calls for the assets, totaling
$187,000, to go to the local church when he dies. The archdiocese
wants to attach the funds of the trust which it said ``serves as an
acknowledgement of O'Shea's indebtedness.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit also demanded an accounting and repayment of all money
owed by O'Shea, who was ordained in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese's suit said ``there is substantial danger'' that
O'Shea might revoke the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shea's civil attorney, Joseph O'Sullivan, said the lawsuit is
barred by the three-year statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are alleging that in 1995 they believed there was a
conversion of funds. They have to act within three years,''
O'Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the primary motivation for the church's suit was to gain
access to the trust fund. ``The trust fund says if, in fact,
Monsignor O'Shea (were) found to be criminally liable, there would
be money to cover it . . . Now the church is trying to circumvent
the criminal process,'' O'Sullivan said. ``They are trying to use
this lawsuit as the vehicle to take the money.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco attorney John Christian, who is representing the
church in the lawsuit, declined comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shea was permanently stripped of his priestly duties in 1995,
following numerous allegations that the had sexually molested boys.
In 1996, the San Francisco district attorney's office charged him
with 11 counts of grand theft and filing false tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   In the criminal complaint, prosecutors alleged that O'Shea
diverted money into at least eight secret accounts in three San
Francisco banks. The money was allegedly used to maintain a home in
Indian Wells, an expensive community near Palm Springs, Calif., and
in property at Lake Berryessa in Solano County, as well as for
other personal uses.
</P>
<P>
   Those charges are pending.

HOW CAN PEOPLE LIVE ON THE EAST COAST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Give me those sudden earthquakes, mud slides and
brush fires any old time, the kind of disasters that make you jump
right up and run into the great outdoors and don't keep you waiting
in front of the Weather Channel in your mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   How can people live on the East Coast, much less Florida? It's
the state of less-than-Biblical plagues like hurricanes, tornadoes,
thunderstorms, bugs, snakes, tourists, theme parks, monster truck
derbies and cheap housing developments.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a hurricane tears up the Florida coast, Californians
naturally have to ask some questions about that wacky state of
grapefruit and gun nuts. Are hurricanes divine punishment for
Floridians' Sybaritic lifestyle of shuffleboard, jai alai, driving
on the beach and one-stop shopping for beer, ammo and bait?
</P>
<P>
   I'd much rather face a 7.1 temblor as punishment for too much
weird sex, architectural food and Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two million flee hurricane,'' said the San Francisco Examiner
headline as Hurricane Floyd's 150-mph winds moved toward the
Florida coast on Tuesday. That's an astounding number of people,
about 15 percent of the population of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, though. You can do worse than flee Florida, a
land that's barely land, where no hurricane is strong enough to
blow the bugs away.
</P>
<P>
   This is no joking matter because people's lives and homes are in
danger. But why is it that typical California disasters always lead
to jokes, ruminations and columns about how weird we are to live in
California?
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Florida gets leveled by the wind, all you hear are a
few lame jokes about trailer parks. You don't hear anything about
the rich Floridian drug smugglers and embezzlers who keep coming
back for federal disaster aid to rebuild their smashed beachfront
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trailer park'' is a laugh line. ``Beachfront home'' is not.
</P>
<P>
   Californians are resented. Floridians are not, and for good
reason. They have to live in Florida, where winter is colder than
you think and summer is hotter than you can imagine, except for the
daily thunderstorm break, which operates like a steam setting on an
iron.
</P>
<P>
   There are many wonderful people in Florida, particularly the few
natives, but basically the state was a trick played on gullible,
freezing Yankees by Henry Flagler, the original salesman of swamp
land.
</P>
<P>
   I've lived through some powerful hurricanes in Florida and New
England, and I experienced the '89 quake and the '91 Oakland
(Calif.) hills fire. Nobody wants these kinds of disasters in their
lives, but for some reason I find quakes and fires easier to take.
</P>
<P>
   You can prepare for fire by cutting brush. But when a hurricane
is on the way, you sit helpless watching the TV weather map and the
biggest blip in the world moving toward you like a rotating nuclear
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes give ample time to escape to higher ground, although
higher ground in Florida is a few miles south of Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks stick with their cheaply constructed homes and
trailers until the last minute so they can protect their Elvis
spoon collections and not live in a gym. Then, all at once, they
hop in their cars and jam the causeways and highways. Then maybe
they loot.
</P>
<P>
   When a quake hits, there you are, dead or alive, prepared or
unprepared. An earthquake is a giant lottery. Your fate depends on
happenstance, like whether you happened to be standing under
unreinforced masonry.
</P>
<P>
   Quakes don't get names like Floyd either. Floyd was the barber
in Mayberry.
</P>
<P>
   Here in California we talk ominously about the Big One, or
somewhat less ominously about the Pretty Big One. Or else they're
numbered '06 or '89 like vintages.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Weather Service retires the names of hurricanes if
they're big enough. Hurricane Camille killed 256 people, so they
hung up her jersey. There's something very weird about treating a
killer hurricane like Magic Johnson, but that's life on the twisted
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey doesn't retire numbers, and we
remember exactly what those numbers felt like. The only joy in
small quakes is trying to guess its number.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody goes out in a hurricane and tries to guess if it's
Category 4 on the Saffir Simpson scale. It's easy to tell because
the roof goes away and there's an alligator in your stovepipe.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you have to be crazy to live out there on the Right Coast,
where Beltway and Manhattan snobs make fun of us, but send their
own aged mothers to live in that snake-ridden appendix hanging at
the bottom of the old Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Best of luck to all our friends in Florida and points north on
the East Coast this hurricane season. But whatever happens, don't
even think of moving here.
</P>
<P>
   California is suffering the ultimate disaster, houses that don't
shake, slide or burn, but just sit there skyrocketing in price.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be crazy to live here, just rich.

for everything from fencing by the Spanish conquerors to an
ornamental garden grass. But over 20 years, it has muscled out the

the former artisan's cottage Ms. Blow shares with her husband,
Detmar Blow, an art dealer, prepares visitors for the blazing
modernity of the interior nor the eccentricity of its inhabitants.
By night, however, passers-by are often startled by the merrily

Fenway Park, the team made much of the deficiencies of the old
ballpark. At the top of the list, the most criticized feature of
the old stadium, was the narrow seats. ``In our surveys, seating
was the largest single issue for fans who come to more than three
games a year,'' said Kathryn St. John, a spokeswoman for the Red
Sox. ``When the park was full, people were literally overflowing
their seats.'' In the new stadium, fans will enjoy an 18- or
19-inch seat instead of a 14- or 15-inch one. By Phil Patton.

UNDATED: being cynical. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Harvard, the Times story notes, Purdy was outraged at the
freshman class custom of sitting together for a showing of ``Love
Story'' and shouting insults at the characters onscreen. How could
anyone make light of the lead character's cancer, Purdy wanted to
know. How could such disrespect for human suffering exist? It
evidently never crossed his mind that fellow freshmen were mocking
a very bad movie, not a disease.
</P>
<P>
   That is part of the reason ``For Common Things'' fails as real
philosophy. It is, instead, wordy prattle dispensed by someone who
wants to tell the common herd how to change without ever sharing,
even momentarily, the herd's perspective. How can Jedediah know
what they think when, by his own admission, he did his best not to
interact with them?
</P>
<P>
   The other reason Purdy falls short is that, although he decries
the derivativeness of politicians and TV show preachers, he does
exactly what he doesn't want them doing. There is nothing unique
about a political candidate or an ambitious philosopher stating the
obvious: The world is in bad shape, and it could be better. This
basic theme harks back to, say, George Wallace in 1968 asking
dissatisfied taxpayers to ``send a message'' to Washington's
``pointy-headed bureaucrats'' without ever explaining why electing
George Wallace president would be a message effective enough to
bring about positive change.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy asks us to make a bad world better by caring more but
doesn't demonstrate how caring more can be translated into specific
action. Oh, there are generalizations: Compassion, he notes, is not
feeling sorry for someone, but trying to help someone. But help
how, Jed? Details are nice.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Knopf's publicity campaign, and a lot of the praise
generated in positive reviews about ``For Common Things,'' focus on
Purdy's age. It is true; few 24-year-olds could write such a book,
let alone demonstrate the vocabulary and reading habits of Jedediah
Purdy. If his philosophy fails, then his youth ought to be enough
to place him beyond critical contempt, some seem to believe.
</P>
<P>
   But the unsubtle message is that no young man has ever achieved
such literary/philosophic heights before, and that's simply not
true. In precosity Purdy is among the elite but is not the elite's
one-man roster. William F. Buckley, the conservative to whom Purdy
has (so far) most often been compared, wrote ``God and Man at
Yale'' when he was 26 and founded the prestigious National Review
magazine just a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy isn't the youngest college student to write and publish a
book that got national attention. James Simon Kunen was 19 when
``The Strawberry Statement'' chronicled his role in the Columbia
University student riots of 1968, when Kunen was an 18-year-old
freshman. Windy, condescending and painfully sincere, ``The
Strawberry Statement'' was turned into a very bad movie, but Kunen
couldn't be blamed for that. He has since written a couple of other
near-forgotten books, and recently wrote some articles for
Newsweek. But he didn't change the world, although he made clear in
``The Strawberry Statement'' that this was his intention.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy isn't even the youngest Harvard ex to make a literary
impression. Cotton Mather was admitted to Harvard at the ripe old
age of 12, and subsequently, ``The Oxford Companion to American
Literature'' notes, ``was justifiably considered a prig by his
fellows.''
</P>
<P>
   Post-graduation, Mather became an author and minister. By the
time he was Purdy's age, he was churning out titles like ``Relating
to Witchcraft and Possessions,'' with his chief message that
Americans must abandon modern hedonism and return to the simpler
moral values of their forefathers. Mather ended up delighting at
the Salem witch trials _ unsurprising, since he entered Harvard in
1675.
</P>
<P>
   So, with ``For Common Things,'' Jedediah Purdy proves he is not
unique, either as a philosopher or child prodigy. He is, in fact,
derivative.
</P>
<P>
   There's irony in that, but also potential _ which shouldn't be
ignored, even though ``For Common Things'' makes you want to chide
the kid rather than shake his hand. ``For Common Things'' is
obviously sincere, written by a young person who is intellectually
gifted. With a little more experience in the real world, Purdy may
have something of value to offer besides the pleasant, not terribly
unique wish that we would all work together and build a better
society.

<P>
   Jedediah Purdy is the stuff legends are made of _ and marketing
campaigns, too.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years old, first home-schooled by farmer-parents in
West Virginia and then whisked off to Harvard via the tony Exeter
prep school, young Jed, as he's affectionately called by relatives
and publicists, snagged a book contract with Alfred A. Knopf, one
of the more prestigious publishers.
</P>
<P>
   In between Harvard matriculation and his current enrollment at
Yale, where he's studying ``law, environment and values,'' Jed
churned out a 207-page book titled ``For Common Things: Irony,
Trust and Commitment in America Today.'' The author fervently hopes
in his copious introduction that the book will ``turn our attention
to essential and neglected things,'' namely losing the irony that
separates us emotionally from commitment to making our world a
better place.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Common Things'' has engendered uncommon response: The New
York Times Magazine recently devoted a four-page spread to Jed and
his book; all the prestigious magazines and newspapers are
reviewing it, albeit arriving at mixed opinions. (''Inspiring'' is
the positive, minority opinion; ``pompous'' is the negative
majority verdict, with ``overwritten college term paper'' a close
second.) Jed either has been or will be seen on network morning
talk shows, with a good dollop of appearances on the best cable
programs.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks on store shelves, the book has met uneven sales,
too. Purdy's appearances on TV spiked Internet sales _ ``For Common
Things'' hovers between Nos. 135 and 150 on amazon.com's bestseller
list, with a high around 35 _ but walk-in store shoppers don't seem
as enthusiastic. An informal check of three major Fort Worth area
bookstores last week indicated that they have collectively sold
fewer than a dozen copies.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the irony of Jedediah Purdy writing a book decrying
marketing schlock and then having himself and his book become the
center of a national marketing campaign, it is possible _
necessary, really _ to decide how, its near-overwhelming
earnestness aside, ``For Common Things'' really measures up as the
philosophy it purports to be. Both praise for and attacks on ``For
Common Things'' center on two specific issues: its theme and its
author. Theme, of course, ought to be most important, though
Jed-bashers prefer calling him names to weighing what he wants to
tell the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, ``For Uncommon Things'' is a call for readers to stop
distancing themselves from commitment _ emotional, social,
political. For many reasons, Purdy argues, we've learned that ``not
caring'' is the best way to protect ourselves from disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are skeptical, ironic, and inclined to an impoverished
self-reliance,'' he writes in an early chapter. ``At the same time,
we want to give up the ironist's jaded independence and believe
that we are not alone, that we can find moral communities, clear
obligations and even miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy's most obvious failing is overuse of an impressive
vocabulary. Many very intelligent people go through their entire
lives without once using the word ``jejune;'' Purdy includes it in
the first paragraph of his book. ``(Jejune,'' by the way, means
``dull'' or ``ordinary.'') He writes not with engaging rhythm, but
with an annoying habit of overselling his ideas. Where one media
example of social commitment to irony would do _ yes, Jed,
``Seinfeld'' was a signal that not all was well with America _ he
can't help tossing in many more examples, potty-mouth TV cartoon
``South Park'' included.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy also likes to recall his idyllic childhood; eager to raise
their children away from modern society, his parents moved to the
West Virginia hills in 1974 ``to pick out a small corner of the
world and make it sane,'' according to their son. He and his sister
were taught without specific subjects and lesson plans, encouraged
to jump into adult conversations and learn from the low-key world
around them.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Jed did have to try high school, and it didn't work.
He admits he was unprepared for teen-age society. When, in ``For
Common Things,'' Purdy describes the cynic as someone who stays
home from parties while thinking he is better than those who
decided to go, it's impossible not to imagine Jed doing just that,
turning down an invitation and staying home, while all the other
kids laughed and danced and drank beer on the sly. But Jed, of
course, wouldn't say he was being cynical.

AT WORK, BEING ADAPTABLE IS CRUCIAL TO SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's an old joke about two campers who notice a bear slowly
approaching. While they're watching the bear, one of the men grabs
his tennis shoes and begins putting them on.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing that for?'' his friend asks. ``No tennis
shoes in the world are going to let you run faster than a bear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to run faster than the bear,'' he replies. ``I
just have to run faster than you.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know how someone becomes a star at work, think
about the man in the tennis shoes. He isn't necessarily faster or
smarter than his friend (now known as Bear Chow). He's just more
adaptable.
</P>
<P>
   Most workers are like Bear Chow, and think that being a star is
like trying to outrun a bear. They think you either have to have
incredible skills or work long hours, sacrificing your life for the
sake or work. Or they believe they are already stars _ and get a
real jolt when the layoff notices arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But a couple of recent books _ Robert Kelley's ``''How to be a
Star at Work'' and ``First Hired, Last Fired,'' by Robert M.
Bramson and Susan J. Bramson _ say that although top performers
certainly have good technical skills, they owe most of their
success to smart work habits.
</P>
<P>
   They also make it clear that it's about focusing on the right
issues, not spending your life in the office. In researching their
book, the Bramsons found that none of the people identified by
bosses as ``indispensable'' worked particularly long hours unless
special circumstances required it.
</P>
<P>
   Here are five qualities that help to separate the best workers
from everyone else:
</P>
<P>
   _ Understanding other people's perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   The camper with the tennis shoes looked at the situation from
the bear's perspective, and saw that the faster runner would become
the less-desirable entree.
</P>
<P>
   Mediocre bosses overlook this. They hand down decisions without
understanding how they will make subordinates' lives more
difficult, limiting the chance that workers will buy into the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing can happen with top managers. They will
thoroughly analyze a plan among themselves but not even think about
getting ideas from rank-and-filers. Or, if they do talk with
subordinates, they'll be concerned with getting their point across,
not listening to other perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   People who work hard tend to think they're wonderful workers.
But think about your boss's perspective: Is there anything that
makes you better than the other 25 people who have similar jobs?
Has the boss made it clear that you stand out, either through words
or choice assignments?
</P>
<P>
   Suppose the boss gets an angry call and passes it on to you. A
lot of workers might solve the caller's problem, but the best ones
know that it probably doesn't end there. If you were the boss,
wouldn't you want to know that the problem had been resolved? If it
appeared that you screwed up, but you really didn't, shouldn't the
boss know that? And if you did screw up, shouldn't you apologize?
</P>
<P>
   The same thing is true for bosses. When you learn something,
think about whether it would make other people's lives easier if
you told them right away. One particularly bad habit bosses can get
into is to say something like this on a Friday: ``I want everybody
in the office at 10 a.m. Monday. There are some serious problems we
need to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   What you've done is ruin everybody's weekend. You know what the
problems are, but the workers don't _ and everyone who cares tends
to personalize these things.
</P>
<P>
   If a subordinate offers an idea, respond to it. If you
stonewall, it's true that the proposal will slowly fade away _ but
so will your employee's respect. E-mail makes courtesy easy. Take
10 seconds and write: ``I'll get back to you on that next week.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Thinking like an owner.
</P>
<P>
   Many tasks don't fit neatly into anyone's responsibilities, but
they have to get done. Find the ones that are crucial and offer to
do them.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of workers will be tempted to say, ``That's not my job.''
</P>
<P>
   They're right. But the best workers _ the ones who get promoted,
the ones who survive layoffs, the ones who get snatched up by other
companies _ take on added responsibilities, discarding lesser
duties if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If you never get chosen for high-profile assignments, identify
important tasks that no one else is handling and offer to do them.
If you perform well, you'll raise your profile.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking like an owner also means paying attention to the costs
of a project. If something appears to be wasting a lot of time and
money, say so. Your boss may not realize it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Meeting deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Most people turn in work by the assigned time, but the best
workers stand out because they do it early, again seeing things
through other people's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you have something due Oct. 15, which your boss then has
to process for a Nov. 1 deadline. If you were the boss, wouldn't
you want it a week or two early if possible? If there were
complications, wouldn't you want to know as early as possible so
you could assign more staff? What bosses want is pretty basic: Do
the assignment well and turn it in on time. Top workers do that,
but they provide something extra: peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   If you're the boss and you handed that Oct. 15 assignment to a
top worker back in April, you have several months of not worrying
about it. You know that the bases will be covered, that you'll get
periodic updates to reassure you (even if they're just brief e-mail
messages) and that you won't get a rude surprise on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Helping others effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Top performers will help peers to learn, but they won't do
others' work for them. They're most helpful to people who have
tried to do as much as they can before they ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adapting and learning.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be afraid of changes and technological advancements, and
move quickly to use new items effectively. Top workers even come up
with new ways the tools can help them.
</P>
<P>
   Mediocre workers won't think beyond the company's training
program. If they see others using new technology, they won't bother
thinking about whether the same item might help them as well.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Put the cotton back in the bottle
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal broke one of those curious stories the
other day of such catastrophic social significance that no one
could figure out why it was important. Bayer Aspirin is no longer
putting plugs of cotton in its bottles.
</P>
<P>
   No one, according to the WSJ, has much noticed. I didn't, but in
my own way I'll miss those useless stoppers. They were originally
put there to prevent tablets from chipping and turning into powder
as they jiggled in the bottle. All the jiggling in the world
wouldn't break the aspirins with the new high-tech coating. Goodbye
cotton, another victim of relentless corporate efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   I assume drugstores all over the country will follow suit with
prescription bottles. I never understood why they were there,
except as little symbols of stability in a changing world. I felt
care was being taken for a good cause I could not fathom. Such
steps will no longer be taken.
</P>
<P>
   I'm on my own now, a little lonelier, a little more frightened.
Progress.

   Jedediah Purdy isn't the only young writer/philosopher to make a
literary impact. His contemporaries in age, if not generation,
include:
</P>
<P>
   Aristophanes, born about 445 B.C., was a playwright in Athens.
His plays poked fun at government and society. ``The Clouds,''
written when he was about 23, and ``Lysistrata,'' written when he
was 34, are still studied and performed.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton Mather, born in Colonial America in 1663, became
Harvard's youngest freshman when he was 12. After graduation, he
became a minister and author, using both professions to decry the
decline of morality and urging more conservative lifestyles. He
wrote more than 450 books, essays, poems and published sermons and
was said by his enemies to be unwilling to believe anyone had the
right to disagree with him.
</P>
<P>
   Few realize that Edgar Allan Poe was a writing prodigy. His
first collection of poetry was published when Poe was 22. He had
written most of his famous verse and horror novels and short
stories by his mid-30s. Good thing; he died at 40.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Buckley published ``God and Man at Yale'' when he was
26; he founded the ``National Review'' at age 30 and went on to
become perhaps the best-known spokesman for conservative politics
during the 1960s and '70s. His recent books have all been mediocre
spy novels, mostly involving the now-defunct Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Naked and the Dead,'' based on Norman Mailer's World War
II experiences, made him a celebrity author in 1948 at age 25.
Mailer won two subsequent Pulitzer Prizes, for ``The Armies of the
Night'' and ``The Executioner's Song.'' Among all the boy-prodigy
authors, he has had perhaps the longest and most prominent career.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond wrote several philosophic tracts that formed the
basis for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC,
in 1960; Bond was 20 at the time. At 25, the African-American
leader was elected to the Georgia State Assembly, only to have his
election invalidated because he opposed the Vietnam War. He was
later reinstated. Undaunted, Bond ran for the same seat and won
again; this time, a Supreme Court ruling forced the Georgia
assembly to allow him to serve. Bond made more history in 1968,
when he was nominated for vice president at the Democratic National
Convention. Before delegates voted, Bond noted that, at age 28, he
was constitutionally ineligible for the office (35 is the minimum).
Bond now serves as chairman of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   As an 18-year-old freshman at Columbia University, James Simon
Kunen participated in the 1968 student protests. At 19, he
published a book about them titled ``The Strawberry Statement,''
which concluded with the dramatic promise that, ``one of these days
I may fight in earnest and altogether so I won't have to fight
anymore.''

LOOKING AT THE FUTURE, THROUGH JED'S EYES

By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pausing for a quick interview between law classes at Yale,
24-year-old Jedediah _ ``Just `Jed' ''_ Purdy seems polite,
well-spoken and just a little bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Response to my book, `For Common Things,' makes me feel very
peculiar,'' Purdy admits in a phone interview. ``The reason one
writes a book is because of a point to be made, to have something
worth saying. I imagined people sitting down with it, giving the
book some time as a set of ideas to be considered, not paying any
particular attention to the person who wrote it. Perhaps I was
being naive in this.''
</P>
<P>
   As reviews of ``For Common Things'' find their way to the
apartment Purdy shares in New Haven with two fellow students, he is
struck by the words in them devoted to his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``My book is clearly, very openly, a young man's book,
reflective of a sense of urgency about what to do with a life,''
Purdy says. ``Certainly, it is a perspective that comes from being
in one's early 20s, considering the directions gone so far in a
life, and the directions where a life may next go. But to focus on
my age is, I believe, catching the book at a wrong angle. What I
have attempted to describe are not virtues or deeds I personally
have accomplished, or even to present my own convictions as
exemplary. Rather, I am describing what I have seen in other lives,
described by other writing and in scenes of public engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   After a short pause to pose for photographs for another
interview _ a pause of perhaps five seconds for which Purdy spends
the better part of two additional minutes apologizing profusely _
he also responds to criticism that ``For Common Things'' is simply
the yammering of an inexperienced boy trying to talk about issues
he isn't old enough to know much, if anything, about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that in some ways my book invites that
response,'' Purdy says. ``It is, of course, a personal book, but my
aim is to explore some ways we can develop from personal experience
something that evolves beyond the idiosyncratic. And, of course,
portions of the book dealing with political skepticism and the
whole tone of the current popular culture are areas where a young
person can characterize modern texture as well as anyone of any
other age.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy doesn't intend ``For Common Things'' to be his last book,
although he doesn't expect writing to occupy all his post-Yale
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of myself exclusively as a writer, though
whether I ever practice law is unclear,'' he says. ``My view of the
rest of my life is that it won't turn on how much of this current
notoriety stays with me. And I think of this first book as a
preface to future works that will be not so much exploration of
ideas on a large scale as they will be topical, more concrete _ the
city as an element of American culture, for instance, or work in
America and the difference between those who think it is an
entitlement to have interesting careers vs. those who work so that
one day they won't have to work anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a writer or lawyer, as a celebrity or nonentity, Purdy
never intends to sit back and let the world go along without his
input.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view,'' he says, ``I hope to be engaged in
public issues for a long time.''

FOOD-RELATED IDIOMS REVEAL SOMETHING ABOUT OUR APPETITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Food is not just in our pantries and on our plates. It's all
over our language. Look at this smorgasbord of idioms, showcasing
our appetites.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER'S DOZEN
</P>
<P>
   Definition: 13
</P>
<P>
   Origin: Consumers have always taken their bread quite seriously.
In the 1200s, the English enacted a law that bakers must deliver a
pound's worth of bread for a pound's worth of money. Because scales
were scarce, bakers would throw in an extra piece of bread to
ensure that they met the weight allowance.
</P>
<P>
   BELOW THE SALT
</P>
<P>
   Definition: Not up to snuff; the lower echelon.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: Can be traced to the 1500s, when the salt cellar was
placed in the middle of the long dining table. The master and the
esteemed members of the group sat at one end of the table, ``above
the salt,'' and hoi polloi sat at the other end, ``below the
salt.''
</P>
<P>
   CUT THE MUSTARD
</P>
<P>
   Definition: Make the grade.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: At the beginning of the century, ``to be the proper
mustard'' meant to be the real deal, probably because some mustard
of the time was less than pure. Short-story master O. Henry used
the phrase: ``I looked around and found a preposition that exactly
cut the mustard.''
</P>
<P>
   SALAD DAYS
</P>
<P>
   Definition: Period when one is young and naive.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: Shakespeare's ``Antony and Cleopatra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My salad days, When I was green in judgment, and cold in
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Cleopatra explaining away her affair with Julius Caesar
</P>
<P>
   TOP BANANA:
</P>
<P>
   Definition: Head honcho.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: From the vaudeville practice of the show's lead comedian
carrying a soft club with which he banged and derided other
performers.
</P>
<P>
   A CHICKEN IN EVERY POT
</P>
<P>
   Definition: A prosperous time.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: A quote from Henry IV of France (1553-1610).
</P>
<P>
   ``I want there to be no peasant in my kingdom so poor that he is
unable to have a chicken in his pot every Sunday.'' Farmers for
centuries avoided butchering their chickens because money could be
made from selling the eggs.
</P>
<P>
   PIE IN THE SKY
</P>
<P>
   Definition: An ideal that will most likely never occur.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: From the song ``Preacher and the Slave'' by Joe Hill,
from a collection from Industrial Workers of the World (1911).
</P>
<P>
   ``You will eat, bye and bye,
</P>
<P>
   In that glorious land above the sky;
</P>
<P>
   Work and pray, live on hay,
</P>
<P>
   You'll get pie in the sky when you die.''
</P>
<P>
   CABBAGES AND KINGS
</P>
<P>
   Definition: Unrelated items.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: From Lewis Carroll's ``Through the Looking Glass,''
(1871)
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come,'' the Walrus said,
</P>
<P>
   ``To talk of many things:
</P>
<P>
   Of shoes _ and ships _ and sealing wax _
</P>
<P>
   Of cabbages _ and kings _
</P>
<P>
   And why the sea is boiling hot _
</P>
<P>
   And whether pigs have wings.'
</P>
<P>
   APPLE OF MY EYE
</P>
<P>
   Definition: What, or whom, one holds dearest.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: Originally, it was believed that the pupil of the eye
was a solid round body, and so it was called the ``apple'' of the
eye. But by the ninth century, it was known that an injury to the
pupil would cause blindness; so the pupil (''the apple'') became
``that which one holds dearest.''
</P>
<P>
   DUCK SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Definition: Easy.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: The ease with which a hunter can shoot a duck sitting on
water.
</P>
<P>
   NOT KNOW BEANS
</P>
<P>
   Definition: Clueless.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: Beans show up often in English _ a hill of beans, spill
the beans, use the old bean. ``To not know beans'' has a couple of
possible roots. One is from the British, who use the phrase ``to
know how many beans make five,'' derived from the centuries-old
practice of teaching children to count by using beans. The saying
has been tied to Boston, where everyone knows beans.
</P>
<P>
   APPLE POLISHER
</P>
<P>
   Definition: Flatterer.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: This one probably goes back to the Garden of Eden, when
that wily snake made the apple look so enticing. But as children
began taking apples to their teachers, the term came into modern
usage.
</P>
<P>
   TAKE THE CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Definition: Deserve top honors.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: At one time a ``cake'' meant a prize or award. In the
mid-1800s, African-Americans came up with the cakewalk, an event in
which couples competed with the grace and style of their promenade
for the prize: a cake.
</P>
<P>
   GRAVY TRAIN
</P>
<P>
   Definition: To have it easy; to make a living with little
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: Gravy has long meant something nice, something that
dressed up the meat and potatoes. The gravy train evolved during
America's railroad days, when a ``gravy'' run was an easy one with
little work.
</P>
<P>
   TALK TURKEY
</P>
<P>
   Definition: To get down to nuts and bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Origin: Two men go hunting, a white settler and an American
Indian. They have a good hunt, but when it comes time to divvy up
the day's take, the white man manages to put the turkeys in his own
section of the take. But the Indian is not so gullible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always talk turkey,'' he supposedly says to his companion,
``now I'll talk turkey to you.''

RAISE A GLASS TO ROSE _ YOUNG, SPIRITED AND SUDDENLY HIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When your most fashionable friend pours you a glass of pink wine
one of these warm afternoons, don't assume she's lost her mind. If
she's hip, that's not a white zinfandel she's wielding.
</P>
<P>
   She has probably selected one of the dry, full-bodied ross from
the south of France that are so popular among chic hosts and
hostesses on the East Coast. And if she's in the know like those
stylish denizens of the Hamptons, she's having fits trying to
convince her friends that she hasn't geeked out.
</P>
<P>
   As Food &AMP; Wine reported this summer, novelist Jay McInerney
loves serving ross from Provence and Bandol, such as the Domaine
Tempier, to his summering guests in the Hamptons. But he admits
that he has to reassure them that ``it's actually really cool'' to
drink ross.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, ross are a tough sell elsewhere. Ask somebody
who knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do like a ros on a warm day _ it's refreshing,'' said
Bernard Tronche, who said he orders a case from Provence each year
for his Fort Worth, Texas, restaurant, Saint-Emilion. ``But it
doesn't sell that well. Sometimes a customer orders it, meaning
white zinfandel, and is surprised to not get a sweet wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tronche enjoys having a pizza with his ros, which is a
young and spirited wine, it's also a nice companion for
bolder-flavored foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in Aspen, we had a wonderful ros with spicy Asian
food,'' said Darryl Beeson, who is the cellar master at the Mansion
on Turtle Creek in Dallas. ``What I like about it is that you can
throw an ice cube in your ros and not feel like you're committing a
sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most ross found in these parts are those from Provence
or from Languedoc-Roussillon, the region just west of Provence,
there are plenty of others from Spain, Italy and Greece. Even some
American producers, such as Joseph Phelps in the Napa Valley, make
a ros that is definitely not the sweet blush that is sort of known
as wine for beginners.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like a touch of pink, here are some ross to check out.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau d'Aqueria Tavel: paler pink and strong flavored, this
bone-dry wine from the southern Rhone region is blended from
grenache and syrah grapes; it hints of tangy cherry and goes nicely
with herbed, grilled fish, pasta laced with aioli, bouillabaise,
ratatouille and couscous. About $15.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Phelps Vin du Mistral Grenache Ros '96: The California
producer of famed (and costly) Insignia red wines makes a very nice
refreshing, dry ros. About $10.
</P>
<P>
   Fortant '97: This French white merlot is an easygoing
bestseller. Less than $10.
</P>
<P>
   Vendages de Soleil '97: Another French favorite, this comes in a
gorgeous bottle that looks as though it was hand-painted. Less than
$10.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Grande Cassagne Costieres de Nimes '98: Tasting of red
berries, cherry and mint, this round and fruity wine has a ripe,
smooth finish. Serve it with antipasti, crudites, pates, grilled
salmon, Caesar salad and hamburgers. Less than $10.

   Bragging rights: And since we're already on board the calorie

<P>
   THE VERY BEST BROWNIES
</P>
<P>
   Yields 9
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces best-quality semisweet chocolate
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces best-quality unsweetened chocolate
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 cup miniature chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Butter an 8-inch-square pan.
</P>
<P>
   In large bowl, beat sugar, eggs and salt for 15 minutes. This is
much easier if you own a stand-up mixer and can roam around the
kitchen straightening up while the mixture beats. If all you've got
is a hand mixer, however, plan on having a book in your other hand.
Just check the bowl once in a while to make sure the egg mixture
isn't migrating out onto your counter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, melt the semisweet and unsweetened chocolates and
butter in a double boiler over a very low flame. When mixture is
about three-quarters melted, take it off the heat and stir until
chocolates and butter are completely melted and the mixture is
smooth. Cool to lukewarm (don't rush this) and fold gently into the
sugar-egg mixture. Fold in flour, vanilla and finally the chocolate
chips.
</P>
<P>
   Spread mixture in prepared pan and set it in middle of the oven.

   Bragging rights: And since we're already on board the calorie

note that these brownies must be made six hours before serving.

<P>
   THE VERY BEST BROWNIES
</P>
<P>
   Yields 9
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces best-quality semisweet chocolate
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces best-quality unsweetened chocolate
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 cup miniature chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Butter an 8-inch-square pan.
</P>
<P>
   In large bowl, beat sugar, eggs and salt for 15 minutes. This is
much easier if you own a stand-up mixer and can roam around the
kitchen straightening up while the mixture beats. If all you've got
is a hand mixer, however, plan on having a book in your other hand.
Just check the bowl once in a while to make sure the egg mixture
isn't migrating out onto your counter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, melt the semisweet and unsweetened chocolates and
butter in a double boiler over a very low flame. When mixture is
about three-quarters melted, take it off the heat and stir until
chocolates and butter are completely melted and the mixture is
smooth. Cool to lukewarm (don't rush this) and fold gently into the
sugar-egg mixture. Fold in flour, vanilla and finally the chocolate
chips.
</P>
<P>
   Spread mixture in prepared pan and set it in middle of the oven.
Bake for 20 minutes if you like your brownies custardy. If you like
them a little drier, bake for 30 minutes. They'll still be nice and
creamy. Cool on rack for 6 hours and cut into squares.

 &HT;    Bathing, massages among benefits of prized pure oils, deemed
essential for mental stimulation, stress relief
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aromatherapy is one of today's hottest trends, but it's
certainly nothing new. There's ample evidence that aromatic
medicine and the art of aromatherapy were widely used in both Egypt
and India more than 4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Using aromatic plants, the Egyptians created medicines,
embalming preparations, massage oils, perfumes and cosmetics.
Meanwhile in India, aromatics also were used as part of the ancient
medical practice ayurveda, which still exists today.
</P>
<P>
   These days you can't march down a supermarket aisle without
running into merchandise emblazoned with the term aromatherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aromatherapy is so popular because it works, especially in a
society that's so stressed,'' says Lauren Marie Thomas, certified
aromatherapist and reflexologist with the Heal Center in Sandy
Springs, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Essential oils benefit you emotionally through your sense of
smell and are beneficial to your body by skin absorption.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the benefits of aromatherapy can be as easy as soaking
in a tub scented with a combination of essential oils or having a
total body massage with specially mixed oils.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all aromatherapy products are created equal, says
Candace Apple, owner of Phoenix &AMP; Dragon New Age bookstore in Sandy
Springs, which sells Earth Harmony, a locally developed line of
oils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aromatherapy is such a generic name today,'' Apple says. ``A
lot of products say aromatherapy, but not all of them are made from
all natural essential oils.''
</P>
<P>
   Those essential oils are what give aromatherapy its power. Don't
confuse aromatic with therapeutic. Just because a product smells
wonderful doesn't mean it boasts any therapeutic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   So, while you think a sniff of Chanel's Coco perfume will send
all your cares away, chances are it won't encourage creativity,
calm your headache or provide a mental stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   Those prized pure oils don't come cheaply. The good news is that
you don't need to buy very much. A standard 9-milliliter bottle of
pure oil will run from around $5 to $15. If you buy oil blends,
they're even less expensive, but you won't get the benefits of
essential oils.
</P>
<P>
   You can find a variety of scented candles, but for therapeutic
value, make sure they contain essential oils, not synthetic
perfumes. Expect the prices to start at around $10 for a good but
fairly small candle.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be students of aromatherapy should do their homework.
Thomas suggests taking a class or assembling a small library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you get a reputable book on contraindications,'' she
says. ``The chemical aspect is important. Even though they smell
like perfume, the oils are chemicals. You have to be careful
because although you're talking about drops of oil, it's easy to
overstimulate yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   While small amounts of some essential oils can be placed
directly on your skin, for scented massage or skin care, a few
drops of the oils are mixed with a carrier oil, which is any
vegetable or nut oil such as grapeseed, hazelnut, jojoba or almond.
Don't use mineral oil or baby oil because it won't penetrate the
skin and the essentials won't get to do their work.
</P>
<P>
   Along with bathing and massages, there are several popular ways
to avail yourself of the benefits of aromatherapy. You can use a
diffuser, a ceramic or metal vessel that holds a small candle and
has a little well at the top. Add a few drops of pure essential
oils with a little water, then light the candle, and when the flame
heats the water, it disperses the oil's fragrance throughout the
room.
</P>
<P>
   Cindi Martin of Atlanta is a newcomer to the world of
aromatherapy, but she's already a fan, especially of the diffuser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a lot about it,'' she says, ``but I have a friend
who's interested in aromatherapy, and she gave me one of those
little oil burners a few weeks ago. I just picked up a few more
oils because I'm starting to mix them to get a special scent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I light it every night before I go to bed, and I find it very
restful. I'm hooked on jasmine oil mixed with a little lemon _
that's my latest creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you spend a lot of time in your car, you can indulge in
aromatherapy. You can buy a car diffuser that plugs into your
cigarette lighter. Simply place a few drops of your favorite oils
on a diffuser pad, slip it into the gadget and the heat sends out
scents that might keep you calm in the midst of a traffic tie-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aromatherapy is a very subtle way to improve your health,
especially stress, without turning to pharmaceuticals,'' Thomas
says. ``A few drops of oil in a diffuser can change your whole
mood.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Kronos, Glass in black, white
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those brand-name vanguardists, foxy chamber group Kronos Quartet
and minimalist/pop composer Philip Glass, tag-team the silent
cinema on their latest collaboration: a score for Todd Browning's
1931 horror classic, ``Dracula.'' Packaged with the menacing visage
of Bela Lugosi glaring from the CD's cardboard slipcover, the
project immediately piques your curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, who is frequently linked to such fellow '60s-identified,
repetition-minded, rock 'n' roll-friendly composers Steve Reich and
Terry Riley, has a virtual second career as a soundtrack guy. His
credits include unconventional documentaries like ``The Thin Blue
Line'' and ``Koyaanisqatsi,'' epics like Martin Scorsese's
``Kundun'' and even the B-movie slasher ``Candyman'' (which he
disowns, sort of). Half the time, his work sounds cheesy and
blithely recycled; but when it's inspired, a Glass score flaunts a
multifaceted opulence, its hypnotic insistence pulling you through
the surface into a hall of mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dracula'' is good Glass. His keyboard-based music translates
with appealing simplicity to string quartet, especially one as
well-recorded as the Kronos, which plays these 26 short pieces
(from 43 seconds to nearly five minutes) with a crisp elegance.
Maybe it's the brevity of the segments or the desire to complement
those shadowy black-and-white images, but the composer's signature
repetitions never get, you know, repetitious. Neither does it
succumb to heavy-handed drama, stroking romantic touchstones
without evoking the same old gloom and doom from the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dracula''
</P>
<P>
   Kronos Quartet/Philip Glass. Nonesuch. 26 tracks.

   ``Na Please''

   Ol' Dirty Bastard. Elektra. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   And now, rap listeners, we return you to another episode of Ol'
Dirty Bastard. Last we saw him, ODB, Big Baby Jesus _ or whatever
he was calling himself _ was running his mouth at the 1998 Grammy
Awards, running from the cops or running up a number of women
accusing him of shirking child support. And as reckless as this
member of the Wu-Tang Clan is in his personal life, he is on his
second solo album. Stumbling through often incoherent boasts and
verbal assaults, the equal-opportunity offender somehow manages to
stay upright enough to make fun of singers who ad-lib (``Good
Morning Heartache''), smart enough to include danceable production
(``Recognize'') and interesting enough to keep you tuning in _
albeit warily _ to hear what he'll wreck next.

   ``prokofiev bartok webern barber''
</P>
<P>
   Garrick Ohlsson, piano. Arabesque. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Known as an interpreter of romantic music, American pianist
Garrick Ohlsson also has a gift for mainstream contemporary
repertory (though, regrettably, he rarely plays it in public). The
melodic ease and harmonic clarity of his Chopin and Schubert are
just as apparent in this exquisite recording. He plays the
meditative first movement of Prokofiev's Sonata No. 8 and the
intricate fingerwork of Samuel Barber's 1949 sonata with equal
thoughtfulness and skill. As for Bartok's ``Three Studies,'' Op.
18, and Anton Webern's ``Variationen fur Klavier,'' Op. 27, these
sketches have the transparency of early Debussy preludes. The tiny
middle variation of Webern (``Sehr schnell,'' very fast) lasts
exactly 38 seconds: a dragonfly of a piece, gone almost before it's
here.

<P>
   ``Juxtapose''
</P>
<P>
   Tricky with DJ Muggs and Grease. Island. 10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   There are artists who spend a career trying to equal a
remarkable debut, and Tricky is among them. 1995's ``Maxinquaye''
was a dark, moody masterpiece that sprang from the Bristol,
England, trip-hop underground with a stunning display of raw
talent. Tricky has never again reached the mark set by it.
``Juxtapose'' doesn't change that, but it still outstrips most of
the competition. Previous releases flirted with psychedelia, but
that tendency gets free rein here. ``Contradictive'' and ``She
Said,'' among other tracks, call to mind Echo and the Bunnymen and
even Smashing Pumpkins. The steady throb of hip-hop is still there,
but we get more trip and less hop. The metallic thrum of ``Hot Like
a Sauna'' even flirts with Kid Rock/Limp Bizkit-type sonics. One
other caveat: At just under 36 minutes, this is considerably
shorter than your average full-price CD.

 &HT;    Prine &AMP; Co.'s dandy duets do country proud
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever been to a yard sale and stumbled upon a box of old
45s that turned out to be buried musical treasures? This new CD
from John Prine is like that. It's a delightful excavation of some
of the greatest country music standards of the '50s and '60s, the
kind of tunes that kept late-night truckers awake and honky-tonk
jukeboxes glowing.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, Prine has recorded every song as a duet with some of
country's greatest female twangers _ Opry queen Connie Smith (``So
Sad to Watch Good Love Go Bad),'' feisty Lucinda Williams
(``Wedding Bells/Let's Turn Back the Years),'' Trisha Yearwood
(``When Two Worlds Collide''), Emmylou Harris (``I Know One'') and
Melba Montgomery (``We Must Have Been Out of Our Minds'').
</P>
<P>
   From the crying pedal steel to Prine's slightly off-key Ernest
Tubb vocals, these tunes could have been cut in a sweaty,
smoke-filled recording studio 35 years ago. All that's missing is
the hiss and pop of a needle on vinyl. Prine gets extra points for
teaming with Iris Dement to revive one of George Jones and Tammy
Wynette's most clever duets, ``We're Not the Jet Set'' (``Oh, we're
not the jet set/ we're the old Chevro-let set.'') And be sure to
hit the back button at track No. 8. You'll want to hear the
cheatin' classic ``Back Street Affair'' with Patty Loveless twice.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Last Days'' (PG-13) _ James Moll's Oscar-winning
documentary uses simplicity to underscore the horrors of the Nazi
Holocaust. It focuses on five survivors of Germany's decision to
exterminate as many Hungarian Jews as possible late in the war,
when Hitler logically should have been channeling all resources to
his troops. It's a portrait of hatred at its most irrational. The
survivors tell stories of courage and loss with a
matter-of-factness that makes the horrors of genocide
heartbreakingly personal. Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Cookie's Fortune'' (PG-13) _ A delicious, deep-fried riff
from director Robert Altman. Set in small-town Mississippi, this
comic character study kicks off when busybody Glenn Close tries to
cover up her aunt's (Patricia Neal's) suicide, leading to
misunderstandings that shake up the lives of the locals, including
Charles S. Dutton, Julianne Moore, Liv Tyler and Chris O'Donnell.
Altman spoons a rich Southern flavor over his scenes, celebrating
yet ever so gently mocking his characters' eccentricities. Grade:
B+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Forces of Nature'' (PG-13) _ Opposites attract as
strait-laced Ben Affleck heads to his Savannah wedding, accompanied
by free-spirited Sandra Bullock. Like ``My Best Friend's Wedding,''
it's a savvy blend of romantic-comedy formula and wise 1990s
updates. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Three Seasons'' (PG-13) _ The winner of three awards at
Sundance and further distinguished as the first U.S. film shot in
Vietnam since the war, this tenderly appealing pastiche interweaves
several obliquely connected stories while catching a country in
transition between a conflicted past and an uncertain future.
Reminiscent of Italian neo-realism, the movie may be narratively
facile, but it's visually and emotionally rich. With subtitles.
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``God Said `Ha'!'' (PG-13) _ A one-woman autobiographical show
with ``Saturday Night Live'' alumna Julia Sweeney talking about her
brother's cancer, her parents and her own illness. Lacking special
effects or sex scenes, and with death as its undeniable subtext,
it's definitely a grown-up film. And it proves that laughter is
indeed the best medicine. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Jill Vejnoska
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Yellow Submarine'' (G) _ As a cultural artifact, it's a
blast. As a movie, it's a bomb. Available for the first time in 11
years, the digitally restored Beatles oddity is a showcase for some
psychedlic strangeness and swell tunes (largely culled from ``Sgt.
Pepper's''), mired in a nonsensical fantasy plot. The animation
plays like a series of inferior Peter Max posters forced to move;
that's a plus or minus, depending on your own personal groove, man.
(VHS, $19.98; DVD $29.98.) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Children of Heaven'' (unrated) _ You can see this
Oscar-nominated movie (for foreign language film) intent on
divining all sorts of hidden messages in its tale of abject
poverty, scary authority figures and other aspects of Iranian life.
But then you'd miss seeing a simpler, much more delightful story
about two little children and their quest for one pair of shoes.
The ending is by turns touching, heartbreaking and hilarious.

LIGHTS, CAMERA, CENSOR! HERE COMES `ACTION'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although he's playing a character with no character and starring
in a comedy in which language is lewd, offensive, sexual, racist,
homophobic or merely bleeped out, Jay Mohr and his much-hyped
half-hour comedy, ``Action,'' have created one of the early
pleasures of the new TV season.
</P>
<P>
   I say this with the full knowledge that this is the kind of
television that could very well doom us all.
</P>
<P>
   Shot with the quick-cut sensibilities of a music video and the
broadcast standards of late-night cable, ``Action'' arrives at a
time when network TV finds that its only recourse in the audience
war against the freewheeling cable competitors is to arm itself
with the same artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Jimmy Smits put it succinctly the other day while
cruising the red carpet during the pre-Emmy festivities, ``Get
edgier, get crazier, go over the line.''
</P>
<P>
   He must have gotten a peek at Thursday's pilot episode of Fox's
``Action,'' which does all that and tosses in a scene in which a
limo drags a hooker several blocks, then dislodges her onto the
red-carpet entrance of a movie premiere, her skirt up, legs
spread-eagled, the camera zeroing in.
</P>
<P>
   Says Mohr's Peter Dragon, who's more concerned with the flashing
cameras than a no-name prostitute: ``Don't die, hooker, please
don't die, this is a Christmas movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter is the protagonist here, a Xanax-popping, hotheaded
Hollywood producer who is Mohr's Jerry Maguire character had he
ascended into the film industry and gotten hooked on amphetamines.
He is unscrupulous and heartless, a purveyor of the filth that
pervades Hollywood, which is ironic and even comical considering
that he's about to do the same number on us on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Peter's specialty is the sort of big-budget action picture that
might be titled ``Slow Torture II: It Still Hurts'' unless he
decides to call it ``Slow Torture II: Now It's Unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   He has an ex-wife married to a tyrannical boss, the studio head,
who is gay and is legendary for being well-endowed physically. Most
of Peter's time is spent barking orders into his cell phone,
walkingandtalkinglikethis, and treating everyone below him like a
gooey something on the bottom of his $200 shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can come to the premiere,'' Peter snaps into his cell
phone as he strides into his office suite. ``She can come to the
post-premiere party. But she cannot come to the post-premiere
party-party. Whaddaya mean, why? Because she's ugly!''
</P>
<P>
   Illeana Douglas is Wendy Ward, a former child star turned
cocaine addict turned prostitute turned Peter's creative
consultant, which, in this rather pretentious, sleazy world, could
very well happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a date?'' Wendy asks Peter, who is bent over the
sidewalk, halfway out his limo, when they first meet. Peter: ``I'm
gonna puke on you.'' Wendy: ``Gee. I don't think I have a price for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot more in this vein, most of it howlingly funny,
based on situations that are morally appalling, but taken as a
package, create a racy and entertaining spoof of Hollywood
deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   Action is executive-produced by Chris Thompson, who wrote for
HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' the other cable series that was
all tension, cynicism and profound shallowness _ just the way you
imagine Hollywood life would be, except funnier.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike that on ``Larry Sanders,'' the humor isn't hermetic.
You'll get all the jokes even if you've never set foot in Los
Angeles, although you'll probably laugh louder if you subscribe to
Daily Variety.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sanders, ``Action'' will take advantage of stars playing
themselves _ Keanu Reeves appears in the pilot, attending the movie
premiere of ``Slow Torture,'' asking Peter why Wendy has her hands
down his pants. Purrs Wendy: ``I'm a big fan of yours.'' Purrs
Keanu: ``I'm getting to be a big fan of yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter, by the way, is flanked by Stuart (Jack Plotnick), his
sidekick of a production president and typical Hollywood yes-man.
Buddy Hackett plays Peter's uncle and chauffeur, and perhaps the
only person he remotely respects, unless you count Georgia (Sara
Paxton) his pre-teen daughter, who lives with her mother (Cindy
Ambuehl) and the gay studio boss.
</P>
<P>
   The series, originally conceived for cable (HBO passed), has
drawn a considerable amount of attention by allowing Peter to utter
bleeped-out obscenities. Not that you don't know what he's saying.
Take the scene where he rips into an underling upset over losing
his ``Employee of the Month'' parking space: ``I will continue to
park any (bleep) place I want,'' Peter informs him, ``because I'm
the (bleep) employee of the century!''
</P>
<P>
   Profanity, or the semblance of such, isn't needed to give Action
irreverence or realism. So let's hope it's a device that becomes
relegated to the same every-now-and-then status of a posterior
sighting on ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bleeped profanity aside, I like the idea that ``Action'' will
have an infinite number of ways to deconstruct the film business
and that it will come through the eyes of Peter, who looks as if
he'll convey the shadings of insecurity and bottled-up rage that
made Larry Sanders such a prickly, complicated, glorious character.
</P>
<P>
   To say that ``Action'' is so far the most fearless half-hour of
comedy this season wouldn't be off target _ just suspect at a time
when we must question whether Smits' solution of network TV being
``edgier, crazier, going more over the line'' will be worth what we
get in the long run.

 &HT;    Wake up with stress-free breakfast
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have known forever that breakfast is the most important meal
of the day. Why is it, then, that for many it is the meal we put
the least thought into? Day after day the same soggy cereals,
sugary doughnuts, Pop-Tarts and fast food are eaten on the run ...
and we are done with it.
</P>
<P>
   But breakfast is also a quality-of-life meal. Besides being
nutritionally vital, breakfast sets the tone for the day. If
breakfast time at your house is usually rushed _ filled with
stress, tensions and distractions _ maybe it's time to take a good,
hard look at your morning dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every day can be a Norman Rockwell painting; but
by doing a little readjusting here and a tad of rethinking there,
you can add a chunk of quality time and other remarkable benefits
to your family's life.
</P>
<P>
   A study done last year by Massachusetts General Hospital took
100 kids from the third through eighth grades who usually didn't
eat breakfast for one reason or another and gave them a chance to
eat a free, nutritionally sound (although not very imaginative)
breakfast for four months. The kids were tracked to see how often
they ate the breakfasts. At the end of the test period, the kids
who ate the breakfast often saw improvements in their math grades.
(Researchers couldn't figure out why the boost showed in math and
not other subjects.) The kids also claimed that their feelings of
anxiety and depression decreased. On top of that, teachers and
parents reported that tardiness, absenteeism and hyperactivity
dropped among the breakfast eaters.
</P>
<P>
   We can only imagine what would happen if, instead of moping to
the breakfast table to face yet another predictable bowl of cereal
or a doughnut, your family was met with an eye-opening, tasty and
imaginative morning meal.
</P>
<P>
   It can be done with surprisingly little effort by budgeting just
15 minutes in the evening and 15 minutes in the morning to plan and
prepare this most important meal.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a good place to look to help you get started
revamping your breakfast routine.
</P>
<P>
   For pure motivation, start by looking at some fabulous breakfast
dishes. And where better to start than with what bed-and-breakfast
inns across the country are serving their pampered guests? For
original, tempting recipes _ like Pineapple French Toast With
Ambrosia Salsa and Artichoke Heart Strata _ check these B&AMP;B sites:

 &HT;    Peanut Butter Bars that melt in your mouth
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if you're not back in a classroom, the very thought of
cranking a pencil sharpener and smelling a box of newly opened
crayons may be enough to revive fond back-to-school memories.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Stribling of McDonough (Ga.) wrote to say she would
appreciate a recipe for Peanut Butter Bars like those she enjoyed
in the early 1980s when she attended a Fulton County elementary
school.
</P>
<P>
   Her plea was answered by Betty Sheldon of Covington (Ga.), who
said she got this recipe from the dietitian at Rowland Elementary
School in DeKalb County (Ga.) when her children attended in the
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   The bars are easy to make and freeze well.

   &QR;  Cynthia Montgomery of Tucker (Ga.) is looking for a recipe

says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mary Rose asks via voicemail if anyone has a recipe for a
mandarin orange cake like one a co-worker, who has since moved

 &HT;    SHOPPING DESTINATION: Thomasville
 &HT;    City of Roses thrives on hospitality, ingenuity
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOMASVILLE, Ga. _ In this historic southwest Georgia town of
20,000, the streets are paved with red bricks instead of gold.
</P>
<P>
   But that simply adds to the charm of its vibrant Victorian
downtown, which boasts about 100 authentically restored shops and
galleries. Businesses run the gamut, from Neel's 101-year-old
department store to Grapevines &AMP; Good Times, a four-month-old
boutique that sells invitations, gifts and collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   If you wander into Thomas Drug Store, you can walk on the
original 1857 blue-and-white tile floor and buy a block of camphor
($1.29) that Thomasville women put in their silver chests to retard
tarnish on the family silver. Or you can buy a diamond at Jerger
Johnson Jewelers while admiring their polished wood jewelry cases
dating to 1857. And when you're ready for a break, duck into Izzo's
Pharmacy, whose owners use a 75-year-old hand press to make yummy
burgers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to soaking up history on your shopping foray, you'll
be treated to top-notch service in each store and have your
purchases gift-wrapped for free. And don't worry about parking.
There's plenty on the streets _ and it's free, too.
</P>
<P>
   Thomasville, also known as the City of Roses, was named a Main
Street City in 1982. The goal of this program is to provide
economic development within the context of historic preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem that most towns would love,'' said Sharlene
Celaya, the executive director of Thomasville Tourism. ``I have a
list of five owners who want to move to Broad (the main shopping
street), but there are no vacancies. Most of our stores are locally
owned by second- and third-generation residents and young people
are coming back to their hometown to open more.''
</P>
<P>
   Holly Lybrook, the co-owner of Hollybrook, a chic furniture and
home accessories shop, is originally from Thomasville. She lived in
Richmond for 20 years with her husband Drew but moved back 3 1/2
years ago to open the shop. ``I always wanted to come home,''
Lybrook said. ``I love the friendliness of the people and the
pretty downtown. My husband, who is from Richmond, also wanted to
move to Thomasville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are lucky. Local residents support us as well as visitors
from Valdosta (Ga.), Albany (Ga.), Bainbridge (Ga.), Moultrie
(Ga.), even Tallahassee (Fla.).''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday afternoon, former Atlanta resident Dinorah
Hall, who now lives in Albany (Ga.), was shopping at Lybrook's
shop. ``I find more unique, yet affordable, items here than at the
Atlanta Decorative Arts Center,'' said Hall, who is director of the
James H. Hall Eye Center in Albany. ``Plus, everyone in Thomasville
makes me feel so comfortable when I'm shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantans also like to shop in town. Ted Turner and wife Jane
Fonda own Avalon, a plantation in northern Florida, and shoppers on
Broad Street often rub elbows with Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   A local wag once remarked that ``Thomasville was built on
Northern ingenuity and Southern hospitality.'' Maybe so. Founded in
1824, the town received its charter in 1831 and became a part of
Thomas County.
</P>
<P>
   After the Civil War, wealthy northerners and socialites traveled
to Thomasville by train, where it ended its run. Situated 330 feet
above sea level, the town was fairly free of lowland marshes that
bred mosquitoes carrying yellow fever and malaria. Thus, it became
known as a fashionable winter resort. Northeast and Midwest
industrialists built homes, also known as ``cottages,'' in town, or
plantations in the fertile lands. By 1906, however, the railroad
expanded to Palm Beach and Miami, leaving Thomasville and
surrounding counties with a heritage of beautiful homes and
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these graceful places _ most are still privately owned _
attract a bounty of visitors and hunters. Quail hunting is a
favorite sport. The 4,500-acre Woodhaven plantation in nearby
Coolidge is owned by Atlantan Charlie Loudermilk, founder and
chairman of Aaron Rents. It's said to be the inspiration for the
fictional quail plantation Turpmtine in Tom Wolfe's novel ``A Man
in Full.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take I-75 south to Tifton (Exit 18). Go right,
which brings you to a stop sign. Turn left and you will see the
sign for U.S. 319 south. After it crosses Ga. 19, U.S. 319 south is
also known as Jackson Street, which takes you straight into
Thomasville. About a four-hour drive from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most shops open 9 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Free parking on Broad Street and side streets. Also,
two municipal lots are on Crawford Street behind the stores facing
Broad Street.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Stores are generally accessible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: Public restrooms in the Thomasville Welcome Center,

   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1884 Paxton House: You can't miss this elegant two-story
bed-and breadfast on Remington Avenue, which is painted a deep blue
and trimmed in white with a wonderful wraparound porch. Innkeeper
Susie Sherrod, a retired army nurse, has restored this Victorian
beauty and filled it with antiques, crystal and dolls collected
from her trips abroad. The nine rooms/suites have private baths,
TV, phones and air conditioning. And guests also have use of the
hot tub and lap pool. There's even a tiny gift shop on site filled
with trinkets made by the owner. Don't miss the gourmet breakfast.
On a recent morning, Sherrod served eggs Benedict, fresh fruit and
her famous homemade banana nut bread. After this repast, you can
take off the calories by walking the four blocks to the shopping
district. Smoke-free rooms are $99-$250. No children under 12. 445

   &QR;  Even shoppers have to eat. At lunch, head for The Horse and
Buggy, 123 N. Broad St. (912-225-9600), located in the renovated
1916 Upchurch Building, which has been everything from a billiard
parlor to various retails shops. The sleek interior features a
buggy filled with flowers and a contemporary Southern menu. For
starters, try collard soup, a blend of the leafy greens, country
ham and mixed veggies ($2.50 a cup). If you eat eggs, the western
omelet is a must ($6.95). 11 a.m.-3 p.m. Tuesdays-Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Other dining spots to try: Neel's Lunch on the Mezzanine, 101 N.
Broad St. (912-226-5431, Ext. 17). Located in the oldest store in
town, this small cafe serves a variety of sandwiches, including ham
or turkey, chicken salad, pimento cheese and peanut butter and
jelly ($1.25-$3.25). For a cool drink, opt for a lemonade ($1), an
iced cappuccino ($1.50) or a cherry Coke ($1.25). The Billiard
Academy, 121 S. Broad St. (912-226-9981). Step up to the walk-up
window and order a hot dog all the way _ chili, mustard and onions
($1). Chips are 50 cents, a beer, $1.75. Then play a friendly game
of pool. 8 a.m.-9 p.m. Mondays-Fridays; 8 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Splurge on dinner and make a reservation at Melhana, the Grand
Plantation Resort, 301 Showboat Lane (912-226-2290;
1-888-920-3030). Developed in the late 1800s by industrialist
Howard Melville Hanna, and recently restored, you will eat in a
pale pink house surrounded by formal English gardens. Appetizers
might include fried green tomatoes ($8.95) or creamed crab on toast
points ($8.95) followed by a blue cheese apple salad ($7.95). Main
courses choices: pan roasted grouper ($26.95), grilled double lamp
chops ($29.95) or Florida red snapper ($25.95). 6-10 p.m. every
night. Jackets required for men.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond shopping

 &HT;    One impressive, earnest `Prince'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' (PG)
</P>
<P>
   The powers that be at DreamWorks talked to everyone from
evangelists to ministers to rabbis to Muslim theologians to make
sure the world's major religions found nothing overtly offensive
about this animated musical epic. About the only person they didn't
contact was the ghost of Cecil B. De Mille. Too bad.
</P>
<P>
   He could have told them he'd already done this movie.
Unquestionably impressive, ``The Prince of Egypt'' can't help but
summon echoes of De Mille's ``The Ten Commandments.'' It has the
same awesome visuals, the same cast-of-thousands scale, the same
insistently reverential approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince'' tells of the Hebrew people's liberation from slavery
in Egypt. All the big scenes are here: Moses in the bulrushes; his
run-of-the-palace coming of age; his discovery of his true
birthright; his being summoned by God to lead the Israelites out of
bondage; the 10 plagues. A huge amount of care has been lavished on
this movie, and it shows, from the spectacular animation to the
spectacular voice talent: Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum,
Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Patrick Stewart and Steve
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   But is ``Prince'' the sort of animated classic that will be
embraced? Not really. It can't escape a kind of squeaky-clean
Sunday-school-lesson aura. It's visually impressive. And just a bit
too kosher. It probably could have used a little ham. ($26.99
video, $34.99 DVD.)

   ALTANTA _ Having trouble finding a particular item? We'll try to
help you locate it. But due to the volume of mail, we cannot track
down every request. Readers whose queries are answered in the

<P>
   Q: I recently visited Boston and drank the best-flavored tea
I've ever tasted. It was brewed from Sir Thomas Lipton tea bags.
I've looked in several stores in the Atlanta area since I've been
back, but they seem to be unavailable. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _Dottie Richey, Dunwoody, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Another tea request: When we have catered lunches at work, the
caterer always brings Sir Thomas Lipton herbal teas. They are much
better than teas I find at the store. Where can I find them?
</P>
<P>
   _William K. Wilson, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: We've bagged that tea. According to a company representative,
the Sir Thomas Lipton line of teas is sold only to hotels, motels,
cruise ships and other food professionals. However, Lipton makes
these teas available to the public via its Products by Mail
Program. Included are flavored tea bags (raspberry, honey and
lemon, orange and spice, blackberry, mint and amaretto) as well as
herbal tea bags (including chamomile, golden honey lemon,
peppermint, orange, lemon soother and cinnamon apple). A box
contains 24 bags, and a six-box case is $8.86 plus $4.88 shipping
or $13.74. Send a check or money order to: Lipton Products by Mail,
P.O. Box 3000, Grand Rapids, MN 55745-3000. Information:

   1-800-697-7897.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please help us find pencil clips that slip onto wooden
pencils. These allow one to ``clip'' a pencil to a pocket, etc.
They used to be available at Emory University in the bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   _Dennis Taylor and
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Taylor, Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Another clip request: For years, I've been unable to find pencil
clips _ those little metal things that slip over six-sided pencils
so you can clip them onto pockets. Have they been declared lethal
or something? If not, where can I find them?
</P>
<P>
   _The Rev. James E.
</P>
<P>
   Hacke, Griffin
</P>
<P>
   A: Clipping right along, we found your silver-colored pencil
gizmos at Artlite Office Supplies &AMP; Pens, 1851 Piedmont Road N.E.
(404-875-7271). Each one is 29 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Seems as if I've been searching forever for a small
4-by-2-inch nylon ``shoe wallet'' in which you can carry ID and
coins. It attaches to the laces on a running shoe. I am quite sure
I purchased the last one here in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   _Vic Bond, Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: No one will pick your pocket when you wear a ``shoe pocket''
on your running shoes. It attaches via a hook and loop tape
fastener and comes with or without a piece of reflective tape. We
found this handy item for $5 at two places: Fleet Feet Sports,
Sandy Springs Plaza, 6221 Roswell Road N.E. (404-255-3338) and at
Phidippides, two locations: 220 Sandy Springs Circle N.W.
(404-255-6149) and 1544 Piedmont Ave. N.E. (404-875-4268).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Scott's Liquid Gold ``Touch of Scent'' wall
dispenser refill.
</P>
<P>
   _Helen B. Darsey, Avondale Estates, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Every room will be as fresh as a spring day with a Touch of
Scent Air Freshener in the Potpourri scent. According to the
manufacturer, ``one touch is all you need for a long-lasting
fragrance.'' Each refill is $2.19. We found our 2.5-ounce can at
Drug Emporium, 2953 N. Druid Hills Road N.E. (404-636-6108). If you
don't have a dispenser, call for an order form at 1-800-227-8111.
Or visit Scott's Web site, www.touch-of-scent.com.

<P>
   Q: I am interested in finding utz potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   _Lance Baden, Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since 1921, the family of Salie and Bill Utz has been making
and selling potato chips in Hanover, Pa. At first, Salie made the
chips in a small house behind their home and Bill delivered them.
In 1936, they started using an automatic potato chip cooker, which
could produce 300 pounds of chips per hour. Today, the company
turns out more than 12,000 chips per hour in such flavors as
regular, crab, salt and vinegar, sour cream and onion. You've had
trouble finding the chips because they are sold only in
Northeastern and North Central states. However, you can get your
fix of utz chips by ordering them via mail at 1-800-367-7629, Ext.
138. Or visit the Web site, www.utzsnacks.com. An 11-ounce bag
retails for $2.49. Utz also produces pretzels, popcorn and
decorative cans.

<P>
   It doesn't get much better than this _ and that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The current U.S. economy _ dubbed Goldilocks by many, because
like the perfect porridge it's neither too hot nor too cold _ faces
a number of scares in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three bears _ the Federal Reserve Board, China, and
YK2 _ is likely to be ferocious enough to send the fair-haired girl
tumbling out the window, but together they will be enough to keep
the stock market on edge for at least the remainder of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for more volatility as investors hop from sector to
sector and stock to stock trying to find one that's just right.
</P>
<P>
   The current stock market is priced for perfection. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index, for example, traded on July 16 at 36.97
times earnings for the previous 12 months. That record
price-to-earnings ratio fully incorporates what looks like a great
year for corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter U.S. equity strategist Peter Canelo,
for one, projects that earnings for the S&AMP;P 500 will increase by 14
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   No one needs to search too hard to find the forces behind that
whopping increase. The improving global economy has produced
growing sales volume for those multinational companies that took
the biggest hit in the global crisis of 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to firming prices for the goods they sell and very modest
increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor they buy,
corporations have seen those increased sales volumes multiply by
the time they hit the bottom line as earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Morgan Stanley estimates that non-farm worker
productivity in the U.S. increased by 2.6 percent in the year ended
in June 1999, the best rate of increase in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, because wages haven't climbed much while
productivity has, the cost of a unit of labor increased by less
than 1 percent during the same period. That's the first time in
three years corporations have seen their labor costs rise by less
than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This state of perfection can't last much longer _ according to
the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   In June, after almost a year of looking for the ghosts of
inflation without finding any, the central bankers found enough to
scare themselves into raising short-term interest rates by 25 basis
points (100 basis points equal one percentage point).
</P>
<P>
   In his July 22 testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan warned that the Fed didn't think one hike would
solve the problem. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which
had fallen below 5.9 percent, rapidly climbed back above 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't seem to make much of a case for a resurgence
of inflation, but a majority of the Fed governors are determined to
shoot first and ask questions later. And for investors, that
matters much more than the quality of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market believes the Fed is serious about raising rates,
and that will put downward pressure on stocks. The pressure is
likely to continue until the bankers remove the uncertainty by
actually doing what investors now fear.
</P>
<P>
   Look to May and June of 1999 as a model for how the markets will
behave _ sinking on the worry and rallying on the news, even if the
news is a rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that almost certainly would deter the Federal Reserve
would be a resurgence of the financial crisis that rocked Asia in
1998. The region is clearly not out of the woods yet. The recovery
in Korea and Thailand appears to be real, but fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Japan cannot convincingly shake its recession. And now China
shows signs that it is considering a devaluation of its currency,
the yuan, an act that would send the area back into turmoil. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese could be on the verge of a Japanese-style
deflationary spiral. Consumer prices have fallen in China for 21
consecutive months. At the same time, the Chinese savings rate has
climbed to 42 percent of household income _ people are putting
money away for an increasingly uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, growth in the gross domestic product has slowed in
each year since 1996, and last year China's economy grew by a
lackluster 4 percent, according to non-governmental economists (the
Chinese government claims GDP grew by 7.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The glut of manufactured goods such as televisions is so great
that even price cuts of 25 percent can't clear the market. In some
industries, companies have closed factories for months to reduce a
mountain of inventory. That, of course, just increases fear (and
cuts incomes) and sends consumer spending lower. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Devaluing the yuan so that Chinese exports are cheaper is a
tempting short-term solution. It would undoubtedly produce a spike
in exports _ until China's neighbors responded with their own
devaluations and set off a trade war that no side would win and
that would be blamed on the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation would probably kill China's attempt to gain entry to
the World Trade Organization this year or next.
</P>
<P>
   That the Chinese are even willing to consider devaluation is a
sign of how dire the situation is. China's leaders know that a
deflationary spiral, once in place, can last for a decade or more _
all they have to do is look across the narrow sea for proof of
that.
</P>
<P>
   And domestic stability in China depends on strong economic
growth. China needs to add 7.5 million jobs a year just to hold
unemployment steady at the current 10 percent in cities and 30
percent in the countryside. The regime knows that the hope of a
better tomorrow is essential to contain potential unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting what China will do is almost impossible _ the
country's course of action depends on massive political and
complicated internal struggles.
</P>
<P>
   It is that unpredictability that will send the bond market (and
with it parts of the equity market) into a speculative tizzy from
time to time over the remainder of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Neither a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike (or two) nor the
devaluation of the yuan would mean the end of the world, but worry
over those two issues certainly helps set the stage for those who
believe the YK2 problem will cause the demise of civilization as we
know it. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what the widespread use of two-digit year dates in
computer software will do to computer systems around the world in
January 2000. The absence of major problems so far _ computer
systems that make payments or order inventory, for example, have
been coping with the dating issue for months now _ makes it likely
that any blowups will be localized.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that no one knows. In that atmosphere of
uncertainty, investors tend to see a monster under every bed. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's the likely effect of these worries on the stock market
during the next several months? In each case, at the moment, the
risk is all on the downside.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is already reflected in the prices of financial
assets; the bad news is just starting to get factored in. In
situations like that, investors tend to sell at the first sign of
real or imagined trouble.
</P>
<P>
   During May and June, that led to an over-sold market as
investors marked down everything. That was followed by a July
rally. And in early August, stocks and bonds took another tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Expect more of the same: lots of action without much direction. &QL;

points (100 basis points equal one percentage point).
</P>
<P>
   In his July 22 testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan warned that the Fed didn't think one hike would
solve the problem. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which
had fallen below 5.9 percent, rapidly climbed back above 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't seem to make much of a case for a resurgence
of inflation, but a majority of the Fed governors are determined to
shoot first and ask questions later. And for investors, that
matters much more than the quality of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market believes the Fed is serious about raising rates,
and that will put downward pressure on stocks. The pressure is
likely to continue until the bankers remove the uncertainty by
actually doing what investors now fear.
</P>
<P>
   Look to May and June of 1999 as a model for how the markets will
behave _ sinking on the worry and rallying on the news, even if the
news is a rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that almost certainly would deter the Federal Reserve
would be a resurgence of the financial crisis that rocked Asia in
1998. The region is clearly not out of the woods yet. The recovery
in Korea and Thailand appears to be real, but fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Japan cannot convincingly shake its recession. And now China
shows signs that it is considering a devaluation of its currency,
the yuan, an act that would send the area back into turmoil. &QL;

<P>
   The Chinese could be on the verge of a Japanese-style
deflationary spiral. Consumer prices have fallen in China for 21
consecutive months. At the same time, the Chinese savings rate has
climbed to 42 percent of household income _ people are putting
money away for an increasingly uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, growth in the gross domestic product has slowed in
each year since 1996, and last year China's economy grew by a
lackluster 4 percent, according to non-governmental economists (the
Chinese government claims GDP grew by 7.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The glut of manufactured goods such as televisions is so great
that even price cuts of 25 percent can't clear the market. In some
industries, companies have closed factories for months to reduce a
mountain of inventory. That, of course, just increases fear (and
cuts incomes) and sends consumer spending lower. &QL;

<P>
   Devaluing the yuan so that Chinese exports are cheaper is a
tempting short-term solution. It would undoubtedly produce a spike
in exports _ until China's neighbors responded with their own
devaluations and set off a trade war that no side would win and
that would be blamed on the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation would probably kill China's attempt to gain entry to
the World Trade Organization this year or next.
</P>
<P>
   That the Chinese are even willing to consider devaluation is a
sign of how dire the situation is. China's leaders know that a
deflationary spiral, once in place, can last for a decade or more _
all they have to do is look across the narrow sea for proof of
that.
</P>
<P>
   And domestic stability in China depends on strong economic
growth. China needs to add 7.5 million jobs a year just to hold
unemployment steady at the current 10 percent in cities and 30
percent in the countryside. The regime knows that the hope of a
better tomorrow is essential to contain potential unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting what China will do is almost impossible _ the
country's course of action depends on massive political and
complicated internal struggles.
</P>
<P>
   It is that unpredictability that will send the bond market (and
with it parts of the equity market) into a speculative tizzy from
time to time over the remainder of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Neither a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike (or two) nor the
devaluation of the yuan would mean the end of the world, but worry
over those two issues certainly helps set the stage for those who
believe the YK2 problem will cause the demise of civilization as we
know it. &QL;

   No one knows what the widespread use of two-digit year dates in
computer software will do to computer systems around the world in
January 2000. The absence of major problems so far _ computer
systems that make payments or order inventory, for example, have
been coping with the dating issue for months now _ makes it likely
that any blowups will be localized.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that no one knows. In that atmosphere of
uncertainty, investors tend to see a monster under every bed. &QL;

   What's the likely effect of these worries on the stock market
during the next several months? In each case, at the moment, the
risk is all on the downside.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is already reflected in the prices of financial
assets; the bad news is just starting to get factored in. In
situations like that, investors tend to sell at the first sign of
real or imagined trouble.
</P>
<P>
   During May and June, that led to an over-sold market as
investors marked down everything. That was followed by a July
rally. And in early August, stocks and bonds took another tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Expect more of the same: lots of action without much direction. &QL;

`ACTION' COULD BE THE TV SEASON'S FUNNIEST OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fall season's most hyped show is also the most controversial
and perhaps even the funniest. The bleeping bleeps can say whatever
they want, ``Action'' is not only a bracing tonic for television,
it's a searing sendup of Hollywood movies, the people behind them
and, ultimately, all of us. So what if it accomplishes all of that
by swearing at and skewering anything in its path?
</P>
<P>
   The show is damn funny. Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action,'' which debuts Thursday evening, was originally
developed for HBO, and it contains all the hallmarks of pay-cable
freedom: swearing, anti-P.C. sentiments and the kind of hip insider
punch lines that say, ``If you don't get it, go watch CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fox has smartly bleeped out the swear words instead of
rewriting them into some kind of soft acceptable alternative, and
the network has otherwise left this series untouched _ one of the
smartest moves it has made in some time.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what will the audience think? Will people like
the abrasive, unlikable main character, will they tolerate the
everybody-knows-what-you're-saying bleep-outs, and will they get
all the industry humor?
</P>
<P>
   Let's put this bluntly: If you think a cameo involving Keanu
Reeves having sex _ no, not that kind _ in a theater, or perhaps
the best O.J. Simpson gag in ages is just plain bad taste, you're
going to hate this show.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you appreciate razor-sharp humor, biting
social commentary and gratuitous anger and swearing, well, settle
into the sofa, you daring viewer, and get a load of what could be
the season's finest offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' stars stand-up comic Jay Mohr (he was the obnoxious
sports agent in ``Jerry Maguire'') as the obnoxious and brutally
frank movie producer Peter Dragon, whose specialty is empty-headed
action movies that have made his parent studio a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   When Dragon drives onto the studio lot and parks in the spot of
Manny Sanchez, cafeteria worker, who was just awarded that space as
employee of the month, he points out _ in one of the best rants
you'll ever see this side of Dennis Miller _ that he's ``employee
of the (bleeping) century!'' and can park wherever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Illeana Douglas (``Grace of My Heart'') plays Wendy Ward, a
child star turned Hollywood prostitute who ends up being Dragon's
best evaluator of talent, someone who really knows the pulse of the
nation and won't suck up to him the way his other employees do.
</P>
<P>
   When she's the only one who will tell him the truth _ that his
latest $150 million action picture is a flop _ Dragon's president
of production says, ``She's a whore?'' To which Dragon says, ``No,
she's a prostitute. You're my whore.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Hackett makes a comeback as Dragon's Uncle Lonnie, the
security guard/chauffeur for Dragonfire Films. Believe it or not,
it's fairly inspired casting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' is the product of executive producer Chris Thompson
(``The Larry Sanders Show,'' ``The Naked Truth'') and movie
producer Joel Silver (``The Matrix,'' ``Lethal Weapon'). They have
jammed so many industry jokes in the show it's like a poisonous
Valentine to Hollywood. And they make no attempt to explain things.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Dragon's mean and powerful studio boss Bob (Lee
Arenberg) has people in Hollywood scrambling to guess whom he's
modeled after, and several people who may or may not be the model
have already stepped forward to say they are flattered despite his
evilness.
</P>
<P>
   That he's a dead ringer, visually, for Barry Diller may be lost
on 80 percent of the viewers, but Thompson and Silver don't care.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should they. ``Action'' has enough universal themes _ greed,
meanness, Hollywood stupidity, entertainment and, deep down, a big
heart _ that a lot of viewers can glom onto it despite the inside-
baseball approach. Besides, with Silver in tow, the show is
expected to have celebrity cameos every week. That they have Reeves
in the pilot is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and a word on that pilot: ``Action'' is a half-hour sitcom,
but Fox, sensing the building hype, has expanded the premiere to
one hour, but didn't have the final product ready to preview. All
of the 30-minute pilot sent to critics will appear Thursday,
however, and you can rest assured that if the other half is as
funny, you'll be shifting your viewing habits pretty quickly.

COMPUTERS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By J.D.BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. If Windows 98 Second Edition requires at least a 486
processor, why do computer makers offer that operating system but
processors at 366, 400 and 450? A. Advertisements for computer
systems are full of confusing numbers and abbreviations. The
confusion in this case is between model numbers and chip-speed
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``486'' you might see in system requirements refers to the
model number for the Intel 80486 microprocessor. The 486, highly
popular with home users in the early 1990s, was the fastest chip
available until Intel introduced the Pentium family of
microprocessors in 1993. The Pentium chip has been through several
generations and is now up to the Pentium III. Other companies, like
Advanced Micro Devices, also manufacture Intel-compatible chips for
PC's.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers you saw in the recent advertisement (366, 400 and
450) were referring to the different clock rates of these newer
microprocessors. The clock rate is the speed at which a
microprocessor can execute instructions, and it is usually measured
in megahertz. Some old 486 chips have a clock rate of 33 megahertz,
but the new Pentium III (or competing brand) chips have clock rates
of 600 MHz, and even faster speeds will be coming along.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I use Windows 98 and my computer screen flickers a lot. What
I can do?
</P>
<P>
   A. You might try changing the refresh rate of your screen to a
different setting. (The refresh rate is how many times your
computer redraws the screen per second.)
</P>
<P>
   Go to the Start menu, then to Settings and Control Panel.
Double-click on Display; in Display Properties, click the Settings
tab. Click on Advanced, then on the Adapter tab to see refresh rate
options, including the Optimal choice for your system. Lowering the
Desktop area setting (also in the Display control panel) could give
you more refresh rate choices.
</P>
<P>
   You might also try calling the makers of your video card and
monitor, or visiting their Web sites for technical support
information. You may be able to download updated device drivers for
your hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology, by

`CHILE PEPPER' MAGAZINE SEEKS JUST THE RIGHT BLEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DICK REAVIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard enough for magazines to make money, but a bimonthly
magazine about ... peppers? Can a title published in Fort Worth,
Texas, by two men with nothing in common except middle age and,
again, peppers, succeed?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, say ``Chile Pepper'' publisher Joel Gregory and
editor Robb Walsh. They will be unique because their audience is
unique: Of the magazine's 60,000 readers, 70 percent are male.
``Chile Pepper,'' Walsh says, ``is the only cooking magazine in the
country with a predominantly male readership.''
</P>
<P>
   The editor-publisher team plans to turn that difference, like
the differences between the two of them, into an advantage. They
intend to establish grilling and barbecuing as parts of the
magazine's franchise, because outdoor sauces are often spicy _ and
because outdoor cooking is a male favorite. Adopting the prophet's
role, Gregory declares that ``Chile Pepper could become to hot and
spicy foods and outdoor cooking what `Cigar Aficionado' is to
tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Gregory, 51 _ he of the deep-throated drawl _ is a
Fort Worth native, the former pastor of Gambrell Street and Travis
Avenue Baptist churches. For a while, he was also pastor and heir
apparent to W.A. Criswell at First Baptist Church of Dallas. Walsh,
46, from New England and Austin, describes himself as a ``former
hippie'' _ with emphasis on ``hippie,'' not ``former.'' The
contrast between the publisher and editor is apparent even at a
glance: Gregory wears somber Sunday suits and a Rolex. Walsh wears
a mulitcolored Lego watch, no tie and no socks.
</P>
<P>
   Their journal of hot and spicy foods was founded in Albuquerque,
N.M., in 1987. Its first editor, David Dewitt, a New Mexico radio
personality and show promoter, appealed to the eccentricities of
``chileheads'' with articles that carried titles such as
``Armadillo Tamales and Other Delights.'' But he inspired some of
the gastronomy network's talent: Walsh wrote his first magazine
article for Chile Pepper in 1991, an apt piece, ``Confessions of a
Hot Sauce Smuggler.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite management changes, chile fanciers didn't abandon the
magazine. ``We have an extremely loyal readership,'' Gregory says,
pointing to reams of lengthy surveys that subscribers have mailed
to the editors. The magazine has about 40,000 subscribers. To
attract female readers, Gregory and Walsh will pursue the kind of
articles on light and healthful fare that have made ``Cooking
Light'' _ with a circulation of 1.6 million, the largest of the
foodzines _ a hit with women.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest transition for the magazine has to be the
unlikely pairing of the preacher and the hippie. After leaving
Dallas and the daily ministry in 1992, Gregory returned to Fort
Worth to sell cemetery plots and operate a clinic for preachers in
need of sermon seasoning. In 1994, he penned ``Too Great a
Temptation,'' an autobiography of his rise and fall at First
Baptist in Dallas. The book was published by the Summit Group, a
Fort Worth publishing house. Early the next year, when Summit spun
off a magazine firm, the Magnolia Media Group, Gregory entered the
company's ranks as a manager, even giving the new firm its name, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   As an editor and publisher at MMG, which produces a half-dozen
niche and regional titles, including ``Fort Worth'' magazine and
``Pet Life,'' Gregory shepherded ``Chile Pepper'' to press.
Gregory, who says that he has always been a fan of picante fare,
soon began looking for a way to make a name for himself as an
owner-publisher. A former member of his Dallas flock, insurance
magnate Karl Singer, and his sometimes partner, Fort Worth investor
James Goldsmith, came to his aid, and in May the
money-and-Scriptures men bought ``Chile Pepper'' from MMG.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory quickly discovered that ``I was wearing too many hats,''
and decided to hire an editor. When Walsh heard about the opening,
he wasn't sure that he wanted to apply. Austin had been his home
since 1970, when he moved there for college. He was also wary of
Gregory's biblical reputation, and his free-lancing career was in
fine shape, if such a thing is possible. In 1995, his book about
Jamaican fare had been published, followed in 1998 by ``Nuevo
Tex-Mex.'' In February, a book with Reata chef Grady Spears, ``A
Cowboy in the Kitchen,'' had been released. He ran the the Austin
Chronicle Hot Sauce Festival, which Walsh began in 1991 ``because
some people get a buzz from eating chiles,'' and he was a
contributor to National Public Radio's ``Weekend Edition.'' Perhaps
most important, he had just won, for the second time, the James
Beard Journalism Award, ``something like the Academy Awards of the
food business.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was a bit intrigued by the idea of returning to a magazine
for which he once wrote, and once the contract was completed in
August, Walsh moved into the Fairmount historical neighborhood _
and quickly became enamored of the mag's town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fort Worth'' he says, ``is the Texas that I moved here to live
in in 1970.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways,'' Walsh says, ``the old `Chile Pepper' was a
lifestyle magazine. Under MMG, it became more of a cooking
magazine. I want a marriage of both.''
</P>
<P>
   The wedding of features and readers that Walsh and Gregory plan
to solemnize is not entirely implausible, nor is ``Chile Pepper's''
Fort Worth location a great disadvantage, peers in the magazine
trade say. DeWitt says that in the years since the publication was
born, ``the magazine and chiles have both gone mainstream. Walsh
will give back to the magazine some of the edge that it originally
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Davis, executive editor at ``Cooking Light'' _ published in
Birmingham, Ala. _ observes that ``chile peppers are being
appreciated across more of the United States, thanks probably to
demographic changes such as the expansion of the Latino and Asian
population, and also the fact that people travel more and hear more
through the various media, including new ideas about food and
cooking.'' But tying lifestyle to recipes won't be easy, he
advises, and the magazine's immediate need, he says, is to improve
its editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   The next issue, on sale in October, won't show the full teamwork
of Gregory and Walsh; readers will have to wait until January for
that. With that in mind, ``Cooking Light's'' Davis, a former Austin
resident, recalls the days of a defunct but much-missed Austin
hangout, ``Maybe Gregory and Walsh could use the old Raw Deal sign
as a motto: `It'll be better next time.' '' (Visit the

   Most people think of mold and mildew as minor household
annoyances that can be dealt with by spraying with a bathroom
cleaner. This is effective for small patches of mold, but it's not
sufficient to deal with larger infestations, which can become a
serious health hazard. Some environmental inspectors estimate that
at least 10 percent of the houses in the United States have enough
mold contamination to make the occupants sick.
</P>
<P>
   Mold and mildew are common names for a variety of species of
filamentous fungi _ microscopic stalk-like plants that grown on
substances of plant or animal origin, like paper or leather. The
stalks, called mycelium, support the fruit, or spores. Collectively
these plants may look fuzzy; others may look slimy. Both stalks and
spores present some health hazard, but spores are the bigger threat
because they break away from the stalk and become airborne, where
they can easily be inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   They need two things to grow: organic nutrients (paper,
cellulose, dust from the skin or even oil from a fingerprint) and
moisture. They can grow at temperatures between 32 and 95 degrees
Fahrenheit, but most species thrive at common household
temperatures. The moisture may be in the form of water or
moisture-laden air with a relative humidity above 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When the mold digests the organic nutrients, it grows and
releases volatile organic substances like aldehydes, alcohols and
ketones. As these compounds evaporate, they give off the musty odor
that is characteristic of mold and mildew. If the temperature
drops, or the moisture dries up, the mold may stop growing and
become dormant until conditions change and favor renewed feeding
and reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Most homeowners believe that as long as they do not see visible
signs of mold, that is patches of green, blue, or black
discoloration on surfaces, their environment is free of
contamination. What they don't realize, however, is that large
accumulations of mold may be growing in areas that they cannot see,
like air ducts, remote attic or basement spaces, or wall cavities.
Left to multiply, these infestations may produce enough organic
compounds to cause allergic reactions, sickness and, in extreme
cases, death (a possibility with infants).
</P>
<P>
   The only tools you need to look for mold are a strong flashlight
and your nose. The flashlight will help you to see in dark corners
and recesses throughout the house. Your nose will help you detect
the musty odor that means mold is present. You may not be able to
see mold in enclosed areas, but you can often detect it because the
odor-laden spores will drift out through an electrical outlet or
crack in the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Because attic air is generally dry and hot, it might seem an
unlikely place for mildew growth, and, in most cases, it is.
However, a leak in the roof can add enough moisture to allow a mold
colony to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Pay particular attention to air-conditioning systems and
dehumidifiers because they pull water out of the air where it
condenses on cool surfaces. This condensed water can be enough to
nourish a mold colony.
</P>
<P>
   When you discover a light infestation of mold sediment, cleanup
is simple You can spray the area with a bleach solution _ one ounce
of ammonia-free detergent, one quart of household bleach and three
quarts of water _ and wipe clean.
</P>
<P>
   But for heavy concentrations of mold, you will have to take more
precautions. First set up a fan so it blows fresh air in your
direction. Then don goggles, a high-efficiency particulate
air-purifying respirator equipped with a chlorine cartridge and
rubber gloves. Spray the bleach solution on the mold. Use clean
cloths and clear water to wipe the area clean.
</P>
<P>
   Discard the cloths in double plastic bags and dump the rinse
water down the toilet. When the area is dry, vacuum it to remove
residual spores and particles. Do not, however, use an ordinary
household vacuum, which can stir up the spores and circulate them
in the air. Use a high-efficiency particulate air-purifying vacuum
(this can be rented) and go over the entire area.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to clean mildew and mold off porous surfaces
like wallpaper or fabric. It is usually better to remove these
materials and dispose of them in double plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   Removing heavy concentrations of mold from air and heating ducts
is a job for a professional. Consult with a contractor certified by
the National Air Duct Cleaners Association. The contractor will
seal the ducts to keep the mold from spreading through the house,
then use compressed air, high-efficiency particulate air-purifying
vacuums and duct whips to remove it.

VIDEO WINDOWS ON THE WORLD FOR THE DIGITAL HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Forget bricks and sheetrock. Get past the notion of computer
monitors and television sets. Someday the outside and inside of
your home may consist of liquid crystal displays that function as
walls, windows and multimedia portals.
</P>
<P>
   That's the future of domestic space as envisioned by Hariri &AMP;
Hariri, an architectural firm in New York City known for its
experimental designs.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the firm's most recent conceptual designs, huge
passive LCD screens take the place of walls and windows. When
turned on, the screens act as computer or video monitors,
displaying images, video, text or any other digitized information.
When turned off, the screens are transparent and look like
floor-to-ceiling windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this the building block of the future,'' said Mojgan
Hariri, an Iranian-born architect who co-founded Hariri &AMP; Hariri
with her sister, Gisue. Such blocks, Mojgan Hariri said, could be
prefabricated, off-the-shelf products that people might someday buy
at a place like the Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   A conceptual home based on their vision, which they call the
Digital House, is on display through Oct. 5 at the Museum of Modern
Art in New York. Visitors to a larger MOMA exhibit called the
Un-Private House can see a two-foot model of the house as well as
an animated videotaped rendering of how it might look and feel to
walk through such a space.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday afternoon, more than a dozen people were
gazing with amazement and skepticism at the scenes played out
before them.
</P>
<P>
   The video, for example, shows a person cooking dinner according
to directions given by a restaurant chef who had appeared on the
LCD screen in front of the kitchen counter. In a hallway, music and
video flash from a wall. In the living room, family members gather
to talk with friends who are not physically present but are
displayed in front of the sofa, larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   The architects envision people being able to unplug themselves
from such interactivity, too. When the screens are turned off,
``you can see beyond and through to nature,'' Mojgan Hariri said.
``It is that flexibility that we are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   They came up with the Digital House concept a year ago for an
article in House Beautiful magazine. Since then, Mojgan Hariri
said, ``a few people have come forward and want to build the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   But the technology is not quite as advanced as she and her
sister would like. Liquid crystal displays that can switch from
opaque to clear already exist, but images are projected onto the
screens. Hariri &AMP; Hariri are waiting for screens that are as smart
as computers, that essentially have no need for projectors. They do
not want designs to be hampered by the logistics of hiding
projectors in walls and ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters have talked to manufacturers like Philips and
Samsung about such a concept. ``Everyone is enthusiastic about the
possibilities of it,'' Mojgan Hariri said. ``But right now, they
are so busy they cannot even catch up with themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The hitch might revolve around more than simply a lack of time.
Display technology has inherent limitations, said Paul Semenza,
director of market analysis for Stanford Resources, a
market-research company that specializes in display technology.
Today's active displays, which are known as direct-view displays,
must include tubes or grids to provide color and definition. The
apparatus is hardly transparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Displays have a function of producing images, and that is
contradictory to using this as a window onto the world,'' Semenza
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another barrier may be cost. Considering the cost of flat-panel
televisions, Ms. Hariri imagines that a screen as large as 4 feet
by 8 feet _ a size that she imagines as a useful building block _
would most likely cost between $10,000 and $15,000 today. And
that's not even taking into account the technology required to turn
the screens into windows.
</P>
<P>
   But she adds: ``It's like anything else. I'll bet in two years,
the price of these screens will come down to $2,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Terence Riley, the curator of the MOMA exhibit, dismisses the
talk of technological limitation, calling it ``short-term''
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house is already an increasingly media-driven
environment,'' Riley said. ``This is a logical conclusion of what
is already a commonplace situation in the typical house.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley suggested that the technological building block that
architects would use might not even be the LCD but some other
technology. ``But the desire for these things is so great _ these
facades that can give information,'' he said, ``that I do think it
is eventually going to become possible.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first high-definition VCR is now on the market. But don't
assume that the technology behind it will become dominant, the way
VHS videotape rules the world today. In fact, the future looks
quite messy.
</P>
<P>
   At least three different formats and technologies for recording
high-definition broadcasts are butting heads in research
laboratories and product development studios around the world. For
the industry, and for consumers, this issue holds tremendous
importance. About 91 percent of American homes have a VCR, most
often more than one. The ability to play movies and record shows
has become a ubiquitous feature of home entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The nation has not yet entered one of those format wars endemic
to the consumer electronics industry. Most companies are simply
waiting and watching, trying to see which technology will ripen in
time to dominate the market as digital television becomes a
mainstream product in the years ahead. But unless all of the major
companies magically make the same choice, a format war seems
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Panasonic Corp. is the first to offer an
entry-level product, a digital, high-definition VCR based on the
VHS format. This updated version of the venerable standard is
called digital-VHS or D-VHS. It can record digital programs, even
high-definition programs, on a special $14.95 VHS videotape that
has a higher-quality magnetic coating. The machine can also serve
as a traditional VCR and record regular television shows on
conventional VHS tape _ all for a retail price of about $1,000,
twice as much as a typical high-end VCR today.
</P>
<P>
   Several other companies have announced plans to come out with
D-VHS products in the months ahead, even though many industry
leaders call this format an interim solution in the quest for the
definitive digital, high-definition recorder. But for the next year
or two at least, D-VHS machines may be the only option. The
alternatives aren't ready yet.
</P>
<P>
   That should not prove to be an important issue for any but a
tiny handful of consumers today, as there would be no reason to buy
a D-VHS machine if you did not already own an HDTV. And by the time
high-definition sets become a mainstream product, two or three
years from now, the alternative formats may be ready.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, a look at the new Panasonic VCR
indicates that D-VHS is hardly an unappealing interim option. The
new Panasonic machine works quite well, just like a regular VCR.
</P>
<P>
   The reason D-VHS machines are considered an interim compromise
is that they cannot easily offer all the versatility that consumers
have become accustomed to in a traditional VCR. For example, if you
record a high-definition television show and want to fast-forward
through the commercials when you watch it later on your HDTV, that
is not at all easy to do with a D-VHS machine. The reason is that
the VCR is recording a coded digital signal that cannot be watched
until it has been passed through a digital decoder. And these
decoders are not equipped to handle a highly complex digital signal
pouring in at two, three or four times the normal speed.
</P>
<P>
   The Panasonic device can provide a freeze frame of a
high-definition image when the user presses Pause. But most of the
other special functions that come with high-end VCR's, including
slow motion, are not available. When the tape is advanced quickly,
the monitor shows a still image of the last frame displayed before
the Advance button was pressed.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, 50 consumer electronics companies, including
Panasonic, agreed on a format for a new sort of digital,
high-definition VCR that would do everything a high-end analog VCR
can now do. The idea behind this industry agreement was to avert a
format war. The new system was called the digital videocassette, a
completely new format that would simultaneously record a
low-definition copy as well as the high-definition program. The
low-definition version would be used for ``trick effects,'' as they
are known in the industry: fast-forward, slow, reverse play and the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since then, that format has been used for
camcorders. But manufacturers appear to have forgotten about the
agreement to use it to build high-definition VCR's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anyone who is looking at it now,'' said Ed
Milbourn, a senior executive at Thomson Consumer Electronics, the
maker of RCA, Proscan and General Electric equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The reason seems to be that most manufacturers are betting that
one of two competing technologies will replace tape-based recorders
altogether in the next two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   The leading candidate is a high-definition DVD recorder. But
Milbourn said he, like others in the industry, was also keeping his
eye on video recorders based on hard drives, like the Replay
Networks or Tivo video recorders that are on the market now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can integrate those in a TV easily, and they can be a lot
cheaper than a DVD recorder,'' he said. But high-definition video
eats huge amounts of storage space, and the technology behind
hard-drive video recorders will have to advance significantly
before they can hold larger quantities of data.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Similar hurdles await a high-definition DVD recorder. DVD
recorders are possible now for conventional video, but the
marketing of such recorders is hampered by the two most common
problems afflicting the consumer electronics industry: format wars
and piracy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the DVD Forum, a consortium of companies that
control the format, agreed several years ago on a format for
recordable DVD's, several manufacturers ignored that agreement and
began promoting competing formats. And to prevent piracy, Hollywood
is insisting that any digital recording format be designed to
prevent the copying of movies. The standard for that has not been
agreed upon, either. Both those problems have held up the
aggressive marketing of DVD recorders.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a different technology must be perfected, one that
uses a blue laser, which has a shorter wavelength than the red ones
now in use. Changing to a blue laser is the most practical way to
increase the storage capacity of a DVD so it can hold a
high-definition movie. The capacity of a DVD must more than double,
to about 17 gigabytes. A blue laser with a shorter wavelength can
read smaller pits burned into the surface of a DVD. And the more
pits, representing digital ones and zeros, the greater the
recording time of the disk.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, a Japanese company began shipping sample
quantities of a blue laser to manufacturers. But the actual
commercial sale of DVD products using a blue laser is thought to be
at last two years away. ``As soon as the essential factors such as
the short-wave laser are ready, the work will begin,'' Toshihiro
Sugaya, chief specialist of the optical-disk technology department
at Toshiba, told the journal Electronic Engineering Times in June.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, consumers are being offered the D-VHS format.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kelsey, vice president of the Panasonic Audio Group, said
the company did not view D-VHS as an interim format. ``My
understanding is that the format will be improved so that it can
eventually include these other features,'' he said. Panasonic has a
stake in the continued health of D-VHS.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic's parent company, the Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co., is the majority owner of JVC, the inventor of VHS and D-VHS.
And JVC will receive licensing royalties for every D-VHS deck sold.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Panasonic's product works as a digital
recorder only in a closed, proprietary system in conjunction with a
Panasonic digital receiver box. It can record a conventional
television signal from an antenna or cable connection, just as any
VCR does. But digital programming is received only through a
special cable that connects the VCR to Panasonic's receiver box.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the VCR works quite simply. And not surprisingly,
digital copies of high-definition programming are flawless. There
is no easily apparent difference between the original and the
recorded copy _ just as it should be with a digital device.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the VCR may be uncertain. But with D-VHS, the
present feels quite comfortable and familiar.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The rural house we recently moved into has no smoke alarms
and we would like to install as many as needed. Where should we
locate them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some local codes require one in each bedroom, but most people
install one outside the door of each bedroom or sleeping area. Do
not install them more than about 10 or 12 feet away from the
bedroom door, and don't place them in the kitchen, furnace room or
workshop where many false alarms (due to fumes, etc.) can occur.
Also, place them at least 10 or 12 inches away from wall and
ceiling corners as shown here, but make sure they are at least
three feet away from open windows and cold air or return duct
openings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to paint the front of my dishwasher to help
spruce up my kitchen. What kind of paint do you think I should use?
</P>
<P>
   A: The toughest paint would be a two-part epoxy paint, but you
can also use any good grade of alkyd enamel. If you do decide to
use an epoxy, bear in mind that careful and thorough preparation of
the surface is essential _ so read and follow directions carefully.
Even with an alkyd you have to clean and sand the surface before
painting, but in general this type of paint is more ``forgiving''
than an epoxy if you are not as thorough in the preparation of the
old surface.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My house is on a busy street with lots of traffic, so noise
is always a problem during the day and early evening hours. The
windows have only a single pane of glass, so I am wondering if I
can reduce the noise by installing storm windows over each window,
or by replacing the old ones with new double-pane windows. Which do
you think would offer the best chance of noise reduction and be
most economical?
</P>
<P>
   A: Storm sash would certainly cost a lot less and if properly
installed (with good caulking around the frames) they would
probably help reduce noise just as much as replacing the existing
windows with more expensive new double-pane models.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to install a large whole-house attic fan to help cool
the house during the summer after the sun goes down, but I am
confused about how and where the fan should be installed. Should I
lay it horizontally over the opening in the upstairs ceiling and
directly over the louvers on the attic floor to permit the fan to
draw air up from below, or should I install the fan vertically
against one of the end walls in the attic?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although both methods are used, installing the fan
horizontally over the ceiling louvers is easier and often more
effective as there is less chance of drawing hot air in from
outside if the attic is not really airtight (often impossible in
attics that have openings around the eaves for venting
condensation). However, you will also have to install louvered
openings at each end of the attic so that the exhausted air can
escape easily to the outside. These openings must have a total
unobstructed area that is at least 10 percent larger than the fan's
ceiling opening.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``SMOKE DETECTOR PLACEMENT'' goes with
this column.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Smoke detectors should be installed at least 12 inches
away from each corner, whether on the ceiling or wall.

   Alien life forms! Hidden messages! Secret formulas! Naked women!
</P>
<P>
   That's not what one would expect from a European manuscript that
appears to be about 400 years old. But this 7-by-10-inch, 234-page
parchment book in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at
Yale University has all that and more.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Voynich manuscript after Wilfred M. Voynich, a book
dealer who bought it in 1912 and tried for many years to unlock its
secrets, the book is a Holy Grail of sorts for cryptographers, as
well as other devotees of the unusual.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this book about? That's a good question. What does it
say? Nobody knows. It has never been read, because no one can
translate it.
</P>
<P>
   You can try reading it yourself, or at least see the pictures,
at www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/8389/voygal1.htm. An extensive
commentary on the manuscript, including its history and a summary
of theories as to its origin, is at www.voynich.nu, a site by Rene
Zandbergen, who is engaged in a European project to try to crack
its code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, I don't think that anyone believes the MS to contain
any historical secrets, but it is regrettable that this has been
used as an excuse to stop funding its research,'' Zandbergen wrote
by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Describing its appeal to code-breakers, he wrote: ``Some of the
greatest brains in cryptography of the 20th century have been
baffled by someone from the Middle Ages.'' He likened it to a high
school football team devising a game plan that baffles the Miami
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Students are fairly sure of a few facts: The manuscript existed
by the early 1600s, and was owned by various people in the court of
King Rudolph II of Bohemia (1552-1612) in Prague. Rudolph, who was
also Holy Roman Emperor, was an eccentric who was fascinated with
the occult, and attracted numerous scholars, pseudo-scientists and
mystics.
</P>
<P>
   A faint signature in the manuscript has been identified as that
of Jacobus Horcicki de Tepenecz, Rudolph's doctor, herbalist and
alchemist. The manuscript passed to another Bohemian court
physician, Johannes Marci of Prague, who gave it in about 1665 to
the Rev. Athanasius Kircher, a Jesuit scientist and mathematician
who was an expert on codes.
</P>
<P>
   Then it went to an Italian monastery, where it remained until
Voynich bought it. A letter enclosed with the manuscript, from
Marci to Kircher in Rome, states that Rudolph had paid 600 ducats
for it.
</P>
<P>
   It is lavishly illustrated with detailed plants and flowers,
none of which match any known plant. Some have human faces. There
are astrological symbols and drawings galore, which remain a
mystery. And adorning many of the flowers, buildings and other
drawings are tiny nude figures.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge is the writing. The manuscript's estimated
250,000 characters are in no known alphabet. They are arranged in
groups like words, and certainly look like a language, but no one
has ever conclusively translated a single page.
</P>
<P>
   The Voynich is the most studied medieval manuscript in the
Beinecke Library, attracting several hundred academics a year and a
good many more amateur scholars. It also attracts devotees who tend
to be passionate about their theories.
</P>
<P>
   The Beinecke sells microfilm and prints of the manuscript, and
is on line at www.library.yale.edu/beinecke.
</P>
<P>
   Serious academic students tend to be from the fields of
mathematics, statistics and linguistics. Some of the most dedicated
Voynich cryptographers have worked for the Army or the National
Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manuscript itself seems to have the attraction of a
poisonous flower,'' William R. Bennett Jr., emeritus professor of
engineering and applied science at Yale and a Voynich expert, wrote
by e-mail. ``Quite a few people have wasted the final decades of
their lives trying to decipher it and reacting to the numerous
pictures in it as if it were some kind of medieval Rorschach test.
Good luck, but be careful!''
</P>
<P>
   People have suggested that the manuscript is a heretical tract
by Isis followers, or an astronomical thesis by Roger Bacon, the
13th-century Franciscan, or an almanac, or an alchemist's guide, or
a secret list of herbal remedies.
</P>
<P>
   A widespread opinion is that the manuscript was created to
separate Rudolph from his ducats, and that much of the writing (but
not necessarily all) is gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best guess is that the manuscript was a deliberate hoax,''
Bennett wrote, naming John Dee, an English mathematician and
astrologer at Rudolph's court, as the likely suspect. ``I suppose
he argued that it contained the secret of eternal life, wanted a
high price for his efforts, and didn't want to create anything that
could be deciphered.''

 &HT;    LATINOS WORRY THAT THEIR CHILDREN FACE UNFAIR TESTS
 &HT;    300&AMP;add
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of thousands of children who are still
learning English are being harmed by the invalid use of some
standardized tests that measure progress in public school reforms,
the Presidential Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for
Hispanic Americans reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Office of Civil rights should investigate the use of
tests with Hispanic students, especially English language
learners,'' recommended the 21-member commission, which was formed
by President Clinton six years ago. It also called upon the federal
government to fund more research into how to avoid bias in tests
administered to Hispanic students.
</P>
<P>
   ``State policies often require that Hispanic students be
assessed in English with tests they may not even understand, or
with alternative but less rigorous tests in Spanish, whether or not
they are receiving instruction in that language,'' said the
commission's report. ``Neither approach produces accurate
information about student learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet children with low scores on those tests risk being denied
promotion to the next grade or a regular high school diploma, the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many states exempt Spanish-speaking students
from tests intended to discover which schools or districts need
outside intervention or extra resources to get up to par. So those
schools don't get the extra help their students need in order to
master the English language and other subjects, the commission
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in high-stakes tests, and of course there are valid
tests,'' said the commission's chair, Ana ``Cha'' Margarita Guzman,
executive vice president of Austin Community College in Texas.
``However, the stakes need to be high for the school districts and
the schools _ not for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commission singled out Texas as an example of a state that
for the most part uses valid tests correctly in measuring
educational results. But it argued that the educational needs of
some some students may be neglected during the ``grace period'' in
which they are exempt from assessment tests until their English
skills are improved.
</P>
<P>
   In California, tests designed to diagnose learning problems are
instead being used improperly as a measure of language proficiency,
said a commission member, Sonia Hernandez, deputy superintendent of
the California Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has the opposite problem, where districts sometimes use
``tests that do not assess the students' content knowledge, but
assess their language fluency,'' said another commissioner, Erlina
Paize Archuleta of the Colorado Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   While elementary school students in Colorado can take tests in
their native language, funds haven't been made available to develop
similar tests for middle or high school students, she said.
</P>
<P>
   About half the nation's school districts have some students
learning English as a second language. Seven out of 10 are from
Spanish-speaking families, the commission said. Most of the Spanish
speakers live in California, Texas, New York, Florida or Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The commission recently began work on a state-by-state analysis
of the use of high-stakes tests. Its preliminary research showed:
</P>
<P>
   -- Nearly 20 states have adopted reforms in which graduation or
promotions to the next grade can depend completely or in part on
tests the children may not understand. For example, math tests can
contain word problems that pose trouble to youngsters who are not
native to the language of the test.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 40 of the 49 states that use tests of students to learn
which schools need intervention or extra resources, students with
limited English proficiency are exempted from all or some of the
key tests.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said that Texas and North Carolina are the only
states in which minority and disadvantaged children are rapidly
closing the gap between their performance and those of other
students on statewide exams. Texas, Oregon and Minnesota were
singled out as states that have made great progress in developing
``fair and accurate'' standardized tests.

TALK SHOW HOST FIGHTS TO KEEP HER VOICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Diane Rehm loses her voice, 700,000 people know it _ almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   She hesitates, strains and struggles to get the words out.
Listening to her over the radio, you can't help but feel her
distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strangled hoarseness fills my voice with tremors and makes
me sound like a very old woman,'' Rehm says. ``It's very
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   And she never knows when it might happen.
</P>
<P>
   This week, her voice is strong and pleasant. It doesn't sound
like the typical radio-talk-show voice, if only because it is more
respectful and less sarcastic and flippant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had six Botox injections, and my voice is quite strong,''
she says in a telephone visit. ``I will go as long as I can without
another. When I need another, believe me, I'll know it. I'll hear
it on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been five weeks since Rehm's last injection with Botox,
the brand name for the purified botulinum toxin that doctors at
Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center periodically inject directly into
her vocal cords to relax them and prevent them from clamping
together so tightly as to prevent the flow of speech.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a cough and slight tremor in Rehm's voice seven
years ago was finally diagnosed about 18 months ago as ``spasmodic
dysphonia,'' a type of dystonia or involuntary muscle spasm that
interferes with speech.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is still unknown and there is no cure, but there are
several treatments, including Botox and a drug used to control
epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two weeks after her first Botox injection, Rehm
had no voice. It took five weeks for her voice to come back enough
to resume her popular radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't lose my voice at all, this last time,'' she says.
``It got very weak and breathy, but I never lost my voice
completely. I'm very lucky. I have no real side effects from the
botulinum. There have been people taking it as long as 15 years
without long-term side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehm timed her last injection so she would have three weeks to
get her voice back before leaving on a tour two weeks ago to
promote her new book, ``Finding My Voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, an autobiography, chronicles Rehm's traumatic
childhood and her quest to find her voice, figuratively and
literally, as a Washington talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes referred to as the female voice of public radio, Rehm,
who will turn 63 on Tuesday, says she never expected to have a
career.
</P>
<P>
   She was 37 with less than a year of college when she volunteered
in 1973 to work on ``The Home Show,'' a program at American
University's radio station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would marry and have children and be a wife and
mother, but I never expected any type of career. It was so
unexpected and late in life, out of the blue, an aberration _ young
Arab girl with no college education volunteers to work at radio
station,'' Rehm says.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 20 years, she has conducted live interviews with
Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, Gen. Colin Powell, Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, novelist John Grisham, actresses Liv Ullman, Audrey Hepburn
and Lauren Bacall, and hundreds of other politicians, writers and
movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``What causes the switchboard to light up and brings people to
radio is dealing with serious subjects that really concern
listeners, no matter who your guest is,'' Rehm says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to treat each guest and each caller with respect _
bring light instead of heat to each subject, no matter what you are
talking about or who you are talking with. That's what brings
people to radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the presidential campaign is over, Rehm would like to
talk to each candidate, and she believes she will get the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to hear each one's tone of voice, how he or she
interacts with listeners. I want to hear how they respond to
listeners' questions. I'm not interested in hammering away at them,
but in hearing how they sound as human beings,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, I would like to talk to the president before he leaves
office. I would like the chance to sit down for an hour's true
conversation with listeners one-on-one, our listeners around the
country _ no screening out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rehm has some other plans. Roger Mudd will be the
host for a black-tie gala Tuesday to celebrate Rehm's birthday and
the 20th anniversary of ``The Diane Rehm Show'' and to raise money
for American University's radio program. First lady Hillary Clinton
is the honorary chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of my career, my voice meant everything, but I was
able to say, `If this is God's will, I have had a wonderful career
for which I can be very thankful,' '' Rehm says. ``I pray a lot for
healing and strength, but I am one of the lucky ones. If it's never
any better than this, and I have to continue the injections, I can
live with that.''

EVEN A MOUSE THAT ROARS CAN SIT ON THE SIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Texas, N.C., Ohio)   (af)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your
door. It stands to reason that the time-worn adage about innovation
and capitalist reward would apply to better mice as well, at least
of the computer variety.
</P>
<P>
   By that measure, the vertical mouse, which resembles a gamer's
joystick, ought to be poised for commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The International Journal of Human-Computer
Interaction, a respected quarterly, published a study that said
switching to the odd-looking mouse had reduced the pain suffered by
computer users in their hands, arms and necks and also trimmed the
number of workdays lost to sick leave.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the past is any guide, the Anir Vertical mouse, also
known as Dr. Mouse, faces an uphill struggle, and its producer,
Animax International of Norway, will not be minting a fortune
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Industry history, economics and human nature resist an insurgent
product unless it promises a huge improvement in price or
performance or some other benefit. Economists call the forces
favoring the incumbent product ``lock-in'' and describe the steep
hurdle faced by an innovative newcomer as high ``switching costs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, it's the brain that is the real lock-in _ people's
habits are so difficult to change,'' said Hal Varian, an economist
at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ergonomic computer keyboards and mice have
found it frustratingly difficult to make major inroads. As many as
20 percent of the nation's 150 million computer users, especially
those working on their machines for four hours or more a day, are
considered by experts to be at risk of suffering repetitive stress
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Most ergonomic products try to reduce the strain of computer
work by putting the hands in a more natural position _ tilted with
the thumbs raised somewhat instead of having the hands splayed
flat, as they are when typing on a conventional keyboard or when
manipulating a standard mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful ergonomic product by far has been the
Microsoft Natural Keyboard, a wave-shaped, split keyboard that
raises the thumbs and separates the hands. Indeed, Microsoft's
hardware unit _ which produces mainly keyboards, mice and joysticks
_ is a quiet success story within the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a success story that contradicts the repeated claim
of the company's critics that Microsoft owes its success to the
inherent and unfair edge it enjoys because of its industry-standard
Windows operating system. Microsoft has no natural advantage in
hardware other than a well-known brand and deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rick Thompson, vice president of the hardware unit, said the
Natural Keyboard, introduced in 1994, did not take the market by
storm, as he had hoped. Today, roughly 120 million PCs are shipped
worldwide each year, nearly all of them with flat keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called aftermarket for replacement or enhanced keyboards
is about 3 million, and one in five of those have an ergonomic
design. In the ergonomic keyboard niche, Microsoft holds an
estimated two-thirds of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply can't cause most people to change from the standard
design even if your product is better,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's sense that the best product does not always win in
the marketplace is contradicted, however, by two economists who
have sided with Microsoft in its antitrust battle with the
government. Stanley J. Liebowitz, a professor of managerial
economics at the University of Texas at Dallas, and Stephen E.
Margolis, a professor of economics at North Carolina State
University, argue in their new book, ``Winners, Losers and
Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology''
(Independent Institute) that the best products do come out on top.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They say the importance of economic lock-in and switching costs
are vastly exaggerated, and that Microsoft's dominates the PC
software market thanks to hard work and superior business acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Liebowitz and Margolis are known for their shrewd critique of a
classic story about the success of a second-best product _ the
Qwerty keyboard layout, which became the standard design in the
1880s when it was used in vocational schools to teach touch-typing.
Later designs, notably the Dvorak keyboard, were said to allow
faster typing, but they never caught on. But Liebowitz and Margolis
concluded that August Dvorak had inflated his claims for his
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Liebowitz and Margolis have a bit more trouble explaining
away the leading modern example of what is often said to be a
second-best winner, Microsoft's DOS and, later, Windows, which
mimicked the look of Apple's Macintosh operating system, which was
introduced in 1984. They dismiss the Mac's several-year lead over
Windows, until recently, in ease of use as merely superior
``elegance'' _ not a real consideration, economically, they
suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it remains to be seen whether an innovation like the
vertical mouse can overcome the daunting challenges it faces.
</P>
<P>
   The field study just reported seems encouraging. It was
conducted by Dr. Arne Aaras, coordinator of health medical services
in Norway for Alcatel, the European telecommunications company, and
two assistants over six months.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at 69 computer users; it measured pain by using
questionnaires. Pain levels dropped 30 percent to 50 percent.
Alcatel and the Norwegian government financed the study.
</P>
<P>
   Other ergonomic experts are impressed. Marvin Dainoff, director
of the Center for Ergonomic Research at Miami University in Ohio,
called the study powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the hurdles of habit and price are high. Researchers say
that it takes a day or so to learn how to use the vertical mouse
and that performance drops slightly.
</P>
<P>
   And the Anir Vertical mouse costs $50. ``Anything that knocks up
the price of a system is very tough to sell,'' said Neal Taslitz,
president of Humantouch Products.
</P>
<P>
   Mouse experts at Microsoft have not ruled out a vertical design,
but they are skeptical. ``You have to take account of the social
context in which a product will be used,'' said Edie Adams,
ergonomics manager of the company's hardware unit. ``A vertical
mouse would take a lot of motivation on the buyer's part.''
</P>

   Getting information into a handheld device has become easier
because handwriting recognition software has improved. But a
keyboard is still the preferred method for entering lots of text.
Keyboards for handheld devices are available, but until now, none
have been the size of a regular keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   A new company, Think Outside, in Solana Beach, Calif., announced
this week a folding keyboard called the Stowaway, for handheld
devices. Folded, the unit is about the size of a Palm III or the
new Handspring Visor and fits, though a little tightly, in a shirt
pocket. It opens up, like an accordion, into a full-size keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Oldort, Think Outside's chief executive and inventor of the
keyboard, said that the need for such a keyboard for the millions
of handheld devices in use was obvious. ``It's like the missing
piece of a puzzle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the keyboard won't be available until the holiday buying
season, Palm Computing has already committed to putting its name on
a version of it. Versions will be available for the Visor at the
same time and a Windows CE version will be available the first of

reports of children being injured, according to the Consumer
Product Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Until you receive a free repair kit from Cosco, you should not
use these seats as infant carriers. To request a kit or more
information, call the company at (800) 221-6736.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son is a huge fan of the Bigfoot monster truck. Is there a
club he can join? _ E.L.D., Bedford, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bigfoot International Fan Club costs $9.99 for a
three-year membership. Members receive five 8-by-10 photos,
postcards, a newsletter and a birthday surprise.
</P>
<P>
   To join, write to Bigfoot 4X4, 6311 N. Lindbergh Blvd., Dept.

stands 10 feet 6 inches high and weighs 11,000 pounds. Bob Chandler
began modifying it in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   There's an official Bigfoot World Wide Web site at
www.bigfoot4x4.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that the actor Chuck Connors played Major League
baseball briefly. What were his stats like? _ S.G., via the
Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Connors played one game for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1949 and
66 games for the Chicago Cubs in 1951, according to ``Total
Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed first baseman hit .238 in 202 at-bats, with two
home runs, 18 runs batted in and four stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Connors, who died in 1992 at age 71, also played basketball for
the Boston Celtics. In 1946, the first home game in team history
was delayed for an hour because the 6-foot-5 Connors broke a wooden
backboard with a pre-game dunk.  &QL;

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LESLIE LAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drainage Is Key to Anemones
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have tried several times to grow Anemone blanda with no
success. At first, I got 2 out of 25 _ until the gophers got those
2. Then I tried planting the bulbs in wire baskets, which convinced
me that the gophers weren't causing my failure. I admit I cannot
detect which end of the bulbs is up, so I have planted them
vertically hoping the roots or shoots would pick the up and down of
it.
</P>
<P>
   A. Anemone blanda bulbs are actually tubers, enigmatic
collections of bumps that look more like fossilized animal
droppings than anything else. Though many have a slightly flattened
quality that might lead you to think there is something vertical
going on, it doesn't mean anything.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, this is one case where you don't  &UR; need &LR;  to know
which end is up. ``It does not matter which way they are planted,''
said Dr. William B. Miller, a professor of flower-bulb and
greenhouse-crop physiology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
Commercially, they are just dropped into the soil.
</P>
<P>
   So, it isn't orientation that stands between you and a spring
carpet of daisylike white, blue and pink flowers. The culprit is
probably poor drainage or clay soil, both of which can lead to rot.
``Wet soils are the single most important cause of failure with
flower bulbs,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Climate must also be considered. Year-round heat won't do;
anemones need a period of cool winter dormancy. And bitter winters
would be just as bad. Authorities differ on just how cold-hardy A.
blanda are, but they do best where Fahrenheit temperatures do not
fall much further than 0 to 10 below.
</P>
<P>
   The Fruitful Concord Grape
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are Concord grapes just wild grapes that have become
cultivated, or is there something special about them?
</P>
<P>
   A. Depends on what you mean by ``just'' and ``special.'' Concord
grapes are a distinct variety, but they were developed from the
seeds of wild grapes (Vitis labrusca) by a grower named Ephraim
Bull of Concord, Mass. The first cuttings from the parent vine were
sold in 1849 or '50, and a decade later they had spread all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Concord is still special in being extremely good-looking,
juicy, and pleasant-tasting, but it is neither as sweet nor as
flavorful as Catawba, for instance, or Delaware, or Golden Muscat
or several other table grapes that also have labrusca ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   As a noted authority, Dr. U.P. Hedrick, wrote in 1944: ``This is
the most widely grown grape in North America. Black, cluster and
berry large; quality good but not the best. Vine characteristics
nearly perfect. Very fruitful.'' All still true, probably, since
Concord vines are remarkably long-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Beware the Breeding Mole
</P>
<P>
   Q. I seem to have a lot of mole holes and tunnels in my garden,
and I worry that some of the root vegetables will be attacked. One
suggestion has been to use nematodes to kill the grubs the moles
eat and thus drive them away. What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   A. Fear not. Or rather, no need to fear yet, since moles don't
eat vegetables. As long as they stay in the food garden, they're
doing mostly helpful things, like aerating the soil and removing
grubs. They'd be assets if they didn't also eat your valuable
earthworms. And (unwittingly) lend their tunnels to
vegetable-hungry mice and voles.
</P>
<P>
   And they do breed. So, sooner or later you're going to have more
moles than you'll need, at which point you'll discover that they
are the hardest of all animal pests to get rid of. You can't fence
them out, and folk repellents, including chewing gum and human
hair, seldom work.
</P>
<P>
   You can try spraying the earth near the tunnels with castor oil
solution (6 ounces of castor oil and 2 tablespoons of dishwashing
liquid in 1 gallon of water). That sometimes drives moles away. But
they might just go to the lawn, and then you'd really have
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mole-plagued lawn owners, whose sorrows range from dead grass to
broken ankles, have no recourse except trapping or using poison
gas. These methods work only until the next group of moles moves
in. But if employed in early spring, before breeding season starts,
these measures will help somewhat. Farm-supply stores sell the
equipment and provide instruction on how to use it.
</P>

GLOBAL AMBITIONS FOR A MICROSOFT DICTIONARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIN SCHOEN BROCKMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dictionary's main job is to answer questions, not to provoke
them. But even before installing the Encarta World English
Dictionary, I was arguing with the claims printed on its box.
Microsoft is marketing this product as ``the world's first global
English dictionary.'' Oh? What about the Oxford English Dictionary,
that 20-volume, 40,000-page, continually updated record of the
English language as spoken everywhere in the world (and available,
incidentally, both in its entirety and in abridged form on CD-ROM)?
</P>
<P>
   Let's go to promotional claim No. 2: ``Created for the new age
of global communication.'' I couldn't argue with that. It was
immediately apparent from the print version, released in July, that
this dictionary is multicultural in tone and content to an extent
that is, indeed, unprecedented. That attitude (and latitude) is
even more pronounced in the audiovisually empowered CD-ROM. The
idea of an absolutely up-to-the-moment, sex- and race-sensitive
dictionary with built-in Roget's Thesaurus, Computer Dictionary,
Style Guide, Almanac and Book of Quotations is a good one. But how
does such an ambitious project work in actual use?
</P>
<P>
   I asked Joan Cohen, an educational therapist in New Haven,
Conn., to try out the dictionary while writing one of her case
studies. She found that it responded quickly, and she was impressed
by the convenience of being able to switch rapidly between her text
and the dictionary or resources like the thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a break from her report, she fed the dictionary a few
tough words that her students might have to look up: pangaea,
archaea and eukarya. All of them are clearly defined. Then,
scrolling down the options under Bill Clinton, she decided to
investigate a few quotes. She liked the wittiness demonstrated not
only by the choices but also by their presentation. ``There have
been no scandals in this administration'' is filed under Delusions.
Returning to her work, Ms. Cohen looked up ``shut down.'' Its
little red megaphone icon was missing, which meant that she could
not tune in its spoken pronunciation. She wondered if other words
are without sound (the packaging touts the dictionary's audio
pronunciations).
</P>
<P>
   I didn't find any more missing megaphones, but there were other
slip-ups. I was surprised to see (and, of course, hear) the no
longer acceptable pronunciation of Mi'kmaq (an Indian tribe of
eastern Canada) as ``mik mak,'' instead of the now preferred ``meeg
maw.'' Definitions are deliberately simplified (``English has never
been easier'' is part of the marketing strategy), but they
sometimes border on the simplistic. Some etymologies are
unsatisfying. The citation for ``arugula,'' for instance, is
``origin uncertain: probably from dialectal Italian.'' Close, but
why not explain that ``arugula'' is the southern Italian
pronunciation of the standard Italian ``rucola''?
</P>
<P>
   At other points, the question that kept coming to mind was,
``What were they thinking?'' It may be more fashionable, but it
hardly makes sense to show a Frida Kahlo painting and a Diego
Rivera painting but not a Picasso or a Matissse, to give dictionary
entries for Barbara Walters and Oprah Winfrey but not for Walter
Cronkite and Mike Wallace, to offer a dozen quotes from Maya
Angelou and none from Joseph Brodsky, the Russian-born Nobel Prize
laureate and former U.S. poet laureate. And why is New Deal defined
here but not New Frontier? (Great Society comes up, but only in
passing, in a quote from Lyndon B. Johnson.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the dictionary's annoying preachiness. It is one
thing to point out that Canadians and Mexicans may take offense
when ``America'' is used to refer to only the United States. (In
fact, I wish that all the politicians who speak ad nauseam of ``the
American people'' would take note of that.) But littering
definitions with the word ``offensive'' _ it shows up 20 times each
in explanations of two very popular expletives _ is, well,
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   I did enjoy browsing here, much as I love wandering the densely
worded pages of print dictionaries. While searching for
Tchaikovsky, for instance, I spotted ``TCBY Treats'' on the word
list. It turned out to be 28th on a chart of Top 50 Franchises in
the United States, one of numerous interesting charts that came up.
Clicking on ``tonality'' in Multimedia produced a line from ``My
Country 'Tis of Thee,'' presented in both scored and recorded form
in three keys: C, F sharp and A flat. That was fun.
</P>
<P>
   But I also kept encountering shortcomings in using the program.
For instance, among the Multimedia selections (other search
categories include Dictionary, Thesaurus, Almanac, Quotations,
Computer Dictionary, Sounds, Images and the presumably
all-encompassing Everything), I came across ``wangga music of
aboriginal Australia.'' I clicked on it and found that I could
listen to a few bars. But had I entered the program wanting to look
up ``wangga music,'' having read or heard of it somewhere, and had
I then taken the logical first step and searched for it under
``Everything,'' I would not have found it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' it turns out, does not search Multimedia, Sounds
or Images. Two other drawbacks are that Quotations, at least when
arrived at via Everything, bunches together quotes both from the
person and about the person, which can be confusing. And under
Dictionary, different meanings for the same word are often grouped
in separate places, which not only complicates the process of
printing out a full word profile but increases the odds of
overlooking the definition needed.
</P>
<P>
   After several hours of browsing, it became clear that even in
the area of pop culture, a major attraction (there can't be too
many other general use dictionaries that have the entry Marvin
Gaye), some things are amiss and others are simply missing _ any
references at all, for instance, to klezmer and Latin music.
</P>
<P>
   I asked my 12-year-old son, Jonathan, to check out his area of
expertise, rap music, which I thought would surely be a hot area
for globally minded lexicographers. He was disappointed to find
that Will Smith turned up as only a name on several lists of music
awards. But then he noticed that there was a quotation. It turned
out to be: ``Here lies Will Smith _ and, what's something rarish,/
He was born, bred, and hanged, all in the same parish.'' Jonathan
panicked for a second until he realized that this was an earlier
Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
   So what were they thinking? I'm afraid that to a large extent it
was, ``How fast can we get this product into the stores?''
</P>
<P>
   That might be the way to get ahead in software marketing, but
not in the dictionary game.

YOUNGER BRAMHALL'S MUSIC EVOLVING BEYOND BLUES, LONG SOLOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a British term for long, cliched, pointless and just bad
blues guitar solos that we can't print in this newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   One we can, though _ and the one that Doyle Bramhall II uses _
is ``nonsense guitar,'' or just playing a lot of notes, usually in
the style of Stevie Ray Vaughan and/or Jimi Hendrix and/or Eric
Clapton.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle Bramhall II does not play nonsense guitar. He could if he
wanted; shoot, he could easily cut Jonny Lang and Kenny Wayne
Shepherd to ribbons if he felt like it.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no question that a lot of blues hogs out there would
just love to hear him crank it up and play just like Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   But Bramhall won't do it. He won't just play ``the blues.'' The
music he's making now, on his RCA debut, ``Jellycream,'' is a savvy
blues/rock/pop/soul hybrid that is immediately enjoyable and gets
better with every listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that different from what Eric Clapton is doing _ he
puts blues over rock and pop songs,'' says Bramhall. ``What's wrong
with a lot of rock music is, it's just an opportunity for people to
overplay and play a bunch of solos. For myself, I write songs and I
play guitar if it's right for the song.''
</P>
<P>
   Bramhall has recorded some fine music before _ he was, after
all, one-fourth of the Arc Angels, and also released a more
pop-funk-oriented CD on Geffen in 1996 _ but ``Jellycream'' is
clearly his best work to date, a confident CD that can rock
extremely hard, but also shows his depth as a soulful singer and
ballad writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I wanted to do was make a rock record and go in
as a band and make it as live as possible so I could reproduce the
songs live,'' says Bramhall, who lives in Los Angeles with his
wife, Susannah, and their 4-year-old son, Doyle Martin; he and
Susannah collaborated on several ``Jellycream'' songs. ``I was
listening to a lot of Neil Young and you could hear him in the
studio with four or five people and the vibe of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Bramhall has never wanted to be just a guitar-slinger;
his vision of good music has always included the Beatles, Sly and
the Family Stone, the Kinks, Stevie Wonder, and his favorite
singer, the late, great Donny Hathaway.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Dallas on Christmas Eve 1968, he grew up with the blues:
His father, Doyle Bramhall, is the legendary
singer/songwriter/drummer who would go on to write numerous songs
both for and with Vaughan, including ``The House Is Rockin', Change
It, Lookin' Out the Window'' and ``Life by the Drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan and Big D were so close that, for a time in the early
'70s, they lived next door to each other in Austin; Stevie Ray used
to baby-sit the younger Bramhall. Doyle II made his stage debut in
1983 as part of a trio called The Mechanix at a Stripling Middle
School talent show, and not long afterward was sitting in with
Marcia Ball and the Juke Jumpers, with Dad on drums.
</P>
<P>
   Then came an invitation to join the Fabulous Thunderbirds in
1989, playing ``400 nights per year'' for two years, and then
teaming with Charlie Sexton, Tommy Shannon and Chris Layton in the
Arc Angels in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he was part of a band that included his dad and
guitarist Denny Freeman that opened for Vaughan during his last
Austin show.
</P>
<P>
   The Arc Angels sundered after one CD, and Bramhall released his
eponymous CD in 1996. He toured behind it, wrote and recorded some
more, signed with RCA, and then, out of the blue, got an offer to
tour with Pink Floyd's Roger Waters. Suddenly Bramhall, who had
never even owned a Floyd record, was singing lead on ``Money, Time,
Comfortably Numb'' and several others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was basically playing the part of David Gilmour,'' Bramhall
says. ``And really, it's not that different from what I do. I was
talking with Roger and Andy Fairweather-Low, who played with
Clapton, and their blues influences were the same as mine _ they
just had a different perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Bramhall says touring again with Waters (who is strongly rumored
to be going back out on the American road next spring) is a
``definite possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, it's all ``Jellycream,'' all the time. His
current touring band features Susannah on vocals; Wendy Melvoin,
her sister, on bass; and Lisa Coleman on keyboards. The latter two,
of course, were with Prince (when he was Prince) during his
commercial heyday in the '80s. (Dave Ferman covers pop music for

<P>
   Like many bargain hunters, Rosemary Forrest often goes to the
trouble of mailing in rebate coupons when she purchases computer
equipment. So when she bought a Microtek scanner in June from a
catalog and sent in the rebate application, Ms. Forrest knew that
she would probably have to wait at least two months before seeing
the $50 check in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Eight weeks later, Ms. Forrest, of Augusta, Ga., did get
something in the mail from the company that Microtek had hired to
handle its rebate program. But instead of a check, it was a letter
explaining that she had sent in the wrong bar code from the scanner
box. What's more, she had a deadline two days away in which to send
in the correct one, or she would not receive the check.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can take eight weeks and they give me two days?'' Ms.
Forrest asked. ``If it hadn't been for the rebate, I would have
bought a different scanner.'' Although Ms. Forrest mailed the
correct bar code the same day, six more weeks have gone by with no
check in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with falling prices and a stream of new products that
threaten the already brief shelf lives of existing ones,
manufacturers and retailers of computers, peripherals and software
are relying more and more on rebates to attract customers. And for
more and more customers, the experience of redeeming the rebate,
like Ms. Forrest's, is not a pleasant one.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer protection agencies say they have received numerous
complaints about long waits, rejections of rebate applications and
sales of items after the rebate offers have already expired. And
the problems are expected to get worse. ``With all the rebate
offers out there in time for back-to-school and the coming holiday
seasons, we expect to see complaints about rebates increase as the
year ends,'' said Debra Martinez, chairwoman of the New York State
Consumer Protection Board.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers say they are aware of consumers' frustration with
rebates and are taking steps to improve things. ``We'd like to see
the rebate system work better for everyone,'' said Suzanne Shelton,
a spokeswoman for CompUSA, which has added a division to its
technical support dedicated to handling rebate problems.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers and retailers often turn over their rebate
programs to fulfillment centers, companies that handle the paper
work from customers and mail out the checks. And the fulfillment
centers maintain that they have to adhere to stringent procedures
to protect their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are unhappy with the way rebates are handled,
but it's not going to change,'' said Frank Giordano, president of
TCA Fulfillment Services in Mount Vernon, N.Y., which manages
rebate programs for computer hardware retailers and manufacturers,
including Tiger Direct, Sony, Iomega and PNY Electronics. ``Our
clients give away millions of dollars a year, and it's very easy to
duplicate receipts and other proof-of-purchase materials. We have
to take every step we can to protect our clients' interest.'' These
steps include rejecting incomplete rebate response cards and
anything but the original bar codes, Giordano said.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Kemerer, a marketing specialist at Microtek, said it was
not unusual for customers to send in the wrong bar code from the
box, as Ms. Forrest did. But Ms. Kemerer added that Microtek
usually allowed the customer at least two weeks to send in the
correct code.
</P>
<P>
   Mail-in rebates have long been a part of the computer industry.
Software can include rebates for $5 to $20, while printer and
scanner manufacturers might offer $50 back on a $149 product. But
the latest incarnation of offers, where customers can get up to
$400 back on new computers when they sign up with an Internet
service provider, have significantly upped the stakes in the rebate
game.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, for example, has formed agreements with several
computer manufacturers, like Compaq and Packard Bell, to offer $400
rebates when a customer commits to three years of Compuserve
Internet service. Many other such agreements exist between small
and large computer manufacturers and Internet providers.

   These larger rebates have been offered for only a few months,
and consumer organizations say it is too early to say whether
purchasers are encountering the same kinds of problems with getting
their money as with smaller offers. But consumer advocates say
there is another kind of problem with these PC-Internet rebate
offers: such offers are often presented in a misleading way, they
say.

   New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner Jules Polonetsky
said computer retailers would often subtract the amount of the
rebate from the advertised price of a computer, often ending up
with a $99 or $199 price tag. In most cases, he said, the
advertisement will neglect to mention that the customer is required
to pay the Internet provider's charges, which range from $19.95 to
$21.95 per month, up front. If the contract lasts 36 months, which
many do, that can mean a payment of $700.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figuring out exactly how much you're expected to pay on the
day you make the purchase takes a good deal of detective work,''
Polonetsky said. ``In their efforts to advertise, some retailers
are stepping up a little too aggressively on the side of promotion,
as opposed to disclosing the real terms of the offer.''

<P>
   Ms. Shelton, of CompUSA, noted that all of the company's
advertisements for PCs with Internet-related rebates listed details
about the charges at the bottom. ``There's a lot of information to
be conveyed in our ads, but we try to do it in the most
straightforward way we can,'' she said. ``It's a good deal for a
lot of consumers, and we think we're disclosing all the terms. It's
not in our best interest to do otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   While some consumers have grown to dislike rebates,
manufacturers and retailers like them, largely because many
consumers never redeem the coupons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers love rebates because the redemption rates are
close to none,'' said Alan Schachter, vice president and general
manager of Datavision, an independent computer and electronics
retailer in New York City. ``It's just human nature that we go
after them, and they get people into stores, but when it comes time
to collect, few people follow through. And this is just what the
manufacturer has in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they do not release redemption figures, many
manufacturers say they have higher return rates on rebate offers in
the higher dollar amounts. ``We generally see greater consumer
redemption rates with rebates over $100,'' said Sherri Snelling, a
spokeswoman for Canon Computer Systems, which offers rebates on
many of its printers, fax machines and multifunction products.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the new, larger rebates on computers will encourage
consumers to redeem more rebates remains to be seen. The important
thing, Ms. Martinez said, is to look at the dollar value of the
computer. ``Don't assume it's a great deal just because it has a
rebate attached to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who do redeem rebate offers complain that the process
is long and complicated and often seems to involve almost as many
steps as the preparation of a dinner:
</P>
<P>
   1. Buy the product.
</P>
<P>
   2. Find the rebate and complete the form (located in a store
brochure, inside the box or, in some cases, on the Internet).
</P>
<P>
   3. While the rebate form is simmering, find the original store
receipt, circle the product purchased on the receipt and throw it
in with the rebate form.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cut out the bar code on the box, attach it to the other
items, and mail it all in to a fulfillment center within a certain
window of time.
</P>
<P>
   5. Stew for eight weeks.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ann Marie Carpenter, a resident of Gilmanton, N.H., mailed off
several envelopes to retailers like Sam's Club and BJ's with
varying results. Although Ms. Carpenter usually gets a check sent
back to her for the rebates she seeks, she said, the waiting period
is often well over the six to eight weeks stated in the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   One frustrating incident occurred when Ms. Carpenter bought
Sierra Online's Printmaster Gold software for $39.95, with a $20
mail-in rebate inside the box. After filling out all the necessary
paper work, attaching her sales receipt and sending it out, her
letter was sent back to her six weeks later with a note explaining
that the store's receipt had an invalid sale date printed on it.
</P>
<P>
   After she corrected the date, which was a cash register mistake,
she resent the envelope, only to be told by Sierra Online's
fulfillment center that the original deadline had expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``After several months go by, it's very hard to remember where
you are in the process,'' Ms. Carpenter said, ``and after a while I
start to have the feeling that I'm getting ripped off. I don't
understand why they can't just make the stuff cheaper off the
bat.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Retailers can also confuse the issue by advertising manufacturer
rebates that have expired by the time the customer walks into the
store. ``I used to go the rebate table at Sam's Club looking for
bargains several days a week,'' said Tom Reed of Fort Pierce, Fla.
``But lately I've noticed that most of the rebate packets are
expired. When you look at the fine print and see the printer
without the rebate, the deal doesn't seem so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Elda Scott, a spokeswoman for Sam's Club, said the retailer was
phasing out the rebate tables. To help keep control over expiration
deadlines, she said, the company is instead mailing out fliers that
advertise a collection of rebate offers. By letting customers fill
out one rebate application for all the advertised products, the
fliers also simplify the rebate process, she said. ``Instead of
sending forms to each different manufacturer, the application goes
to one centralized fulfillment center,'' Ms. Scott explained.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can also run into problems when they try to follow up
on their rebate requests by getting in touch with fulfillment
centers. Ms. Forrest found that the address given her for
addressing her envelope with rebate information was in a different
location from the office with the phone number she called at
Microtek to complain when she had not received her check. ``It
seemed like there was no correspondence between the two, which
really set my teeth on edge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the long waits and particular manufacturer requirements
into account, consumer advocates say that reaping the benefits from
computer hardware and software rebates requires tremendous reserves
of patience and organization and a laserlike focus on the fine
print. But it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duffy, a consumer advocate in Covina, Calif., is a satisfied
rebate customer who has a file cabinet full of rebate documentation
in his office. Duffy has saved more than $1,500 on computer
equipment and software with rebates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people procrastinate, and companies will profit from
that,'' he said. ``But if you work at it a little and stay on top
of the deadlines, you can really have fun with it.''

VENEZUELAN LEADERS SEEK TO INSPIRE CONFIDENCE IN NEW GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three Venezuelan leaders are on a mission in the
United States this week to convince Americans that their oil-rich
nation of 23 million is emerging from months of political strife
and getting its act together.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders, members of Venezuela's National Constituent
Assembly, which is rewriting the nation's constitution for the 27th
time in its 188-year history, acknowledged Wednesday that the
process of creating a new system of government from scratch has
been messy.
</P>
<P>
   But ``despite the disruptions, no one has been killed or
injured,'' said Isaias Rodriguez, who is the assembly's first vice
president. ``The tensions have been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   After a breakfast meeting here with reporters, the Venezuelans
traveled to Washington to meet with State Department officials as
well as representatives of the Organization of American States and
the Inter-American Development Bank. On Tuesday they met with Wall
Street financiers and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   They will wrap up their trip Friday by meeting with former
President Jimmy Carter in Atlanta. Carter led an international
delegation that monitored Venezuela's presidential election last
December in which the current president, Hugo Chavez, was elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to transmit confidence,'' said Claudio Eloy
Fermin, an assembly delegate. ``To do that, you have to respect
property and (promote) less government interference in the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil in Venezuela pits Chavez, a former army lieutenant
colonel jailed in 1992 for plotting a coup, against the leaders of
the nation's two main parties that control Venezuela's Congress and
have dominated politics there since the 1950s. The Congress leaders
oppose the 131-member assembly, which was elected in July.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 45, and his backers who control the assembly say the
Congress and the two parties are corrupt. The parties, they charge,
have promoted nepotism and looted Venezuela's coffers, leaving the
majority of its population impoverished despite Venezuela's
considerable oil wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a follower of South America's great 19th century
liberator, Simon Bolivar, has styled himself a populist crusading
against waste and inefficiency in government, including the
judiciary. As president, he has cut the number of ministries from
29 to 13 and eliminated 500 governmental bodyguard positions.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of the two main parties, Democratic Action and the
Social Christian Party, have accused Chavez and his followers of a
crude power grab. The party leaders say the assembly is a tool of
Chavez designed to do an end run around Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis reached a climax late last month when the assembly
voted essentially to shut down the Congress. Chavez's opponents
compared him with Cuba's communist dictator Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, a major purchaser of Venezuelan oil, took a
dim view of the assembly's action. But last week the assembly
relented. It and the Congress agreed to a power-sharing scheme
until Venezuela's new constitution is completed by the end of
October. A referendum approving or disapproving it could take place
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan leaders are now trying to soothe feelings in U.S.
financial and political circles. Chavez is planning a visit to the
United Nations and to Washington later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Combellas, another assembly delegate, said Wednesday
that ``we have had a system that has operated totally behind closed
doors in the past, but it's not closed now. We are the ones who are
legitimizing Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The three delegates characterized the recent political turmoil
as a natural byproduct of a new political system replacing the old.
``The United States has constitutional stability and Venezuela does
not,'' said Rodriguez. ``We want our constitution to have
permanency.''
</P>
<P>
   Fermin said that formulating a new governmental system through a
constitution is ``a democratic act, and it will be carried out
democratically.''
</P>
<P>
   Fermin, a 1993 presidential candidate of the Democratic Action
Party, said he had opposed the assembly and advocated reforming
Venezuela's constitution through the Congress. But he decided to
run for the assembly anyway this summer. ``I have to be the
guardian of my ideas,'' he said. ``I cannot be outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not a Chavez supporter, Fermin said, ``It bothers me
very strongly that (the political parties opposing Chavez) are
telling the country and the world that we are in a dictatorship.
That's not true.''

FOR BERLINERS, REAL-TIME TRAFFIC INTELLIGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By SALLY McGRANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The countless construction cranes that hang over Berlin don't
just change the skyline: with construction at 35,000 sites every
year, getting across town by car is a serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The routing complications caused by the two separate road
systems that evolved over the 28 years that the Berlin Wall divided
the city don't help. Add the additional car traffic generated by
the relocation of the German seat of government from Bonn to
Berlin, and the result is traffic snarls that can paralyze roads
for hours.
</P>
<P>
   So, like other cities around the world, Berlin is betting that
the solution to its traffic problems will be a new kind of
data-collection and communications technology. With money from
Berlin's government, a consortium that includes DaimlerChrysler,
Siemens, BMW and Volkswagen is developing a ``traffic management
center'' in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The project will use data collected from a variety of sources
throughout Berlin to make real-time information about traffic
conditions available to the public over the Internet, cell phones
and palm-size devices.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the next two months, Siemens will install about 140
infrared sensors at key intersections. Mounted on street lights and
bridges, the devices will monitor the volume and speed of vehicles,
then transmit any changes (for example, lowered speeds because of
an accident) via radio to a control center.
</P>
<P>
   At the center, the data will be run through a program that will
generate a continuously updated model of the traffic situation. The
data will also be combined with information from police and
emergency services and public transit agencies, as well as
specifics about construction schedules and special events, and made
available on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters will be able to check the site before they leave for
work to see if they should drive or take the bus or rapid transit.
The Web site will even include information as to availability of
spaces in parking lots, and eventually, under present plans, data
on the rapid-transit system.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Beer, head of the Division of Transport Technology,
Telematics and International Relations for Berlin's Ministry of
Construction, Housing and Transport, said that one advantage to
this system is that commuters will be able to check only the
information that is relevant to them. ``You can't talk about 35,000
construction sites in a 30-second spot on the radio,'' he added,
noting that traditional reports may not note disruptions on small
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic problems are not unique to Berlin, of course, and
neither are attempts at electronic monitoring to cope with them.
Many cities have various systems in place, including speed or
weather sensors and video cameras, and private traffic-monitoring
companies, like those that provide updates to radio and television
stations, abound.
</P>
<P>
   But what will really change traffic management in the next few
years will be projects like Berlin's, linking all of a city's
diverse monitoring systems in a central location and making the
information available via the Internet or cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Government-sponsored initiatives for this kind of centralized
traffic management started earlier in Europe than in the United
States (Berlin has been working toward this for the last three
years), but American projects are moving at a more rapid clip
(Berlin has yet to sign a final contract between its public and
private partners.)
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, projects similar to Berlin's are beginning
in San Antonio, Seattle and Phoenix, and another will be started in
December in the New York metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Department of Transportation has committed
$1.3 billion to traffic-management projects over the next six
years, but takes a less controlling approach than its European
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe in general, you've seen this develop in a European
fashion, that is to say, government-led,'' said Geoff Halstead,
president and chief executive of Traffic Station, a company, based
in Los Angeles, that is working with the four American pilot
projects. ``In America, it's American _ driven by
entrepreneurship.''
</P>
<P>
   Technological approaches differ, often according to what kinds
of technology are already in place. The Seattle project uses a
combination of sensors in road surfaces and video cameras to
monitor traffic flow. Other projects monitor traffic speeds using
radar or electronic toll collection devices. The trick is to be
able to meld information from very different sets of monitoring
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to bring a patchwork of technologies into a quilt
that covers the nation,'' said Roy Courtney, director of
architecture and standards at Intelligent Transportation Society of
America, a public-private advocacy group created by Congress in
1991. But, he added, ``we're still trying to mature this
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, traffic jams are a fairly new phenomenon. ``Until the
end of the '80s the public transportation in West Berlin was very
good,'' Beer said. ``A lot of people didn't have cars in the West.
In East Berlin, of course, you had to wait 10 or 15 years for a
car, so the number of cars was even lower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the reunification of Berlin, every one wanted to go from
East to West, or to regions around Berlin that you couldn't get to
with public transportation, so a lot of people got cars,'' he
added. ``There was a big increase in car buying after the wall came
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Beer envisions a system in which drivers can check traffic
conditions from their cell phones while driving, see that there is
congestion in the city center, check to see which nearby lots have
vacancies, park their cars and take public transportation for the
final leg of their trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to encourage public-transit use,'' he said, adding
that because Berlin is now the capital, traffic will only increase.
``We think that in the next years it will be impossible to come to
the city center by car,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a lone tourist in New York standing on a subway platform
underneath Times Square, asking a map not only to show the fastest
route to the Bronx Zoo but also to highlight the closest deli that
sells pastrami sandwiches and the cleanest nearby public bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype of an interactive map that might one day be able
to answer questions like those can be found in a laboratory at
Pennsylvania State University. Researchers in the university's
computer science and engineering department have been working for
more than two years to create a computerized map that can respond
not only to tourists' spoken questions but also to their hand
gestures. Their prototype, a map of the university's main campus,
in University Park, projects an image of buildings and grounds onto
a 60-inch television monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could create a map of any area you want, of course,
including New York City,'' said Dr. Rajeev Sharma, the project's
leader and an assistant professor of computer science and
engineering, ``and you could provide a limitless amount of
information if you connected it to the Internet. We even want to
develop a system that could handle having multiple people standing
in front of it, everyone waving their hands, trying to figure out
where to go. The map would decide who was in control and then
answer that person.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the map system's capabilities are far more
modest. The prototype system consists of two computers _ a personal
computer and a Silicon Graphics workstation _ that communicate,
respectively, with a cordless microphone and a video camera to
respond to a person standing in front of the map. A person can
communicate with the map either by speaking or by using hand
gestures, like pointing.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, a person speaks into the cordless microphone to
ask, ``Where is my dormitory?'' the personal computer uses standard
speech-recognition software, then responds with an on-screen image
that shows the location of all the dormitories. The person is then
prompted to choose one of them.
</P>
<P>
   If instead of speaking the person points toward the map or waves
a hand across its image, the workstation's video camera uses
gesture-recognition software developed by Sharma's team, then
responds with an on-screen image of a little red hand that moves
across the map like a cursor.
</P>
<P>
   Previous gesture-recognition projects have proved computers can
learn to recognize static gestures. In 1966, for instance,
researchers at Carnegie Mellon University taught a computer to
recognize 14 gestures from the American Sign Language alphabet.
Building on that, the Penn State team has developed a method to
teach the computer to pick out the meaningful gestures among all
the ones someone may be making.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lucky break came from watching the Weather Channel, when
we realized that the kinds of gestures people make in front of a
map are similar to the kinds of gestures the weather forecasters
use,'' Sharma said. Weather Channel recordings were used to teach
the system to identify meaningful gestures.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the computer may never understand some things. ``For
example,'' Sharma said, ``it doesn't understand a gesture that's
obscene in one culture or another.'' Which, come to think of it,
could make it less adaptable to Times Square.

 &HT;    Outer Banks braces for another storm
 &HT;    By Cindi Courbat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CURRITUCK, N.C. _ With the clean-up from Hurricane Dennis still
under way, North Carolina's Outer Banks waited for an even bigger,
and potentially more dangerous, hurricane today.
</P>
<P>
   Packing 155 mph winds, Floyd bypassed Florida on Tuesday and, as
of early Wednesday evening, was headed straight for the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 a.m. Wednesday, Currituck County issued a mandatory
evacuation for its off-road north beaches _ joining other
oceanfront communities from Florida to Virginia where an estimated
two million people have already fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., a mandatory evacuation order was also put into
effect for Currituck's low-lying areas, including Knotts Island and
Gibbs Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Weather Service flood prediction models indicate storm surge of
eight to 10 feet in the Currituck Sound, Lambertson added. There is
a high potential for flooding in all of the low-lying areas
adjacent to the Sound, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Vann, fire chief at Corova Beach, said about 70 families _
mostly tourists _ had left the area by noon and the rest were
expected to leave by 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting real good response,'' Vann said. ``Fire and
rescue workers have been calling and going door-to-door in an
effort to get everyone off the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Vann said the north gate leading through the Back Bay Refuge
into Virginia Beach, Va., has been open all day, and would remain
open as long as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Dyer, owner of Karichele Realty in Corolla, said
Wednesday that about 300 short-term renters have evacuated the
north beaches over the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 30 houses in the four-wheel drive area _ each
with an average of ten tenants,'' Dyer said. ``We expect everyone
to be gone from there by nightfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyer said the evacuation process is going more smoothly for
Floyd than it did two weeks ago when Hurricane Dennis threatened
the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem better prepared and more willing to leave (than
they were for Dennis),'' she said. ``It still isn't clear where
they can go _ but they seem willing to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The back gate leads only to Virginia's beaches _ so that isn't a
final solution for those who have been evacuated from Currituck,
Vann said. Most evacuees will have to drive much further north or
west to reach safety, he said. Dyer said she has been advising
tenants to head as far north as Richmond and as far west as Raleigh
to escape danger, and to find alternative shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being told that every motel room in North Carolina is
already booked,'' Lambertson reported.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of available motels and shelters poses a serious
problem for many beach residents, Currituck County Commissioner
Ernie Bowden said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's right to force people to evacuate without
providing a nearby shelter for them to go to,'' he said. ``I have
voiced this opinion to local officials for many years _ and I don't
know why they refuse to open Knotts Island and other local schools
to use as shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bowden, many older people and indigents are being
forced to stay in their homes _ even through mandatory evacuations
_ simply because they can't afford to drive two or three hours away
and then pay for motel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were up to me, I'd open up every school in Currituck
County to use as a shelter _ but I am just one voice on a board
that is opposed to that idea,'' Bowden said. ``They say they don't
want the liability of opening a shelter but the truth is they
assume liability every time they use the school for civic
activities _ and they are assuming a greater liability by leaving
these people out here in the storm with no where to go and no way
to get there.''

   It's a Palm!
</P>
<P>
   It's a Phone!
</P>
<P>
   It's a Game!
</P>
<P>
   It slices, it dices, it shreds and makes radish rosettes, just
by changing the blade. It sews buttons on your shirt, catches big
fish, takes out even the toughest stains, and fits in your pocket.
It removes unsightly blemishes, never needs sharpening, and alerts
the authorities in case you fall down and can't get up. But wait!
There's more ...
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados of late-night television advertising are familiar
with consumer devices that promise to perform 101 different tasks,
just by turning a knob or switching an attachment.
</P>
<P>
   The palm-size computer world is about to be treated to similar
claims, in the form of a new and very promising little personal
digital assistant called the Visor, made by a new company called
Handspring Inc. The company said it would begin taking orders for
the Visor at its web site (www.handspring.com) any day now, for
delivery in October and November. The new product will not be in
retail stores until early next year. Prices range from $149 to
$249, depending on the model.
</P>
<P>
   The Visor is promising on several levels. On its most
fundamental level, it is a fully compatible, slightly smaller and
less expensive clone of the palm-size computer now sold by the 3Com
Corp.'s Palm Computing division. The Visor was created by the same
people who invented the original Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The Visor uses the Palm OS operating system, which allows it to
take advantage of the thousands of home-made and commercial
applications written for the Palm Pilot. It weighs a little more
than 5 ounces, is about the size of a pack of playing cards, runs
for weeks on a pair of AAA batteries, and has the same infrared
capabilities as the Palm, enabling people to ``beam'' their contact
information to one another wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   But even more promising is a little slot on the back of the
Visor, called the Springboard slot, which allows the user to plug
in a variety of matchbook-sized modules that perform specialized
tasks. Depending on the module that is inserted, the Visor can
slice, dice and otherwise process data in a variety of interesting
ways, and transform itself into a seemingly endless variety of
tools. It is sort of a Swiss Army pocket computer.
</P>
<P>
   Handspring executives said a number of Springboard modules would
be offered in coming months, including wireless phones and voice
recorders (the Visor has a tiny built-in microphone), data and fax
modems, MP3 music players, one-way and two-way pagers, graphing
calculators, bar-code readers, Global Positioning System units,
games, and even heart monitors and scientific probes.
</P>
<P>
   One minute the Visor is a language translator; the next, with a
headset, it becomes a portable digital music player or a cell
phone. Snap in the right module, and it draws a map to the nearest
gas station or ATM machine, calls up stock quotes, and checks your
V-mail (voice mail) and e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, however, the Visor's slot is full of promise, and
not much else. The only module that Handspring made available for
testing before its formal debut this week was the Tiger Woods PGA
Tour Golf card ($29.95). I suppose one could argue that it is
productivity software, in that Woods is a well-known efficiency
expert known for getting around a golf course with an economy of
effort. But some sticklers would call it a game.
</P>
<P>
   Handspring says that some 20 Springboard modules and accessories
will be available by the end of this year. The big challenge will
be to get more major hardware and software companies to support the
Springboard technology.
</P>
<P>
   The way the slot works is almost as interesting as the potential
applications for it. One of the charms of the Palm Pilot, compared
to rival devices, is its simplicity. Hit the power button and it
turns on, without churning through a boot-up process. The same is
true for the Handspring modules that slide into the Visor's slot.
</P>
<P>
   Each module is expected to be self-contained, with everything
needed to simply plug in and launch. The user will not have to load
any diskettes or CD-ROM drivers, nor issue any commands to launch
or shut down the software. When the application is no longer
needed, the user just pops out the module and plugs in something
else. Compared to other versatile devices like the Windows CE-based
PDA's, the Visor is a snap to use.
</P>
<P>
   There are three different versions of the Visor. The most
popular model is likely to be the basic Visor ($179). It comes with
2 megabytes of RAM, which is sufficient to hold thousands of
addresses, several years' worth of appointments and to-do items,
and far more e-mail messages than one ought to be carrying around
in one's pocket. It also comes with a cradle that connects to the
USB port of any desktop or laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   The USB connection is very smart, and an order of magnitude
faster than the serial port connections used by the original Palm
Pilot. Most newer computers come with a USB port or two, but people
with older computers can order a serial connector for the Visor.
</P>
<P>
   The version I tested was the Visor Deluxe ($249), which includes
8MB of RAM. Handspring says this is enough space to store 12,000
addresses, 10 years worth of appointments, 6,000 to-do items, 6,000
memos and 400 e-mail messages. This seems like a lot of to-dos,
even compared to the list of chores my wife hands me each weekend,
and I have yet to meet the poor wretch who actually needs instant
access to 6,000 memos.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the practical use for all that added memory is for Palm
OS software applications that the user can transfer into the Visor
through a desktop computer. Loading a lot of downloaded games will
eat up memory, for example. Or, larger businesses may want more
memory for custom applications like technical manuals or product
data bases. The memory requirements are reduced somewhat by the
ability of Springboard modules to take care of their own memory
needs without drawing on the Visor's built-in RAM.
</P>
<P>
   The Visor Deluxe comes in a clear case or in a choice of three
translucent colors (what a concept!) or black-gray. It also has a
leather carrying case.
</P>
<P>
   The third model is the Visor Solo ($149), which comes without
the synchronization cradle and cable needed to connect to a PC.
About the only reason I can think of to buy one of these is if the
household already has another Visor and does not need two cradles.
</P>
<P>
   Handspring said the Visor and Visor Deluxe models would not be
shipped until October, although the company says it will soon be
taking orders (and money) at its Web site  &UR; (www.handspring.com &LR; .
The Visor Solo will not be shipped until November, the company
said. The delayed shipping date, along with the initial paucity of
plug-in modules and the fact that the Visor is not available in
retail stores, all combine to force Handspring's early customers to
take a leap of faith based on the impressive track record of the
original Palm Pilot developers.
</P>
<P>
   The Visor works smoothly with both Windows and Macintosh
computers, and swaps data with leading contact management programs
including Microsoft Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The 3Com Corp., meanwhile, disclosed plans this week to spin off
the Palm Computing division as a separate company. Such a move
could free the Palm team from the gravitational drag of the larger
computer networking company and perhaps lead to more aggressive
pricing and product design.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely rumored that 3Com is also preparing some changes
for its own line of Palm Pilot computers, including price
reductions across its product line and even the addition of a
variety of translucent colors (what will they think of next?). The
company has also said it is on schedule to begin selling its
innovative Palm VII computer nationwide this fall. The Palm VII,
which until now has been available only in the New York City area,
allows the user to send and receive e-mail by radio and download
information like stock quotes and sports scores clipped from World
Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   As always, competition benefits the consumer. The least
expensive Palm model today, the Palm IIIe, was introduced just last
month with a list price of $229. To remain competitive with the new
$179 Handspring Visor, which matches and surpasses the IIIe in
features, 3Com will have to cut the price by at least $50.
</P>
<P>
   The Handspring Visor really, really works _ just like a Palm
Pilot. It costs less and does more, at least in theory, although in
my tests it was unable to make julienne fries, remove lint or slice
a ripe tomato.

AGAINST DEVELOPERS, CHICAGO ARTISTS BATTLE THE CLOCK

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Barton Faist is sick of the uncertainty of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken a toll,'' said Faist, a soft-spoken artist who is
battling to save his studio and home here in Tree Studios, a
wondrous amalgam of gables, carved heads, stained-glass windows and
chiseled aphorisms, a project dreamt up by a turn-of-the-century
philanthropist for struggling artists _ like Faist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Faist, 44, paced as he recited war stories of 17 years of
fighting his landlords, the Shriners, who are trying to sell the
increasingly valuable property to developers. For most of those
years, the developers have had another dream: razing all those
gables and mottos to build the New Chicago, another glossy, glassy
apartment tower to add to the city's rapidly expanding collection.
</P>
<P>
   This week, fearing the result of this relentless clash of new
and old, the World Monuments Fund named Tree Studios one of the
world's 100 most endangered places, right next to Machu Picchu in
Peru and the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Why is a charming but down-at-the-heels artists' enclave in the
heart of Chicago deserving of such attention? ``Because the threat
is so immediate,'' Bonnie Burnham, the fund's president, said.
``People may not think of Tree Studios as one of the world's
undying treasures, like Machu Picchu, but it has an extremely
interesting history.'' John Singer Sargent is said to have painted
in the courtyard; Frank Lloyd Wright visited his disciples here; J.
Allen St. John illustrated the Tarzan books here; at different
times Burgess Meredith and Peter Falk, then struggling artists,
struggled here before finding their true calling.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the fate of the compound, created in 1894 by Judge
Lambert Tree and the oldest such artists' enclave in the country,
is in limbo. The city, in cooperation with the Shriners, who have
owned it since 1959, has imposed a nine-month moratorium on just
about anything having to do with Tree Studios and the Shriners'
1913 Medinah Temple, which together take up the full block on State
Street between Ontario and Ohio Streets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a contentious hearing in 1997, the City Council, which can
vote down any landmark designation, thwarted the recommendation of
the Commission on Chicago Landmarks to designate all of Tree
Studios and listed only the front facade and the roof line on State
Street. Anyone buying the property could have legally ripped down
the Moorish Medinah Temple and most of Tree Studios.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half after the City Council's action and just as
the Shriners were ready to talk with developers, the local
alderman, who had backed the studios' vastly reduced landmark
designation, proposed new hearings to include the rest of the
complex. The Shriners threatened to sue. But even as they rattled
the legal saber, they signed an agreement with Steven Fifield, a
Chicago developer, to sell the block for $21 million. He quickly
drew up d plans to gut Tree Studios and tear down Medinah Temple to
build a tall tower and parking garage. At that point, Mayor Richard
M. Daley announced that the Medinah Temple should be saved, too.
Fifield threw up his hands: if he had to save both the studios and
the temple, he said, the property was worth a lot less than $21
million.
</P>
<P>
   So all parties have agreed to the moratorium: no demolition, no
lawsuits and no landmark attempts.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Fifield, in an interview, explained his newest plan
for the block. If he has to save the temple, where Daley saw the
Shriners' Circus as a child, he wants to build a 38-story rental
tower in the middle of it. And he wants to sell the city on a
package of special tax incentives that would effectively pay him
back a good chunk of the $21 million he will still give the
Shriners for the land and buildings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the Tree Studios? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To avert another attempt at landmark designation, the developer
said he would save the exteriors and the courtyard but made no
promises for the interior, much of which still has its original
stained glass and fireplaces trimmed with handmade tile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, Faist and his fellow artists will have to go.
``They've known that from the beginning,'' Fifield said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the courtyard this week, water splashed from the original
stone fountain, and little-girl-pink impatiens flowed from
terra-cotta urns. All was serene in George Sotos' drawing studio,
where five skeletons dangled in the late summer breeze. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sotos, a tall man with a George Carlin ponytail, says he pays
about $1,450 a month for his double-width ground-floor space, where
he teaches 85 students a week; another two dozen drift in on
Saturday for life-drawing workshops. He lives down the hall, near
Carl and Lucille James, who have lived there since 1952. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James, a sturdy 80, is a painter and illustrator whose work
appears in the extensive show of Tree Studios artists _ past and
present _ at the Chicago Cultural Center through Sept. 26.
``There's been a tremendous change in the neighborhood since we
came,'' Mrs. James, 72, said. ``It used to be silent; now it's
Disney World.'' She was referring to the Disney Quest store that
opened this summer a block away.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner, James said, ``there's a high-rise condo going
up, and we hear it's sold out before they put a shovel in the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Fifield said that the other developers _ at least
three bid similar amounts for the Shriners' block _ were willing to
pay so much.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Paul Barber, the business administrator of the
Shriners, said he didn't know who would end up with the property _
or what they would do with it. ``Hey, we're a fraternal
organization that cares for crippled kids,'' he said. ``Our sole
goal is to liquidate the asset.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A weakening Hurricane Floyd will bring gales and flooding rains
to most of the Middle Atlantic region Thursday. The center of the
storm will likely pass from eastern North Carolina this morning to
near southern New Jersey Thursday night. Given this path, many
coastal locations on the east side of the hurricane will experience
sustained winds between 40 and 50 mph with gusts to 75 mph or
higher. Very rough seas and tides between 5 and 8 feet above normal
will cause serious beach erosion. Rainfall of 3 to 5 inches will be
common from Virginia to eastern New England resulting in widespread
urban flooding. Gusty winds west of the storm track will reach 40
mph at times.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will be brighter and tranquil with much lower
humidity. Brisk winds in the Carolinas will diminish by afternoon.
Some clouds will return to south Florida as sea breezes occur. High
pressure cresting over the Middle West will promote sunshine and
pleasantly cool weather from the northern Mississippi Valley to the
Tennessee Valley. Morning readings will be in the 40s as far south
as the Ohio River.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will persist over the western Plains and
southern Rockies due to a sluggish disturbance near the Four
Corners. The dull conditions will shift into Nebraska and the
southern Dakotas later Thursday. Sunny skies and very warm air will
cover the interior Northwest. The Southwest will be bright and
seasonable, except for thundershowers in the mountains and fog
along the Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Storm Surge
</P>
<P>
   Land is where hurricanes sometimes go to die. At landfall,
however, hurricanes are very dangerous. As a hurricane approaches
the coast, water is pushed toward land on the storm's right-forward
flank by fierce onshore winds. Because of the shallowing bottom,
water being shoved ashore piles up, causing an abnormal rise in
ocean level. Called the storm surge, this sudden rise can reach
heights as high as 30 feet. Battering waves ride atop the surge.
This wall of water can flatten houses and small-story buildings.
Storm surges swell when they occur at the time of normal high
tides.

THE GAME AS ELEGANT FASHION STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wipeout 3 is the closest a video game can get to fashion without
actually strutting down a runway.
</P>
<P>
   When the original Wipeout was released in 1995, it was the first
time anyone had played a racing game (much less a hovership racing
game) with a name-brand techno soundtrack (clocking in at 150 beats
per minute, the Chemical Brothers' sonic tsunami made the game seem
even faster).
</P>
<P>
   Programmed in the hard-clubbing north of England, the game's
code was visually candy-coated by the Designer's Republic, a design
agency known for its faux corporate logos and postmodern
typography.
</P>
<P>
   Wipeout looked like a rave poster brought to life. And that made
sense, because the Designer's Republic was well known for its
underground techno album covers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the agency's original job was to design the game's
packaging. But as the project progressed, the eye-catching cover
designs migrated onto every available surface in the Wipeout world:
the icons, menu screens, raceway billboards, hover-ship color
schemes and team logos.
</P>
<P>
   On the game's Web site (www.wipeout3.com), the fictional
manufacturers that produce the hoverships have their own graphic
identities, including corporate color schemes (complete with paint
catalog numbers), typefaces, and specifications about the size and
placement of their logos and how those visual treatments should
look at various sizes, in motion and in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those layouts, an advertising agency could mount a
highly successful, eight-figure campaign including television
commercials, print advertisements, billboards, point-of-purchase
displays, animated banners on Yahoo and subway posters.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point: if the packaging is slick and stylish enough,
the product must be real. It's not the graphic resolution or
realistic physics that makes you believe in the Wipeout universe.
It's the deadpan fictional advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fictional advertising bleeds into Wipeout 3's
real advertising, further enhancing the verisimilitude of the game.
In a world where everything is a promotion for itself, the line
between fiction and nonfiction is thick and blurry. The line
between packaging and content is equally vague.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy an album, it has a plastic wrapper and a sticker
with a bar code that you peel off and throw away. If it's vinyl,
there's a sleeve with room for lots of snazzy graphics. If it's a
CD, there is a jewel case and a little booklet with pictures and
text.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface of the record or CD there are track listings and
record company logos and more graphics, and all of that is
packaging. It frames the experience, but the music could exist
without it.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy Wipeout 3, there's a throwaway plastic wrapper and
a sticker with a bar code that you peel off and throw away. There's
a little booklet with pictures and text. These are clearly
packaging.
</P>
<P>
   After the game loads, there is a Designer's Republic menu screen
that lets you select options: game mode, number of players, your
vehicle and race course. And that's also packaging, the way that
station identification logos are packaging for television content.
</P>
<P>
   In game play, there are numbers on screen that match all the
other packaging, and they indicate your speed and fuel level and
what sort of weapons you have on board. This on-screen text
literally frames the action, and although the game could exist
without it, the information is semi-useful in the course of play.
It's superficial, but it enhances the game.
</P>
<P>
   So do the street signs and futuristic billboards and hovership
hull logos. One could argue that those are packaging as well, even
though they are an inextricable part of the experience, the same
way that a blue, white and pink label with lower-case red letters
is inextricably a part of the Evian bottled water experience.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sense, all video game graphics are packaging. In terms
of pure game play, a video game is a constellation of objects in
space, and those objects behave in particular ways in specific
circumstances. Those objects could take any form without affecting
the rhythm and pace of the game. Their computer-generated skins,
wrapped seamlessly around wire-frame models, bear no relation to
the underlying game code.
</P>
<P>
   Like all packaging, video game graphics are arbitrary and
superficial _ and tremendously important when it comes to selling
things.
</P>
<P>
   They distinguish one product from other similar products. In the
case of Wipeout, they distinguish the product from one year to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   The game play doesn't change. The packaging changes. And so the
packaging has to be fashionable, so that it needs to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, it was a fashion statement, especially in
Europe,'' said Nicky Westcott, Wipeout's lead artist. ``It is a
very integral part of Wipeout that it is a fashionable thing. For
that reason, we do have to change with the times. We have to make
sure that the bands are updated. It is, in a way, its own worst
enemy for that, because it was so cutting edge when it came out
that it has to stay cutting edge.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Wipeout's soundtrack has been assembled by techno's
current darling, DJ Sasha. The graphics have been revamped to
reflect a cooler, more sophisticated sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``While still looking like Wipeout, we tried to make it look
like a believable future,'' Ms. Westcott said, ``instead of making
the sky toxic orange with 10 moons flying around and the world gone
mad. It's very low-key. The other one was in-your-face techno. In
this one, it's a lot more refined.''
</P>
<P>
   Elegance is refusal. It's the last thing you'd expect in a video
game. But that's intentional. ``We have to take into account what
people expect,'' she said. ``Then do something else.''
</P>

`ACTION': CALCULATED TO SHOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Six words are bleeped within the first two minutes of
``Action,'' as if to say, ``There, that's out of the way.'' The
well-orchestrated hype about Fox's new inside-Hollywood comedy has
made bleeped language its trademark even before Thursday night's
premiere. ``Action'' is calculated to shock, with its world of
Hollywood hookers and words banned from prime time. But it won't
take long before viewers recognize ``bleep'' as the minor,
attention-getting ploy it is.
</P>
<P>
   The show is truly subversive and daring in its scabrous
attitude. Its central character is Peter Dragon, a producer who
understands that his grand success exists in direct proportion to
his ruthlessness. He seems to come by his savage attitude
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Peter begins by swerving into the parking place reserved for
``Employee of the Month,'' and berating poor little Manny Sanchez,
the commissary waiter whose space he has stolen. ``I'm employee of
the (bleep) century,'' Peter shouts, with the arrogance and barely
hidden insecurity of someone who is always one flop away from
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   From that first scene, ``Action'' violates the rule that a
series needs a good guy. Instead, it builds its appeal on the
flattering idea that viewers understand the importance of parking
spaces, that they get the Hollywood jokes. Peter may not be
lovable, but the audience is encouraged to identify with him. The
alternative is being Manny, and who wants that?
</P>
<P>
   Its riskiness makes ``Action'' more appealing than one more
bland, even-keel sitcom would have been. Still, it is sometimes
easier to admire the show's daring than to laugh at its jokes.
``Action'' has been compared to ``South Park'' for its adolescent
humor and dialogue, but it most resembles that cartoon in its
unevenness. Veering wildly between laser-like satire and
disappointingly obvious sex jokes, ``Action'' is full of dull
stretches followed by an occasional explosion of howlingly funny
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The show is funniest when it stays closest to plausibility. This
is Hollywood, so plausible leaves plenty of room for the
outrageous. In the premiere's one hysterical episode, Peter is
talking to an agent whose client has a slight image problem. Peter
sputters when he realizes, ``You're pitching me O.J. Simpson.''
(Does anyone doubt that ``Action'' is speculating on the inevitable
here?)
</P>
<P>
   Jay Mohr is despicably good as Peter, especially when he
sarcastically tells the agent that his client towers over other
actors. ``Tom Hanks is unwilling to go that extra mile and hack his
wife to death,'' he shrieks.
</P>
<P>
   Mohr doesn't have to make Peter likable because, in another of
the show's clever dark moves, his victims are usually more annoying
than he is. Peter is vile to a writer who has been hired by
mistake. (In a line bluntly determined to shock, he screams at the
man who signed Adam Rafkin instead of Alan Rifkin, ``We got the
wrong Jew.'') But then Rafkin is such a dweeb. Hanging around
Peter's office like a puppy, begging for an invitation to a movie
premiere, he is almost begging to be kicked.
</P>
<P>
   The film he wants to see is Peter's latest, a violent action
flick called ``Slow Torture'' (the kind that Joel Silver, an
executive producer of ``Action'' and the producer of ``The
Matrix,'' might recognize). Peter is driven there by his uncle and
chauffeur, played by Buddy Hackett. And on the way they encounter
the show's biggest problem, Wendy Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Walking the streets looking for business, Wendy (Illeana
Douglas) gets her fur coat caught in the door of Peter's limo and
rides along stuck to the side like a Garfield toy. When the car
stops she tumbles out, legs splayed. She is that oldest of cliches,
a whore with a heart of gold. Wendy represents what is weakest
about ``Action'': the indulgence in broad physical humor and the
too-obvious sex jokes. But it is a deft touch that she was once a
child star; that's what happens to has-been children.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap laughs may be the show's insurance policy, its grip on the
``South Park'' audience. It is hard to see whether ``Action'' will
develop its smartest or its lowest strand of humor. (A second
episode, not available in advance, will follow Thursday night.)
Even if it continues to ricochet between high and low, it should
find a grown-up audience among those weary of unadventurous,
goody-goody sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' is one of the shows that Sen. Joseph Lieberman and
William Bennett cited the other day when giving Rupert Murdoch, the
chairman of Fox's parent company, their Silver Sewer Award for,
they claim, mucking up social values. Their chilling implication
that Hollywood should make room only for homogenized, wholesome
products is almost reason enough to watch in protest. A better,
more entertaining reason is the show's refreshingly frank, scalding
view of human nature. ``Action'' earns its MA rating (for adult
audiences), but that's what ratings are for.

`OUT OF PLACE': A VOICE FOR PALESTINIANS SPEAKS OF HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late in his absorbing memoir, ``Out of Place,'' Edward W. Said
describes an incident that occurred during his first year in the
United States, 1951, when he entered his junior year of high school
at the Mount Hermon School in Northfield, Mass., after having been
educated mainly in English and American schools in Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   He writes about being assigned to write an essay for English
class, ``On Lighting a Match'': how he dutifully researched the
subject in encyclopedias, histories of industries and chemical
manuals and compiled what he had found. After turning his piece in,
his teacher almost immediately asked to see him and complimented
him on his research. ``But is that the most interesting way to
examine what happens when someone lights a match?'' Said reports
the teacher asking. ``What if he's trying to set fire to a forest
or light a candle in a cave or, metaphorically, illuminate the
obscurity of a mystery like gravity, the way Newton did?''
</P>
<P>
   Said continues: ``For literally the first time in my life a
subject was opened up for me by a teacher in a way that I
immediately and excitedly responded to. What had previously been
repressed and stifled in academic study _ repressed in order that
thorough and correct answers be given to satisfy a standardized
syllabus and a routinized exam designed essentially to show off
powers of retention, not critical or imaginative faculties _ was
awakened, and the complicated process of intellectual discovery
(and self-discovery) has never stopped since.''
</P>
<P>
   This story is one of many entertaining epiphanies in a narrative
that takes the author from his birth in Jerusalem in 1935, through
childhood in Egypt, Palestine and Lebanon, and up to 1962, when he
had all but completed his doctorate at Harvard but had not yet
become a leading spokesman for the Palestinians. (Because the book
was written before a recent accusation that he has exaggerated how
much of his childhood was spent in Jerusalem, he does not deal with
that issue, but he has denied the charge elsewhere.)
</P>
<P>
   The narrative includes an almost Proustian portrait of the
author's parents: Wadie Ibraham, a prosperous Cairo businessman
from Palestine who moved to the United States as a teen-ager and
served in the American Expeditionary Force in World War I, and
Hilda, some 20 years younger than her husband, born in 1914 of a
Lebanese mother and a Baptist minister and educated in Beirut,
Lebanon, which, he ruefully adds, was ``the happiest part of her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of all ``Out of Place'' is a portrait of the child
these two unusual people worked so hard to construct, a child named
Edward, after the Prince of Wales, his mother told him, and Said
after his father, although its original source could never be
determined by the author.
</P>
<P>
   What this construct got from his father, among other things, was
an unrelenting need always to be busy regardless of results and
endless instructions that he found hard to follow: typical was his
father's suggestion when he heard his son practicing the Cub Scout
oath and referring to God and king. `` `Why are you saying that?'
he asked me, as if I had devised the words myself. `You're an
American, and we have no king, only a president. You are loyal to
the president. God and president.'''
</P>
<P>
   What he got from his mother was love and protection and a
passion for the arts _ when he was 9, she had them read ``Hamlet''
aloud together, he taking the male parts, she the female plus
Polonius in ``implicit solidarity'' with her husband's tendency to
spout platitudes, Said writes _ but she could also withdraw her
love with devastating effect.
</P>
<P>
   Together these parents monitored their child so carefully that
they would even inspect his pajamas to confirm that he was having
wet dreams, and when they found no evidence, they accused him of
``self-abuse,'' much to his shame and guilt. What all this
attention accomplished, Said writes, was completed by the schools
he attended, which condescended to him as an Arab and judged him to
be lacking sufficient ``moral stature.'' (At Mount Hermon, although
he consistently ranked first or second in his class, he was made
neither valedictorian nor salutatorian.) The result, far from his
parents' or the schools' conscious design, was that Said grew up
feeling flawed, defeated, clumsy and forever ``out of place.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, the author gradually began to detect a
second self within him, and the emergence of this doppelganger
lends this memoir its irresistible dramatic tension. The other self
first emerged in outbursts of physical force and endurance, belying
the uncoordinated weakling that the author pictured himself as
being. Then that self saw through the hypocrisy of his treatment as
a second-rate person and rebelled.
</P>
<P>
   Next he began to tap the dazzling intellectual and artistic
gifts that his mother had nurtured and the metaphorical match
struck at Mount Hermon had illuminated: Eventually it would light
the way to his becoming a prolific writer and the distinguished
professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia
University. And finally the second self grew into a politically
committed spokesman for the Palestinian cause, although here in
these pages Said touches on that issue only glancingly.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of these two selves was not neatly schematic. At
every point in his story, the author's persona remains painfully
and sometimes amusingly contradictory. In fact, not until 1991,
when he was found to have chronic lymphocytic leukemia, was he able
to alter his pattern of driven activity, which he calls one of his
father's legacies, and begin to recall the past and write the
present memoir. Once he did, his remarkable memory provided such
rich detail that at moments it nearly overwhelms his story.
</P>
<P>
   Some might call ``Out of Place'' a classic immigrant's voyage to
America, where, in an important sense, everyone is out of place.
But Said fails to express appreciation at having fulfilled what was
apparently, subliminally at least, his father's dream for him.
True, he does offer some begrudging praise of the United States:
``I feel a much sharper sense of dissociation about its
relationship with Israel than my Palestinian contemporaries, who
see it as a Zionist power pure and simple but do not acknowledge
any contradiction in the fact that they also send their children to
college here or do business with U.S. corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet his portrait of the country is less of a haven for the
dispossessed and more of a refinement of the colonialist outlook
toward Third World people. Maybe the brighter side of his
experience is another story. In the meantime, the message of his
remarkably narrated liberation is clear enough.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tastefulness is not something that David Bouley is
used to worrying about. On the plate, it hasn't been a problem for
Bouley, the chef and owner of the four-star Bouley Bakery. But he
is standing in the entry of his new 3,800-square-foot restaurant,
Danube, worried about the speckled Brazilian granite that he thinks
looks like Gustav Klimt paintings, 3,000 copper leaves that canopy
the ceiling like the Secessionists' dome in Vienna and every other
detail of the $1.8 million establishment, opening Monday at Hudson
and Duane Streets in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm doing, to tell you the truth,'' Bouley
said of his newly flexed decorating skills. ``I wanted it to be a
special place. I wanted people to have a shock.'' He let out a
nervous laugh at what could be a self-fulfilled prophecy. ``I mean,
do you like that stone?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the laurel-leaf crown, Bouley, 46, wore an unpressed white
shirt, dusty blue jeans and duck-foot-shaped French shoes, his
curly hair what the French would call a melange of peppers: black,
white and gray.
</P>
<P>
   Danube is Bouley's
Scheherezade-meets-Kubrick's-Arthur-Schnitzler interpretation of a
high-water mark in 20th-century culture: the Austria of Gustav
Mahler and Josef Hoffmann, and the arts and cuisine of the East
European countries along the river Danube.
</P>
<P>
   Whether waltz or schmaltz, Czech model Paulina Porizkova was
overcome. ``She walked in and she said she had to sit down,''
Bouley said. ``She felt wrapped up, like she was with her mother,
going to Prague.''
</P>
<P>
   Danube's Zsa-Zsa decor is the opening shot in the New York
restaurant world's Russian-Austro-Hungarian war. Warner LeRoy, the
impresario behind Tavern on the Green and briefly Bouley's business
partner, is rebirthing a legend: the Russian Tea Room on West 57th
Street, scheduled to open Oct. 4. Four years in labor and two years
late, the seven-story tea-room construction site looks less like a
theatrical extravaganza inside than the scene backstage at the
Metropolitan Opera House during a cancellation-plagued production
of ``Boris Godunov.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second floor, cavernous as a Caribbean-cruise-ship dining
room, the Tea Room's mascot _ a 15-foot-high, 2,500-pound acrylic
bear-shaped aquarium that will house live sturgeon _ is headless
and benignly bubble-wrapped, like a diver without his helmet.
Shards of sapphire-blue and white mirror spike the sheet-rocked
walls like broken glass. On the third floor, LeRoy's Tiffany-glass
ceilings, recycled from his restaurant Maxwell's Plum, are in
place; on the walls are more anatomically neutered larger-than-life
Russian polar bears, discoing like intoxicated singles in carvings
on 10-by-5-foot glass panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to be very careful to make them completely nothing,''
said Kathy Bradford, the Colorado-based glass artist involved, of
the boy- or girl-bear issue.
</P>
<P>
   Missing in action is the $500,000 Faberge-inspired Venetian
glass-egg tree. The bronze bear chandeliers fabricated by the
Indian company that supplied Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City,
N.J., are nowhere in sight. Still a coming attraction: the Red
Square diorama with a working model of the Kremlin, created by
Keith Gonzales, who helped design the ``Siegfried and Roy
Spectacular'' in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Tea Room was to be LeRoy and Bouley's wedding hall.
The partnership that brought together two of New York's most
prominent restaurateurs in 1995 blew apart two and a half years
later, with a lawsuit filed by LeRoy charging that Bouley
misappropriated funds. The suit was settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is difficult not to view the timing of the two new
venues as anything less than a duel: a midtown-downtown showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Bouley's Prussian operetta of a restaurant is a few bullets shy
of LeRoy's $20 million box-office Muscovite bear burlesque, but as
another of Vienna's famous turn-of-the-century citizens, Sigmund
Freud, demonstrated, obsession can make history, too.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in Danube's Orient-Express-like bar, beneath a red
plaster ceiling that was flown in from France, Bouley corrected the
impression that the little room was a sunburst of gold paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's gold,'' he said. ``It's either 22-karat or 18-karat
or composition gold.'' In his bomb-shelter-style office across
Duane Street in the Mohawk Building, which is to become two more
restaurants, a cooking school and a food court, he keeps a box of
gilt samples: gold, platinum, silver; frail as leaves of phyllo
dough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to create something that was as far from the
minimalists as I could go,'' he said. ``You can't just do a few
fancy things, I realized. It's better to do none, or many and
create a harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouley has come a long way from the painted rain gutters that
formed the lighting coves in the original Bouley restaurant, also
on Duane Park, which he designed and built himself in 1986 with his
brother Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are higher now. ``It's like buying an expensive
car,'' Daniel Boulud, the chef and owner of Daniel, the three-star
French restaurant, said of the current relationship between dining
and decor. ``You buy it for the engine, but the leather, the
details _ these amenities count as much. It's important today.''
</P>
<P>
   Boulud, who designed his first restaurant with Mara Palmer, his
wife's step-grandmother, hired residential designer Patrick Naggar
for his new dining room, a mock palazzo that drew criticism for its
lack of intimacy. Boulud, who has redesigned parts of it, called it
a ``work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Danube's silk-pleated, Edwardian-fringed gaming-table lanterns,
gold-mica-waxed ceilings, Venetian stucco work, Secessionist murals
and full-scale reinterpretations of well-known Klimt paintings,
including ``The Kiss,'' are meant to ``bring back a richness of
atmosphere that really made you stand up and take notice,'' Bouley
said, ``things that are beautiful from a craftsman's point of view:
the hand of the artist.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that this atmosphere will complement his craft in the
kitchen, where, with executive chef Mario Lohnigner, he is
producing a menu of Austro-Hungarian such specialties as Wiener
schnitzel and spaetzle newly interpreted, like the Klimts.
</P>
<P>
   Bouley worked with a decorator, Jacques Garcia, whose Paris
office superintended commissions like the French gold, cut-velvet
draperies, the mock-Turkish English carpet and the Joseph Maria
Olbrich-style black-lacquered furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 52, who has a reputation for opulent, historically
detailed interiors, is to be the star of the French Designer
Showhouse opening Oct. 14 in New York. Bouley admired his work for
the Hotel Costes in Paris, where they met. Garcia also designed the
Sultan of Brunei's 60,000-square-foot residence on the Place
Vendome. The decorator restored a 17th-century Norman chateau,
Champ-de-Bataille, with a 30-acre Le Notre garden, for his own use.
The French government had refused it as a gift because of
renovation costs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his client's four-star knack for simplicity, Garcia said
that he thought Danube's lavishness revealed Bouley.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is complicated comes from perfection itself,'' he said.
``David is a perfectionist, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouley's effort involved 30 European craftsmen and a mid-waltz
change in architectural partners, from Harman Jablin, LeRoy's team,
to Kevin White. After three tries, Gerard Coltat, a muralist from
Nice, got Klimt right. At Bouley's insistence, he replaced the
faces in two portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one was too ugly,'' Bouley said. ``The staff called
her `Bucky.''' She now looks like Cindy Crawford in a pompadour.
Coltat also exposed a breast.
</P>
<P>
   With its Brahms and Strauss CDs swirling like ballroom-dancers
through a $12,000 music system, the 65-seat Danube, whose exoticism
proved to be unexpectedly elegant on a recent evening, will be a
private entertainment by comparison with the Russian Tea Room.
</P>
<P>
   James Kuryloski, the owner of Felber Ornamental Plastering
Corp., which is supplying LeRoy with fake stag heads, said of the
Russian Tea Room, ``As far as anything we've done, the only thing
close is Opryland down in Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a fellow in Texas, a taxidermist, who was able to get
a beautiful natural pair of antlers as a model,'' Kuryloski said.
``Warner said there weren't enough spikes on them, so we had to add
spikes to suit extreme tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bouley isn't closing the book on expanding the
realms in his empire. ``Danube is a byproduct of some of the energy
that went into that,'' he said in his office, where he thumbed
through a ring-binder with close to 1,000 Russian recipes that he
had developed for LeRoy. ``I had a good time doing this,'' he said.
``I'll have to open a Russian Tea Room one day.''

<P>
   If ever there was a common touchstone of cyberculture it is the
engaging little computer game known as Tetris. This first truly
cross-platform, cross-generational, cross-the-sexes digital
diversion is, some 15 years after its birth, still drawing players
to all manner of computers _ from desktops to electronic organizers
_ to play it.
</P>
<P>
   And, 15 years later, people within the gaming industry are still
drawn to the creator of Tetris, Alexey Pajitnov, 44. That suits him
fine. Making games, playing them and discussing how much fun they
are to make and play have been a large part of his life since he
was a clever boy growing up in his native Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   There was very little to do for entertainment, he recalls, in
what was then the Soviet Union. So, he occupied himself mostly by
solving complex, mathematical puzzles on paper. He soon graduated
to solving three-dimensional puzzles like Rubik's Cubes. ``I loved
them all,'' Pajitnov said in a heavy Russian accent that makes him
sound more like a cosmonaut than an American-based game designer.
</P>
<P>
   But his creation of Tetris in the mid-1980s has made Pajitnov, a
man with a boyishly round face framed with a full beard, a
celebrity in game circles and somewhat beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the birthplace of the Sony Gameboy, the hand-held game
device that helped to sell more than 30 million copies of Tetris,
Pajitnov is hounded by autograph seekers. In professional game
conferences around the world he is often regarded as a living
legend, a sort of stocky, Jedi master of computer code and game
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He created what I still think is the single most addictive
game ever made,'' said Cliff Bleszinski, the lead game designer for
Epic, a computer game company based in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Pajitnov is hoping to strike gold again with a new game on
CD-ROM called Pandora's Box. The game, which is being released this
month by Microsoft, is a collection of 10 visually dazzling puzzle
types with more than 350 individual variations.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzles are connected in a plot line that carries the player
around the world restoring order wrecked by seven tricksters
released from Pandora's box. The game is rooted, Pajitnov says, in
his time-tested theme: players instinctive urge to replace chaos
with order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he thinks about the customer, and how they approach
the game, and what they are going to get out of it, he almost seems
like a psychologist,'' said Ed Fries, the general manager of the
Microsoft game group. ``He's in your head and he is thinking about
what he is going to do to make this game compelling to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Pajitnov's approach to computer games is certainly not
accidental. By the time he was 14, Pajitnov, whose mother was a
journalist and whose father was a philosopher, writer and political
dissident, had fallen into the mind-whirling embrace of advanced
mathematics and strategy games. The former he studied hard; the
latter he explored gleefully.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a master's of science degree in applied mathematics
from the Moscow Institute of Aviation and did post-graduate work at
the Academy of Science Computer Center in Moscow. All the while he
continued to play games, even designing some to test the computers
at the center, where he also worked as a programmer in speech
recognition, artificial intelligence and computer-assisted design.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of his heady research, Pajitnov decided that he was
more interested in ``bringing the computer to people, directly,''
as he put it. At first, he said, he tried to find ways of using the
computer to help unlock psychological processes. Nothing really
came to fruition, but he gained an extraordinary understanding of
the psyche, he said, a kind of engineer's insight into human
behavior. ``That kind of helped,'' he said, in deciding what he
would do next.
</P>
<P>
   In about two weeks in 1984 he wrote the primary computer code
that would become Tetris. He recalled that he could have written it
more quickly, but he found the game so compelling, even in its
embryonic stages, that he kept playing rough versions, telling
himself that he was ``testing it.'' After many more refinements,
the game finally made it to the West in 1988 by way of a Hungarian
programming consortium.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The following year the game earned four Excellence in Software
Awards, the computer game equivalent to the Oscars from the
Software Publishers Association. Since then, the game has sold some
50-million copies in many variations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tetris is one of the few games that has transcended the casual
gamer and the hard-core gamer,'' Bleszinski said. It is widely
believed that even the occupants of the Russian space station Mir
passed some of their idle hours circling high above Earth playing
Tetris.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about being recognized as the creator of one of the
world's most popular computer games, Pajitnov paused and spoke
slowly. ``The first time it is agreeable, but the hundredth time?''
His voice trailed off as he shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   Tetris is very unusual in that it is widely played by women, a
distinction in a computer game universe that is often mapped by the
tastes and habits of male players. ``There is just something about
it that is so appealing,'' said Linda Helin, the general manager of
XS New York, a game arcade and cyber cafe in Times Square. ``I
still play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pajitnov said he is not surprised. ``Tetris is very
nonviolent,'' he said. ``Women don't feel bad that this is some
kind of stupid male activity.'' ``And Tetris is a kind of game
which helps you order the world. You fight against chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it is very politically correct, but that's what
women prefer to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pajitnov was still living in the Soviet Union when he developed
the game and so was unable to cash in on the wild success of
Tetris. Under communism, he explained, he was prohibited from
personally profiting from his work. The rights to his game were
given up to the state for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, years after he emigrated to the United States in
1991, have the rights to the game reverted to him. ``I'm getting
some royalties,'' he said beneath his breath, conceding that the
game's economic life is all but over. ``I'm losing my humor sense
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He'd much rather talk about games than the fortune that got
away. ``I am always thinking about how he will be puzzled,''
Pajitnov said of potential players, ``how he will be intrigued, how
he will figure it out and how to fool him.''
</P>
<P>
   Central to his method of creating computer-based puzzles is to
try to create those that will interest and hold his attention. Then
he ``simplifies, simplifies, simplifies, simplifies until it is
understandable.'' His reason for this, he said, is simple: ``It's a
lot of frustration when you are just confused on how to operate the
puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   After running his own company in the Soviet Union in the late
1980s, and working for others in the United States, Pajitnov
created a string of relatively successful games like El-Fish,
Welltris and Hatris. In 1996 he joined Microsoft as its first game
designer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is one of 10 game designers nestled in offices on one
of Microsoft's campuses just outside Seattle. His second-floor
office is comfortable, he said, overlooking the Microsoft cafeteria
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever skills I have I use,'' Pajitnov, who is married and
the father of two sons, said of his work for Microsoft. Dismissing
his star status, he shrugged and said, ``I'm a working person.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he is making the media rounds around the country to talk
about his latest project, Pandora's Box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal it to give you a good time, a relaxing time,''
he said as he mouse-clicked his way through one of the new game's
puzzles that requires players to restore the famous form of Rodin's
``Thinker'' from globs of 3-D pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself, I love this kind of puzzle,'' he said with an impish
grin. ``It is kind of meditative stuff.''

`OUT OF PLACE': A VOICE FOR PALESTINIANS SPEAKS OF HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Editing changes in last sentence of 4th graf.)  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late in his absorbing memoir, ``Out of Place,'' Edward W. Said
describes an incident that occurred during his first year in the
United States, 1951, when he entered his junior year of high school
at the Mount Hermon School in Northfield, Mass., after having been
educated mainly in English and American schools in Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   He writes about being assigned to write an essay for English
class, ``On Lighting a Match'': how he dutifully researched the
subject in encyclopedias, histories of industries and chemical
manuals and compiled what he had found. After turning his piece in,
his teacher almost immediately asked to see him and complimented
him on his research. ``But is that the most interesting way to
examine what happens when someone lights a match?'' Said reports
the teacher asking. ``What if he's trying to set fire to a forest
or light a candle in a cave or, metaphorically, illuminate the
obscurity of a mystery like gravity, the way Newton did?''
</P>
<P>
   Said continues: ``For literally the first time in my life a
subject was opened up for me by a teacher in a way that I
immediately and excitedly responded to. What had previously been
repressed and stifled in academic study _ repressed in order that
thorough and correct answers be given to satisfy a standardized
syllabus and a routinized exam designed essentially to show off
powers of retention, not critical or imaginative faculties _ was
awakened, and the complicated process of intellectual discovery
(and self-discovery) has never stopped since.''
</P>
<P>
   This story is one of many entertaining epiphanies in a narrative
that takes the author from his birth in Jerusalem in 1935, through
childhood in Egypt, Palestine and Lebanon, and up to 1962, when he
had all but completed his doctorate at Harvard but had not yet
become a leading spokesman for the Palestinians. (Because the book
was written before a recent accusation that he has exaggerated how
much of his childhood was spent in Jerusalem, he does not tackle
that issue head on but has dealt with it elsewhere.)
</P>
<P>
   The narrative includes an almost Proustian portrait of the
author's parents: Wadie Ibraham, a prosperous Cairo businessman
from Palestine who moved to the United States as a teen-ager and
served in the American Expeditionary Force in World War I, and
Hilda, some 20 years younger than her husband, born in 1914 of a
Lebanese mother and a Baptist minister and educated in Beirut,
Lebanon, which, he ruefully adds, was ``the happiest part of her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of all ``Out of Place'' is a portrait of the child
these two unusual people worked so hard to construct, a child named
Edward, after the Prince of Wales, his mother told him, and Said
after his father, although its original source could never be
determined by the author.
</P>
<P>
   What this construct got from his father, among other things, was
an unrelenting need always to be busy regardless of results and
endless instructions that he found hard to follow: typical was his
father's suggestion when he heard his son practicing the Cub Scout
oath and referring to God and king. `` `Why are you saying that?'
he asked me, as if I had devised the words myself. `You're an
American, and we have no king, only a president. You are loyal to
the president. God and president.'''
</P>
<P>
   What he got from his mother was love and protection and a
passion for the arts _ when he was 9, she had them read ``Hamlet''
aloud together, he taking the male parts, she the female plus
Polonius in ``implicit solidarity'' with her husband's tendency to
spout platitudes, Said writes _ but she could also withdraw her
love with devastating effect.
</P>
<P>
   Together these parents monitored their child so carefully that
they would even inspect his pajamas to confirm that he was having
wet dreams, and when they found no evidence, they accused him of
``self-abuse,'' much to his shame and guilt. What all this
attention accomplished, Said writes, was completed by the schools
he attended, which condescended to him as an Arab and judged him to
be lacking sufficient ``moral stature.'' (At Mount Hermon, although
he consistently ranked first or second in his class, he was made
neither valedictorian nor salutatorian.) The result, far from his
parents' or the schools' conscious design, was that Said grew up
feeling flawed, defeated, clumsy and forever ``out of place.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, the author gradually began to detect a
second self within him, and the emergence of this doppelganger
lends this memoir its irresistible dramatic tension. The other self
first emerged in outbursts of physical force and endurance, belying
the uncoordinated weakling that the author pictured himself as
being. Then that self saw through the hypocrisy of his treatment as
a second-rate person and rebelled.
</P>
<P>
   Next he began to tap the dazzling intellectual and artistic
gifts that his mother had nurtured and the metaphorical match
struck at Mount Hermon had illuminated: Eventually it would light
the way to his becoming a prolific writer and the distinguished
professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia
University. And finally the second self grew into a politically
committed spokesman for the Palestinian cause, although here in
these pages Said touches on that issue only glancingly.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of these two selves was not neatly schematic. At
every point in his story, the author's persona remains painfully
and sometimes amusingly contradictory. In fact, not until 1991,
when he was found to have chronic lymphocytic leukemia, was he able
to alter his pattern of driven activity, which he calls one of his
father's legacies, and begin to recall the past and write the
present memoir. Once he did, his remarkable memory provided such
rich detail that at moments it nearly overwhelms his story.
</P>
<P>
   Some might call ``Out of Place'' a classic immigrant's voyage to
America, where, in an important sense, everyone is out of place.
But Said fails to express appreciation at having fulfilled what was
apparently, subliminally at least, his father's dream for him.
True, he does offer some begrudging praise of the United States:
``I feel a much sharper sense of dissociation about its
relationship with Israel than my Palestinian contemporaries, who
see it as a Zionist power pure and simple but do not acknowledge
any contradiction in the fact that they also send their children to
college here or do business with U.S. corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet his portrait of the country is less of a haven for the
dispossessed and more of a refinement of the colonialist outlook
toward Third World people. Maybe the brighter side of his
experience is another story. In the meantime, the message of his
remarkably narrated liberation is clear enough.

ARE YOU A TRUE FAMILY MAN? HERE'S A TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listen up, fathers. Before you take the following test to
determine just how domesticated, wife-dependent and child-addicted
you have become, you must understand the Paula Nicholas theory.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Nicholas, 30, is a beautiful single woman who lives in
Mississippi. She sells pharmaceuticals. Often, when she is
contemplating dating a gentleman, she will take him to a certain
type of restaurant known as a ``bar.'' Once there, she will put
money in a jukebox and play a song or songs by '80s ``Tiger Beat''
and ``General Hospital'' star Rick Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Most men would wince at that. Rick Springfield, in generic male
terms, is a ``goober.'' He sang sappy power ballads about how he
wished he had Jessie's girl, wondering aloud where he could find a
woman like that. He said that he would get excited by a woman
because there was heaven in her eyes tonight, noting that the fire
within him was ignited and love was burning bright. You get the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: Nicholas deemed a man worthy of her companionship
only if he enjoyed the music of Mr. Springfield. Her theory,
delivered in a slow, thick drawl: ``Any man who would admit to
liking Rick Springfield is comfortable with who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   That theory can be applied to family men, too. If you want to
know how comfortable a man is with his role as husband, father,
handler of all business familial, then have him take the following
``when the wife and kids are outta town'' test. As with the Rick
Springfield test, the intuition to give the manly answer will,
ironically, be counted against you. (For future biographers, it
should be noted that I created the following quiz this past weekend
while my wife and child were visiting relatives.)
</P>
<P>
   ``All answers on a scale of 1 to 10 _ 10 being exactly like
something you would do, 1 meaning you would never act that way.''
</P>
<P>
   1. After four days of being alone in the house, you begin to
wish your wife was back in town so that you'd have clean underwear
again. That is until, on day five, you discover a load of whites in
the dryer that had been there the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   2. At six o'clock every day, you stare at the phone, waiting for
the daily call that comes from your daughter when she and Mom
arrive home. When you remember that the call won't come, you wonder
what that weird empty feeling is inside you, deciding it must just
be that you're hungry.
</P>
<P>
   3. After five days of Ultimate Bacon Double Cheeseburgers from
Jack-in-the-Box for dinner, you begin to wonder whether your
returning wife will still love ``the new you'' who can't seem to
button your trousers anymore.
</P>
<P>
   4. You find yourself watching hours of Cartoon Network and
Nickelodeon when at home, so that you and your daughter can discuss
the tomfoolery of Johnny Bravo and the Rugrats when she returns.
</P>
<P>
   5. On your night out with the guys, you act appropriately
collegiate. Except that you bring your cell phone so that, once you
steal away to the restroom, you can make a long-distance call to
make sure that the wife and munchkin are indeed planning on
returning soon.
</P>
<P>
   6. You stay up far too late watching veg TV every night, leaving
far too many lights on, because for the first time, you think your
daughter may be right about those ``scary nighttime noises in my
room.''
</P>
<P>
   7. You remember, for the first time in a long time, that even
though the grass always seems greener, you hated being single.
HATED it.
</P>
<P>
   8. You start to wonder why you spend so much time at work,
wondering if somehow you could quit to spend time with your wife
and child every minute of every day, yet still afford the
sport-utility wagon.
</P>
<P>
   9. While eating candy and playing PlayStation in the swim trunks
that are substituting for your underwear, you realize that if your
wife left you, you would fall apart so fast you'd be a recurring
guest on ``Jerry Springer'' within a month.
</P>
<P>
   10. You decide to publicly declare your transmogrification from
``normal guy'' to ``whipped family man'' in the hopes that your
wife and child will take pity on you and never leave again, except
perhaps during Cowboys games.
</P>
<P>
   (Scoring: 90-100, welcome to my world; 75-90, I'll see you at
the PTA meeting; 60-75, put down the remote and attend a soccer
game, please; 50-60, did you think this whole family thing
through?; below 50, why are you reading a section called Family
Day?)

 &HT;    TEXAS REP FIGHTING SCHOOL PRAYER AMENDMENT
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Chet Edwards, D -Texas, said Wednesday he
would once again lead the fight against a school prayer
constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting government into our religious and prayer life was a
bad idea when Madison and Jefferson rejected it over 200 years ago
... and it is a bad idea today,'' Edwards said, at a Capitol Hill
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was among the leading opponents to a similar measure
last year that fell short of the two-thirds majority needed for
passage, the first House vote on a school prayer amendment in 27
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., who authored last year's amendment,
is also renewing his role. He introduced a new measure Wednesday
that would ``secure the people's right to acknowledge God according
to the dictates of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed by 57 co-sponsors, most of them Republican, the amendment
added: ``The people's right to pray and to recognize their
religious beliefs, heritage or traditions on public property,
including schools, shall not be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue that more prayer would help deter violence in
schools and that legislation is needed to reverse more than 30
years of court decisions which have resulted in an atmosphere
intolerant of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said that the effort is based on a myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' he said. ``God and
prayers are alive and well in our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiments were echoed by leaders of religious and civil
liberties groups that joined Edwards at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are prayer clubs, there are Bible groups,'' said Oliver
Thomas, who sits on a special council for religious liberty at the
National Council of Churches of Christ. He said that no child is
denied the right to pray as long as they do not disrupt school
events or infringe on the rights of others.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also say that the amendment would be divisive _
pitting religions against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each school district there would be a fight like you can't
imagine over which religion or religions would be acknowledged and
promoted in schools,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups represented at the press conference included the
National Council of Jewish Women, the Baptist Joint Committee on
Public Affairs, the American Jewish Committee and the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   This year's debate over school prayer is likely to repeat as a
political hot button issue.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Christian Coalition supported the amendment by
distributing hundreds of thousands of church bulletins and
targeting 50 congressional districts with phone calls, radio ads
and 150,000 postcards -- some accusing congressional opponents,
including Edwards, of religious bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he is surprised that those on the political right
support government intervention in something as private as
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political conservatives, who do not trust our government to
educate our children and regulate our businesses, should be the
first to distrust government getting involved in something as
personal and sacrosanct as our religious faith and prayers,'' he
said.

Dennis still under way, North Carolina's Outer Banks waited for an
even bigger, and potentially more dangerous, hurricane today.
Packing 155 mph winds, Floyd bypassed Florida on Tuesday and, as of
early Wednesday evening, was headed straight for the Carolinas. By
7 a.m. Wednesday, Currituck County issued a mandatory evacuation
for its off-road north beaches _ joining other oceanfront
communities from Florida to Virginia where an estimated two million
people have already fled their homes. (Courbat, Elizabeth City)

</P>
<P>
   FLOYD-FLA _ The storm. Even though Hurricane Floyd essentially
missed Florida, it triggered what may be the biggest evacuation in
history. Hundreds of thousands fled _ and are still fleeing -_ in
Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, where they are braced for
impact expected Thursday morning. It's still a monster storm and
whatever it hits will be hurt. In Tallahassee, emergency managers
say they pretty much knew yesterday afternoon that it wouldn't hit
Florida, but they didn't want to call back hundreds of thousands
jamming I-10 and other highways and send them back because what if
it wobbled back left? The agony of when to leave and when not to
leave strikes again. (Moffett, Palm Beach Post)

   CLINTON-VETO _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and congressional
leaders plan a large, elaborate ceremony Thursday to veto the GOP
tax-cut plan. The event likely is only the first of several vetoes
in coming weeks, and illustrates how the power of the pen is
putting Clinton, a year ago seemingly in danger of imminent removal
from office, in position to once again best Congress in a battle
over tax and spending policy. (Deans, Cox News Service).

<P>
   TESTS-LATINOS _ WASHINGTON - Some states and school districts
that use high-stakes tests to decide whether students can advance
to a higher grade or graduate from high school use them in a way
that discriminates against Latino students who are still learning
English, according to a report released and discussed here
Wednesday by Clinton's official Presidential Commission on
Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans. The report is said
to identify ``unacceptable practices'' and offer ``guidance for
effective policies.'' (Mollison, Cox News Service). 20.

   SCHOOL-PRAYER-0916 _ WASHINGTON _ Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas,
said Wednesday he would once again lead the fight against a school
prayer constitutional amendment. Joined by leaders of religious and
civil liberties groups at a press conference, Edwards said the
renewed GOP effort is divisive, has no chance of passing and is
taking time away from important legislation. (Moscoso, Cox News

<P>
   STRAY911 _ PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Like many people who want a prompt
response, Jay T. McCarty added a 911 after his phone number on the
page he sent his girlfriend near dawn on Aug. 29. The three digits
somehow resulted in a phone call to the Palm Beach Police
Department. Officers arriving at the ground-floor Hammon Avenue
apartment from which McCarty had called found McCarty with crack
pipes and other drug paraphernalia, as well as a 12-gauge shotgun
and .22-caliber rifle, both loaded. (Schusler, Palm Beach Daily
News).

   GHB _ ATLANTA _ Teens use gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) as a party
drug. GHB developed as an anesthetic but never approved for use in
U.S. It was being sold to weightlifters in 80s and 90s as a muscle
booster and sleep aid til FDA banned sales. Chemists changed a few
components to slip through the law, and substances with same active
ingredients still available, or its easily cooked at home thanks to
availability of chemicals and internet instructions. Common
overdoses, including a recent one in alpharetta where a 17-year-old
girl went into respiratory arrest after sipping some while hanging
out with friends. they got the substance at a health food store,
where it is being sold still as a solvent and labeled ``not for
human consumption. FDA says they have trouble controlling the
substance because it is not illegal to make or sell, only to sell
it as a drug or food supplement. If it's labeled as a solvent, you
can buy and sell all you want. (Quinn, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED..

<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   UN-SUPPORT _ One of the goals of Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation is
to build more support for the United Nations. That may not be an
easy task. The U.N. is under fire in some circles in America, which
is already far behind in its dues payments. And the Clinton
administration has often seemed to circumvent the organization. As
the U.N. General Assembly begins a new session and a new U.S.
ambassador begins his duties, we talk with Atlanta-based experts
about the issues confronting the organization and what is needed to
rebuild support. (Graham/Melvin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.

HOW TO HELP THE KIDS BUCKLE DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's officially homework season. No more summer slacking, no
more first-of-school light workloads. It's time to get down to
business, whip out the sharpened No. 2 pencils _ or turn on the
computer _ and do some real work. Here, some of the best ideas,
products and resources for getting out from under that pile of
work:
</P>
<P>
   1. Start with basic organizers. Organize your study area with
two stationery musts: a calendar and an assignment book. Keep a
calendar by your child's homework area to keep track of projects
and long-term assignments. (That science fair can sneak up on you
if you don't see it approaching, circled in red.) Consider mounting
a reusable two-month or three-month wipe-off calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Your child will also need a totable form of date-tracking: an
assignment book. They're crucial. Assignment notebooks come in all
forms, from the cheap and simple spiral notebook styles to the
personal organizers with leather covers and refillable pages. The
key is to get into the habit of writing down homework assignments.
Remembering the homework assignment is half the battle. Well,
almost.
</P>
<P>
   2. Get a CD-ROM Encyclopedia. Remember when ``encyclopedia''
meant a collection of heavy books that cost hundreds if not
thousands of dollars and were outdated within a few years? No more.
These days, encyclopedias come on CD-ROM and go for less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   The just-released Microsoft Encarta Reference Suite 2000
contains four major CD-ROM reference guides: the encyclopedia, the
Encarta Interactive World Atlas, the Encarta World English
Dictionary and Encarta Online Deluxe, an online version of the
encyclopedia. The set of four costs about $65 after a company
rebate _ the deluxe encyclopedia by itself is about $40 after the
rebate. One caveat: The Microsoft Encarta products run only on
Windows. A Mac version of the encyclopedia has been produced in
years past, but it's not known if one will be made for the 2000
edition.
</P>
<P>
   3. Turn to online homework helpers. There's more to the Internet
than junk e-mail and advertising; it's probably the fastest,
easiest way to get information children might need to complete
homework assignments. Try these two exceptional Web sites that
specialize in getting students the homework help they need:
</P>
<P>
   The www.homeworkcentral.com site lets students pinpoint the
information they need by helping them narrow down their topics. The
site is divided into age groups, and the search engine is designed
to serve academic purposes. For instance, if you type in ``George
Washington,'' you'll get information about the first president _
not a list of every site with the word ``George'' or ``Washington''
in it.
</P>
<P>
   The www.schoolwork.org site offers numerous topic categories,
then provides a fairly comprehensive list of Web sites that contain
specialized information about each topic.
</P>
<P>
   4. Keep those papers in place. There's always that book that
won't stay open or that piece of paper that keeps disappearing.
Eliminate frustration with products that keep flyaways in place.
Try an adjustable bookstand that props up your textbook _ and keeps
it open to the right page; The Container Store has a version for
$35. Or use a book weight that'll weigh down the page you need.
Levenger's Web site (www.levenger.com) offers really nice leather
book weights for $17.99 _ or find a cheaper one at bookstores or
office supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   5. Provide practical inspiration. Sometimes the work gets done
faster when the right tools are also fun to look at. Hence the
Pokmon Study Kit, based on the Japanese animation game that has
taken over the lives of everybody younger than 12. These little
desk-supply packs (ruler, eraser, pencil sharpener, pencil pouch)
cost less than $5 at toy stores that carry Pokmon products; we
found them at Kay Bee Toys in Fort Worth's Hulen Mall. Or spring
for the Deluxe Desktop Set, which includes a Jigglypuff tape
dispenser, a Bulbasaur pencil sharpener, a Poliwhirl tape measure
and a Pikachu stapler; it goes for about $10. Not a bad investment
if it helps get the homework done.

RECOVERED MATISSE WINDS UP IN LAS VEGAS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recovered a few months ago by the family from whom it was
confiscated by the Nazis in 1941,  &UR; Henri Matisse &LR; 's 1924
``Odalisque'' has landed at  &UR; Steve Wynn &LR; 's Bellagio in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosenbergs lived in Paris, where they collected art and
owned a gallery. Their Matisse was sold in the '50s by the Knoedler
gallery in New York, to  &UR; Virginia  &LR; and  &UR; Prentice Bloedel &LR; , who knew
nothing about its past. The Bloedels donated it in 1991 to the
Seattle Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, after the painting was mentioned in a book about Nazi
art looting, the Rosenberg heirs sued the museum. A B'nai B'rith
Holocaust Art Restitution Project affirmed that the painting
belonged to the Rosenbergs, and the museum returned it.
 &UR; Elaine Rosenberg  &LR; told the New York Times that her late
father-in-law would have rejoiced. ``His children are finally
coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that the
work, which has been valued at more than $2 million, was bought
within two months by Wynn, who won't say what he paid for it. It is
on display at the gallery at Wynn's Bellagio hotel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mimi Gates &LR;  of the Seattle museum told the Seattle newspaper
that the family wasn't interested in working out a deal to allow
the Matisse to remain in the Seattle museum, which is suing the
Knoedler gallery on grounds that it illegally sold the painting to
the Bloedel family.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Wynn's statement of the gallery's purpose, on the Bellagio
Web site, is to make available ``works that have long been hidden
from public view in private collections,'' apparently including
this work that had been in a museum.  &UR; Barbra Streisand &LR; , who was at
the Bellagio Saturday attending ``O,'' the water-based Cirque du
Soleil show, was treated to a private tour of the art collection.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   _ Faced with a roar from angry protectors of the Miss America
image, pageant organizers backed away from the report early this
week that they would allow divorced and formerly pregnant women to
compete. They said they were reconsidering the decision.
</P>
<P>
   _ Point Richmond conceptual artist  &UR; Nicolino &LR;  had planned to
string bras across the Grand Canyon, but he didn't raise enough
money (there was also a small question of getting permission).
Writes the artist this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking of selling off 40,000 bras, one at a time, in
vending machines. ... Got to issue a public apology to all those
bra donors for stooping to this level.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Rose Barrett &LR;  appreciates the honesty in a sponsoring
announcement she heard this week on KQED radio: The program had
been brought to listeners by United Airlines, whose new
economy-plus class features ``3 to 5 inches of legroom.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Pamela Helsey  &LR; reports that  &UR; Gwyneth Paltrow  &LR; _ who is not
making a movie in San Francisco, says the film commission _ has
been seen in the last few days ``at all the cool places,''
including Tokyo GoGo on 16th and Valencia. Remember  &UR; Mick Jagger &LR; 
at the Slanted Door, just around the corner? The Mission District
rules.

<P>
   &UR; TRUTH IN THE EYE OF THE BIOGRAPHER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At a party  &UR; Roselyne Swig &LR;  tossed in San Francisco on Tuesday
night for  &UR; Christopher Ogden &LR; , author of ``Legacy: A Biography of
 &UR; Moses  &LR; &AMP;  &UR; Walter Annenberg &LR; '' (Little, Brown; $29.95), Ogden, an
experienced biographer, contrasted a few of his subjects:
</P>
<P>
   Despite philanthropist and ambassador Walter's reluctance at
first to talk about his father, who made a somewhat tainted fortune
by publishing racing forms and went to jail in the '30s for tax
evasion, Ogden was granted full access to records and complete
control over the text.
</P>
<P>
   While Ogden was at work on an earlier authorized book about
Pamela Harriman, ``Life of the Party,'' the Democrat femme fatale
came to suspect that the biography would be less than adoring. She
pulled out of the deal, legal wrangling ensued over notes already
gathered, and Ogden went on to complete the biography _ which
wasn't half as critical as &UR; Sally Bedell Smith &LR; 's later ``Reflected
Glory'' _ without her help.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confide in her and trust her. ... Elizabeth is someone
who loves me, really loves me.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Michael Jackson about Elizabeth Taylor in the October issue
of Talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is part of my heart. We would do anything for each other.
... He is magic. And I think all truly magical people have to have
that genuine eccentricity.''

 &HT;    Baptists take action against pro-gay church
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The executive committee of the Georgia Baptist
Convention voted Tuesday to remove Oakhurst Baptist Church in
Decatur from convention roles because of the church's acceptance of
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation will go before the full state convention in
Macon (Ga.) in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the kind of decision we make without a broken
heart,'' said the Rev. Gerald Harris, president of the state
convention. ``Some Georgia Baptists may disagree with this motion.
Some Georgia Baptists may say `good riddance.' For me, it's like
sending a child away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   The action is the first since the 1998 Georgia Baptist
Convention voted specifically to exclude any church that
``knowingly takes, or has taken, any action to affirm, approve or
endorse homosexual behavior.'' A committee is also looking into
Virginia-Highland Baptist Church in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's executive committee meeting, the Rev. Robert White,
executive director of the Georgia Baptist Convention, read a
statement from Oakhurst that acknowledged that the church's
``struggle with questions of who is to be included at the Lord's
table has been an essential part of our history for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 86-year-history, Oakhurst helped to resettle Cuban
refugees, accepted African-American members, ordained women, took
in homeless men and drug addicts, and finally welcomed gay and
lesbian members, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to believe that the biblical references to homosexual
behaviors do not address the Christian commitments and loving
relationships of our gay and lesbian members,'' the church's
statement said, and added that ``gay and lesbian Christians serve
as Sunday School teachers, choir members, deacons and preachers''
at Oakhurst.
</P>
<P>
   The 135-member executive committee voted with only one
dissenting voice to declare Oakhurst, which has about 250 active
members, ``out of harmony and cooperation'' with the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole lot of people who are looking for someone
who will stand up for what they believe,'' White told them. ``In a
society where people will tell you that political correctness
includes the full acceptance of homosexuality as moral, we, the
church, I believe, are mandated to tell the truth about what the
Bible says in love. The Bible calls it sin. We have a wonderful
message about relief and release from sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakhurst pastor the Rev. Lanny Peters said he thinks there will
be ``some sadness'' in the congregation about the committee's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a member of the Georgia Baptist Convention since
our inception in 1913,'' he said. ``It's always been part of our
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   If ratified by the full Georgia Baptist Convention, the severing
of ties with Oakhurst will mean that the church will no longer be
counted in convention statistics, can no longer send
representatives to state conventions, and will neither contribute
to convention ministries nor receive assistance from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you believe that homosexuality is a sin, it's wrong to
pick on this particular group,'' Peters said. ``I think my question
would be, would they be equally adamant in kicking out a racist
church?''

 &HT;    Fox takes `Action' against cable sitcoms
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox's ``Action'' is the most audacious debut of the season. It's
being called a ``bridge'' show between the networks and cable, but
it's more like a gangplank into a future where the only difference
between the two is whether the four-letter words are bleeped.
</P>
<P>
   They're literally bleeped here, and for good reason. Movie
producer Peter Dragon, played to snarky, snakey perfection by
bad-boy-next-door Jay Mohr (``Jerry McGuire''), makes his
outrageous entrance into American living rooms by speeding through
a studio's streets, flipping off Steven Spielberg (``geek!''), then
pulling into a parking spot reserved for the employee of the month.
</P>
<P>
   When the award-winning commissary worker objects, Dragon turns
on him with an asp's smile and asks if he got the award for not
urinating in the commissary's Cobb salads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because if I was you, I would pee in the Cobb salads,'' Dragon
says in his deadly deadpan. ``In fact, I would pee in every
(bleeping) Cobb salad every (bleeping) day so every one of those
(bleepers) in the commissary would have a little (bleeping) taste
of Peter Dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a soliloquy on ``Action,'' a show you'll love if you
don't hate it, and hate if you don't love it. It's an insidery
sendup of Hollywood; a self-loathing mirror on our media culture.
It's a world where cell phones are an evolutionary advance on the
human anatomy and insincerity is more prized than the truth. It
lets us feel wink-wink knowing about the Hollywood machinery that
suckers us every time.
</P>
<P>
   When Dragon's head of production mistakenly buys the wrong
script, he offers, ``We've bought crappy scripts before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was on purpose!'' Dragon snaps back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the gaps between clever exchanges are extended with the
broadest, Fox-est filler: pratfalling hookers, penis jokes _ ``The
Player'' meets ``Married... with Children.'' Much of it unreels
like an in-house roast of the company brass: lots funnier if you're
in on the jokes. If your bathroom reading is ``Entertainment
Weekly,'' maybe you'll cut it.
</P>
<P>
   Mohr is delicious as Dragon. He sets up tent inside his
bloodless character with such vacant glee that you'd run to hug him
if you didn't know he bites.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the cast seems emboldened by his toxic oxygen.
Illeana Douglas (``Message in a Bottle,'' ``To Die For''), plays
child star-turned-prostitute Wendy Ward, a hooker not with a heart
of gold, but with an eye for the blockbuster script. Jack Plotnick
plays production head and Dragon sychophant Stuart Glazer (``Is she
your whore?'' he asks Dragon of Wendy. ``No, Stuart,'' Dragon tells
him. ``She's my prostitute. You're my whore''). And Buddy Hackett
hacks his way wonderfully though his role as Dragon's lackey uncle
Lonnie.
</P>
<P>
   Guests show up to lampoon themselves: Keanu Reeves in the
premier, Salma Hayak in the episode that follows immediately after,
Cameron Diaz later in the season.
</P>
<P>
   It all sort of works as much as it all sort of doesn't. It's too
bad a network like Fox doesn't have the confidence yet _ or doesn't
trust its audience enough _ to simply be good and be done with it.
That's the real difference between the networks and cable.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Dragon would say, brimming with hide-skinning cynicism,
``Welcome to the magical world of motion pictures.''
</P>

   HURRICANE-RDP (Charleston, S.C.) _ Having already produced the
greatest evacuation in U.S. history, Hurricane Floyd skirted past
Florida and Georgia Wednesday and aimed itself directly at the
low-lying coasts of the Carolinas, where its eye was expected to
come ashore early Thursday. Although no hurricane-force winds or

50 mph began knocking down power lines and blowing debris across

pump iron before work, women with a cell phone at their ear and a
baby at their side, youngsters in rollerblades and yalmulkes _ are
inventing a new style of Jewish life that is one part Orthodox
Judaism and one part quintessential suburbia. By Jane Gross.

REVIEWS OF NEW DREAMCAST GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, Sega launched its new,
gonna-take-ya-to-the-next-level home video-game system, Dreamcast
($199). Here's a quick look at four of the key titles:
</P>
<P>
   Sonic Adventure: Well, as Sega promised, Sonic's latest
run-and-pick-up-the-gold-coins journey is fast. And colorful. And
fun. But does Sonic Adventure ($49, all ages) break vid-game ground
like Nintendo's Mario 64? Not really.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic Adventure is more of an evolution than a revolution, a
spiffed-up, souped-up upgrade that features remarkable speed and
blinding colors _ but little else.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you'd want much else. Sonic games have always been more
about fast-paced action than Mario-type adventure. And on that
level, Sonic Adventure is a major success: Sonic races through a
whole new world, a brightly colored Oz-land filled with double-loop
tracks, underwater worlds and mountainous regions. You've never
played a Sonic game like this before.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Stinger: This game, however, has been around a long time
and was more fun when it was called Resident Evil. Blue Stinger
($49, age 17 and up) is the Dreamcast's version of RE, a horror
movie come to life in which the player must shoot to kill or run
like ... well, really fast.
</P>
<P>
   Story line: Guy hero gets stuck on an island that's infested
with mutants. Your goal: Like Metallica says, kill 'em all. One
interesting thing: You can use limbs from dead monsters to battle
live ones.
</P>
<P>
   The coolness stops there. The rest of the game is brainless,
grisly gore and nonstop bad language _ definitely not a kid game,
or a good one, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   NFL 2K: Here is a great game. NFL 2K ($49, all ages) has got to
be the best football game out there _ for any system. Period.
Frighteningly realistic graphics, all the teams and stadiums,
custom plays, precise, uncomplicated control _ forget Sonic. Buy
this instead.
</P>
<P>
   Soul Calibur: From Street Fighter to Virtua Fighter, Sega has
always had major luck with transforming arcade fighting games into
killer home video games _ and Soul Calibur ($49, age 13 and up)
carries on that tradition.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the medieval-themed SC so impressive _ besides the
superb graphics _ is the little bits of realism; for instance, the
game takes weapon weight into account. If this is the kind of stuff
Dreamcast is gonna be doing, its future definitely looks promising.

 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hedwig Schmidt is about to undergo a sex change.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be the first time, of course. Anyone who has seen
``Hedwig and the Angry Inch,'' the long-running off-Broadway
musical, knows that a botched sex change is just one of the
problems facing the world-weary drag queen Hedwig Schmidt, who
describes herself as the ``internationally ignored song stylist.''
</P>
<P>
   The character, created by John Cameron Mitchell and the composer
Stephen Trask, demands a mix of wit, wistfulness and vocal
firepower in a 90-minute monologue spiced with 10 rock songs. And
ever since the show opened at the Jane Street Theater in February
1998, the role has always been played by male actors, each of whom
has donned the character's gravity-proof blond wig, arch German
accent and industrial-strength makeup to create the image of an
individual caught midway between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, the musical's gender bending will take a curious
new turn, when a woman, Ally Sheedy, takes over the role.
</P>
<P>
   It is a risky move for both performer and production. For the
producers, casting a woman in a role that trades so heavily in
gender confusion means playing with the script's double-entendres
and humor, not to mention the loyalties of the show's devoted
following.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I talk to about it, when I tell them, their eyes kind
of go out of focus,'' Mitchell said. ``They're trying to grasp the
idea. Some people say that's not a good idea, to have a woman; some
people think it's wonderful.'' He emphasized that while the actor's
gender is changing, the character remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the word leaked out in late July that Ms. Sheedy
was taking over, Mitchell posted an open letter to Hedwig fans on
the show's Web site, explaining how he had met and cast Ms. Sheedy.
``She'll need to feel welcome to go where she needs to go in this
part,'' Mitchell concluded. ``And I hope you'll all be there for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Ms. Sheedy, whose career as a Brat Pack ingenue gave way
to a sustained professional slump in the late 1980s, the role means
putting her newfound reputation as a serious actress, and her
untested voice, to the test.
</P>
<P>
   How does she feel?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's essentially me onstage with a mike for 90 minutes,'' Ms.
Sheedy said recently over a cup of coffee before heading to a voice
rehearsal. ``Now I'm in the terrifying reality of having to do the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While popular and critical reaction to Ms. Sheedy remains to be
seen, what is certain is that Ms. Sheedy's take on the character is
bound to differ from those of her predecessors: Mitchell, Michael
Cerveris and currently, Kevin Cahoon.
</P>
<P>
   First off, there's a new wig: gone are the feathered sides in
favor of a look that the wig designer Mike Potter described as
``Sally Struthers meets Chaka Khan in a tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got dreads, crimps, spiral, curls and braids,'' he said.
``It's like all hairdos in one.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vocally, some key changes in songs have been made to suit Ms.
Sheedy's voice, and she has also dropped some of the ad-libs she
feels aren't working for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing her as straight as possible to begin with,'' Ms.
Sheedy said. ``And seeing how it goes over.''
</P>
<P>
   The choreography has also been stripped somewhat, too, allowing
her to explore what Trask called the ``rock 'n' roll survivor'' in
Hedwig. ``It's going to be less glam and more punk, less European
and more American, more New York, less London,'' Trask said. ``You
can imagine this Hedwig had a heroin problem at one point.''
</P>
<P>
   That alone would not make Hedwig a huge stretch for Ms. Sheedy.
After all, it was only last year that she won plaudits for playing
a heroin-addicted photographer in the independent film ``High
Art,'' a role that won her the Best Actress Award from the National
Society of Film Critics and several other groups. Other juicy roles
have followed, including that of a perpetually lonely production
designer in ``Sugar Town,'' directed by Allison Anders and Kurt
Voss, which opens Friday, and a slightly unhinged blind date in the
romantic comedy ``I'll Take You There,'' which was screened this
month at the Telluride Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The roles, and good reviews, have been a sweet vindication. A
Manhattan native, Ms. Sheedy had a career as a teen-age actress in
New York and fame in Hollywood in her 20s before suddenly finding
herself unable to win decent roles. She was eventually dropped by
her agent at the William Morris Agency and considered quitting
acting altogether. Shortly after that, she read the script for
``High Art'' and was so eager to play the role that she called the
director, Lisa Cholodenko, herself.
</P>
<P>
   Now 37, Ms. Sheedy displays much of the goofy charm _ she uses
the word ``like'' a lot _ and twinkling looks that scored with
teen-age boys in '80s movies like ``The Breakfast Club'' and
``WarGames.''
</P>
<P>
   She is married to David Lindsay, an actor she met during her
last stage appearance, a production of ``Advice From a
Caterpillar,'' by Douglas Carter Beane, in 1991. They have a
5-year-old daughter, Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy, who has been open about her battles with bulimia and
prescription drugs, still shows flashes of bitterness about what
she describes as the ``acceptable version of female'' that prevails
in Hollywood, which she feels shut her out of many roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel that I fit neatly into the particular definition
of femininity,'' said the actress, lean and slim-hipped, adding
with a puckish smile: ``I think there's something kind of
androgynous about me, and I kind of like it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that androgyny and an aura of having endured trial by
fire that first appealed to Mitchell. He said he felt it was a
perfect fit. ``There's anger and irony and world-weariness about
Ally's own life that infuses Hedwig all the time,'' he said. ``In
many ways, she is Hedwig. She's been through hell and back again
and she's not shy about saying so.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   It was in January, between screenings at the Sundance Film
Festival, that Mitchell and Ms. Sheedy first met and began to
discuss the possibility of her taking on Hedwig. Mitchell showed
Ms. Sheedy a videotape of the show; Ms. Sheedy's response was
immediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'd really love to do a show like that,''' she
recalled. ``And near the end of the festival he said, `You know I
really want a woman to do the show. Do you want to do it?'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy wanted the part but was not certain that she had the
vocal range for the score, which swings from punk to twangy country
to anthemic glam rock. ``It's such a new experience for me, because
it's something I haven't really tackled,'' she said of singing.
``It's a completely fortunate coincidence they like my voice,
because my voice is odd.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Trask said he wasn't completely convinced that Ms. Sheedy could
do it, either. ``I was totally prepared to say, `It's really nice
to meet you, but I don't think that it's going to work out,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   What Trask found, however, was a voice that fell somewhere
between the punk stylings of Patti Smith and the folk sound of
Natalie Merchant. He decided that every song could work with Ms.
Sheedy's voice and that in some cases the switch would allow him to
strip some songs back down to their original form.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a song, `Sugar Daddy,' which has a kind of a Vegas
feel the way John performed it,'' he said. ``I'd never intended it
like that. So I'm kind of excited to see it returned to a looser,
less revved-up feel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hedwig'' follows the story of a sexually confused, glam
rock-loving East Berliner who agrees to marry an American GI _ and
have a sex change _ in order to cross over to the West. Neither the
operation nor the marriage is a success, however, leaving Hedwig
living in a Kansas trailer park, where she plays mentor (and lover)
to a young Springsteen type named Tommy Gnosis. Apart from the
occasional grunt from the band or Hedwig's long-suffering husband,
Yitzak, the job of keeping the audience's attention is all
Hedwig's.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Perfecting that mix of song styles and character takes work. Ms.
Sheedy has been rehearsing five days a week with a voice coach, as
well as putting in daily sessions with Trask, the composer, and a
personal acting coach. To create a more masculine look, she has
trimmed her hair short and has been working out to build muscles in
her arms and shoulders. Her script, in a blue binder, is marked
with notes to herself on the character and decorated with a
Polaroid of herself and Mitchell, each in costume as Hedwig.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything has gone smoothly; her debut was originally
scheduled for this past Monday, but was rescheduled for next week
to make up for rehearsals lost when Ms. Sheedy had to travel to
Telluride. ``I went under serious duress,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gender gap, Ms. Sheedy says she feels a deep
connection to the role of Hedwig.
</P>
<P>
   ``She makes sense to me emotionally,'' she said. ``The fact that
she once had a penis that got cut off is just not presenting itself
as an obstacle to me.'' She adds with a laugh: ``I guess this is
what happens when you grow up on the Upper West Side.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the role also resonates with the life of her mother,
Charlotte Sheedy. The elder Ms. Sheedy, a literary agent in
Manhattan, divorced Ms. Sheedy's father in the early 1970s and
began a long-term relationship with another woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the other parts of Hedwig I understand is the search
for spiritual completion, which is something that I actually
watched firsthand my mother go through,'' Ms. Sheedy said. ``It's a
really long journey from thinking you're supposed to be one way and
then being brave enough to say, `What I actually am is something
else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Ms. Sheedy is finding her inspiration for the role,
Trask and Mitchell say they are confident that she is up to task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a reinvention of Hedwig,'' Trask said. ``But in
the end, we think the feeling is going to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell added: ``I guess historically, drag queens were
imitating movie stars and luminaries. It's kind of nice to have a
movie star imitating a drag queen.''

FALN VICTIMS DEMAND EXPLANATION FOR CLINTON'S CLEMENCY DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two victims of FALN bombings, joined by two former
FBI agents who investigated the terrorist group, on Wednesday
condemned President Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican
militants and demanded that the president explain his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Pascarella, a former New York City police officer who was
injured in a December 1981 FALN bombing, told a Senate panel he
could not understand why Clinton would grant any ``clemency request
with American blood on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The FALN gave me a life sentence when one of their bombs blew
off part of my leg, destroyed the hearing in one of my ears, badly
scarred my other leg and damaged my eyesight, and I want to know
why President Clinton feels that their sentence should be less
severe than mine,'' Pascarella told the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   William Newhall, who said he lost three friends and was severely
injured in the January 1975 bombing of Fraunces Tavern in New York
City, told the hearing that Clinton's decision was an ``affront''
to the families of those who died in FALN bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends' children grew up without their fathers, while
their wives were left to grieve and raise their families alone,''
Newhall said as he worked to hold back tears.
</P>
<P>
   Former FBI Special Agent Richard Hahn, who investigated FALN
attacks from 1975 to 1987, told the committee that the president's
decision sends a ``frightening message'' to terrorists that the
United States is not serious about protecting its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Wofford, a former FBI special agent who worked on FALN
cases from 1974 to 1980, said he feared the president's granting of
clemency might hurt current law enforcement efforts against the
FALN organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very difficult to get captured FALN members
to cooperate and give information about the group since they know
that their sentences could be shortened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the testimony of the Pascarella and Newhall, the
committee's chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, became visibly
angry at the refusal of White House officials to testify before
Congress on the president's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick and tired of being stiffed by this administration
when I ask for information that we have a right to see,'' said
Hatch. The chairman is well known for his calm demeanor and courtly
manners but he repeatedly stopped himself in mid-sentence to regain
his composure as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he will subpoena administration officials to testify
about Clinton's decision to grant clemency to the Puerto Rican
militants.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Justice Department blocked Neil Gallagher,
assistant director for the FBI's National Security Division, from
testifying at a separate Senate hearing on the clemency issue.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining its decision not to allow Gallagher to appear before
the committee, the Justice Department said in a statement that
there were constitutional questions about whether it would be
appropriate for FBI officials to testify because the power to grant
clemency is the president's exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, labeling that explanation as ``pathetic,'' said he would
ask his committee to subpoena Gallagher and officials from the
Justice Department and the White House to force them to appear
before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee cannot stand to be snubbed by the White
House,'' he said. ``The only thing we're asking for is that the
administration explain to us and the American people why it made a
decision that almost nobody understands or agrees with.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's threat came a day after the Senate voted 95 to 2 in
favor of a resolution calling the clemency decision ``deplorable.''
The House passed a similar measure last week with 311 to 41 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The votes on the president's decision have no actual impact on
the clemency granted to the Puerto Rican militants since Congress
has no constitutional authority to overturn the offers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 FALN members offered clemency, which required them to
renounce violence, 14 accepted and two declined.
</P>
<P>
   None of those granted clemency by Clinton was directly linked to
bombings that caused injuries or fatalities, a point the president
has cited in explaining his decision.
</P>
<P>
   However, at Wednesday's hearing, Hahn noted that some of the
released militants had been caught building bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men helped build the bombs, transport the bombs and plan
attacks, so don't tell me they had nothing to do with FALN
bombings,'' Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   The FALN was linked to 130 bombings that killed six people and
maimed dozens of others.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said the president's decision
``has undermined the country's doctrine that it will find
terrorists, hunt them down and punish them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., a long-time Clinton supporter,
said: ``As I have said, the burden of proof is on the
administration to prove why clemency should be granted. I have
repeatedly requested information on these cases. I have been given
no such information.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has said politics played no role in his clemency
decision and that he was swayed in large part by the lengthy terms
_ nearly 20 years in several cases _ already served by the FALN
members.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans and members of the law enforcement community
have accused Clinton of offering clemency to help his wife's
all-but-announced Senate candidacy from New York, home to some 1.3
million Puerto Ricans eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, the issue has turned into a headache for the first
lady. Mrs. Clinton first came out against the clemency offer,
angering many of New York's Puerto Rican leaders. Then last week
she explained that she should have consulted more with Latino
leaders before reaching a decision.

FRIENDLY TRIO KICKS TOUR INTO GEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bruce Hornsby and David Lindley supplied some
extraordinary musicianship, Shawn Colvin and Jackson Browne the
introspection, and Bonnie Raitt the rock as the veteran performers'
concert tour hit the Greek Theatre on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In their own personal hootenanny, Raitt and cohorts have been
performing together for the past three weeks as kind of an ad-hoc
band. Each of them is spotlighted at times throughout the evening
but usually with at least one of the others joining in on harmony
or in accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   The results, as you might guess, are uneven. Sometimes it works
quite well, such as on Colvin's hit ``Sunny Came Home,'' an
intimate number that benefits from strong backing, but there are
other times when numbers lack focus and the addition of another
voice or instrument seems extraneous.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately it's Raitt's energy that fuels the evening. After
30 years in the business, she's got as much kick _ maybe more _ as
she ever has. And songs like ``Are You Ready for a Thing Called
Love'' and ``Let's Give Them Something to Talk About'' had the
house rocking.
</P>
<P>
   Raitt did most of the talking, too, showing off her bawdy sense
of humor when she ended a solo she was dueting on with Lindley and
cracked, ``That's the first time I ever finished before a man.''
</P>
<P>
   While not as outgoing as Raitt, the others weren't slouches
musically. Hornsby showed off some wild piano licks, and Lindley
was his usual amazing self, excelling on a multitude of different
string instruments throughout the evening.
</P>
<P>
   While Colvin is an accomplished songwriter, most of her material
is suited to more intimate places than the Greek, which was sold
out. Browne, who has had a longer career and is a Southern
California fixture, fared better. His songs like ``The Pretender''
or ``Barricades of Heaven'' maintain their intimacy even with
expansive arrangements. And Browne can kick it into gear, too, as
he _ joined by the others _ proved on the final number before the
encore, ``Running on Empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best thing about the evening, though, was watching
how these longtime performers clearly have fun making music after
all these years. That in itself is inspirational. If the rest of us
could just enjoy our jobs that much. &UR;  &QL;

WIDER AMERICANS DEMAND WIDER SEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PHIL PATTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Boston Red Sox announced a long awaited and highly
controversial plan to replace venerable Fenway Park, the team made
much of the deficiencies of the old ballpark. At the top of the
list, however, were not the antiquated restrooms and snack bars,
the lack of revenue-producing sky boxes or even the rats that
occasionally menaced television cameramen. The most criticized
feature of the old stadium were the narrow seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our surveys, seating was the largest single issue for fans
who come to more than three games a year,'' said Kathryn St. John,
a spokeswoman for the team. ``When the park was full, people were
literally overflowing their seats.'' In the new stadium, fans will
enjoy an 18- or 19-inch seat instead of a 14- or 15-inch one.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox experience was a sign of how obsessed America has
become with widening its seats. That's mainly because its own seats
have widened. Statistics indicate that the number of obese
Americans has increased by 50 percent in the last two decades, and
since 1985, the average weight has grown by 10 pounds. Much of this
surplus has migrated to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Another ballpark, Tiger Stadium in Detroit, is due to be
replaced next year by Comerica Park, now under construction. Its
new molded-plastic seats, echoing the shape of the old wooden
slatted ones, will be 2 inches wider than the originals. Many of
the new crop of stadiums offer such seats, along with a premium
class of wider ones, called club seating, which is usually 2 inches
wider than standard. At Jack Kent Cooke Stadium outside of
Washington, home of the Redskins, the club section seats, or
chairs, as the management refers to them, are a full 5 inches wider
than those in the main seating areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, Americans have always liked things big,'' said George
Kordaris, the editor and publisher of Office Insight, an office
furnishings industry newsletter based in Darien, Conn. ``But
there's no question that American butts have gotten bigger in the
last few years. I've seen a lot of chairs from European companies
that Americans are just not comfortable in.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers and administrators of stadiums and theaters are
finding that the standard 18 inches of bench or bleacher space that
guides like the Architectural Graphic Standards of the American
Institute of Architects recommends no longer suffice for the same
number of people.
</P>
<P>
   At General Cinema Clifton Commons, a 16-theater omniplex in
Clifton, N.J., which opened last spring, the seats are wider than
those in older theaters, and cup holders are on the seat back in
front for elbow room. ``One of the positive feedback factors we get
is the improved seating,'' Ron Lichtenberger, the senior manager,
reported.
</P>
<P>
   In the air, seats are a key battle in the design of future
airliners, with Airbus bragging that its planned A3XX will offer
wider seats than the Boeing 747-400. Boeing, for its part, pushes
the virtues of the new 777, whose coach seats are wider than the
747s (18.5, against 17 inches).
</P>
<P>
   On the road, sport utility vehicles are growing larger, and so
are their seats. When Ford rolls out its new Excursion, 7 inches
longer than Chevrolet's Suburban, the Suburban counters with wider
seats in its year 2000 model. In Ford's new subcompact Focus, there
was no room to widen the seats, but, said Mike Bradley, the
designer in charge of the car's ergonomics, Ford did away with
constricting lumbar bolsters, flattening the seat bottom more
comfortably to accommodate human seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York City subway, the new R-110A cars coming to the
IRT lines do away with the old scoop seats in favor of a flat
bench, which eliminates overlap.
</P>
<P>
   With a certain militancy emerging on the part of larger members
of the population, many companies are reluctant to refer outright
to larger rears. But the renewed popularity of huge, old-fashioned
club chairs, like one in the fall Pottery Barn catalog, for
instance, suggests a subtle way to minister to those who want more
seat room. So, perhaps, does the return to fashion of such 1950s
designs as Arne Jacobsen's broad-beamed Swan chair.
</P>
<P>
   Definitive word on the increase in posterior dimensions awaits
the completion of a body-measurement study being conducted by the
Air Force and some 20 companies at the laboratories of Wright
Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. The Civilian American and
European Surface Anthropometry Resource project aims to update
designer templates for human dimensions, including rear ones.
Kathleen Robinette, head of the research lab, explained that by
using a new whole-body scanner, the project will supplement
traditional two-dimensional templates with statistics about surface
and volume. Many designs, she said, are based on obsolete
dimensions for the human body.
</P>
<P>
   But what most designers have already realized is that however
much the average rear may have expanded, the important news is that
it has become more varied. The population has become somewhat
taller and a good deal heavier but also far more diverse in size
and shape.
</P>
<P>
   This was one finding of the extensive research that went into
the design of Herman Miller's Aeron chair, a favorite in high-tech
offices. For this reason, William Stumpf, Don Chadwick and the
other designers finally decided to produce not one but three sizes
of the Aeron, a la Goldilocks. The designers also found that men
and women sit differently: larger men, for instance, lean back to
avoid excess weight on their ischial tuberosities, the bony points
of the posterior.
</P>
<P>
   In Will Self's novel ``Great Apes'' (Grove-Atlantic), a sort of
thinking person's ``Planet of the Apes,'' where chimps rule the
world, chimpanzee characters are struck by the strangeness of the
rear end of Homo sapiens. ``Ludicrously curvaceous,'' one of them
calls the human buttocks. Now research suggests that there may be
something to this notion. According to a scientific paper by Thomas
Greiner, a physical anthropologist at the New York Chiropractic
College in Seneca Falls, N.Y., the bipedal human carriage may
depend on larger buttocks. Dr. Greiner believes that a larger and
stronger gluteus maximus, and a longer hipbone for it to attach to,
help keep the body upright.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting seats to a variety of dimensions is hardly a new goal.
Along with all the ergonomic research, the Aeron team also pursued
a line of literary research. In Shakespeare, they found evidence of
the search for ideal size seating. The clown in ``All's Well That
Ends Well'' refers to the search for an imagined chair ``that fits
all buttocks; the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the
brawn-buttock, or any buttock.'' Such a chair is more elusive than
ever.

hit some turbulence. The Simi Valley-based company that customizes
airplane cabins, will cut its staff nearly in half _ to 126
employees _ and reduce executive compensation by about 20 percent
in the face of a bad quarterly report and dim prospects for the
near future. By Dave McNary.

</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-POP-MUSIC (Undated) _ During ``Not Lookin,''' a new duet
with her former beau, the urban love man K-Ci Hailey, Mary J. Blige
demonstrates how to stop a man cold. The song, from Ms. Blige's new
album, ``Mary,'' pits a woman seeking true affection against a man
out for pure pleasure. Throughout the 1990s, most discussions of
women's increased power in pop have focused on alternative-rock
transgressors like Tori Amos and Courtney Love or the songbirds of
Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair. Rhythm-and-blues artists sold albums
but were rarely viewed as culture shapers. Now, though, with
mainstream rock again becoming a male bastion, it is clear whose
music matters within the continuing emergence of women as equal
players in contemporary music. By Ann Powers. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY-NIGHT-LIVE (Undated) _ Nothing in popular culture can
be hip for 25 years. The culture turns over far too many times.
Icons become relics; objects of obsession become objects of
nostalgia. So what are we to make of ``Saturday Night Live''? The
one-time groundbreaking, precedent-setting, establishment-tweaking
comedy sketch show begins a decidedly well-established 25th season
on NBC next week, to be celebrated by a two-and-a-half-hour
prime-time special next Sunday night. Longevity is certainly not in
itself a claim on pop cultural relevance. Other shows have been on
longer but are in no danger of being labeled hip (e.g., ``The Price
Is Right''). But, apparently in defiance of both time and show
business convention, ``SNL'' begins a 25th year still the most
pervasive influence on the art of comedy in contemporary culture.
By Bill Carter. (Moved).

<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CALIGULA-FILM (Undated) _ This month, the re-release of a movie
that became infamous in 1980 for going too far will go even further
_ about 12 minutes further, according to its producer, Bob Guccione
of Penthouse magazine. ``Caligula,'' called by Newsweek ``a
two-and-one-half hour cavalcade of depravity,'' will now run nearly
two-and-three-quarters hours. The movie opened Friday in New York.
By Ted Loos. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JAKOB-THE-LIAR-FILM (Paris) _ ``Jakob the Liar,'' directed by
Peter Kassovitz and starring Robin Williams as the reluctant hero
Jakob Heym, opens in New York on Friday. The film, based on a 1969
novel by Jurek Becker, tells of a Jewish cafe owner who uses lies
to bring hope to a Polish wartime ghetto. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SHABBY-BLACK-DANCE (New York) _ ``I'm supposed to look like a
disheveled, disgruntled old geisha,'' Beverly Blossom said
cheerfully, dressed in a long golden kimono and top hat and
sprawled in a convenient folding chair in a midtown rehearsal
studio. Next she swept across the floor in a bargain-basement black
satin Balenciaga cloak and thrift-shop gold dress, a toy monkey
drooping from her hand. Then, with the donning of another, slightly
shredded costume, she became both an aging beauty and a
bottom-patting old gigolo drawn together in a bittersweet tango.
``Who (italics)is(end italics) she?'' a visitor to the studio
whispered, eyes wide, as Ms. Blossom glided through the dizzying
array of characters she will portray in ``Dances in Shabby Black,''
a retrospective program on Friday and Saturday at the Context
Studio, a small black-box theater on the Lower East Side. By
Jennifer Dunning. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   DOWNSIZING-MUSICALS (subslug) (New York) _ The dancing corkscrew
will still be there, as will the singing whisk and the graceful
cheese grater. But there may be slightly fewer spinning plates and
spatulas when ``Beauty and the Beast'' reopens at the Lunt-Fontanne
Theater on Nov. 12. By Robin Pogrebin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OHNESORG-MUSIC (Cologne, Germany) _ Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, 51, a
Bavarian, who has held various administrative position in Munich,
will become the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall.
By James R. Oestreich. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NINE-INCH-NAILS-ALBUM (New York) _ Trent Reznor can smile now.
``Everyone has this impression of me that I'm morose,'' he
complained. An interviewer pointed out that the albums he had made
as Nine Inch Nails were saturated in despair. ``Point taken,'' he
said. Reznor was caffeinated and voluble as he sat in a midtown
hotel room where he was doing interviews, sipping what was clearly
not his first cup of coffee and explaining how five years went by
between ``The Downward Spiral'' and Nine Inch Nails' new album,
``The Fragile.'' By Jon Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   UN-PRIVATE-HOUSE-ART (New York) _ Modern life is long, modern
art is short. That's why art keeps getting better all the time. If
you don't like it now, just stick around for a while. Eventually,
something likable is bound to turn up. It's a pleasure to report,
for example, that the Museum of Modern Art's architecture and
design department is back on track after several lackluster
seasons. ``The Un-Private House,'' a current show has been a
popular as well as a critical success. The exhibition of 26 recent
residential designs will run through Oct. By Herbert Muschamp.

RUCKUS SOCIETY `IN TRAINING' TO DISRUPT WTO SUMMIT IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They call it the perfect protest: a city snarled. Traffic tied
up. Banners hang from buildings. Protesters have chained themselves
to trees.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the The Ruckus Society, which teaches these things, which
espouses these methods, which really wants to disrupt life in
Seattle when the World Trade Organization meets here later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Ruckus Society will be at the Pragtri Farm just
outside of Arlington, Wash., to teach 160 activists from around the
world how to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   The society, based in Berkeley, Calif, promotes its weeklong
workshop as a camp. Instead it is a training ground for what could
be the nation's largest protest in 20 years. Protesters from
Florida, Vermont, Minnesota and Oregon are expected to attend the
camp, which started Wednesday. So are protesters from Canada and
England.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle police and federal agencies have set up a task force to
deal with the planned protests. The city's SWAT team will be on
alert, police said; specific security plans have not been released.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters and a police line make good visual images _ and
that's what the Ruckus Society says its training is all about: It
wants protesters to get their messages across, but it doesn't want
them to get hurt doing it. .
</P>
<P>
   The WTO conference will be held in Seattle Nov. 29 through Dec.
3. It will bring about 5,000 delegates from around the world to
discuss, among other things, trade and tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Westlund, communications director for the Rainforest Action
Network, which is co-sponsoring the camp at the Pragtri Farm, is
glad to see delegates from around the world will come together
during the WTO conference.
</P>
<P>
   But he's concerned, too, about the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good thing,'' Westlund said of the WTO conference.
``It's good to see an acknowledgment that the world is one, linked
ecoysystem.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we're going to globalize, we need to have environmental
laws, we need to have laws that protect people. We gotta get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Forcing the delegates from 150 nations to ``get it right'' is
the overarching theme of The Ruckus Society's camp. Its official
title, ``Globalize This!'' was coined by John Sellers, The Ruckus
Society's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Courses include how to reconnoiter areas for protests; how to
blockade objects and streets; how to perform effective political
theater; and how to coordinate massive, non-violent movements of
humans against an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The camp also marks a departure further into the politics of
protest for the 5-year-old group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new lease for us,'' said Sellers, a Greenpeace
veteran. ``This is the first time we've done a camp with a totally
concrete political target in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we've always tried to depoliticize the camps. Now
we'll be able to do a lot more livewire classes, with everything
focused on distilling the same basic message.''
</P>
<P>
   That message?
</P>
<P>
   The WTO is a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers calls this camp ``advanced camp.'' The only applications
accepted, he said, were for progressive, experienced protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people are planning on making their feelings
known,'' said Westlund, of the Rainforest Action Network. ``But
we're focused on getting our message across in a non-violent way.
</P>
<P>
   That means climbing buildings, creating mass civil disturbances
and performing skits that demonize the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be doing an expanded technology bit of things _ digital
activism, like online security, encryption, building the perfect
Web site against WTO,'' Sellers said. ``We'll be doing advanced
media classes. We won't have mandatory climbing workshops like
we've done at some of our other camps, but we'll have it so that
people can climb pretty much anytime they want at the workshops.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be an advanced ropes course at the farm, Sellers
said, and a two-story steel structure for people to practice
climbing buildings _ which is designed to help them better display
their banners made of rip-stop nylon.
</P>
<P>
   The society's climbing expertise has been on display in Seattle
before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, nine society trainers dangled from the Aurora Bridge
for 48 hours to block a fishing trawler from leaving Lake Union.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers was at the Aurora Bridge that day, though not dangling
from it; he was providing site security for the others. In 1998,
Sellers and three other activists climbed to the top of a
construction crane in downtown Houston and opened a giant banner
that read ``Houston, We Have a Problem _ Stop New Oil
Exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   The WTO conference, which focuses on global trade, has given the
group, and protesting in general, a much-needed boost.
Municipalities have become much stricter about citing people for
civil disobedience, Sellers says, and that's made it tougher to
find people willing to get a message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things are heating up right now,'' Sellers says. ``The
media is champing at the bit to go and report this kind of news.
There's no Monica Lewinsky, story, no O.J. Simpson story.''

   NEW YORK _ For 12 years, the 74-year-old Biltmore Theater has
stood dark and lifeless, blackened by fire damage, crumbling with
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Now with Times Square suddenly prime real estate and theaters in
increasingly great demand, people are fighting over the 948-seat
house, at 261 W. 47th St.
</P>
<P>
   The battle, between a real estate developer, who says he wants
to restore and book the theater, and the Nederlander Organization,
which says it may try to more than double the house's size so that
it can accommodate musicals, has cast a light on some of Broadway's
most beautiful and neglected jewel boxes: the small, two-balcony
theaters, mostly on the less popular east side of Broadway, that
have fallen into disuse.
</P>
<P>
   Theater operators, who had considered these properties obsolete
money losers, and real estate interests are now vying over at least
three of the theaters, suggesting that a recent trickle of serious,
straight drama on Broadway could lead to a busier future for houses
like the Biltmore, Belasco, Cort and Lyceum. Yet the strengthening
real estate market in Manhattan could threaten the theaters as
never before.
</P>
<P>
   There is new interest in the Lyceum Theater on West 45th Street,
which has been dark 70 percent of the time over the last 12 years,
according to a report by Richard Frankel, one of several Broadway
producers interested in putting a tourist attraction in the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a number of successful plays in smaller theaters,
including last season's ``Blue Room'' at the Cort on West 48th
Street, Shubert Organization chairman Gerald Schoenfeld, said,
``All of this bodes well for the future.'' He once campaigned
unsuccessfully against designating the theaters as city landmarks,
arguing that theater owners should receive tax breaks or other
compensation for the burden of operating under landmark status.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Bernstein, president of the League of American Theaters and
Producers, said: ``Do we have a new paradigm? I don't think anybody
knows the answer to that. This season if you had a telephone booth
you could book it if it had a fire exit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Broadway theaters are booked to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the Biltmore involves all the issues that are
likely to shape the theaters' future.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Moinian, a real estate developer, said he wanted to
restore the Biltmore and build a 43-story residential hotel next to
it. He is suing the Nederlanders, the prominent theater owners,
arguing that the organization improperly terminated his contract to
purchase the property because real estate values had tripled since
1997, when he arranged to buy the property for $14.4 million. They
now believe that the Biltmore can fetch a higher price, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   The Nederlanders have moved to dismiss Moinian's complaint on
the grounds that he failed to show up for the real estate closing
last April, thereby defaulting on the deal. The theater owners are
considering transforming the Biltmore into an 1,800-seat theater as
they shop it to other prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Biltmore's interior became a city landmark in 1987, as did
the interiors of five other Broadway theaters, meaning that any
changes made for a production, like taking out rows of seats to
expand the stage, must be reversed after the show closes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the options they're considering is rehabilitation of
the interior and exterior in compliance with landmark
regulations,'' said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the
Nederlanders, in reference to the Biltmore. ``They will either sell
it or rent it or retain it. They're looking at all three options.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Judge Herman Cahn of state Supreme Court in Manhattan
heard arguments in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for the Biltmore are sharply different than they
were in the 1980s, when all of Broadway's theater owners fought
landmark designation for theaters that they did not see as
economically viable. These small theaters are difficult to book
because many people do not want to sit in a second balcony and
producers need a certain seating capacity to earn a return on their
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Larger theaters like the Gershwin, the Majestic and the Marquis
each have about 1,600 seats and only one balcony. And some
theaters, like the Helen Hayes, rarely use their second balconies.
</P>
<P>
   Can theater owners be blamed for wanting to update these small
houses or get rid of them? ``Most of these buildings are
approaching 100 years old, and you can't just recreate them
easily,'' Bernstein said. ``By the same token, you can't remodel
them easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's really hard for theater owners to grapple with the
problem. There is no other business I can think of where the owners
of the factories are still operating with the same plant as they
were 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s theater owners struggled to fill seats
because of the economic downturn, and some sought to unload their
properties. In 1991, for example, the Nederlanders sold the Mark
Hellinger theater to the Times Square Church. About three years
later, the Shubert Organization agreed to install a community court
in the Longacre Theater for three years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Biltmore is not the only house of its size that is suddenly
coveted. Two blocks down, a fight is raging over the fate of the
foundering Lyceum on 45th Street. Several producers want to open an
hourlong show geared toward tourists, ``The Spirit of Broadway,''
which would run several times a day. But Schoenfeld contends that
the production is not a legitimate theatrical attraction and does
not belong in the Lyceum.
</P>
<P>
   Although he called the Lyceum a money-losing liability when he
sold the Lyceum's air rights to Bertelsmann AG, the German media
company, Schoenfeld nevertheless said: ``We're not interested in
doing anything other than preserving these theaters for the
presentation of legitimate theatrical attractions.''
</P>
<P>
   Another developer holds a similar option at the Belasco, a
Shubert theater.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent demand for Broadway houses of almost any
size, many people in the theater district say the Biltmore-sized
theaters do not have much of a long-term future.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns
the two-balcony Walter Kerr Theater, said he believed that the
demand would change with the economy. ``The future of the
two-balcony playhouse is still extremely grim right now,''
Landesman said. ``There's a theater shortage and booking backlog,
but it's not going to last. We've been through these cycles
before.'
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Landesman said, he does not consider the Walter
Kerr newly valuable property. ``If I can get a good price, I would
take it,'' he said ``It's tough to book.''
</P>
<P>
   The Biltmore, home of ``Barefoot in the Park,'' ``Hair'' and
``My Sister Eileen,'' was built in 1925. Designed by Herbert J.
Krapp and developed by Irwin Chanin, the neo-classical theater
needs extensive repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Moinian said he originally intended to turn the Biltmore into a
lobby for the adjacent high rise he planned to build on the east
side of Eighth Avenue between 47th Street and 48th Street, which he
would call the Biltmore. But because of the theater's landmark
interior, Moinian said the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission
informed him that such plans would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Moinian said he proceeded with plans to restore the theater.
Unable to locate the original blueprints, Moinian hired an
architectural firm, Issac &AMP; Stern, that recreated the plans from
scratch. He then hired the architectural firm Li Saltzman, which
specializes in restoration. The plans were submitted to the
Landmarks Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Rosen Deutsch, the chief of staff for the landmarks
commission, said, ``When we heard about the litigation, it was
decided we would wait to hear the outcome on ownership before any
permits were issued.''

 &HT;    End of Tukky's adventure tears at boy's heart, father's walletBy
John Kelso
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ The good news is that
<TEXT>
Tukky, the Hebrew-speaking African gray parrot, has been found and
is back speaking Hebrew in its own cage in Northwest Austin.
<P>
   The bad news is that the kid who took it in wants one of these
high-dollar birds for himself. And his dad says that will set him
back a couple of grand.
</P>
<P>
   But what the heck? He's a chiropractor.
</P>
<P>
   After reading about Michelle Perris-Moscona's lost bird, Tukky,
in this column Sunday morning, Dr. Jay Morgan, who lives about two
miles from Perris-Moscona as the parrot flies, realized that the
bird his family took in was, indeed, slightly conversant in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   So on Sunday, Morgan and his son, Casey, 12, returned the bird
after some grieving by the boy. Casey, a bird enthusiast who had
wanted an African gray parrot for quite some time, thought his
prayers had been answered when the bird showed up next door
unexpectedly and he got to take it home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been bugging us just like a Chinese water drip torture
to get an African gray,'' Jay Morgan said. ``If you sneak into his
room at night, you can hear him praying on his knees to God to get
him one.''
</P>
<P>
   This bird yarn began Sept. 2 when Tukky, the Hebrew word for
parrot, flew away from Perris-Moscona's deck. She lives on Cat
Mountain with her husband, Jerry, and son, Ronny, 13. The bird
learned to say a few phrases in Hebrew from listening to the family
chat in the living room. Michelle and Jerry hail from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgans live on top of Shepherd Mountain, overlooking Loop
360 and the Pennybacker Bridge _ a couple of hills over from the
Moscona family. The Morgans have a cockatoo named Gumbo. This is
high-end territory, and no one out here in these large homes keeps
chickens unless they are wrapped in cellophane.
</P>
<P>
   Around 7:30 last Saturday night, the Morgans' next-door neighbor
called the Morgans to report that a bird had run into the
neighbor's back window and stunned itself. The neighbor figured the
bird was Gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   But when young Casey found out the bird was an African gray
parrot, he rushed next door to apply for custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't even get off the phone, and my son is like ringing
their doorbell,'' Jay Morgan said. ``It was like he was aglow. He
was absolutely ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Morgans took the bird in, not knowing who owned it.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sunday morning, Jay Morgan picked up my column and started
reading about a missing Hebrew-speaking parrot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm (thinking), `No way, it can't be the same bird, and the
article says, `Mimics cell phones,''' he recalled. ``About the time
I read that, the bird goes, `(insert cell phone noise here).'''
</P>
<P>
   He read on. ``Person lost it from West Austin. I'm going, `Bad
sign,''' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the dagger through the heart: ``And then I read further,
and it says it speaks Hebrew,'' Morgan said. ``So I go over to the
cage I have him in, and I go, `Tukky,' and he goes, `Tukky,' and I
go, `Oh-oh, we're dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said approaching his son about returning the bird was
tough duty. ``So my wife and I go in his bedroom, and I say, `Son,
we've found the owner of the bird.' Casey goes, `There's no
possible way,' and I said, `Son, go speak Hebrew to him.' And he
says, 'What's Hebrew?'''
</P>
<P>
   Casey came around to see things his father's way. ``I said,
'Casey, we have to do the right thing here,''' Morgan said. So on
Sunday, Jerry Moscona picked up Tukky. And no, the Morgans did not
accept the $250 reward.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Perris-Moscona is glad to have her bird back. Jay
Morgan is pleased about that, too, although he says the incident
will lighten his wallet. He figures he has to get Casey an African
gray parrot, which costs considerably more than a $7 duck from
Callahan's General Store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure this woman over on Cat Mountain is going to cost me
about a grand for a bird and another grand for a cage,'' Morgan
joked. ``I have no choice. We kind of hope he (Casey) forgets, but
we figure the chances of that are about the same as flying in the
space shuttle.''

NEDERLANDER NEGOTIATES ITS OWN STAGEHAND PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Breaking ranks with Broadway's other major theater
owners, officials of the Nederlander Organization have reached a
separate agreement with the stagehands' union.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Local One of the International Alliance of Theatrical
Stage Employees ratified the new contract Sunday, said Tony
DePaulo, the theater business manager for the union.
</P>
<P>
   The Nederlanders' move was a departure from the most common
labor strategy of theater owners, who let the League of American
Theaters and Producers, a trade organization, represent their
interests in negotiation sessions with the unions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the rationale for making their own deal, the
Nederlander official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said, ``Sometimes you just don't feel like being part of a massive
committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The current contract between the League and Local One expired
July 31. The new, five-year agreement between the Nederlanders and
Local One includes an annual 3 to 3.5 percent increase in pay along
with title and category upgrades for some production stagehands,
said DePaulo. He said stagehands' salaries under the previous
contract ranged from $944 to $1,270 per week, with benefits and
pension payments.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the Nederlanders received concessions from the
union on work rules for house electricians and other backstage
workers as well as the use of film stock shot during performances.
``I think it's a very progressive deal,'' DePaulo said. ``It
reflects the 1990s rather than the 1940s.''
</P>
<P>
   The league and the other two major Broadway theater owners, the
Shubert Organization and Jujamcyn Theaters, are to begin their
negotiations with the union Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nederlanders are the first major theater owner to directly
seek their own deal with a union, although corporate producers like
Disney, with hits like ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``The Lion
King,'' and Livent, producer of the musical ``Ragtime,'' have
negotiated their own deals. The Nederlanders own eight theaters
outright and half of the Palace Theater.
</P>
<P>
   According to the league's by-laws, members are allowed a
one-time exception from the collective bargaining negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Kylie Robertson, a spokeswoman for the league, said the league
had no comment on the deal. ``The league was not involved in this
issue,'' she said.

 &HT;    Retirement of execs forcing new strategies
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ American corporations face a growing challenge: the
loss of management talent through retirement as the population
ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there aren't enough young workers to fill the gap,''
Business Week (Sept. 20) reports. ``So companies are tapping the
vast resources of their older workers'' by scrapping age limits and
creating ``bridge periods'' or transitions between full-time work
and retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are already adopting defensive strategies. Chevron
conducts ``demographic audits'' to pinpoint skill shortages.
Monsanto and Prudential use retirees as temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   Pro sport nightmares
</P>
<P>
   They're talented, rich and famous, and they get to play ball for
a living. But off the playing field or court, pro athletes face a
host of trials and tribulations, says P.O.V. (October). The
problems include career-ending injuries, losing seasons and fans
who become foes with one missed foul shot or field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stripped of celebrity's sheen, their motivations and
sacrifices seem not just unenviable but even a little mundane,''
the magazine says of the pro athlete's lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy 3 Sticks' return
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta native James D. Robinson III didn't retire to the golf
course after being forced out as American Express CEO six years
ago, as so many ex-chief executives might have done.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes (Sept. 20) says he relied on his AmEx connections and
multiple board memberships _ including Coca-Cola _ to build a
successful investment advisory firm specializing in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``Jimmy 3 Sticks'' by the New York press, Robinson is
chairman of Violy, Byorum &AMP; Partners, which has put together $5
billion in deals in the last four years, Forbes says.
</P>
<P>
   The market's art
</P>
<P>
   Computerized stock market certificates may be more efficient
than traditional shares of stock, but they will never replace the
quality of those old-fashioned certificates with pictorial artwork
good enough to frame.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune (Sept. 27) provides a look at some of the finely
engraved stock market certificates via excerpts from a new book,
``The Art of the Market.''
</P>
<P>
   A share of stock is technically a bill of sale, proof of part
ownership in a corporation. But the certificate may outlast the
company and become valuable as art.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ The September/October issue of Competitive Edge, one of
several Atlanta-based business publications, looks at the
importance of cultural differences for companies engaged in global
business. ``The fastest state-of-the-art technology will not help
you make sales if the cultures of foreign customers cause them to
misinterpret your communications,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Privately owned companies are behind much of the state's
growth, Georgia Trend (September) says in its annual report on
Georgia's largest private firms.

GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO COMES TO THE RESCUE OF THE FIRST LADY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The governor of Puerto Rico enlisted in the New
York Senate campaign of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on
Wednesday in a move that could bolster Puerto Rico's drive to evict
the U.S. Navy from a target range on the island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Pedro Rossello said his political support for
the first lady's pending campaign for the New York Senate seat was
not conditioned on her support for Navy withdrawal from Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically offering my help in her campaign for the U.S.
Senate and my views on issues that pertain to Puerto Rico,''
Rossello said before meeting Mrs. Clinton at the White House. He
said the first lady ``would be an exceptional senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, during a round of meetings on Capitol Hill, won a
commitment from Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to introduce
legislation to transfer Navy-owned land on Vieques to the
government of Puerto Rico. The committee has jurisdiction over U.S.
territories such as Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski's legislation would turn 22,000 acres of Navy-owned
land on Vieques over to the government of Puerto Rico within 60
days of Rossello submitting a land use plan to the White House and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello said he will continue his five-month campaign to
persuade President Clinton and Congress to permanently end target
practice on Vieques in the aftermath of a Marine Corps' bombing
mishap in April that killed a Puerto Rican security guard and
injured four others.
</P>
<P>
   Ending target practice and turning the land over to Puerto Rico
is ``a question of fairness,'' Rossello said. Live-fire training on
an island inhabited by civilians would ``not be happening in any
other territory that is a state,'' Rossello added.
</P>
<P>
   Target practice has been suspended since April, a step that Navy
maintains could imperil the combat readiness of Atlantic-based Navy
and Marine units.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello said he has asked Vice President Al Gore to persuade
Clinton to order the Navy to withdraw from Vieques, located eight
miles east of the main island of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``has been very supportive and has expressed to President
Clinton his desire that the Navy look for other alternatives other
than Vieques,'' said Rossello, a two-term governor of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello met with Mrs. Clinton after meeting with Murkowski and
other lawmakers on Capitol Hill. A special Pentagon review panel
continues to prepare a recommendation for the White House on the
Navy's future use of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Puerto Rico and allies in Congress want the
president to order a permanent end to live-fire training that has
been going on the island since 1941, as well as Navy turnover of
two thirds of the island territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy contends the 899-acre live fire impact area, an 11,000
acre maneuver area and an 8,000 acre ammunition depot provide the
opportunity for integrated land, air and sea combat training that
cannot be duplicated anywhere else on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the president as commander in chief will be able
to see the broad panorama and he will be able to make a decision
that's in the interests of the American citizens who live on
Vieques,'' Rossello said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 9,300 civilians live on the island that was seized along
with Puerto Rico by the United States in the Spanish American War
in 1898.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rossello could be an important campaign asset if Mrs. Clinton
runs for the Senate seat of retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., particularly as she tries to recover from a misstep on a
White House clemency offer to imprisoned Puerto Rican nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton urged the president to rescind the clemency offer
three weeks after extending leniency, only to have most of the
Puerto Rican nationalists accept the deal a few days later. Puerto
Rican politicians in New York accused the first lady of a flip flop
that imperils their support for her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Rossello said Mrs. Clinton's ``intervention was a catalyst''
to forcing the imprisoned nationalists to reach a decision to
accept White House conditions for clemency, adding that the
question is now ``a closed issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello's support could be crucial in New York City, where
Clinton's expected rival, Republican New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, carried 43 percent of the Hispanic vote in the New York
City mayoral race in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics, including Puerto Ricans, made up 20 percent of the
New York City vote in that election.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics, including New York state's 1.3 million Puerto Ricans,
were an important source of support last year for then-Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., in his ouster of veteran Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y. Schumer won 82 percent of the Hispanic vote statewide in a
contest in which Hispanics represented 6 percent of the statewide
electorate.

   2 More Robot Kits From Lego Mindstorms &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lego Mindstorms may have managed to capture the market of
pre-teen-age boys (and their fathers) with its line of buildable,
programmable Lego robots introduced last fall. This year, the
company wants to give 9-year-olds, too, a reason to pester their
parents for Legos. And they won't even need a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Two new products _ the Robotics Discovery Kit and the Droid
Developer Kit _ are showing up in stores this month. The droid kit,
which features white, blue and silver-colored pieces, enables
children to recreate and program the robots of ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery set is more colorful. Models made with its pieces
can perform up to 3,000 behaviors like chirping, rolling forward
and, to provide that element of security all 9-year-olds need,
firing a harmless rubber dart as soon as they sense bright light.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's product required children to assemble their robots,
create their programming instructions on computers and then
download the programs into their creations. The new sets do not
require traditional computers at all; they come with palm-size
microcomputers that can be programmed by pressing buttons on their
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the learning here is for kids to understand the
process of invention,'' said John Dion, a Lego Mindstorms
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lego is still making some assumptions about the
technical skills of its clientele: to read the droid kit's building
instructions, you must have a computer with a CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of shag carpets, beware: The discovery set comes with 387
easily lost plastic pieces, and the droid kit has nearly 700. &QL;

Wednesday's onslaught, recording the progress of the surf as it
crashed its way up to the house. Their Web page received more than
470,000 hits in 24 hours (z.treco.net/greg).

   Sun's New Network Strategy Is to Aim to Simplify Things &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the battle to rid personal computing of needless complexity,
Sun Microsystems recently announced a new network computing
technology.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the Sun Ray 1 appears to be an ultrathin,
high-tech desktop computer with a flat-panel monitor and a central
processing unit no larger than a closed novel. Upon closer
examination, the Sun Ray 1 is what Sun executives like to call an
appliance. All the real computing is done over a powerful,
high-speed network, much the way a telephone is an appliance linked
to a complex network that the user never sees.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Ray 1 does not store applications like word processing
and spreadsheet programs on the desktop, as conventional PCs do.
Everything is on a network. Users insert a special card to gain
access to the network and their files. With the card, users can
also get to their work on any Sun Ray 1 on the network, freeing
them from having to be at a particular desk.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Ray 1 is not available for home use yet. The first
markets for the Sun Ray 1 are, among others, customer management
systems like call centers and help desks; education, including
libraries and school administration, and government and financial
services. But when broadband service, like digital subscriber
lines, becomes more widely available, the Sun Ray 1 could migrate
into the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a technology that can make use of the bandwidth
that is coming available,'' said George Banman, a vice president
and general manager for information applications. &QL;

   A New Player Can Decipher MP3 Music Files on CDs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an uncommon merger of competing technologies, Pine
Technology, a company based in Hong Kong, says it has found a way
to combine the best of MP3 music and CD players.
</P>
<P>
   The device, called a D' Music CD Player SM-200C, looks much like
any other portable CD player and can play regular CDs. Its chief
advantage, said Brian Hamilton, the vice president for sales and
marketing at Pine Technology USA, is that the player can also read
and decode music in the MP3 format, something regular CD players
can't do.
</P>
<P>
   That means that rather than read MP3 music stored on chips
(usually no more than a hour) in MP3 players, the D' Music CD
player reads MP3 compressed music stored on compact disks, which
can hold more than 100 songs and hours of music.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, and it may be considerable for many consumers, is
getting the MP3 music onto to CDs. That requires another device, a
CD writer, something that most computer owners must add to their
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hamliton said the $299 player (three times the cost
of a conventional CD player and about $100 more than most MP3
players) represented a significant step forward for Web-wired music
lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing today is just the start of a lot of
fantastic things to come in the next year or so,'' he said. The
player will go on sale this fall. &QL;

   Giving Books Away Online While Hard Copies Are Sold &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those who argue about the virtues of paperbacks versus
electronic books, Byron Preiss has a new question: Why not enjoy
both? Preiss is the president of Ibooks, which opened its doors on
the Web this week. Ibooks, at www.ibooksinc.com, publishes
paperback and hardback books even as it gives them away in
electronic form.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few weeks, people can download the first chapters
of the books from the Web. After Oct. 1, visitors will have free
access to all of them.

   Medical Guide From Harvard Has an Online Supplement &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Simon &AMP; Schuster releases the Harvard Medical Family Health
Guide, a 1,300-page book, next month, it will have its own
anti-aging prescription: a Web site to provide updates on the text
chapters as they arise.
</P>
<P>
   The guide, which will sell for $29.95, features information on
how to navigate managed health care and on how all the major
biological systems work.
</P>
<P>
   It also has sections on the diseases and disorders associated
with each system.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the site (www.health.harvard.edu/fhm) can be viewed
now and is not limited to owners of the Family Health Guide. The
site is designed to supplement the book's core material.
</P>
<P>
   The guide and the site, edited by Harvard Medical School faculty
members, are designed to improve the quality of communication
between doctors and patients, said Dr. Anthony Kamaroff, editor in
chief of the Harvard Medical Family Heath Guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time patients have with their doctors is shrinking,''
Kamaroff said. ``So we want to give the patient a thorough idea of
what questions the doctor is likely to ask, to help them prepare
ahead for when they're in the doctor's office.''
</P>
<P>
   The site has interactive features designed to make it easier to
understand some of the complex charts in the book, Kamaroff said.
The 165 symptom charts, for example, are laid out in the book as
logic trees, but they can be navigated on line by answering a
sequence of yes or no questions.

`ACTION' AN INTELLIGENT COMEDY WITH AN ADULT SLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lights! Camera! Ask the kids to leave the room!
</P>
<P>
   And then get ready for some ``Action.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that kind. Not on the screen, anyway. While ``Action'' the
TV show might be indelicate and coarse, we're persuaded that it
does have some standards. For instance, there is no frontal nudity
in Thursday night's premiere. Well, there is a
penis-mightier-than-the-sordid scene when a studio boss steps out
of the shower to confront our crude antihero, Peter Dragon. (Yup,
his name is Peter Dragon.) But the camera stays focused squarely on
the only Peter that won't get Fox arrested.
</P>
<P>
   At least not this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' is as earthy as a landfill, and there are many who
will complain that's where it belongs. The language is raw (the
really off-color stuff is bleeped but no less recognizable), and
there's so much sexual inuendo that it almost comes out the other
endo, right onto the cable converter. But, unlike other sitcoms,
which use sex because there seems to be a manual somewhere that
says sexual situations are inherently funny, ``Action'' uses sex
because it's inherently believable.
</P>
<P>
   And as a satire of the movie industry, ``Action'' is delectable.
Think of all those things a Boy Scout is supposed to be _
courteous, kind, clean, reverent, morally straight _ and now think
of the opposite. That's ``Action'': fearless, creative and as
offensive as a commercial network dares to be.
</P>
<P>
   If ribaldry is not your scene, no need to go in search of
``Action.'' But if intelligent comedy with an adult slant doesn't
make you dive under the bed, ``Action'' may be the best thing to
hit Thursday nights since ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that it's not on NBC. You've got a clicker, no? Look
under the sofa, next to the dusty sock. There. Now click over to
Fox and meet Peter and Wendy.
</P>
<P>
   Peter is a golden-boy producer for Dragonfire Films. Wendy is a
former child star who turned to prostitution when the nose candy
gave her a big nasal cavity and a lousy attitude. They meet by
accident and strike an unlikely partnership that makes Wendy
Peter's confidante and de facto script consultant. (Though his last
few films _ ``Uzi Easter,'' ``Carnival of Daggers,'' ``Dead and
Spit On in Oakland'' _ have earned billions worldwide, Peter
wouldn't know good writing from a good grocery list.)
</P>
<P>
   The series bears some resemblance to the current Albert Brooks
film, ``The Muse.'' Like Brooks' screenwriter character, Peter
Dragon is in danger of falling off the Hollywood A-list because his
current movie, ``Slow Torture,'' is a dud. Catching Wendy's fur
coat in the door of his limo may be a stroke of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Live'' alumnus Jay Mohr, who played the sleazy
agent in ``Jerry Maguire,'' is completely despicable as Peter
Dragon. That's a good thing, although Peter is so unlikable he's
hard to root for. But studio boss Bob Gianopolis (Lee Arenberg) is
even worse _ he stole Peter's wife, even though he's gay _ which
may give Peter just enough underdog status to win us over.
</P>
<P>
   If not, there's always Wendy Ward, played with unbridled panache
by Illeana Douglas. Wendy can be as blunt and brash as Peter, but
where Peter's glass of diet spite is half empty, Wendy's glass of
Jolt never needs refilling. She's also smarter than a roomful of
movie moguls and knows what most of them look like with their pants
down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, no spoof of Hollywood is complete without celebrity
walk-ons. Thursday night's 9 o'clock premiere features Keanu Reeves
sitting down; a second episode in the show's regular 9:30 time slot
Thursday night has Salma Hayek. Next week we get Steve Garvey (hey,
they can't all be A-list), and the week after that it's Sandra
Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Action'' will succeed on irreverence and a willingness to
pillory with shotgun randomness. The Jewish power structure in
Tinseltown gets its share of zingers, but ``Action'' is likely to
offend every interest group long before the wrap party. After
Thursday night, Christians, homosexuals, O.J. Simpson supporters,
peasants in Calcutta and employees of the month may want to warm up
their letter-writing arms.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``Action'' isn't without its touching moments. It's
Christmastime in the first episode when Peter, not knowing what to
get Wendy, gives her an envelope stuffed with cash.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously touched, Wendy says, ``But I didn't get you
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter demurs, but Wendy persists: ``I could call my girlfriend
Tracy and we could fool around together while you watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's so sweet,'' Peter says.
</P>
<P>
   To which Wendy replies: ``Well, 'tis the season.''
</P>
<P>
   'Tis also the season for more than three dozen new series on the
networks, and ``Action'' may be one of the best. It's racy. It's
vulgar. And it's very funny.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, there's no laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   Action. Half-hour comedy series satirizing the movie industry.
Starring Jay Mohr, Illeana Douglas and Buddy Hackett. Two-episode
season premiere Thursday night on Fox. Show moves to 9:30 p.m. next
Thursday. Parental guideline rating: TV-MA.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having warmed up the New York State Theater with
returning productions of ``Madama Butterfly'' and ``The Magic
Flute'' over the weekend, the New York City Opera offered its first
new production of the season, Rossini's ``Viaggio a Reims,'' on
Tuesday evening. The performance was treated, for some reason, as
the official opening of the season, which is to say that it was
followed by a dinner for patrons, and included a 30-minute tribute
to Beverly Sills after the intermission, honoring the 45th
anniversary of her debut with the company.
</P>
<P>
   For admirers of the bel canto style, it was also an occasion to
celebrate the City Opera's tradition of exploring rarities,
neglected works and unusual editions of familiar operas.
``Viaggio,'' after all, is an odd duck. As Rossini's last opera in
Italian, it holds a pivotal place in his works list; yet it was
also the very definition of an occasional work, meant to celebrate
a specific public event, the coronation of King Charles X of France
in 1825. Rossini, apparently considering the work of no further
use, withdrew it and cannibalized it in other works.
</P>
<P>
   The score was lost until the mid-1970s, when some of the
orchestral parts were found in Paris. Other materials were
discovered in Vienna and Rome, and the work had its first modern
staging in 1984. But it wasn't until 1992 that the final piece, a
chorus that begins the finale, turned up in the manuscript
collection of the New York Public Library. So although there is a
fine recording of the work, conducted by Claudio Abbado on the Sony
Classical label, ``Viaggio'' is a new world for most listeners.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of charm, cleverness and demands for vocal acrobatics,
``Viaggio'' has a lot to offer, even for a listener who usually
finds Rossini easily resistible. The story is slight but amusing. A
band of travelers is stuck at a hotel awaiting transportation to
Reims, where the coronation is to take place. When horses prove
unavailable, they decide to take part in the celebrations in Paris
instead, but before they leave, each traveler _ all the important
European powers of the time are represented _ offers a tribute to
the new king, sung in the appropriate national style.
</P>
<P>
   Political allegories are plentiful (program book essays by
musicologists Philip Gossett and Janet Johnson offer a key for
modern listeners), but so is Rossinian comic froth, including a
patter song and pairs of lovers at cross purposes. Because a starry
cast had assembled in Paris for the coronation and was available to
Rossini, he wrote no fewer than 10 principal roles, making for a
nearly nonstop stream of ambitiously florid arias and challenging
ensembles. This may also have been one reason Rossini withdrew the
work: its potential casting problems were immense.
</P>
<P>
   The City Opera has assembled a cast that was surprisingly
comfortable not only with Rossini's vocal acrobatics, but with the
embellishments supplied by Gossett, an expert in this style. That
isn't to say that everyone was of equal power and artistry. Indeed,
whatever the qualities of the company's new electronic enhancement
system _ and to these ears the house sounded much as it always has
_ it is by no means an equalizer of talents.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most outstanding singer in the production is Camilla
Tilling, a Swedish soprano who was making her company debut as
Corinna, a poet who sings two exquisite arias (one of them
offstage) with harp accompaniment, and represents Italy in the
multinational assembly of travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tilling's voice has a graceful, limpid quality that floated
nicely through the house. She also has the dramatic instincts to
create a character that reflects the qualities Rossini wrote into
her arias, serenity and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Notable as well were Mary Dunleavy, who gave a powerful,
clear-toned performance as the coltish French Countess of
Folleville, and Sally Wolf, who sang with both energy and subtlety
as Madame Cortese, the owner of the Hotel of the Golden Lily. Paula
Rasmussen's dark-hued mezzo-soprano suited the role of Marquise
Melibea, who, representing Poland, has an opportunity for both
reflection and, in her duet with the Russian Count Libenskof (sung
ably and sometimes colorfully by Jeffrey Francis), temperamental
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   The men in the cast had a hard time measuring up to the women.
Monte Jaffe sang Don Profondo's patter song with the requisite
drive, but his timbre was dry and colorless. Kevin Glavin was also
a bit woolly sounding as the German Baron Trombonok, but he acted
and sang the role with considerable comic verve. Roberto Scaltriti
portrayed the English Lord Sidney amusingly, but with muffled
diction. Barry Banks gave a nicely agile performance as the failed
French lothario, and Dean Ely's account of Don Alvaro's final aria
had exactly the right Iberian flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Moyer's sets _ a tiled hallway and a swimming pool room,
both in mint green _ were simple and uncluttered, and effectively
lighted by Mark McCullough. Anna Oliver's costumes reflected the
ornateness of the period. James Robinson directed the large cast
deftly. Doug Varone choreographed the dance in the finale. And the
orchestra, conducted by George Manahan, sounded splendid.

   HURRICANE-RDP (Charleston, S.C.) _ Ledeall: Having already
produced the greatest evacuation in U.S. history, Hurricane Floyd
skirted past Florida and Georgia Wednesday and aimed itself
directly at the low-lying coasts of the Carolinas, where its eye
was expected to come ashore early Thursday. Although no
hurricane-force winds or ruinous waves were yet reported on the
East Coast, gusts exceeding 50 mph began knocking down power lines
and blowing debris across roadways Wednesday evening in coastal
South Carolina. By David Firestone.

 &HT;    WHAT GUIDES A HURRICANE?
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Several days before Hurricane Floyd began turning
northward, forecasters with the National Weather Service were
predicting with some confidence that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Some even felt confident the storm's right-hand turn, or
``recurve'' in the language of meteorologists, would happen just as
it neared the east coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday afternoon, as Floyd headed toward its expected
South Carolina landfall, forecasters were saying - again with
confidence - that Hurricane Gert would turn northward and miss the
United States altogether.
</P>
<P>
   As computing power and a variety of weather monitoring
techniques have rapidly improved in the past few decades, the
ability to ``model'' the conditions surrounding a hurricane and
predict where it will go have improved rapidly, said Herb White, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have better input data and vastly improved computing
power,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Computer ``models'' -- which combined readings from thousands of
weather balloons with hurricane-hunter aircraft information
gathered in the eye of Floyd and data from satellites, ships at
sea, even commercial aircraft -- would easily predict that a low
pressure ``trough'' moving eastward across the United States would
deflect Floyd northward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricanes move westward from an area just off the coast of
Africa primarily because the prevailing winds in the tropics are
east-to-west,'' explained Peter Ray, chairman of the meteorology
department at Florida State University in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   The storms are like corks spinning in a stream of water, he
said. And for all their power, the stream of water is more
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The winds that circulated practically unnoticed around the
continental-scale low pressure zone contained enough energy to
carry the spinning cork northward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front was much bigger than the hurricane,'' he noted,
``and the winds that surrounded it extended over the whole
north-south extent of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened with Floyd was a question of timing, Ray added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the front was moving across the United States and that
the winds around that front would tend to deflect the hurricane to
the north.''
</P>
<P>
   The only question was how fast Floyd moved toward the Florida
coast and how fast the low pressure front moved to meet it. A
difference of a day would have determined whether Floyd recurved
northward before it reached the coast or made landfall in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Less clearly understood are how the circumstances immediately
surrounding a hurricane and swirling above it converge to define
its intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic example in recent years was Hurricane Andrew,
which on Aug. 19, 1992 was a tropical storm that was so weak
hurricane-hunter aircraft had trouble finding its eye.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, it crashed into the southern tip of Florida, a
Category 4 hurricane, the second most powerful kind of storm known.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last few years have meteorologists begun to explore
the mysterious reaches of the upper atmosphere, where gigantic
cyclones can destroy a hurricane or convert a lazy tropical storm
into a killer.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, when the government put a $43 million Gulfstream jet
equipped with weather monitoring gear into service, hurricane
hunter planes had a ceiling of about 25,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   They flew into hurricanes and released ``dropsondes,''
instruments that measured such weather forecasting staples as
humidity, temperature and pressure as they fell through the storm.
</P>
<P>
   When the radioed results were analyzed, meteorologists could
piece together a fairly accurate picture of what was happening in
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Above 25,000 feet, however, was a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping its ``dropsondes'' from altitudes as high as 40,000
feet, the Gulfstream is rapidly filling in this data and and
meteorologists are learning much about conditions at the top of a
hurricane, where the rising winds that swirl around its eye spread
out and move away.
</P>
<P>
   Huge cyclones that swirl just beneath the stratosphere may have
a lot to do with whether a hurricane remains upright and grows in
strength and intensity or starts to tilt and sag, researchers
think.
</P>
<P>
   A better understanding of the interplay between the surface
level storm and the cyclones above it could greatly improve the
forecasting not only of its path but also its intensity, they say.

AD CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED TO INCREASE HISPANIC PARTICIPATION IN 2000
CENSUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A congressional board and a Houston councilman
launched an advertising campaign Wednesday to increase Hispanic
participation in the 2000 Census, saying the video blitz would
prevent a repeat of the 1990 U.S. population count that missed many
Latinos and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, assailed the U.S. Census
Monitoring Board's effort as a disingenuous attempt by the
Republican-led Congress to appear sympathetic to minorities
uncounted in the 1990 Census. If Republicans and the board were
sincere, Green said, they would support President Clinton's
proposal to use statistical data to help account for minorities
that Census Bureau personnel will inevitably miss next year.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Councilman John Castillo joined the monitoring board in
releasing the video at a Capitol Hill news conference. The tape,
recorded last month in Houston, features city and community leaders
as well as residents encouraging Hispanics to return their census
questionnaires next year in order to prevent a repeat of the 1990
count.
</P>
<P>
   That count of the U.S. population, the most recent, missed 8
million people, according to the Census Bureau. The 1990 census in
Texas undercounted Hispanics by 5.4 percent, compared with 3.9
percent for blacks and 2.6 percent for non-Hispanic whites and
Asians, the bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's total estimated undercount of 3.9 percent, or 875,333
Hispanic residents, that year was the highest of any major city,
while Texas' 2.8 percent was second to New Mexico. The Texas
undercount cost the state about $1 billion in federal assistance,
Green has said.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutionally mandated census is conducted every 10 years
to determine how the 435 seats in the House of Representatives will
be apportioned among the 50 states. The federal government also
surveys the population at other times to determine how federal
money should be allocated.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent an undercount next year, Clinton had proposed using a
statistical formula to complement the traditional head count of the
U.S. population. But the Supreme Court struck down the president's
proposal in January as a violation of the federal Census Act's
mandate that the decennial census be a head count, a decision
endorsed by the monitoring board, a congressional agency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high court's ruling and over Republican objections,
Clinton has vowed to go forward with plans to conduct a second
census that would include statistical data. That second count would
be used to determine the social-welfare needs of each state but
would not go toward the calculation of House seats.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo said the video, to be sent to nearly 1,000 Hispanic
leaders and communities nationwide, will encourage Latinos to
participate in the 2000 Census by alleviating many of their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the tape debunks rumors that information disclosed
on the census questionnaire will be shared with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the councilman added.
</P>
<P>
   The video is a montage of interviews the board produced when its
representatives visited the Houston area with Castillo last month,
seeking ways to increase Hispanic participation in the census.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, in announcing the release of the video, said Green's
concerns about partisanship are unfounded. The board is trying to
mount a ``grass-roots'' effort to ensure that the traditionally
missed Hispanics are counted, the councilman said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Kenneth Blackwell, co-chairman of the monitoring board,
joined Castillo by telephone from Ohio and echoed the councilman on
the importance of Hispanics responding to the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Latinos and Hispanics represent one of the fastest
growing communities in our society and have much to gain in being
fully counted in the 2000 Census,'' Blackwell said. ``This is about
counting people. It's not about Republican or Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Green was not convinced, citing the monitoring board's
outspoken opposition to Clinton's effort to use statistics to
complement the traditional head count of the U.S. population. Green
said the board's vocal denunciation of the president's proposal
undermines minorities' faith in the census and discourages their
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who represents a largely Hispanic district, has denounced
the Supreme Court's decision and said another miscount of Houston's
population would cost the city much-needed federal assistance for
social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in defending the statistical sampling proposal, has
said he expects only 67 percent of the U.S. population to return
completed census questionnaires that will be mailed nationwide next
year. Under Clinton's plan, the population would be divided into
census tracts of about 4,000 people that have ``homogenous
population characteristics, economic status and living
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau agents then would visit a randomly selected sample
of the housing units that did not submit census forms. The sample's
population numbers and characteristics would be added based on the
statistical results.

REVIEWS OF NEW DREAMCAST GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, Sega launched its new,
gonna-take-ya-to-the-next-level home video-game system, Dreamcast
($199). Here's a quick look at four of the key titles:
</P>
<P>
   Sonic Adventure: Well, as Sega promised, Sonic's latest
run-and-pick-up-the-gold-coins journey is fast. And colorful. And
fun. But does Sonic Adventure ($49, all ages) break vid-game ground
like Nintendo's Mario 64? Not really.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic Adventure is more of an evolution than a revolution, a
spiffed-up, souped-up upgrade that features remarkable speed and
blinding colors _ but little else.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you'd want much else. Sonic games have always been more
about fast-paced action than Mario-type adventure. And on that
level, Sonic Adventure is a major success: Sonic races through a
whole new world, a brightly colored Oz-land filled with double-loop
tracks, underwater worlds and mountainous regions. You've never
played a Sonic game like this before.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Stinger: This game, however, has been around a long time
and was more fun when it was called Resident Evil. Blue Stinger
($49, age 17 and up) is the Dreamcast's version of RE, a horror
movie come to life in which the player must shoot to kill or run
like ... well, really fast.
</P>
<P>
   Story line: Guy hero gets stuck on an island that's infested
with mutants. Your goal: Like Metallica says, kill 'em all. One
interesting thing: You can use limbs from dead monsters to battle
live ones.
</P>
<P>
   The coolness stops there. The rest of the game is brainless,
grisly gore and nonstop bad language _ definitely not a kid game,
or a good one, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   NFL 2K: Here is a great game. NFL 2K ($49, all ages) has got to
be the best football game out there _ for any system. Period.
Frighteningly realistic graphics, all the teams and stadiums,
custom plays, precise, uncomplicated control _ forget Sonic. Buy
this instead.
</P>
<P>
   Soul Calibur: From Street Fighter to Virtua Fighter, Sega has
always had major luck with transforming arcade fighting games into
killer home video games _ and Soul Calibur ($49, age 13 and up)
carries on that tradition.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the medieval-themed SC so impressive _ besides the
superb graphics _ is the little bits of realism; for instance, the
game takes weapon weight into account. If this is the kind of stuff
Dreamcast is gonna be doing, its future definitely looks promising.

REPUBLICANS LAUNCH PUSH FOR SCHOOL PRAYER AMENDMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declaring that the time has come to ``kneel down
for America,'' House Republicans launched their latest effort to
pass a constitutional amendment for school prayer Wednesday with a
foot-stomping, hand-waving revival meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, GOP conservatives
gathered at a church near the Capitol to celebrate the
reintroduction of a school prayer amendment that the last Congress
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would expressly permit, but not require, school
prayer. It would also permit posting the Ten Commandments and other
religious teachings in government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a nation must take a stand for authority and against
disorder. And, as we all know, the highest authority is God,''
House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas said from the pulpit of
Bible Way Temple. ``In the battle for our culture, we all need to
understand that you cannot just stand up for America, you need to
kneel down for America.''
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay and other top Republicans conceded that the
constitutional amendment is doomed to defeat. Although the House
supported the proposal in a 224-203 vote last year, the outcome was
56 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for a
constitutional change. It never came to a vote in the Senate, where
support is even weaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is to vote, have a national debate, so the
American people can see who's with `em and who's agin `em,'' DeLay
said. ``If you give up just because it won't pass, nothing will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics accused Republican leaders of pandering to Christian
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Existing law protects a student's right to pray, say grace
before meals, read religious literature during free time and even
form after-school Bible clubs. Not only is this proposal dangerous,
it's unnecessary,'' said Barry Lynn, executive director of Citizens
United for Separation of Church and State.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative outlook did not dampen the enthusiasm of the
amendment's backers, who rallied behind the slogan ``America Come
Back To God.'' About 300 amendment supporters gathered at the
church after rains from Hurricane Floyd canceled plans for a show
of support on the Capitol steps.
</P>
<P>
   Church groups delivered petitions with more than 1 million
signatures endorsing school prayer. The event's organizers included
William J. Murray, the evangelist son of famed atheist Madalyn
Murray O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Christians, and we just really want the Bible and
prayer back in schools,'' said Epifanio Rebollo, part of a
delegation of supporters who traveled to Washington from New York
for the rally. ``The founders of this government were Christians.
They strongly believed in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the church, supporters jumped from their seats, waved their
hands and shouted ``Hallelujah'' in response to lawmakers'
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our laws should at every turn be a complement to, and
encouragement for, those laws of the Lord God Almighty,'' Armey
told his audience.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay drew the strongest response by outlining his vision of a
culture war in U.S. schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now only tolerance is taught, especially tolerance for what is
dangerous and immoral,'' DeLay said. ``God is not allowed in our
schools, but everything opposed to God is.'' Ron Hutcheson, (202)

LINDA JONES, KEY WITNESS IN CISNEROS CASE, MAY BE FREED SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ~WASHINGTON _ Linda Jones, the government's chief witness in the
conspiracy case against former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros,
could be released from federal custody as early as this week, a
prosecutor for Independent Counsel David Barrett told a federal
judge Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get this over with as quickly as possible,''
prosecutor Lawrence Scalise told U.S. District Judge Stanley
Sporkin.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, 52, pleaded guilty last week to a single misdemeanor
of lying to the FBI about $250,000 he paid Jones following their
extramarital affair. Cisneros agreed to a $10,000 fine but received
no jail time or probation.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Barrett, who spent more than $9 million on the
investigation, dropped 18 felony counts against Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who became caught up in a separate federal investigation,
pleaded guilty to 28 felony counts that included bank fraud. She
received a 42-month prison sentence from U.S. District Judge Sam
Cummins in Lubbock, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed to testify against Cisneros in exchange for a
reduction in her sentence. Her attorney, Sam Ogan, a public
defender in Dallas, said Barrett has proposed that Jones, who has
been in custody for 18 months, now be released with ``time
served.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister and brother-in-law, Patsy and Allen Wooten, also have
pleaded guilty to charges brought by Barrett. Scalise said Barrett
has recommended a $2,500 fine for the Wootens.
</P>
<P>
   Ogan said the reduction recommendation for Jones is before
Cummins.
</P>
<P>
   An extramarital affair between Cisneros and Jones, also known as
Linda Medlar, became public in 1988 when he was mayor of San
Antonio. Years later, when he was nominated to head the Department
of Housing and Urban Development, Jones feared she would lose a
secret financial arrangement with Cisneros, who had reconciled with
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   To protect that arrangement, Jones began secretly recording
Cisneros's telephone calls to her.
</P>
<P>
   She later made the tapes public and claimed Cisneros lied to FBI
agents about the amount he paid her. The FBI was conducting a
background investigation into his HUD nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sporkin signaled Wednesday that he would reject a
motion filed by the A.H. Belo Corp. seeking access to 26 of the
tapes of Cisneros and Jones that the prosecution was ready to use
as evidence in his trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the horse dies, you're supposed to get off of it,''
Sporkin told attorneys for Belo, the parent corporation of KENS-TV
in San Antonio and the Dallas Morning News.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lynch, a Belo lawyer, argued that tapes and their
transcripts became judicial record and pivotal to Sporkin's
pre-trial rulings on admissibility. Those rulings led to the plea
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros' lawyers strongly opposed their release, and Barrett's
prosecutors said the evidence should be kept from public
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes contain intimate conversations between Jones and
Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin said part of the plea agreement includes the protection
of Cisneros' private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over with,'' Sporkin told the Belo attorneys. ``Let Mr.
Cisneros live his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is currently the president of the Spanish-language
television network Univision in Los Angeles. He continues to own a
home in San Antonio with his wife, Mary Alice.

SENATE PANEL APPROVES $13.6 BILLION NASA BUDGET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Senate appropriations subcommittee approved a
$13.6 billion budget for NASA next year, virtually restoring nearly
$1 billion in cuts that were made by the House in the agency's 2000
spending request.
</P>
<P>
   Although some NASA funding still is in danger, the agency's
budget is expected to survive intact once House and Senate members
complete negotiations on year 2000 spending issues.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of funding followed an intense lobbying effort
by Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. She won assurances from Sen.
Kit Bond, R-Mo., who chairs the appropriations subcommittee on
independent agencies, that NASA would be funded in line with
President Clinton's request for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said Bond agreed that cutting $1 billion from the
NASA's budget next year would jeopardize not only the international
space station project, but a number of other science missions now
under way at the agency, including a study on human survivability
during long-term space travel, and development and production of
drugs and other materials in zero gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't cut $1 billion without warning from a highly
technical program and still meet the space program's important
goals,'' Hutchison said. ``A strong space program furthers the
national interest by advancing the frontiers of science in such
disciplines as physics, electronics and health care.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASA funding is part of a larger spending measure covering
the departments of veterans affairs, housing and urban development,
and independent federal agencies. When the House passed its version
of the VA-HUD measure last week, it eliminated more than $925
million in NASA funding. The reduction drew complaints from a
number of House members, especially those representing Texas and
Maryland, where NASA centers employ thousands.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, called restoration of
the NASA funding in the Senate bill ``good news'' and vowed to use
his leadership influence to keep the agency's budget intact during
House-Senate negotiations over the final VA-HUD measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the House and Senate come together to negotiate, NASA
will be restored to full funding,'' he said.

<P>
   Jeff Hawkins, the engineer who brought the Palm Pilot to the
world in 1996, is seated in his Spartan new office, pondering the
question of how he came upon the idea of putting a Game Boy-like
slot in the back of the Visor, the new palm-size omni-gadget from
Hawkins' new company, Handspring.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said that for a short time after he and his partner,
Donna Dubinsky, left their jobs at the Palm Computing division of
3Com Corp. to strike out on their own, they had not been sure about
just what they were doing. ``We weren't building anything,'' he
recalled. ``We had two desks and a houseplant.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, Hawkins had what he describes as ``a high moment,
when I said, `That's it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote all this down in my notebook,'' he said, ``and once I
got going, it all flowed right out, and I made a model. The whole
thing was done in a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, 14 months after inspiration struck Hawkins,
Handspring introduced the $179 Visor, a Palm look-alike whose
add-on cartridges, or modules, will eventually turn it into, among
other things, a wireless modem, a cell phone, an MP3 player, a
two-way pager or a game machine.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, a new palm-size computer might receive passing
attention in the consumer marketplace, which is already bursting
with personal digital assistants, or PDAs, and with cell phones
with built-in address books and calendars.
</P>
<P>
   But the Visor is the creation of Hawkins, Ms. Dubinsky and Ed
Colligan, the same trio who created the Palm Pilot, the first such
device to succeed where others had fallen flat. For that reason,
their new company has attracted an unusually high level of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins had not planned to do this. Before starting Handspring
with Ms. Dubinsky in the summer of 1998, he had scaled back to
working part-time at Palm Computing. In fact, Hawkins, an energetic
42-year-old engineer, had diverted his attention almost entirely to
another longtime interest: neurobiology. He was working on a book
about how the brain works.
</P>
<P>
   After what Ms. Dubinsky, 44, describes as ``many, many, many,
many months of conversation,'' Hawkins grew increasingly interested
in what kind of palm-size device he would be able to design if
given complete autonomy. In July 1998, both he and Ms. Dubinsky
resigned from 3Com and set up shop in Palo Alto, Calif., as J.D.
Technology. Within a month, they were joined by Colligan, who had
been Palm Computing's vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Handspring seemed blessed. Just a few weeks
after leaving Palm, Ms. Dubinsky and Hawkins signed a licensing
agreement with the company, which gave them the right to use the
Palm operating system in their own product. This meant that
whatever they built would work with the thousands of applications
already available for the Palm device. And while they had found it
hard to raise money for their original company, they were now flush
with offers from venture capitalists eager to see them duplicate
Palm's success.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said that the Palm's major drawback had always been the
device's inability to accommodate added hardware with ease.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he sketched out the Visor, Hawkins, who keeps
meticulous notes in a slim hardbound journal, sat down and listed
the kinds of devices people might want to add to a handheld device:
ROM cards for games and content, a memory expansion card, one- and
two-way pagers, a cell phone, a Global Positioning System receiver,
a wireless modem, an MP3 music player, a digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said he constantly bought electronic gadgets and took
them apart. One that he had dissected was the Nintendo Game Boy,
which has a slot in back for slipping game cartridges in and out. A
slot on his own product seemed an obvious solution.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner one night, Hawkins' 10-year-old daughter, Kate, came
up with the name for the main device: Visor, which is shortened
from ``advisor.'' The idea to call the expansion slot Springboard
was Colligan's.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurial team knew that the modules must be extremely
easy to use to be appealing. Indeed, when a Springboard module is
snapped in, it shows instantly on the screen. ``Users don't even
know what's going on,'' Hawkins said. ``They don't even know
they're installing anything.'' And when a module is taken out, it
leaves no trace of its presence.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said that both the Game Boy and the Visor emphasized
simplicity and longevity. ``I have held up the Game Boy at meetings
here as an example,'' he said. ``I remind people that we're
designing something that will be used for 10 years and more. A game
you bought eight years ago will play in a modern Game Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that, Hawkins said, is where the similarities end. He sees
the Visor as far more versatile than the Game Boy. ``The Game Boy
is a very limited user experience,'' he said. ``It doesn't do
anything unless you put a cartridge in, and if you take it out in
the middle of a game, it crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubinsky said she and her partners had seen little need for
market research. ``We felt we understood the marketplace pretty
well,'' she said. ``After all, we invented the product and the
category.''
</P>
<P>
   The company did conduct a few focus groups on ``some of the easy
things,'' Ms. Dubinsky said, like prices, memory and colors. (The
$249 Deluxe Visor has eight megabytes of memory, compared with the
two megabytes in the $179 Visor basic model. While the standard
color is black, the deluxe model also comes in a clear case or in
transparent blue, green or yellow.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Handspring got in touch with 20 or so
third-party developers to see if they would be interested in
creating some of the add-on devices on Hawkins' list. The response,
Hawkins said, was even more enthusiastic than he had hoped. Two MP3
modules are coming out soon, and Handspring is working with several
manufacturers on a cell phone module. Prices for the modules will
range from about $20 for a game to $250 for a cell phone or MP3
player.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Springboard slot in the back of the Visor is one feature
that had no market testing. ``You can't test the concept of a
slot,'' Ms. Dubinsky said. ``It's too major.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ms. Dubinsky said, she and her colleagues relied on ``a
general sense out there from people that they wanted to combine
devices, but no one had yet come up with a good way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue for Hawkins was price. Just as he had worked
hard to build the original Palm Pilot for $300 in 1996, he was
determined to keep the Visor's cost to $150. Such a price, he and
Ms. Dubinsky argued, would attract a younger and less affluent
crowd than today's Palm customers. Palm's most popular product is
the $449 Palm V, whose sleek anodized aluminum housing has made it
a de rigueur accessory for the professional set.
</P>
<P>
   But if he was to keep the price low, Hawkins knew that he would
have to sacrifice stylishness and settle on inexpensive plastic
housing for the Visor, and on triple-A batteries instead of the
rechargeable lithium-ion battery found in the Palm V.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as three weeks ago, the company was still trying to
figure out ways to keep the price at $150. At the last minute, it
decided to set that as the price for the no-frills Visor Solo unit,
a basic Visor without a cradle or software for synchronizing data
with a desktop computer. To cut distribution costs, it decided to
sell the Solo only on the Web (www.handspring.com), at least at
first. The basic Visor and the deluxe model will start being
shipped in October, while the Solo will start going out in
November.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The last word on design details was given to Hawkins, who holds
the unambiguous title of chief product officer. And details
mattered greatly to Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   One detail was the stylus, which is stored in a sleeve on the
side of the device. ``Every time I do a new product, I dread the
stylus,'' he said. ``I've never been able to get it right. On the
original Palm Pilot, it was a nightmare. They either got too loose
and fell out or were too tight and wouldn't come out.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Visor, Hawkins decided to put a tiny piece of foam
inside the sleeve so the stylus would slide in and out smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Is he happy with this solution? ``I won't know until I have
100,000 units in the field for a year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The display was easier. Technical advances have improved
displays in general, Hawkins said. The quality of the Visor's
display is somewhere between that of the original, rather fuzzy
Palm Pilot and the display of the crystal-clear Palm V. When a
visitor set her three-year-old Palm Pilot on Hawkins' desk to
remind him of the original display, he seemed appalled, as if he
had just been shown a picture of himself as a teen-ager in a Nehru
jacket. ``This looks like a joke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' he said, looking genuinely embarrassed.
``Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   In designing the Visor, Hawkins decided early on to put a small
microphone in each unit, which added a dollar to the cost but
opened the door for add-on devices like cell phones and voice
recorders.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins immodestly predicts a huge market for Visor modules. ``I
believe there will be hundreds and eventually thousands of things
that plug into the Springboard slot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shares his optimism. In creating such a product,
Handspring's founders are betting that consumers will want one
device with multiple functions rather than owning one for each
purpose _ having a cell phone, pager, organizer and MP3 player, for
example. History suggests that they are mistaken. Exhibit A: the
Sony Walkman. Exhibit B: the Palm organizer itself. Both products
are beloved because they perform one function extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by a market research firm, Forrester Research,
found that although PDAs are in 3.6 million households in the
United States, people use them primarily for managing calendars and
to-do lists and not for more complex tasks like e-mail retrieval.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want a combination device,'' said Ken Dulaney,
vice president of mobile computing at the Gartner Group, another
market research firm. ``Every time you try to get a computer to do
many things, it ends up doing none of them well. Combination
PDA-cell phones are going to fail miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The PDQ phone is the ugliest thing I've ever seen,'' Dulaney
said, referring to Qualcomm's 10-ounce, cell phone-cum-Palm
organizer, which will sell for $500 to $800, depending on subsidies
from carriers. ``Nobody wants that thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to such criticism, Ms. Dubinsky said she believed
that many people would buy the Visor simply as an organizer and
nothing else. Others, she said, may buy it to run a specific
module. One goal, she said, is to have Visors in widespread use in
high schools and colleges. ``Why shouldn't students all have a
little handheld computer that they can learn languages on, do math,
science, programming and all kinds of other stuff?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, executives at Palm have nothing but kudos for their
new competitor. Mark Bercow, a vice president at Palm, called the
Visor ``cool.'' But privately, Palm executives have done some
hand-wringing over the Visor's low price. Palm is likely to lower
the list price of its Palm IIIe before the end of the year, to
around $199 from $229.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins still plans to finish his book on neuroscience, but he
said the temptation to interrupt the project to take another pass
at building the perfect palm-size device was irresistible. ``Every
time I do one,'' he said, ``I think, `OK, it's a little closer.'''

BIRD `DEFINITELY' DONE AS COACH AFTER THIS SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Indiana Pacers president Donnie Walsh brushed
aside speculation about the status of his head coach by saying
Larry Bird had never said, ``flat out,'' this would be his final
season.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Bird said it Wednesday, more than once, and without
equivocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely is,'' Bird said, responding to one of many
questions about his plans during a two-hour-plus interview session
with television and radio reporters to hype his new book, ``Bird
Watching: On Playing and Coaching The Game I Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be my last year,'' he said. ``I signed a three-year
deal. I've always thought three years for a coach was long
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are hoping Bird remains with the franchise in a
front-office capacity, perhaps succeeding Walsh as president. Bird
said he was uncertain about his future, adding, ``I'll wait until
next summer. Yes, I'll be bored again. But I signed a three-year
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to drive home the point, Bird said he could not even get
excited about the potential of Al Harrington or Jonathan Bender,
high schoolers drafted by the Pacers in the first round of the last
two drafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't draft two high school kids,'' he said. ``If you're
coaching for three years, you don't want too many high school
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird's publicity people picked an unusual method to hype the
book. Bird, making his only promotional appearance, sat in a studio
in Fort Myers, Fla., and was interviewed in 10-minute-or-less
sessions solely by members of the electronic media. He looked like
he was in a dentist's chair awaiting a root canal. ``You gotta do
some of it,'' he said by way of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were print reporters not ``invited'' to participate,
Bird's people also did not make transcripts available.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the questions dealt with Bird's revelation in the book
that he has a heart condition, atrial fibrillation, which was
diagnosed only after he sought medical help after he retired from
playing. He did say, however, that he experienced the symptoms
while working out during the summer, while still with the Celtics,
but was unaware of what condition he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought it was fatigue, or working out too hard, or
overdoing it,'' he said. ``It didn't last long and it was always
gone when I woke up the next morning. I never had it while I was
playing (during the season).''
</P>
<P>
   Bird also was asked about his claim that Rick Pitino offered him
a job as an assistant coach prior to Bird's departure to Indiana.
Pitino has emphatically said no such offer ever was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I seen it,'' Bird said. ``I hear he doesn't see
it that way. Whatever. That's fine.''

CHARLES MRAZ, RENOWNED BEEKEEPER, LED VENOM THEORY; 94 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A funeral will be held Thursday for Charles Mraz, a nationally
known beekeeper and owner of New England's largest apiary who died
Monday at his home in Middlebury, Vt. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mraz was born in New York City. He moved to Middlebury, Vt.,
in 1928 and established Champlain Valley Apiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 70 years, Mr. Mraz became world-renowned for his
work as a beekeeper. He traveled to South and Central America,
Europe, Asia, and the Middle East as a consultant on beekeeping
methods and technology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the American Beekeeping Federation recognized Mr. Mraz
among the five most distinguished beekeepers in the country for
advances in commercial beekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer of the bee venom theory, the use of bee stings to
treat auto-immune diseases, Mr. Mraz established the standard of
purity for dried whole venom for the Food and Drug Administration
and was a supplier of venom to pharmaceutical companies and
independent researchers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he recounted his experiences with the bee venom theory
in his book ``Health and The Honey Bee.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mraz was a founding member and executive director of the
American Apitherapy Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to
the medical use of bee products.
</P>
<P>
   An avid gardener and organic farmer, he was also president and
board member of the National Food and Farming Association, the
precursor of the Northern Organic Farming Association.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mraz also served as Middlebury water commissioner and on the
Cemetery Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He was a longtime contributor to the Rotary, Masons, and
Shriners in Middlebury.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mraz leaves his wife, Pamela; two sons, Charles of Destin,
Fla., and William of Middlebury; three daughters, Marna Ehrech of
Shelburne, Vt., Laurie Zwaan of Exeter, N.H., and Michelle of
Burlington, Vt.; several stepchildren; 13 grandchildren, and 7
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral will be held at 10 a.m. at St. Stephen's Episcopal
Church on the Middlebury Green. Burial will be in Middlebury
Cemetery.

ARTS ABROAD: EX-COURT MUSICIAN NOW COURTS THE JAPANESE PUBLIC
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ At first glance, it is hard to imagine that Hideki Togi
was once a court musician in the Japanese Imperial Palace,
elaborately costumed and performing gagaku, a genre of ceremonial
music that has a thousand-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is his youth, long black hair, cowboy boots, or the
soothing, hip rhythms from his latest album that mask Togi's
legacy: His family has performed gagaku before a continuous
succession of Japanese emperors and aristocrats dating back to the
Nara period (710-794).
</P>
<P>
   But listen carefully to his music or attend one of his concerts,
and it becomes quite evident that although Togi resigned from the
Imperial Ensemble three years ago, he is keeping the gagaku
tradition alive and making it more accessible to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   In his Western-style compositions, Togi blends the haunting,
mystical tones of gagaku with the latest contemporary sounds and
beats, all played on a mix of ancient instruments, synthesizers,
cellos, electric guitars and bass.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a subtle fusion of New Age music that is both
yearning and uplifting, searching and defined, foreign yet
familiar, but immensely popular in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Togi knows various types of music, including pop, he
must be capturing many fans,'' said Motoko Sekiya, a music critic.
``Healing music is quite popular today, and Mr. Togi's music has
that kind of feeling. These must be factors that make his music
accessible. And it doesn't hurt that he's handsome, too.''
</P>
<P>
   While other contemporary Japanese composers like Maki Ishii and
Toru Takemitsu have incorporated gagaku into their music in the
past, Togi has taken the music in a new direction, to much critical
and popular acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old musician has been widely praised in Japan for
expanding the appeal of gagaku, which is one of the world's oldest
systematic forms of music with definite orchestration.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, Togi has released five albums that have
sold hundreds of thousands of copies. His latest compact disk,
``From Asia,'' appeared in March on Toshiba-EMI, which says it is
selling well.
</P>
<P>
   His music has become so popular that he has appeared on
television programs and in commercials and done a stint as a
celebrity panelist on a game show. Togi composed an easy-listening
tune for a Suntory pekoe tea commercial, in which he appears
dressed in kimono and holding canned tea with his gagaku music
playing in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started writing my own compositions, it was not my
intention to combine modern music with the ancient tradition as
means of popularizing gagaku,'' Togi said in a recent interview in
his home studio in Tokyo. ``I was just expressing what's inside me
musically. But if the result promotes gagaku, then I am happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Togi said his music was greatly influenced by his childhood,
which he spent living abroad, in Thailand and Mexico, where his
father worked for a trading company.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home my father listened to classical music and my mother
liked film music and operas,'' Togi said. ``But at the
international schools I attended I was exposed to jazz, pop and
rock. I really liked the Beatles.''
</P>
<P>
   Togi returned to Japan for high school and, upon graduation,
with some encouragement from his maternal grandfather, whose family
lineage consisted of court musicians, he entered the music division
of the Imperial Household. After seven years of intense study, in
which he learned to play several ancient instruments and to sing
and dance traditional music, he became a member of the Imperial
Ensemble, which is still restricted to men who are descendants of
court musicians. His instrument of choice is the hichiriki, a
double-reed pipe with nine finger holes that resembles an oboe.
</P>
<P>
   Togi also learned to play the cello because modern-day gagaku
musicians are required to play Western music to entertain visitors
of state from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Togi says that while most Japanese have heard the word gagaku,
which literally means ``elegant music,'' few really understand what
the music is about, and many consider it too stiff and formal.
</P>
<P>
   There are three basic wind instruments in gagaku: the hichiriki,
the sho (a mouth organ made of 17 bamboo pipes) and the ryuteki (a
bamboo traverse flute with seven finger holes). These three wind
instruments play the main melody in gagaku, and they symbolize
heaven, sky and earth.
</P>
<P>
   Togi said that every note in gagaku contained significance. For
example, a single tone can represent a color, a season or even
something as unusual as a human internal organ. A spring note is
cheerful and warm while an autumn sound is more sorrowful.
</P>
<P>
   Togi said he resigned from the Imperial Ensemble to have greater
freedom to explore his own music at his own pace. ``As a member of
the Imperial Ensemble,'' he said, ``I was a civil servant, and my
hours were set from 9 to 5, and there were a lot of ceremonial
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a composer, there are days when the music comes very well
and days when it doesn't,'' he said. ``I wanted to have my own pace
of practicing, training and research that would allow the music to
flow more naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Togi said that his decision to leave the ensemble was not easy
and that it was very rare for court musicians to step down. He
noted that about one person in 100 years does so, mainly because
becoming a member is so arduous.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Togi's former colleagues at the Imperial Household have
publicly criticized his work, calling it laughable. Some gagaku
masters dismiss as invalid any efforts to write new gagaku
compositions or to combine the genre with Western instruments or
even to perform it outside the Imperial Household.
</P>
<P>
   ``The masters at the Imperial Household and my former colleagues
see me as an opponent, and they are very critical of what I'm
doing,'' Togi said. ``But my music has provided many people with
the opportunity to know Japanese gagaku. If the Imperial Household
sees this as problematic, then it's a small thing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Togi's prominence in Japan's music world was underscored
recently at a gala concert in Tokyo featuring some the country's
most noted opera, classical and jazz musicians. After performing a
medley of gagaku, Japanese and classical music on the hichiriki
accompanied by the Tokyo Philharmonic, Togi, who was clad in a
traditional costume, received the warmest applause of any other
performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed him the best because his music spoke to my soul,''
said Noriko Oikawa, a high school teacher. ``He was the only
performer who did something authentically Japanese.''

ANALYSIS: SCHROEDER IS RESOLVED TO PUSH UNPOPULAR AUSTERITY
PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROGER COHEN   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Among recent telephone calls to Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder was one from President Clinton, who urged the German
leader to stand firm in his gathering crisis after his party was
battered in recent state elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton expressed solidarity and said that it was not unusual
for a leader to go through a trough early in his term,'' said a
senior aide to Schroeder, who spoke of the call on condition of
anonymity. ``He told the chancellor to stay the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that course looks anything but assured. Political
troughs may be common, but the place where Schroeder finds himself
looks more like a ravine.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue is straightforward enough: The German state is
running out of money. The costs of unification, of a huge state
sector, of an aging population, of high unemployment have finally
come home to roost. German debt has ballooned to about $833
billion, 50 percent more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our national finances are in a ruinous state,'' Finance
Minister Hans Eichel said Wednesday, adding that Germany's postwar
economic status as a ``model'' was ``finished.'' He noted that one
in every four marks of taxpayers' money now goes simply to pay
interest on the debt.
</P>
<P>
   The minister was speaking in the Reichstag, which Schroeder is
to address Thursday, trying to justify a bold plan of spending cuts
that spares few government departments, clamps down on pensions and
holds down welfare payments.
</P>
<P>
   Those proposed measures have proved deeply unpopular. Disavowed
by many members of his own Social Democratic Party, abandoned at
the polls, Schroeder has seen his approval rating plunge to under
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are problems of substance, and there are problems of
style. The latter are largely of Schroeder's making. But the
chancellor is also trying to do something desperately difficult:
change a conservative country deeply attached to its habits.
</P>
<P>
   That country happens to be Europe's most powerful, its economy
one-third larger than the next biggest in France, and on the
success of Schroeder's bold plan hinge the stability of the euro
and, in the end, the mood of the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, designed to open the way for sharp cuts in corporate
and personal tax rates in coming years, is intended to do nothing
less than jolt Germans into rethinking their lives. Less state,
more personal responsibility; less enveloping social protection,
more entrepreneurship _ that is the direction Schroeder has now
charted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country where people want to be protected and safe,
and now they are seeing that, my God, this man actually wants to
change us,'' said sociologist Claus Leggewie. ``Even if the case
for the changes is evident, the shock is profound.''
</P>
<P>
   And the response has been profound. The disavowal of Schroeder
in elections in the states of Brandenburg, the Saarland and
Thuringia _ and in the big, traditionally Social Democratic cities
of North Rhine-Westphalia _ has been sharper than even his most
pessimistic aides predicted, creating the possibility of an
unstoppable downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Faced by this danger, the chancellor is taking Clinton's advice.
The smile has gone. In its place a new resolve is evident. ``Mr.
Schroeder is not depressed, and he is now very, very determined to
push these cuts through,'' said a spokesman, Bela Anda.
</P>
<P>
   The gamble is clear enough. Painful as the changes will be _ and
the bottom of the ravine has surely not been reached yet _ they
should start to bring benefits and lower a 10.4 percent
unemployment rate in time for Schroeder's re-election campaign in
2002.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the dangers are also evident. Unlike British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, whose outlook he shares, and unlike his Christian
Democratic predecessor Helmut Kohl, Schroeder does not entirely
control his party.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful left wing rooted in the labor union movement remains
committed to ``social justice,'' by which it generally means the
preservation of the system the chancellor is attacking.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schroeder has tried to co-opt this faction by bringing
one its leaders, Reinhard Klimmt, into the government this month,
and although no immediate danger exists that Social Democratic
members of Parliament will vote en masse against the government,
the split weakens the chancellor. A Social Democratic Party
congress at the end of this year will be a stormy affair.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is also undermined by the fact that, up to now, he has
been unable to rise above a somewhat inhibited, wooden style.
Images of the Chancellor as fat cat _ with sharp suits and Cuban
cigars _ have far outweighed images conveying a popular touch.
</P>
<P>
   During a joint appearance with Clinton before ethnic Albanian
refugees this year, the German leader looked almost painfully at a
loss. Later, he told people close to him that did not want to be
put in such a situation again.
</P>
<P>
   If regional Social Democratic leaders in Germany's highly
decentralized system start to see the Chancellor as a political
liability _ a threat to their jobs and power _ he may be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's apparent weaknesses might not matter so much if
Germany were not at a crossroads. But for the scale of reforms that
Schroeder is proposing, a passionate sketching of a German future
and an empathy for people's feelings would certainly help. In this
regard, his speech on Thursday to the Reichstag will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   For Germany is skeptical. It engineered a postwar economic
miracle through the social-market model, through consensus, through
patient negotiation, through solidarity _ and wide swaths of the
population are not ready to acknowledge that times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Americans, when Clinton spoke of a balanced budget, the
interest of such an idea was clear enough,'' Leggewie said. ``But a
lot of Germans say: A balanced budget, what for? We've done all
right on debt and deficits, so let's go on.''
</P>
<P>
   As Eichel suggested Wednesday, just going on would appear to
lead to a not-too-distant wall. Schroeder's predicament, as an
already weakened chancellor, is that in trying to head off such a
collision, he may fall himself. After the foreign-policy crisis of
Kosovo, he now faces what looks like a much deeper domestic one.

BOMB CRACKDOWN REVEALS DARK SIDE OF MOSCOW LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``Operation Whirlwind'' descended on the Kiev Market
around lunchtime Wednesday, when several dozen burly men clad in
black leather jackets and black ski-masks and armed with truncheons
and submachineguns swarmed the grounds of one of Moscow's busiest
street bazaars.
</P>
<P>
   The men were officers in an elite Moscow police detachment, and
their sudden arrival was part of the city's response to a series of
deadly bombings that have claimed over 200 lives in Moscow, the
worst outbreak of terrorist attacks here in memory. But Wednesday's
crackdown also had the look of a big shakedown.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow authorities say that the blasts were the work of rebels
from Chechnya, so the officers quickly rounded up anyone _ vendors,
shoppers, bystanders _ who had the dark complexion someone from the
separatist Caucasus Mountains region might have. The police lined
their quarry up against a wall for a spread-eagle body search and
checked their identification documents.
</P>
<P>
   For a few lucky ones, the ordeal ended there. About 20 not-
so-lucky ones were led away to a large holding cell by the market's
entrance, joining thousands who have been detained in Moscow over
the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest, Wednesday's raid on the Kiev Market ended as they
often do in Moscow: With a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of officers took me on a little walk, they pretended
to study my documents, then they told me I had to pay them 800
rubles (about $40),'' said Galib Rozayev, a merchant who has been
working at Kiev Market for four years, describing his little
journey into the whirlwind Wednesday. ``They aren't thinking about
catching the people who planted the bomb. They've already forgotten
about the bomb. They just want money.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing wrong with Rozayev's documents, or those of 10
of his colleagues who were forced to pay up Wednesday: Citizens of
the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, they have the residency
permit required to live and work in Moscow. Their only crime was
that they look, at least in the eyes of Moscow police, like the
Chechen-backed militants who are battling Russian troops in the
Caucasus region of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this possible is something that has long attracted
the attention of human rights monitors in Moscow: the
institutionalized racism toward people who moved here for a better
life from homes in southern Russia and the former Soviet republics
of the Caucasus and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show many Muscovites believe ``blacks,'' as dark-skinned
people from these regions are called here, are the cause of their
cities' problems with crime and corruption. Politicians like Yury
Luzhkov, the popular Moscow mayor and likely presidential
candidate, encourage these attitudes. Luzhkov has publicly blamed
two Chechen rebel leaders for the explosions _ they deny it _ and
called on the Kremlin to cordon off the breakaway region, which is
nominally still a part of Russia but has stopped obeying the
federal government since the end of a brutal two-year civil war in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   As Muscovites struggle to overcome the fear caused by two blasts
in the past week that flattened two apartment buildings and killed
more than 200 people, Luzhkov and other politicians have demanded
action. The city police have responded with ``Whirlwind,'' a
massive operation of road checkpoints, random document checks,
apartment searches, and increased raids on busy public places like
the Kiev Market.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an expensive annoyance for people such as
Galib Rozayev and Nabi, whose documents are in order, and more
bureaucratic hassles may lie ahead. Luzhkov has ordered that all of
Moscow's estimated 2 million ``guests'' re-register, setting a time
limit of three days that city officials acknowledge is far too
little time for the job.
</P>
<P>
   It is even worse for people such as Sergei, a businessman who is
part Dagestani and has no valid Moscow residence permit. For him,
the increased raids have forced him to hide out in a friends'
apartment and avoid taking the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Police do not care that Sergei is a partner in a
telecommunications firm with Moscow-accented Russian and a
university education. All they see is that he is dark-skinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all based on the way you look,'' he said. ``They don't
stop criminals this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The residence document Sergei lacks is a Soviet-era document
that has been repeatedly declared illegal by Russia's Supreme Court
under the 1993 constitution that proclaims freedom of movement for
Russian citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights monitors have repeatedly criticized Moscow for
that, too. But the police have not changed their enforcement of the
residence rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it is being enforce it seems that it more a source of
additional income than to bring order,'' said Diderik Lohman of the
Moscow office of the New York-based Human Rights Watch. ``It's also
questionable how useful a way to stop terrorists it is to stop
people in the streets and check docusments.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Kiev Market was raided three times. Each time,
Nabi, a cigarette and food vendor from Azerbaijan who only gave his
first name, was hit for a small ``fine'' that was in reality
legalized extortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been living in Moscow for four years,'' Nabi said. ``Do
they think I want to blow myself up? Do they expect to find some
bomb in my sausage?''
</P>
<P>
   But the raids have the support of many Muscovites _ people such
as Alexander Abashkin, the director of the Kiev Market. He supports
Luzhkov's idea, seconded this week by Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin, of surrounding Chechnya with troops and putting a
``quarantine'' on the rebellious region.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the 100,000 Chechens who live in Moscow?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to isolate them,'' Abashkin said, recalling Josef
Stalin's mass deportation of Chechens to Siberia during World War
II. ``Stalin was able to do it in 1944 with a division of (secret
police) and a few trains.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow police say ``Whirlwind'' has been a success. Alexander
Veldyayev, Moscow's deputy police chief, said Wednesday his troops
had detained 27 people suspected of being accomplices in Monday's
blast that killed at least 118 people and flattened an apartment
building in a residential neighborhood and in another apartment
explosion that claimed 93 lives last week.
</P>
<P>
   Unsastified, Luzhkov ordered police to redouble their efforts.
Police have already searched the basements and cellars of Moscow's
30,000 apartment buildings. Wednesday Luzhkov told them to do it
again.
</P>
<P>
   Police also said authorities have found a truck that may have
been involved in bringing explosives to Moscow. Police suspect that
explosives may have been transported to the capital hidden in bags
labeled as sugar.
</P>
<P>
   But Veldyayev also said that while police still believe the
people who ordered the explosions were ``Chechen fighters,'' they
now think the culprits ``used people with Slav appearances'' to
carry out the bombings _ raising more doubts as to the usefulness
of raids on the Kiev Market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian television stations played a tape of what
they said was an anonymous caller who claimed responsibility for
the bombings and called them a response to Russian attacks on
villages in Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a single bomb dropped by Russian pilots will remain
unpunished,'' said the caller, who claimed to be from a previously
unheard-of group called the Dagestan Liberation Army. There was no
independent confirmation of the claim, and Chechen officials
continued to deny any connection between the fighting in southern
Russia and the bombings in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Chechen blew up these houses in Moscow, then we will
shoot him ourselves on the central square of Grozny,'' said Maiberk
Vachagayev, the Chechen representative to Moscow.

SPANISH TRANSLATION ERROR JEOPARDIZES TEXAS BALLOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM BOWER and CARMINA DANINI  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A translator's error has created a major headache
for election officials across Texas, and it could cost Bexar County
taxpayers $91,000 to fix.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stems from an incorrect Spanish translation of
Proposition 15, which is a constitutional amendment ``permitting
spouses to agree to convert separate property to community
property.''
</P>
<P>
   The original translation in Spanish, which appears on Texas
ballots, permits spouses ``to agree to convert separate property to
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Secretary of State's Office, which printed the
ballots, issued an urgent notice Tuesday to officials across the
state, warning that the error is forcing the correction and
recertification of ballots for the Nov. 2 election.
</P>
<P>
   In Bexar County, 400,000 ballots already have been printed based
on a certification of the ballot language by the secretary of state
on Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Bexar County Clerk Gerry Rickhoff told county commissioners
Tuesday the mix-up could cost the county up to $91,000 if the
ballots must be reprinted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means we either have to resticker 400,000 ballots or
reprint them at a cost of $91,000,'' Rickhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Counties bear the cost of reprinting ballots because the state
doesn't have authority to assume liability, Ann McGeehan, deputy
assistant secretary of state, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bexar County Judge Cyndi Krier said the county should look into
a third option of having poll workers hand out fliers with the
corrected language along with the ballots.
</P>
<P>
   McGeehan said local election officials could opt to have their
ballots reprinted or could purchase stickers with the corrected
language and affix them to each ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The translation was done by a person who's federally certified
to work as a translator in federal court, McGeehan said. The same
translator, who has yet to be paid, also did the translation for
the 1977 constitutional amendment election.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there had been any translation errors in the Spanish
version of the ballot for that election, McGeehan replied: ``Not
that we're aware.''

SARASODA GIVES SARATOGA UNFAIR ADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Friday, Sept. 17)  
(rk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rivalry between Sarasota (Fla.) and Saratoga (N.Y.) has
taken an ugly turn.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's true that I'm the one who started the rivalry and
there are probably only two or three people in either city who are
dimly aware of it, but it's a rivalry that has taken an ugly turn
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   I am speaking, specifically, of a new soft drink being marketed
in upstate New York called Sarasoda.
</P>
<P>
   Created by John and Carolyn Davis of PJ's Bar-B-Q in Saratoga
Springs, Sarasoda is said to be made with loganberries, which the
Davises claim is some sort of cross between a blackberry and a red
raspberry. However, if you read the fine print at the top of the
label, you'll see the words ``Contains 0 Percent Fruit Juice.''
</P>
<P>
   I am not a trained food critic or nutrition expert ``per se,''
so I suppose it is possible that Sarasoda could have several
bushels of ``loganberries'' squished into each 20-ounce bottle and
still, technically, contain 0 percent fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, that in itself is not enough to turn ugly the
rivalry between Sarasota (Fla.) and Saratoga (N.Y.), such as it is.
</P>
<P>
   As a Professional Journalist I try to be objective, particularly
if it involves eating or drinking something I am pretty sure I am
not going to like. So I had my wife and 13-year-old son do a taste
test of Sarasoda, which comes in two flavors: Loganberry Flavored
Drink and Loganberry-Lemonade Flavored Drink. Both (the drinks; not
my wife and son) are noncarbonated.
</P>
<P>
   My wife took a sip of Loganberry Sarasoda and made the kind of
face I saw her make once before when she was doing laundry and
unwisely put her hand into the pocket of the boy's jeans.
</P>
<P>
   When she resumed breathing, she described Sarasoda as
``sickeningly sweet,'' quite a strong opinion from a woman who
considers mocha fudge chocolate cake to be one of the world's major
religions.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, needless to say, judged Sarasoda to be wonderful,
comparing the flavor to the liquid in those little edible wax
bottles that I dimly remember from my childhood.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who finds black coffee too sweet, I was
understandably reluctant to sample Sarasoda myself. Would my teeth
fall out? Would my face collapse upon itself like that unfortunate
fellow in the beer commercial? Would I get the sudden urge to
wander off into the woods to smoke and cuss like those annoying
young people in ``The Blair Witch Project?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, nothing remotely like that happened, though I did,
after taking a sip from each bottle, have this irresistible urge to
wash and vacuum my car, mow the yard and re-shingle the roof.
Whether it was the colorful label that accounted for this or the
high-fructose corn syrup, I can't really say. But I must admit I
felt strangely ... energized.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly why Sarasoda represents such an ugly turn in
the Sarasota/Saratoga rivalry. Although the Davises winter in
Sarasota, their concoction, Sarasoda, is available only in upstate
New York. While people living in Saratoga Springs and surrounding
areas are busy washing their cars and re-shingling their houses, we
Sarasoda-denied slobs of Sarasota continue to have trouble
summoning the energy to operate the remote control or chew our
oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to life than high-fructose corn syrup, I realize,
and Sarasota has a lot of things going for it that Saratoga does
not, though I am much too tired to recall what those things might
be right at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Another swig or two of Sarasoda might be just the thing to jog
my memory.
</P>
<P>
   And give me the energy to clean out the garage.

<P>
   TITUSVILLE, Fla. _ The roundhouse punch that Hurricane Floyd was
supposed to deliver to Florida was more like a love tap, and while
most people in this vastly relieved state thanked God and luck, a
few, like Chad Fish, were almost disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, four times the size and just as strong as the killer
Hurricane Andrew that laid waste to South Florida in 1992, had
threatened to ruin miles of coastline and be the event of the
18-year-old Fish's young life here in Titusville, a city of 42,000
people on Florida's east-central coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had hit us ... ,'' he said whimsically as he watched a
soft, harmless rain fall outside the Ramada Inn in this
still-deserted, boarded-up city Wednesday afternoon. But just as
forecasters had predicted, the hurricane turned north before its
eye and most powerful winds made landfall in Florida, and the
damage it left on land was more like a strong summer thunderstorm
than a murderous storm.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million people evacuated Florida's east coast on
Monday and Tuesday _ part of the largest evacuation in the nation's
history _ in shaky anticipation. Never had a storm so great come so
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see it, in a way,'' said Fish, who lives in
Titusville with his mother. Chances are, he said, it will never
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   While rescue workers stood by on the eastern side of the state,
rescue was seldom needed _ although a drunken man did stagger into
the surf in Daytona Beach and had to be fished out, complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Winds, estimated at up to 140 mph near the eye of the storm,
were a fraction of that on the coast, where hurricane-force winds
simply did not penetrate. ``Nothing in the way of massive damage at
all,'' said Don Pride, a spokesman for the Florida Insurance
Commission. ``It appears that Florida has dodged the bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   In Daytona, the hurricane's strong waves knocked down a wooden
pier, a sentimental spot for residents. The wind tore a roof off a
palm reader's house a few miles away, and damaged a church. It
pushed down trees _ but not many _ and downed power lines all along
the east-central coast, which had seemed to be the most likely
place for a landfall or serious damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had God's hand on us,'' said George Schultz, a maintenance
man in Titusville.
</P>
<P>
   The storm ripped awnings, knocked down a billboard, blew some
aluminum siding into power poles in Brevard County and, here and
there, toppled the aluminum roofs over gas pump islands, which
sometimes fall in hard rain. The wind also almost knocked down
several television reporters who insisted on standing on beaches
during the height of the storm to show viewers that it was, indeed,
windy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been spared,'' said Mel Martinez, county executive of
Orange County, which had expected hurricane-force winds earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Florida Emergency
Operations Center, said Wednesday that the state was still
assessing damage and had no figures yet, but county officials up
and down the east-central coast said most of the damage they saw
was minor.
</P>
<P>
   Even mobile homes, which almost melt in hurricane-force winds,
residents here said, came through the winds mostly intact.
</P>
<P>
   Power losses were mostly spotty. Ms. Kelly said some 240,000
households were left without power as of Wednesday. However, more
power losses were expected as the storm skirted the coast at
Jacksonville and moved north off Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Beach erosion, from elevated tides, was one of the most
noticeable impacts of the storm, but even that, residents said, was
less than feared.
</P>
<P>
   In Cape Canaveral, four space shuttles, valued at $2 billion
each and housed in hangars at the Kennedy Space Center, were
apparently not damaged, said NASA spokesman George Diller. Nearby,
at the Cape Canaveral Air Station, four rockets _ valued at more
than $600 million _ were left on the launching pads as the storm
neared, but they, too, were apparently not damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney World near Orlando, which was closed on Tuesday for
the first time in the park's 28-year history, was to reopen on
Thursday. ``Very minimal damage,'' said Renee Callahan, a
spokeswoman for the park.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm left the Florida coast, hundreds of thousands of
people who had left their homes for shelters and hotel rooms inland
headed back to their coastal homes, and most of them were relieved
when they got there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very fortunate,'' said Nell Deberry, who works at the
Ramada Inn in Titusville.
</P>
<P>
   While there was some mild grumbling about the mandatory
evacuations _ actually a misnomer, because many people ignored the
order from emergency management officials and stayed home _ most
people here seemed satisfied that the state handled the crisis
well. Most said it just made sense to flee.
</P>
<P>
   As the winds began to blow on Tuesday, William R. Davis knelt in
front of the walkway at Melbourne High School in Melbourne, one of
three shelters in that city that were mostly packed. The
62-year-old Davis knows hurricanes. He has been dodging them all
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old-time commercial fisherman, a shrimper,'' he said,
sucking on an unfiltered Camel. ``I've been out at sea when it blew
your pants off with your legs crossed. I've got sense enough to get
out of it now.''

THE `LOOK' WORKS ON CHILDREN OF ALL AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, Sept. 23)  
(lh) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of my commands to my two children are issued at the back
of their heads, from another room or tossed over my shoulder while
I'm driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't do that to your sister!'' ``Put the ketchup back in the
refrigerator!'' ``Don't dump out the crayons unless you're planning
on picking them all up again!'' ``Quit sitting on the dog!''
``Don't step on the Etch-a-Sketch!''
</P>
<P>
   As my exasperation level is reached, the commands get louder and
more threatening.
</P>
<P>
   And then I am was reminded, by an article in a parenting
magazine, about The Look.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the one your mom and dad perfected. My mother, lips
drawn tight, could look across the supermarket and cut me down with
a glance.
</P>
<P>
   The look that made you freeze mid-sentence, mid-action, and
reconsider your whole plan.
</P>
<P>
   It's the calm born of confidence and control. The way a really
good first-grade teacher quiets a class of rowdy 6- and 7-year-olds
with a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the irony: To capture attention, do almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Don't yell. Don't threaten. Don't lecture. Don't plead. Don't
repeat something 54 times.
</P>
<P>
   Say it once, low, calm and (you hope) effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, of course, is in how you say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an art to doing nothing, (and) that can turn you into
an immovable pillar of strength,'' writes Chris Ravashiere
Medvescek, a journalist and conflict-resolution mediator, in
Parents magazine.
</P>
<P>
   So what is The Look?
</P>
<P>
   It's an absolutely committed and relaxed, full-body
communication that says to your child, ``I mean business.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoulders facing front, body bent toward the child, hands behind
back, steady gaze and eyes locked on their face. ``And absolutely,
positively no hint of a smile,'' adds Medvescek, a mother of three.
</P>
<P>
   It's not important what you're really thinking. What's important
is that on the outside, you are not amused, you are not angry and
you are not distracted.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit, it works amazingly well. I'd never noticed how
rarely I even had eye contact with my children while I was trying
to communicate a serious consequence to them, or how often I was
trying to do chores or something else at the same time I was
reading them the riot act.
</P>
<P>
   To kids, distraction means they have gained the advantage. After
all, you'll be on to something else in a few seconds ... and so
will they.
</P>
<P>
   But The Look doesn't go away until there is compliance.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing makes kids more uncomfortable than an extended Look.
They want to make it go away, and the quickest and easiest way to
do that is obedience. Right then.
</P>
<P>
   Time outs, being sent to their room, getting so mad you have to
leave the room, even spankings, are easier than tolerating The Look
for a few minutes. From The Look, escape is not possible.
</P>
<P>
   And no one's talking about a seething glare, or a contemptuous
sneer. It's the very neutral nature of The Look that makes it so
effective.
</P>
<P>
   You may need to call their name _ again, in a neutral tone _ to
give them The Look. Your child may say, ``What? What are you
looking at?'' or ``NOOOO, it's not fair; it's not my turn.'' This
is an attempt to engage you in conversation. Don't give in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' says Medvescek, ``I imagine that I am a scientist
observing a life form in a laboratory. `How interesting,' I think.
`Notice how the species attempts to escape an uncomfortable
situation by making high-pitched sounds.'''
</P>
<P>
   Just stand there and do nothing. You may need to reiterate your
request. But make sure The Look doesn't waver.
</P>
<P>
   I once saw my 92-year-old grandmother give my 66-year-old mother
The Look.
</P>
<P>
   It still worked.
</P>
<P>
   So you can add that to the many advantages of developing The
Look: Apparently, there aren't any age limits, and once you've got
it, you never lose it.

AGREEMENT REACHED TO END NEARLY YEARLONG STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For five days short of a full year, 1,450 workers at the
Continental General Tire factory in Charlotte, N.C., have been on
strike in what has been one of the largest and longest strikes ever
in a state known for being unfriendly to unions.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the union, the United Steelworkers of America,
announced a tentative contract, and many workers were rejoicing
that after a painful year they had achieved their bargaining goals.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed six-year contract, the workers' pensions,
which have been far lower than those at other unionized tire
plants, will climb to the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely happy,'' said Linda Hatchell, who helps insert
steel belts into the tires. ``The main thing in my view is we
finally earned the company's respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The walkout, which began last Sept. 20, was unusual not only in
its length but in how the strikers hung together _ just 15 union
members crossed the picket line during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get by these last 12 months, people were living off of
their savings,'' said Mark Cieslikowski, a quality assurance
technician and a member of the union's nine-person bargaining team.
``There were people who took second and third jobs. Some had other
income from their wives. It ran the whole gamut, but we made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hatchell, for instance, worked at a video casino earning the
minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, far less than the $17.50-an-hour
average at the tire plant, one of Charlotte's largest employers.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Hollnagel, a company spokesman, said he could not comment,
other than to say, ``We are happy with the settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions escalated last fall when Continental hired hundreds of
permanent replacement workers, and strikers stood outside the
factory, calling them scabs. All told, 900 replacement workers were
used, with the company saying that production was 60 percent of the
33,000 tires a day produced before the strike. The union insisted
that production was far lower and that the decreased output
pressured Continental to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company threatened to keep all the replacement
workers and not let all the strikers back, the agreement calls for
rehiring within six months all strikers who want to return. Until
they are recalled, workers are to receive 80 percent of their
regular pay. The workers are to vote on the agreement this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers said the strike was caused by bad blood stemming
from the 1995 contract, in which the union had agreed to
concessions aimed at lifting the plant out of a prolonged slump.
The concessions included a wage freeze and acceptance of pensions
and cost-of-living increases below the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say management promised to raise the workers
back to the industry average once the plant became profitable. But
Continental workers said they felt compelled to strike when the
company, now profitable again, balked at raising their pensions and
cost-of-living adjustments to the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things we gave away in 1995, they wouldn't give us back,''
said Cieslikowski. ``We were expecting certain positive things to
happen when they started making a profit. We started asking,
`Where's our share?' and, lo and behold, it wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   The union took numerous steps to pressure Continental, a German
company which is the world's fourth-largest tire maker. It
organized protests at German consulates and persuaded workers at a
Continental plant in South Africa to stage a two-hour sympathy
strike. It hired a financial consultant to write a report saying
that Continental was making a financial mistake to let the strike
continue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the steelworkers got churches and other unions to
contribute food to tide the workers over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solidarity of this membership made this contract happen,
and it was well worth the fight,'' said Robert Griffin, an
electrician at the plant.

 &HT;    CLINTON, RETURNING THURSDAY, IS SET TO VETO GOP TAX AND SPENDING
PLANS
 &HT;    700&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    EDS: Clinton is en route back to Washington and scheduled to
land at 1 a.m. ET Thursday morning.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Back in the White House Thursday after a weeklong
Pacific swing, President Clinton is braced for an all-out partisan
fight over the heart and soul of national politics: federal taxes
and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was expected to veto the whopping $792 billion
Republican tax cut legislation as early as Thursday, effectively
killing prospects for the plan that was sent to the White House by
Congress on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That could be only the beginning. Clinton has threatened to
wield his veto power another half dozen times over the next two
weeks, after drawing a line in the sand over the Republican's
proposed tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dead on arrival at the White House,'' Vice President
Al Gore said Wednesday on Capitol Hill. ``It is not going anywhere.
It's going to be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hurricane Floyd menacing the East Coast, Gore said the
Republican tax cut ``would be kind of like an economic hurricane
wreaking havoc on America's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were quick to cast the White House as the champion
of big government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, maybe this is a difference in philosophy,''
said House Majority Leader Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ''Maybe we do
believe that the American people should have some control over the
money they make...(or) bureaucrats will spend your money for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The next battleground is spending. Clinton's senior aides have
already threatened to veto more than half of the 13 appropriations
bills Congress must send to the president's desk by Oct. 1, the
start of the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriations bills govern about one third of all federal
spending. The rest is so-called mandatory spending for such
purposes as the federal insurance programs Social Security,
Medicare and Medicaid and transportation funding guided by revenues
earmarked for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Gridlock between the White House and Congress over
appropriations bills forced a temporary shutdown in the federal
government in 1995. Legislators and administration officials both
claim they want to avoid a repeat in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tough negotiations lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his foes on Capitol Hill are tens of billions of
dollars apart over how to spend the proposed $1.8 trillion budget
for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to work with them,'' said Gore. ``We extend the
hand of bipartisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other hand, though, is the veto pen, which Clinton has
vowed to use.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the White House has argued that spending
proposals by the Republican-controlled Congress badly underfund a
broad range of Clinton's initiatives, from hiring additional police
and storing nuclear weapons fuel to supporting Mideast peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans counter that Clinton's spending proposals would
break bipartisan budget agreements and eat into the projected
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the economy continues to grow at slightly more than 2
percent a year, the federal government is projected to take in $3
trillion more than it spends over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of that surplus would come from payments into the
Social Security worker retirement insurance program. Both Democrats
and Republicans have proposed plans they say would dedicate that
money to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is over the remaining $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Congress passed a bill that would give
$792 billion back to taxpayers _ through an across-the-board 10
percent cut in income taxes; tax credits for education savings
plans; wiping out the so-called ``marriage penalty'' by increasing
income tax deductions for couples, and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a much smaller_ $250 billion over ten years
_ tax cut, targeting lower-income workers and families. He would
use the bulk of the rest to expand a broad range of domestic and
international programs, to shore up Medicare, the federal health
insurance program, and to provide prescription drug subsidies for
low income households.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond dollars and cents, there are high political stakes.
Democrats and Republicans are using the tax and spending debate to
frame their positions in advance of the 2000 presidential and
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans portrayed their proposed tax cut as emblematic of
their party principles. When it comes to government spending, they
say, less is more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget surplus doesn't belong to the federal government.
It belongs to the American workers who earned that money with their
sweat and ingenuity,'' House Republican Conference Chairman J.C.
Watts, Jr., R-Okla., said in a prepared statement. ``This is their
money. They deserve to have it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a much smaller tax cut of $250 billion over
ten years. It would target lower-income workers and families.
</P>
<P>
   He has said, though, that the Republican plan would starve
needed programs while putting a balanced budget at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats rallied around Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to say unequivocally we will support the
president's plan to veto the Republican tax cut because it's the
right thing to do today, tomorrow, any time a tax cut like that is
proposed,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told
reporters Wednesday at a Capitol Hill news conference. ``We're
asking our Republican colleagues to work with us to pass a
responsible budget that moves this country forward, not backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, White House officials were girding for a long
and drawn out partisan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a running battle that we've had since Day One of this
administration,'' a White House official said privately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is are we going to stay on the course of fiscal
responsibility and prudent investment in the American people...or
abandon it for a reckless tax cut and harsh cuts in education and
other critical priorities.''

SECURITY COUNCIL TRYING TO STRIKE DEAL ON NEW TERMS TO OFFER IRAQ
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council
reported progress Wednesday toward a landmark deal to ease
sanctions on Iraq in return for Baghdad's submission to a new
system of U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   If the agreement is struck _ and accepted by Iraq _ it could
lead to the first, sustained redeployment of U.N. personnel to
monitor Iraqi weapons programs since the previous inspection system
collapsed last year after bitter disputes that culminated in
airstrikes by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting here of senior officials from the five nations _
the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia _ British
officials cautioned that there was no guarantee that this latest
effort to revive inspection of Iraq's clandestine weapons programs
will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Progress was made but eventual success is not certain,'' a
British Foreign Office spokesman said. U.S. officials made no
immediate comment on the results of the encounter, which seemed to
imply a major softening of Washington's insistence on maintaining
sanctions to prevent President Saddam Hussein from rebuilding an
arsenal of chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf conflict, after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait, Baghdad has been the object of wide-ranging
international sanctions and restrictions on its trade with the
outside world. Struggling to break out of isolation, Iraq says the
sanctions are causing vast civilian hardship, but the United States
has accused the Baghdad government of starving its own people.
</P>
<P>
   British officials said senior diplomats from the permanent U.N.
Security Council member nations will hold more deliberations in New
York, leading to a gathering of the five foreign ministers
alongside the U.N. General Assembly gathering next week. Britain
was hoping a U.N. resolution could be agreed to before the end of
the month, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq gave the initiative a characteristically frigid reception.
``We are not concerned with this meeting,'' said Tariq Aziz, the
deputy prime minister. ``Our legitimate demands are known: the
condemnation of the aggression against Iraq and the lifting of the
embargo,'' he told reporters in Baghdad before the outcome of the
London meeting was known. Anything less, he said, would be
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats close to the London talks said the meeting centered on
the structure of a new arms control regime and on the idea of
offering Iraq incentives to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the previous system, the weapons inspectors were grouped
in a U.N. Special Commission headed by Australian diplomat Richard
Butler, but Iraq regarded the body as little more than a front for
U.S. control and espionage. The Special Commission never completed
its assessment of whether Iraq was free of chemical and biological
weapons _ a vital precondition for lifting sanctions. Iraq insists
that it will not allow inspectors to return to the country and the
entire issue has been in limbo for months.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats said that at Wednesday's meeting it was agreed
that a new inspection body would need a less confrontational
profile than the previous commission. But it remained unclear how
far the five countries had progressed toward settling long-running
disagreements among them over the conditions and timing for easing
restrictions on both imports and Iraq's vital oil exports.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by Britain, the United States was said to have argued
that sanctions could only be eased after Iraq had completed a trial
period of compliance with a new weapons inspection system intended
to ensure its full disarmament and establish long-range monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Only after this probationary period would sanctions be suspended
to free Iraq from restrictions on its oil exports and on the nature
of its civilian imports. The officials still had to establish the
duration of any suspension of sanctions, or conditions for
reimposing them. There was no question of permitting Iraq to import
arms or equipment that could be used for military purposes, the
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Iraq is permitted to export oil for the purchase of
food, medicine and some equipment needed to run its oil industry.

NEW ENGLANDERS, WITH AN EYE TO THE SOUTH, PREPARE FOR FLOYD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As Hurricane Floyd tormented the Carolinas, New
England braced for its stubborn fury Wednesday, preparing for
punishing rains and the winds of a still-dangerous storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing glides a little to the east, it could zoom up
Buzzards Bay as a Category 2 hurricane,'' said Peter Judge, a
spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``From one end of the state to the other, something awful could
come out of this thing,'' he said. ``Hopefully, it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Regional weather forecasters said Floyd's punch, once it reaches
this region, could range from tropical-storm wind gusts of up to 70
miles per hour, to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of at least 96
miles per hour, if the storm hugs the East Coast and regains
strength.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's center is expected to arrive here late Thursday or
early Friday. Late Wednesday the National Weather Service issued a
tropical storm watch from Plymouth southward.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorological menace _ still hundreds of miles away _
forced fishermen in Chatham to move their boats to protected waters
and prompted coastal homeowners to place tentative orders with
local lumber suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a large supply of plywood and waferboard that is
standing by in case things break bad,'' said Jim Kalife, manager of
Fairhaven Lumber near Buzzards Bay. ``No one is panicking, but they
want to know if we'll have 10 to 15 sheets available for them and
we're reassuring them that they don't have to grab it too early.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm's unpredictable path gave authorities no choice but to
activate emergency operations centers. Even under the rosiest of
scenarios, they said, Massachusetts will endure high winds, heavy
rains and possible flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heading toward New England. We will have the effects of
Floyd _ that's a certainty,'' said Glenn Field of the National
Weather Service. ``The only question is how strong the winds will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   From northwest Connecticut to Nantucket, Field said, emergency
officials are being told to get ready for a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of emphasis on Georgia and South
Carolina,'' the weather service's warning coordination
meteorologist said. ``But it's possible that it will just make a
grazing landfall in South Carolina and we would be the second stop.
It's not the Hurricane of '38 by any stretch of the imagination,
but a hurricane is a possibility here.''
</P>
<P>
   The September 1938 storm, one of the century's most violent,
killed 600 people and caused massive damage throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Constitution was secured in its berth in the Charlestown
Navy Yard, and at The Country Club in Brookline, where the Ryder
Cup matches begin next week, workers secured about 70 tents that
have been erected near the golf course for corporations that have
payed up to $350,000 to host parties for major customers and
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been strapping them down, and we've taken some extra
precautions to make sure that nothing is damaged,'' said Barton G.
Weiss, president of the company constructing the tents. ``We're
very confident. These are not tents in the normal sense of the
word, they are really more like structures. They are pretty solidly
grounded, with good foundations.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardware stores and harbormasters reported moderate business
Wednesday as home and boat owners for the most part adopted a
wait-and-see approach to a storm that threatened coastal Florida
before veering north toward the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   By early Wednesday afternoon, Floyd's fury was unmistakable as
far north as Cape Cod. Swimmers and small water craft were warned
away from the ocean waters. And forecasters watched to see whether
Floyd tracked inland or glanced off the Outer Banks of North
Carolina and took aim at New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it just skirts the Outer Banks, it's not going to lose a
lot of punch,'' Field said, who pegged Floyd's arrival here for
very late Thursday or early Friday morning. ``If the storm moves
over eastern North Carolina and then back out to sea toward New
England, we could be looking at a Category 1 Hurricane and it's not
out of the question that we could have a weak Category 2 hurricane
on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Field said the last Category 2 hurricane to strike this region
was Hurricane Bob in August 1991, which killed 18 people and caused
$1.5 billion in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's rainfall is expected to average at least 3 to 5
inches across the region with some pockets of heavier rains
measuring 6 inches or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with an inland track, we're going to get a lot of
flooding rain and winds gusts up around possibly hurricane force,''
Field said.

FROM PAPERBACK ROMANCES TO BEST-SELLING NOVELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the focus and chatter in book publishing have been on the
Harry Potter phenomenon, another great success story has been
quietly burgeoning. A small group of women who started out writing
paperback category romances have emerged as the true power in
hard-cover escapist fiction.
</P>
<P>
   These women went from writing romances to romantic suspense
novels to pure suspense with just a touch of romance. In the
process they leaped right over the glitz and sex of the likes of
Judith Krantz and Jackie Collins, and book by book are taking over
the best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Sandra Brown, Iris Johansen, Nora Roberts, Tami
Hoag, Tess Gerritsen, Catherine Coulter and Barbara Delinsky. All
of them have been able to summon their faithful romance-novel
readers to better, more complex books as they themselves have grown
as writers. Most of their writing is now character-driven fiction
that is tough-minded, often violent and does not cater to the
insensate. All are prolific; by year's end, Ms. Roberts, for
instance, will have published 133 novels. They typically have large
backlists going back to their romance-novel days, which makes them
endlessly profitable for their publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Nita Taublib, deputy publisher of Bantam Dell, who edits Ms.
Johansen, said that ``each of her books grows by leaps and bounds''
in its quality and complexity. The same is generally true of her
competitors. Equally interesting, as these women became more
sophisticated writers, their fans became more demanding readers, so
while some readers dropped by the wayside as the authors moved
forward, most followed and remained fans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taublib says that their current work is not so different
from that of such best-selling novelists as Patricia Cornwall or
Mary Higgins Clark, although their careers indeed are, since Ms.
Cornwall and Ms. Clark started at the top of the publishing ladder
with intricate hardcover thrillers, not paperback romances.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, practically every type of writing is more complex
than the romance category, which has a rudimentary formula: woman
and man meet, fall in love, have problem, overcome problem, live
together happily ever after _ angst and ecstasy in no more than
60,000 words, or about 200 mass paperback pages.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, who has written 60 novels, 38 of them best-sellers,
said that ``after about 45 romances I had reached a plateau, and I
wanted to move on,'' adding that from the start her goal ``was to
write more mainstream books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of my books now as suspense novels, usually with a
love story incorporated,'' she said. ``They're absolutely a lot
harder to write than romances; they take more plotting and real
character development. Each book is a stretch for me, and I try
something interesting each time that males will like as well as
women.'' Ms. Brown's latest novel, ``The Alibi'' (Warner Books),
will be No. 4 on the New York Times hardcover fiction best-seller
list on Sept. 26 (this weekend it's No. 1, a first for any of her
books, but for Sept. 26 the three Harry Potter books top it) and
last year's hardcover, ``Unspeakable,'' will be No. 6 on the Sept.
26 paperback list. About 455,000 copies of ``The Alibi'' have
already been shipped to bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johansen describes her career of writing best sellers as a
natural progression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love romance, happy endings and all, but as I continued to
write I wanted to grow,'' she said. ``My plots became more and more
complicated. There's lots of romance in my suspense stories, but
the emphasis is on suspense, not romance.''
</P>
<P>
   Her latest novel, ``The Killing Game'' (Bantam Books), will be
her first to make the hardcover best-seller list of The Times; it
will be No. 11 on Sept. 26. It features Eve Duncan, a forensic
sculptor, who will pop up now and again in her future novels,
though not in all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to make all my books very strongly character-driven,''
she said. ``They have complicated plots, but my purpose is to make
the reader really feel for the characters. I would say the majority
of my readers are women, but the last few books drew letters from
quite a few men too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johansen started writing what she called ``single title
historicals,'' for Bantam's Loveswept line of short romances, which
included a trilogy about a family and a statue that started in the
Renaissance and continued during the French Revolution and then in
contemporary times. ``I was not aware at the time that I was headed
that way, but the story happened to go in that direction, toward
the contemporary'' and this, she said, started her thinking in a
new direction.
</P>
<P>
   So she started writing more complex mass market paperbacks. In
1996 she published her first hardcover, ``The Ugly Duckling''
(Bantam), which included murder, plastic surgery, international
intrigue and revenge _ all the romance delectables woven into a
thriller.
</P>
<P>
   However one feels about the suspense novels with a jot of
romance that these women produce, these writers are the real
engines driving the book world. Each writes with great frequency;
all have a large backlist that is republished and repackaged over
and over, and often millions of fans. And it's the fans who make
them, since these authors' books are seldom reviewed and their
success comes from word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   One could suppose, from their work, that these women had
something else in common: That they were first and foremost readers
who then became writers. And perhaps that's what's most interesting
about them. It's rather like a weekend hacker molding herself into
a tennis pro and winning Wimbledon.

IODINE RADIATION ANTIDOTE AT CENTER OF N-POWER CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It's just a little pill, taken after a nuclear
accident to prevent a common type of radiation poisoning. But the
very existence of potassium iodide has caused big controversy in
the long war over nuclear power, symbolizing the worst thing that
could happen at a reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday a Massachusetts panel on radiation issues will consider
whether to stockpile potassium iodide pills in schools, hospitals
and other buildings near the Seabrook, Pilgrim and Vermont Yankee
nuclear plants to be handed out to the public in the event of a
significant radiation release.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear industry officials oppose distributing the pills, saying
they distract from what people should really do during a major
accident: leave.
</P>
<P>
   But nuclear critics say the industry is mainly afraid of the
public relations black eye they could get from closets of potassium
iodide at schools or on drugstore shelves. The pills, they argue,
saved children's lives during the Chernobyl accident in 1986,
prompting European nations to stock up years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nuclear industry doesn't want'' potassium iodide pills.
``It reminds people that accidents can happen,'' said Peter Crane,
a Nuclear Regulatory Commission lawyer who, on his own time, has
led the fight for the pills for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   However, after years of bureaucratic stalemate, the tide seems
to be turning in Crane's favor. Last summer, New Hampshire
officials decided to make potassium iodide available at drugstores
near Seabrook, and Maine called for storing the pills near Maine
Yankee nuclear plant in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has long declined
to keep public stockpiles of potassium iodide, but officials said
Wednesday they could change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still open. I want to hear all of the materials
available,'' said Robert Hallisey, director of the department's
Radiation Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing before the Governor's Advisory Council on Radiation
Protection is part of a national reexamination of a nuclear safety
issue that dates to the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island
nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Then, federal officials looked in
vain for potassium iodide pills to hand out, finally convincing a
company to manufacture a batch.
</P>
<P>
   Potassium iodide is no cure-all, but, if swallowed soon after
radiation exposure, it prevents radioactive iodine from
concentrating in the thyroid glands, a part of the body where
growing children are highly vulnerable. The Polish government
distributed millions of the pills during the Chernobyl accident in
neighboring Russia, which researchers say helped lower the rate of
thyroid cancers for years afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The usefulness of potassium iodide ``is the major public health
lesson learned from Chernobyl and everybody knows it,'' said NRC's
Crane, who will testify at the hearing. ``And yet the NRC did not
change policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear industry officials counter that potassium iodide has a
relatively short shelf life before it needs to be replaced, and a
small percentage of people have an allergic reaction to the pills.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, argues David Tarantino, spokesman for Pilgrim
nuclear power plant in Plymouth, the pills may give people a false
sense of security during an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``While potassium iodide is effective in terms of the thyroid,
it doesn't do anything for overall radiation exposure and there is
some concern that people might think it was some kind of a silver
bullet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, NRC officials argued that potassium iodide
wasn't worth the cost, and that the money would be better spent on
improving emergency evacuation plans. The Massachusetts Department
of Public Health agreed, setting aside pills only for emergency
workers and people who can't be moved easily.
</P>
<P>
   But NRC commissioners, responding to an appeal from Crane, had a
change of heart in 1998. Noting that the pills had helped reduce
illness after Chernobyl, the NRC called on states to consider a
public supply and even offered to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Massachusetts Department of Public Health officials
rejected the NRC offer, but that drew sharp criticism from
anti-nuclear activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are deep concerns within the environmental and public
health communities that the Department of Public Health is way too
cozy with . . . the operators of Pilgrim. Their footdragging on
this is further evidence,'' said Rob Sargent of the Massachusetts
Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   In response, DPH asked the Advisory Council on Radiation
Protection to reconsider the issue and pledged to follow its
advice. ``We'd be awful foolish not to listen to their advice after
we asked for it,'' said the state's Hallisey.
</P>
<P>
   Activists say they will get a chance to knock down old industry
arguments against the pills, showing that they are cheap and potent
for 10 years in storage, and no more dangerous than cough syrup
containing potassium iodide.
</P>
<P>
   If the council sides with them, DPH will then determine how best
to distribute the pills in Massachusetts communities within 10
miles of Pilgrim, Seabrook in New Hampshire and Vermont Yankee. The
plan could include both stockpiles as well as store availability
for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim's Tarantino said plant officials ultimately could adapt
to a requirement to provide potassium iodide pills, although they
wouldn't like it. ``From a public relations standpoint, it would
probably be another item where people would see concern'' about the
safety of nuclear power, he said.

LYNYRD SKYNYRD CARRIES ON, BUT FORGETTING IS IMPOSSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL DeYOUNG   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 20 years after the fuse was snuffed on Lynyrd
Skynyrd's skyrocketing career, the band has revived, rebuilt,
recommitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be foolish to let it pass us by, if you think about
it,'' says Leon Wilkeson, who has played bass in Lynyrd Skynyrd
since 1971. ``How blessed we are, given second and third chances.
How many groups do you know of that are given blessings like
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Begun in Jacksonville, Fla., by boyhood pals Ronnie Van Zant,
Gary Rossington and Allen Collins, Lynyrd Skynyrd created a pungent
distillation of good-old-boy Southern Rock and bratty,
take-no-prisoners songcraft: At its best, the band was like a
bastard child of the Allman Brothers and the Rolling Stones. It
rocked, but it sure wasn't dumb. No way.
</P>
<P>
   When their chartered plane ran out of gas and crashed into a
Mississippi swamp on Oct. 20, 1977, Lynyrd Skynyrd was crushed,
seemingly beyond repair: Van Zant, the group's leader, frontman and
main creative force, was killed, along with guitarist Steve Gaines
and backup singer Cassie Gaines, Steve's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkeson, Rossington (lead guitar) and Billy Powell (keyboards)
survived the crash _ just barely. Allen Collins died of pneumonia
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just extremely lucky, and we've seriously, honestly
tried to have kept the best attitude that we should have, every
time we hit that stage,'' Wilkeson says. ``I think we can honestly
say we try and play each show like it's the last.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every thing that I do great, he's responsible for,'' Wilkeson
explains, referring to Van Zant. ``And I feel like I can say that
on behalf of the rest of the members who worked with him. He was an
inspiration for everyone around him.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Rhode Island, Leon Wilkeson was working at an ice
cream plant in Jacksonville when he met Donnie Van Zant, one of
Ronnie's younger brothers. Wilkeson auditioned for, and got, a gig
in Van Zant's band the Collegiates, which would later become .38
Special and score a few hits of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Van Zant's band was called My Backyard, then The One
Percent, then Leonard Skinner, after the high school gym teacher
who got Rossington expelled because of his long hair. Finally, for
no reason other than it looked cool on paper, Lynyrd Skynyrd.
</P>
<P>
   Skynyrd signed with MCA Records in 1973. Leon Wilkeson was on
bass from the first session onward, and as the records got better,
the band's reputation grew: ``Free Bird,'' ``Gimme Three Steps,''
``Was I Right or Wrong,'' ``Sweet Home Alabama,'' ``Simple Man,''
``What's Your Name.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossington, Collins and Van Zant wrote the music _ but the
words, those belonged solely to Ronnie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the gift,'' Wilkeson says. ``Absolutely. One of the
strangest things about him in that area was that he never wrote
down lyrics. As strange as that may seem. When asked, he said he
figured if it had to be written down, it wasn't worth keeping. It's
shuddering to think about all the ideas he let slip into the
wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Right out of the gate, they were treated like rock stars,
opening the Who's massive ``Quadrophenia'' tour in the winter of
'73.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a blast, absolutely,'' Wilkeson says. ``One of the best
parts about touring with the Who was that they were just so polite
and gracious to us. Ronnie got the inspiration then that every
opening act that ever performed for us, from then on, we gave them
everything they wanted and treated them the same way the Who did
us. Because we appreciated how important that was, how helpful and
everything. The Who really took care of us and treated us right.''
</P>
<P>
   The band opened a European tour for the Stones, and by '77 was a
major headlining act. The sixth Lynyrd Skynyrd album, ``Street
Survivors,'' had been out less than a week when the plane went
down.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 20 people who survived the crash, Wilkeson was the most
severely injured, suffering a broken jaw, a crushed chest and
massive internal bleeding. He was dead on arrival at the hospital,
and was revived twice on the operating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of physical and spiritual healing that we all
had to go through.'' he says. ``It took a long time to figure out
what to do. We all got together and kind of agreed to lay the name
to rest, out of consideration of the band members that passed away
in the crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, most of the musicians came together as the
Rossington-Collins Band, and when Rossington left to start a new
group with his wife, they made an album as the Allen Collins Band.
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the accident, the band
launched The Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987. Johnny Van Zant,
brother of Ronnie and Donnie, was in the lead singer's slot, and he
still occupies that space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through kind of an eerie period when we started the
Tribute Tour,'' says Wilkeson. ``There were kind of eerie and
pleasant spiritual moments where the presence of Ronnie was always
felt onstage ... and Steve, and Allen, and Cassie. It's a
must-needed feeling for me, personally, that I welcome and like to
have. On account of the loss and how about I miss them since that
happened and all.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's Lynyrd Skynyrd makes an album every couple of years _
1994's ``Endangered Species'' was a critically lauded acoustic set
_ and tours to enthusiastic crowds. Currently, the band includes
Rick Medlocke, the founder of Blackfoot, Outlaws co-founder Hughie
Thomasson and drummer Michael Cartellone.
</P>
<P>
   The music is still fine, and the band still rocks. And even
though a lot of sand has fallen through the hourglass, no one
forgets the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, something that tragic and painful never
completely goes away,'' Wileson says. ``It's all in the way that
you handle your personal thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life goes on _ to everything, there is a season, turn turn
turn. Time to be sad, time to be glad.''

DEMOCRATS, LIKE REPUBLICANS, SHOULD BE WARY OF A BUCHANAN BID

 (For release Sunday, Sept. 19)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some Democrats may be jubilant at the possibility
of Patrick Buchanan seeking the presidency on the Reform Party
ticket and presumably siphoning votes away from the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative commentator's call for a return to the old
fundamentalist policies of strong nationalism and protectionism,
coupled with an adamant stand against abortion and immigration, is
one that presumably could wean other conservatives away from a
centrist candidate such as George W. Bush, John McCain or Elizabeth
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   America would face disaster if it were to follow his xenophobic
policies and retreat to the isolationism and high tariffs of
yesteryear. But his message could have a powerful influence on
voters, especially blue-collar workers and union members who
normally vote Democratic but feel left behind as the great global
express has soared to record economic heights.
</P>
<P>
   Before Democrats get carried away with euphoria, therefore, they
should study the political history of the 20th century and the
impact that third parties have had on presidential elections. A
split in one party's ranks does not always spell disaster for that
party's presidential aspirant.
</P>
<P>
   The four most memorable elections in which third-party
candidates played significant roles were those of 1912, 1948, 1968
and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In 1912 Theodore Roosevelt, a former Republican president and
the most popular political figure of his time, bolted the GOP when
he was denied its nomination and ran as the Progressive Party
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   His action split the GOP wide open. William Howard Taft, the
affable Republican incumbent, was badly beaten in his quest for a
second term, and Woodrow Wilson, the progressive Democratic
governor of New Jersey, was elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson won nearly 42 percent of the popular vote, Roosevelt 27
percent, Taft 23 percent and Socialist Eugene Debs 6 percent
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of scenario Democrats would like to see
replayed with Buchanan in the Roosevelt role and Bush as a
latter-day Taft. Democrats can envision their own nominee, whether
he's Al Gore or Bill Bradley, walking away with the election while
Buchanan and Bush split the Republican vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1948 campaign, with two major defections from the
Democrats, ended quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   The embattled presidential candidate was incumbent Harry Truman,
who was considered a sure loser by political leaders and the news
media. New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey, as the GOP standard bearer,
was seen as a sure winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats faced two problems that seemed insurmountable. One
was Henry A. Wallace and the other was Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who had been jettisoned as vice president in 1944 and
replaced by Truman as Franklin D. Roosevelt's running mate, became
the presidential candidate of the Progressive Party. A caustic
critic of Truman's tough policy of communist containment, Wallace
appeared certain to win the votes of liberals who were disenchanted
with the president and wanted better relations with Moscow. Wallace
was endorsed by the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the philosophical spectrum, Strom Thurmond,
then the 45-year-old Democratic governor of South Carolina, ran as
the nominee of the States' Rights Democrats, known colloquially as
the Dixiecrats. He did well with anti-civil rights voters in
southern states and, in fact, carried Alabama, Louisiana,
Mississippi and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But the defections of Wallace and Thurmond may have helped
rather than hurt Truman. First, the Wallace campaign bolstered
Truman's image as a stalwart opponent of Soviet expansionism and
mitigated Republican assertions that the president was soft on
communism.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Thurmond campaign, which followed a walkout of 35
southern delegates from the Democratic National Convention after it
adopted a strong civil rights plank, helped Truman win the votes of
African Americans and northern white liberals.
</P>
<P>
   The end result was that on Election Day Truman won, and the
Democratic Party picked up 75 seats in the House and nine in the
Senate, regaining control of both houses. Wallace got almost as
many votes as Thurmond, but they were spread around the country
rather than being concentrated in one region. He did not carry a
single state but probably prevented Truman from winning New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 George Wallace, the anti-integrationist Democratic
governor of Alabama, stirred things up with a campaign that
appealed not just to segregationist southerners but to white
workers, most of whom were Democrats disenchanted with their party
and angry over student uprisings against America's stance in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had a field day attacking ``pointy-headed liberals'' and
the political establishment. His appeal was such that in some areas
organized labor leaders had to twist arms to prevent members from
voting for Wallace rather than the Democratic nominee, Vice
President Hubert Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP standard-bearer, Richard Nixon, meanwhile had adopted a
``southern strategy'' aimed at winning votes in the traditionally
Democratic south. As his running mate, Nixon chose Maryland Gov.
Spiro Agnew, whose only claim to fame was his rigid law-and-order
stance against black demonstrators following the death of civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 73 million popular ballots cast that year, Nixon beat
Humphrey by a mere 510,000 votes. But Wallace mustered nearly 10
million votes and took five southern states as the American
Independent Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey believed he might have won without Wallace as the third
party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Ross Perot, the dynamic Texas billionaire, made his
political debut and won more than 19 million votes, compared with
43 million for Bill Clinton and 38 million for George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's candidacy may have tipped the political scales in favor
of Clinton because his stands on trade and other issues, like those
of Buchanan, appealed to the Republican right wing.
</P>
<P>
   If Buchanan wins his uphill fight to head the Reform Party
ticket, he will greatly increase the drama of the campaign. He also
may influence the final outcome.

MCCAIN (Washington) - Sen. John McCain has decided to drop the most
controversial piece of his bill to reform the campaign finance
system in the hopes of finally breaking the filibuster that has
prevented the measure from passing for years, the ``Arizona
Republic'' has learned. When the bill is unveiled Thursday, it will
not include a provision subjecting interest groups to federal
campaign-finance limits and disclosure requirements when they
broadcast political advertisements near elections. That provision
was ardently opposed by anti-abortion groups and the National Rifle
Association, among others during the House debate earlier this week
on grounds that it would muzzle free speech. And it was certain to
be a sticking point in the Senate, possibly a fatal one.. Without
the provision, McCain is optimistic

 &HT;    Airlines promise better service
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The nation's big airlines, trying to counter a barrage
of criticism from passengers, the media and Congress, fired their
own public relations broadside on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Major carriers separately released 12-point plans for improving
customer service, which they agreed to devise earlier this year to
avoid legislation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the big airlines' trade association stepped up
an attack on the Federal Aviation Administration for failing to
keep pace with the growth in air travel.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Mullin, chief executive of Delta Air Lines, unveiled the
Atlanta-based carrier's plan at a speech to the Wings Club, an
aviation group, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin conceded passenger discontent is justified, given airport
crowding and rising delay rates this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The problems stem both from shortfalls in the FAA's air traffic
control system and airline efforts to pack planes and boost
schedules at hubs like Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our industry is facing problems that already are affecting our
ability to provide good, reliable air transportation service,''
Mullin said. ``These are problems that must be addressed, and must
be addressed now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines must regain public confidence,'' he said, warning
that the industry ``may not get a second chance to self-regulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta's plan, which is similar to those of the other big
airlines, includes pledges to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have reservationists inform customers of the lowest fare or
cheaper alternative itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give consumers 24 hours after reserving a ticket to decide on
making the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tell customers when flights are overbooked, if they ask, and
provide information on bumping policies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make available legroom and seat-width information for
different aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide ``full and timely'' information on the status of
delayed and canceled flights, and provide for customers'
``essential needs'' during extended on-board delays.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strive to return misrouted luggage within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Support a government move to boost lost luggage compensation
limits from $1,250 to $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   _ Respond to written complaints within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin conceded some elements of the plan restate service goals
already in place, but added they'll be more specifically applied
under the new plan, which takes effect Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Airline critics in Congress have dismissed the voluntary plan as
a way for airlines to dodge tougher rules, as proposed in a
``passenger bill of rights'' considered last spring. The industry
strongly opposes further government mandates on service, saying
they would raise costs and amount to re-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Chris McGinnis, an Atlanta-based business travel consultant,
said the plans are ``nothing more than business as usual for the
airlines, and frequent fliers are tired of empty promises.''
</P>
<P>
   He said an industry offer to mandate minimum seat dimensions and
reveal how many frequent flier award seats are available on certain
flights would be more meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said Delta's efforts go beyond the 12-point plan. He
noted the airline is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in
technology to improve passenger processing at airports. It's now
installing new boarding computers and plans to roll out self-serve
kiosks and new flight information displays at gates in coming
months _ all in an effort to cut down on long lines and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines unveiled service plans similar to Delta's on
Wednesday. They are posted at the carriers' Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, a lobbying group for big
airlines, renewed its call for Congress to free funds from the
Aviation Trust Fund so the FAA can step up its efforts to upgrade
air traffic control systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improving the air travel experience for passengers is a joint
effort, and airlines have stepped up to the plate,'' said ATA
President Carol Hallett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the government to do its part to reduce the
massive air traffic control delays that are frustrating passengers
nationwide.''

 &HT;    Top executive to head both TNT, TBS
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turner Broadcasting is consolidating control of its
popular TBS and TNT channels under one top executive as part of a
strategy to make them distinct from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing both channels will be Bradley J. Siegel, a veteran
programmer who is now president of TNT and Turner Classic Movies.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel will take on the new title of president of general
entertainment networks. As such he will serve as part of a team
including Turner Broadcasting President Steven Heyer and Chairman
Terence F. McGuirk to reposition TBS.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel's new job is important because TBS and TNT are in an
elite group of cable channels that are almost universally available
in every cable household. TBS is available in 78 million homes and
TNT in 76 million.
</P>
<P>
   All entertainment channels, other than the animated ones, will
now report to Siegel. Betty Cohen, president of Cartoon Network
Worldwide, keeps control of the animated channels. Her
responsibilities include Cartoon Network, Boomerang and a new
animation studio under construction in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``TBS Superstation and Turner South (a brand-new channel being
launched in October) are well-positioned for Brad to craft the
strong identities that he has for TNT and Turner Classic Movies,''
said Heyer.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel's promotion comes one day after TBS President William
Burke was promoted to the job of building parent company Time
Warner's news and information presence on the Internet. In this
job, Burke will work out of Turner Broadcasting's Techwood campus
and hold the title of chief executive of news and information for
Time Warner Digital Media.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past two years, we have been working to develop a
separate programming approach with each channel,'' says McGuirk.
``The repositioning of these networks is still in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel will push that process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past several years, the two have become similar,''
says Siegel. ``We both carry the NBA, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   TNT's position is clear, says Siegel, but TBS' image has become
muddied with expansion. It will be part of his job during the next
couple of months to chart a new course for TBS. He doesn't know yet
what that course will be. The station currently carries old movies,
reruns and a mix of sporting events, including the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``One person is needed to make the decision about what program
goes on each channel,'' says Siegel. He will be that person.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel stressed that his admittedly shallow critique of TBS is
not a criticism of Burke, a friend and ally. ``Bill did a great job
reviving the channel.'' Under Burke's reign TBS improved ratings
and viewership.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel joined Turner Broadcasting in 1993 as executive vice
president of TNT. He was promoted to president of the channel, with
responsibility added for Turner Classic Movies about a year later.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, TNT has changed its content and marketing.
Launched primarily as a movie channel, relying heavily on the
company's MGM library, TNT now features a much broader and more
contemporary selection of shows.
</P>
<P>
   The old movies were moved to Turner Classic Movies, and TNT now
showcases newer films, such as ``Austin Powers,'' ``Top Gun'' and
``L.A. Confidential.'' It also features reruns of top network shows
such as ``E.R.,'' ``Law and Order'' and ``In the Heat of the
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Siegel has broadened TNT's programming to include
sporting and music events.
</P>
<P>
   Today, TNT often leads the industry in viewership among adults
during prime time on cable.

   Nobody can remember the exact moment the giant cane, Arundo
donax, went from being a nuisance to a state of emergency, but the
day it lifted up a bridge in Norco, Calif., might do for starters.
Sudden rains in 1993 had sent flood waters roaring down the Santa
Ana River.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arundo breaks off like monstrous celery stalks that jam up
against the bridge and work like a dam,'' said Paul Frandsen, the
general manager for Riverside County parks, standing on the banks
of the river early last spring. ``As the water rose, it lifted the
bridge right off its pylons.'' It did the same thing again last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The magnificent 30-foot plant has been used for everything from
fencing by the Spanish conquerors to an ornamental grass. But over
20 years, it has muscled out the native cottonwoods and willows
that once thrived along the banks of the Santa Ana. Slurping up
nutrients pouring into the river from seven sewage treatment
plants, arundo can grow 7 inches a day, said Frandsen, who is
battling 8,000 acres of it.
</P>
<P>
   And while the state of California spends millions to remove
arundo from the watershed, Greenlee Nursery, in Pomona, Calif.,
continues to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Arundo is one of about 300 exotic, or non-native, plants
invading natural habitats in the 48 continental states. And about
half of them are escapees from the garden, said Janet Marinelli, a
co-editor of ``Invasive Plants: Weeds of the Global Garden''
(Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Baby's breath, that pretty little white flower in bridal
bouquets, is wreaking havoc in the dunes by Lake Michigan. ``It has
a 15-foot taproot, about as big around as your thigh,'' said Sherri
Laier, an ecologist at the Point Betsie Preserve, in Michigan, run
by the Nature Conservancy. The plant stabilizes the dunes, which is
disastrous for species like the threatened Pitcher's thistle, which
depends on shifting sand to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Norway maples are out-competing the native sugar maples. Purple
loosestrife is killing the native reeds and sedges in wetlands.
Tall fescue, touted by the lawn industry as a drought-tolerant,
disease-resistant grass, never goes dormant on the prairie. So
farewell, native grasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invasive plants are causing about $123 billion a year in
damage,'' said William Brown, the science adviser to Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Controlling them is now on the
presidential agenda. For centuries, plant hunters have freely
traded plants, from lilacs and magnolias to tomatoes and figs, with
virtually no regulations. But those golden days are numbered, as
exotics from other countries have spread over about 100 million
acres and are continuing to grow at a rate of 3 million acres a
year (that's twice the size of Delaware).
</P>
<P>
   How did such glorious, useful plants start eating America?
Through our own doing, mostly, scientists say: Acid rain, polluted
water, heavy metals in the soil, nitrogen overloads, soil
compaction, fragmentation by development are just a few of the
human disturbances that can weaken a natural ecosystem, opening it
up to disease _ and opportunistic weeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of what people have done,'' Frandsen said, ``we have
created a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the World Conservation Union cited exotic species as
the second-biggest threat to biodiversity, next to habitat loss.
And early this year, President Clinton issued an executive order
charging the Agriculture, Commerce and Interior Departments with
developing a plan for controlling invasive species and preventing
the introduction and spread of new ones. At the same time, a bill
is making its way through the Senate that would increase the
Agriculture Department's authority to screen or even ban plants
from commercial trade.
</P>
<P>
   Such controls, after thousands of years of free exchange _ since
that first gardener carried seeds to another campfire _ has the
nursery industry worried about everything from seeds brought back
from Siberia to promising ornamentals in their greenhouses right
now. There are about a dozen plants on the federal noxious weed
list, but horticulturists say the regulations are poorly enforced.
And though 18 state agriculture departments have drawn up invasive
plant lists, compliance is voluntary. As countries like Australia,
where exotic plants overrun more than half of its wildlands, set up
strict requirements before a non-native plant can cross its
borders, the federal government is considering a similar model.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But a plant that may be invasive in sunny California could be
perfectly docile in the cold Northeast. ``One of my biggest
concerns about regulation is that it will be national, while
invasive plant issues are usually regional,'' said Barry Yinger, a
Pennsylvania nurseryman, who has made about 40 collecting trips to
Japan. ``Lantana is a horrible pest in Hawaii, but a great bedding
plant in Pennsylvania. Yet, under national regulation it would be
unavailable to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Yinger advocates regional boards, which could monitor exotics
and serve as a local early warning system for invasives.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Regelbrugge, a senior director at the American Nursery and
Landscape Association, would like to see voluntary compliance, if
only out of the sheer impossibility of regulating plants in a
global economy, where orders fly across the Internet and gardeners
are constantly crossing borders (with seeds and cuttings in their
bags). ``The last thing the nursery industry wants is an absolutely
balkanized marketplace,'' he said, ``where every little village has
its own plant list and the marketplace becomes so fragmented you
can't even keep up with it and do business.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many growers feel that they _ and their plants _ are being
scapegoated by a culture unable to face up to its own mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``These plants aren't big, evil villains that have invaded
pristine nature,'' said John Greenlee, the Pomona nurseryman who
insists on his right to sell arundo in California. ``They are
indicators of disturbance. The river has already been trashed and
turned into a channel. Native plants have already been removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Frandsen, the arundo warrior, paints the same scenario, with the
opposite conclusion. ``You can't reverse this,'' he said. ``You
can't ship the people out and take it back.''
</P>
<P>
   So you weed.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Frandsen assembled a coalition of about 20
groups usually at war with one another _ from the Nature
Conservancy to the herbicide maker Monsanto to firefighters and
flood control officials _ to declare war on arundo. And all spring
and summer, youth workers from the California Conservation Corps
were wacking back the weed with almost military zeal.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as these teams turn their backs, the giant reed
resprouts _ like something from ``The Day of the Triffids.'' So
they nuke it with herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't ever stop doing it,'' said Frandsen, who is pushing
for a state water bond issue that would funnel $20 million to
control the cane. In 10 years, Team Arundo has brought 500 acres
back to cottonwoods and willows, and the least-billed vireo, an
endangered bird, has a place to nest again.

<P>
   The Nature Conservancy fights the same battle on 14,000
preserves around the country. ``If we are going to protect the
diversity of native plants and animals, we have to do weed control
or weed prevention,'' said Dr. John Randall, the group's invasive
plant specialist. ``We cannot simply fence these properties off and
walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many conservationists, he says it is important to focus the
limited time and money available on saving the most diverse, rare
habitats, and also on preventing the entry of new invasive species.
</P>
<P>
   But new plants are the lifeblood of the horticultural world, say
growers who fear that regulations will discourage new plant
introductions and hurt the industry.
</P>
<P>
   It's the very qualities of exotic plants _ the ability to thrive
in the dry, salty conditions of a tree pit, for example _ that send
plant hunters roaming the Siberian steppes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunately true that the plants that are best adapted
to our unnatural landscapes in cities and suburbs are often not
native plants,'' said Yinger, who has a research nursery in central
Pennsylvania. ``Native plants did not evolve for our current
disturbed landscapes, and it is romantic nonsense to claim that
they are the answer to all our landscape problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long view of many biologists, no amount of weeding is
going to keep a disturbed forest full of dogwoods and trillium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservationists are trying to preserve the remnants of what
once was,'' said Dr. Peter Del Tredici, the director of living
collections at the Harvard University Arnold Arboretum. ``It's a
form of creationism. It denies the existence of change, which is
about evolution.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   New Yorkers can see evolution taking place right in the
200-year-old forest at the New York Botanical Garden. The hemlocks
are dying, the dogwoods and ashes are sick. The forest is
struggling with acid rain, amd heavy metals from road runoff. The
Bronx River is polluted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Peters, a forest ecologist at the garden, stood in a
little grove of Aralia spinosa _ a thorny tree called devil's
walking stick _ seeding itself in the sunny gaps created by fallen
trees. ``As the natives die,'' he said, ``these highly invasive
species come in, and say, `Oh yeah, we can live here.''' He led the
way along the banks of the polluted Bronx River, where Japanese
knotweed has covered the eroded banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature itself is fixing this,'' said Peters, trying to like
the invaders. ``These plants are photosynthesizing, they're taking
water up, they're cleaning the air.''
</P>
<P>
   They're doing the job of the forest, in other words. ``And once
you start pulling out those Norway maples and knotweed,'' he said,
``you'll have to do it forever.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does all this debate leave the poor gardener?
</P>
<P>
   In a political state, that's where _ because simply putting an
invasive plant in your garden might be hurting your local
ecosystem. Or not, depending on your view.
</P>
<P>
   Experts hope that people will educate themselves by reading
information published by local botanic gardens and conservancies,
or by attending conferences, like the one coming up at Swarthmore
College in Swarthmore, Pa. _ ``Invasive Exotic Plants: Current
Management Strategies'' _ on Nov. 3 and 4 (215-247-5777, ext. 156).
Gardeners can find out what plants are the top offenders in their
states by calling local plant councils. The Invasive Plant Council
of New York (518-273-9408, ext. 221), for example, lists Norway
maple as the top offender. So plant a sugar maple, to give the
native a leg up.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the plants in your own garden, especially those lovely
self-seeders, like Verbena bonaniensis, a tall, airy purple flower
that comes back every year, then shows up in cracks in the
sidewalk. Or across the street in your neighbor's yard. These are
the sure signs of an invader.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see it doing this in the garden, it's not a good
species to distribute,'' said Dr. Sarah Reichard, a biologist at
the University of Washington in Seattle, who is developing a
screening model for letting plants into the country.
</P>
<P>
   And if a little Arundo donax should pop up in your garden, take
a look in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to admit that part of being an American in the 21st
century is disturbance and pollution,'' Del Tredici said. ``And
these are the plants that flourish in the company of people.''

HUBERT G. QUACKENBUSH, AT 77; WAS ALL-STAR BRUINS DEFENSEMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA MASSEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hubert George ``Bill'' Quackenbush, a former Boston Bruins
defenseman and Hall of Famer who once went 132 consecutive games
without a penalty, died Sunday in Pennsylvania from complications
of Alzheimer's disease. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Toronto, Mr. Quackenbush entered the minor leagues
shortly after graduating from Western Tech High School in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Detroit Red Wings in 1942, where he played for six
years before signing on with the Boston Bruins in 1949. He played
seven seasons with the Bruins, retiring in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   During his 13 years with the National Hockey League, Mr.
Quackenbush was named five times to All-Star teams _ to the first
team in 1948, 1949, and 1951, and to the second team in 1947 and
1953.
</P>
<P>
   In 774 NHL games, he collected a mere 95 minutes in penalties,
and during 1947-1949 he played 132 consecutive games without a
penalty, making him the least penalized defenseman in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he played so many years at an all-star level
with so few penalties says a lot about him,'' Mr. Quackenbush's son
Bruce said Wednesday. ``His style of play was unique, and he showed
that you could be successful without spending half the game in the
penalty box. That's hard to find in hockey these days.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 Mr. Quackenbush was awarded the Lady Byng Trophy, an
annual award given to the NHL player who best combines
``sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct with a high standard of
playing ability.'' He was the first defenseman, and one of only two
in history, to win the Lady Byng.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he was inducted into the NHL Hall of Fame, hailed as
``one of the most effective rushing defensemen in the game as well
as an excellant checker. Not a thumping hitter, his main attribute
was an ability to break up the rush without pounding an opponent
into the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the NHL, Mr. Quackenbush received an associate
degree in engineering from Northeastern University in 1962. He then
worked as a marketing representative for several civil engineering
firms in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 he began coaching hockey and men's and women's golf at
Princeton University, a position he held until 1985. During that
time, he led the men's golf team to five Ivy League titles and the
women to three.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a couple of decades Dad was involved as a coach and a
teacher, something he was very focused on and proud of,'' Bruce
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Quackenbush lived in Lawrenceville, N.J., and was a member
of the Springdale Golf Club in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Joan Kalloch Quackenbush; three sons, Bruce
and Scott of Greenwich, Conn., and Todd of Pennington, N.J.; two
brothers, Ted of Toronto and Max of Halifax; and seven
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is scheduled for Oct. 3 at 2 p.m. in the
Lawrenceville School Chapel in New Jersey.

IN DISCONNECTED NEW ZEALAND, CLINTON CONNECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand _ Here's a new strategy for a
president who wants to win hearts in a faraway nation: Just before
arriving for a state visit, slap enormous tariffs on the country's
chief export _ in this case delicious New Zealand lamb _ and cut
off the tiny country's ability to sell to American consumers. Then,
on arrival, spend each day extolling the virtues of free trade.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to Bill Clinton's arrival here, it
seemed as if all 3.8 million New Zealanders were outraged.
Editorials denouncing Washington for wiping out the livelihood of
New Zealand farmers appeared almost daily. Cabdrivers and fishing
guides alike chewed out Americans for picking on a country whose
entire economy adds up to a fraction of General Motors' revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Clinton, the first president to visit here since
Lyndon Johnson, was pulling over his motorcade in small towns and
working the crowds as if he still had one election left in him, all
seemed forgiven. Thousands lined the streets cheering _ the biggest
crowds this tiny country has mustered since it won the America's
Cup four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably a lot more popular here than he is back in
America,'' Russ Skinner, who teaches at a vocational college, said
as he and hundreds of others mobbed Clinton in what is usually a
sleepy corner of this very sleepy city. ``He's been exposed to be
nothing more than just a human. And that's made us like him even
more.''
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand resembles nothing more than England in the 1950s.
And the president, who talks endlessly about how we are all in a
perpetual footrace for advantage in a superconnected, global
economy, seemed happiest luxuriating in a country more
disconnected, and perhaps less global, than any developed nation on
earth. After all, how many countries still have more sheep than
Internet sites, and are proud of it?
</P>
<P>
   But the government, facing an election in 11 weeks that it seems
likely to lose, was not about to let Clinton off the meat hook.
``We have fed the president as much fine New Zealand lamb as we
could possibly fit in,'' Jenny Shipley, the country's prime
minister, said Wednesday, reminding Clinton, as cheerfully as she
could, that she planned to drag the United States in front of the
World Trade Organization. Clinton's own aides say that New Zealand
will probably win, adding that the tariffs were a sop to a few
senators from farm states to win their support on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proved, once again, that he can't stand to leave anyone
unhappy. ``If I were in your position,'' he told Mrs. Shipley,
``that's exactly what I'd do.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything You Can Do...
</P>
<P>
   Working for Bill Clinton, one would imagine, is enough of a
heart-stopping experience to last a lifetime. There's his explosive
temper. There's the risk-taking that led to impeachment. But for
Gene Sperling, the head of the National Economic Council, and
Douglas Sosnik, one of the president's most senior advisers, the
White House simply isn't enough of an adrenaline rush.
</P>
<P>
   So when Clinton was spending a day at a glorious resort in
Queenstown, playing a staid round of golf in a valley surrounded by
jagged snow-covered peaks, Sperling and Sosnik were plunging into a
142-foot gorge from a bridge over the Kawarau River. Oh, they were
attached to a bungee cord.
</P>
<P>
   The predictable metaphors to Clinton's political fortunes ran
thick. Then the press corps pulled up in a bus, en route to a local
winery, and discovered their pride was at risk. One by one,
reporters and talking heads were leaping into the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proves you're never too old to do something really
stupid,'' Bill Plante of CBS said as he took the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The Juggler's Art
</P>
<P>
   It's hard enough for a country this size to stage one state
visit. But Mrs. Shipley is trying to juggle three at once: Clinton,
President Jiang Zemin of China and Kim Dae-jung, the onetime jailed
dissident who is now president of South Korea. All were here for
the summit meeting of Asian leaders, and all decided this was their
only moment to work on relations with a country that, Henry
Kissinger once noted, is on the way to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a performance: Mrs. Shipley would pack two leaders
off for sightseeing or to visit a farm family while entertaining
the third at a state dinner. By most accounts, Clinton was having
the most fun.
</P>
<P>
   He had plenty of time to play golf and take his daughter,
Chelsea, and his mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham, out to dinner with
the most famous New Zealander of all, Sir Edmund Hillary of Mount
Everest fame. (Hillary Clinton decided that the better part of
political prudence was to stay in New York working her own crowds.)
He visited the Antarctic Center, where expeditions to the American
base on Antarctica begin, and threw snowballs in its re-creation of
a an Antarctic environment.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, on the other hand, has been shadowed at every turn by
protesters shouting at him about China's treatment of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was loud enough that on Tuesday Jiang sent word that
he would not go to his state dinner unless New Zealand got rid of
the protesters. By the time police figured out how to get him into
the banquet hall without hearing the shouts and protests, he was an
hour and a half late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to express my apologies for my lateness,'' Jiang
said, speaking in English. ``But it was not my fault.''

CONTINENTAL TO DROP SERVICE TO BANGOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Continental Airlines is planning to shut down its
service to Bangor, Maine, Oct. 30, diminishing the capacity of the
international airport and raising broad questions about the impact
of airline deregulation in rural parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The move infuriated both Maine senators, who issued a joint
statement saying they were ``appalled by Continental's decision''
and immediately demanded a Senate hearing on the matter.
Representative John Baldacci, a Maine Democrat, also announced he
would hold a hearing at Bangor International Airport next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating,'' said Senator Olympia Snowe, a Maine
Republican. ``It's a significant loss to the airport. We've seen
this pattern in many parts of the country, and it's really having a
significant effect. It certainly is not right or fair. Airlines
depend on taxpayer dollars, public subsidies, the FAA as an agency
and airspace. It's a serious issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline currently runs two flights each weekday from Bangor
to Newark, with the capacity for 46 passengers on each turbo-prop
plane. But according to officials at Continental Express, ``the
system performance was relatively low'' in comparison to other
airports, forcing the company to close it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a true business decision,'' said Michele King, a
spokeswoman for Continental Express, the regional subsidiary fully
owned by Continental Airlines. ``It's a weak market for us. We're
disappointed as well, but we had to make this business decision. It
just makes the most sense to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12 employees of Continental now working at the Bangor
airport will be offered jobs at other airports, King said. She
declined to specify how full the flights to Bangor were on average.
But members of the Maine congressional delegation _ who learned
about the service termination on Tuesday, at the same time as
Continental employees _ said they were under the impression that
the flights were routinely as much as 70 percent full.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Express president David Siegel informed the senators
about stopping the service at a meeting scheduled to express ``good
news and bad news,'' said Dave Lackey, a spokesman for Snowe. The
good news was that Continental hoped to add two daily flights
between Columbus, Ohio, and Portland, Maine, starting on May 2,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the bad news had an immediate impact. Bob Ziegelaar, the
airport director at Bangor for nearly a decade, said he understood
why the congressional delegation was upset. ``They're right,'' he
said. ``Major carriers in this country are abandoning the smaller
airports, and there aren't regional carriers to take their place.
Airports like Bangor are being caught in the middle, because the
major carriers went out and the new ones can't come in because they
don't have the equipment, and the major carriers are fighting
them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Zeigelaar said the airport was already
negotiating with other carriers who hoped to take Continental's
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll overcome this. We're already talking to a couple of
operators,'' he said. And the new carriers, he pointed out, would
operate much larger regional jets. ``So there is a silver lining,''
he said.

MOSCOW BOMBINGS RAISE MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT YELTSIN'S HOLD ON
POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (With RUSSIA-BOMBS)  
(nk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Bombs are exploding in the middle of the night, in the
middle of the capital, killing families in their sleep. Generals
have boasted of victory in a war in the northern Caucasus, only to
be humiliated by thousands of Islamic militants who are striking
behind their backs. And international inquiries have cast new
suspicions overfinancial institutions, as well as members of
President Boris Yeltsin's family.
</P>
<P>
   How Yeltsin will react to the disasters and other problems that
are accumulating in his last year in office is unclear. Political
experts have given up predicting the next step of a leader
generally scorned by the population and isolated by a political
elite that is fleeing in droves from his once powerful tutelage.
</P>
<P>
   For days, rumors have swept Moscow that the Kremlin is again
preparing to do something. The speculation includes a declaration
of a state of emergency, or a ``special regime,'' to an
announcement by Yeltsin that he will resign 10 months ahead of
schedule in an attempt to give the advantage to his chosen
successor, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Other possibilities
include another round of dismissals of top presidential staff
members.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the blast on Monday, which killed more than 120
people in an apartment building on Kashirskoye Highway, top
officials have repeatedly insisted that the government has no plans
to introduce a state of emergency that, some fear, could lead to a
postponement of parliamentary and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   As Putin told parliament on Tuesday, Russia lacks an adequate
up-to-date law for imposing such emergency rule. And many political
observers said they thought that the central authorities were too
weak to impose the controls that such a move would entail.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Yeltsin may retire early continue to circulate.
Analysts say they believed that the idea had been seriously
discussed in the Kremlin as a strategy to propel Putin into power
where he could watch over Yeltsin family interests. A month after
Yeltsin named him as heir apparent, Putin appeared in polls to
trail all possible presidential contenders, with a popularity
rating of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But as Russia's situation goes from bad to worse, a consensus
has emerged that runs across society and across the political
spectrum: Yeltsin's time has run out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Yeltsin left today, it would be better for the people and
political parties, and it would be better for him, too,'' Yegor
Stroyev, chairman of the upper house of parliament, the Federation
Council, said in a recent interview. ``His attempt to hold onto
power or to stay there by installing his own man will create
enormous tension in society.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Stroyev, a former Communist who has been Yeltsin's
tactical ally in recent years, would not have made such a
statement. But since then, the country has undergone a severe
financial crisis that has sunk more of its people into poverty, a
regular turnover of governments and domestic scandals that have in
the last month spilled onto the international scene.
</P>
<P>
   The open-ended war in the Caucasus has come to Moscow with a
wave of what officials say are surely terrorist attacks, attributed
to Islamic guerrilla leaders whose operations in Dagestan have made
a mockery of the Kremlin's earlier claim of victory.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bombing in Moscow, the fourth in Russia in two weeks,
propelled Yeltsin into action. He summoned top security officials
to his office Monday, and since then he has reportedly been keeping
close track of the investigation and the security measures ordered
in Moscow and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the nation tries to steady itself for the
possibility of further attacks, Moscow newspapers expressed doubts
about the adequacy of the government's preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``After asking whether another terrorist act can be averted, the
key question is whether the executive power controls the country as
a whole,'' said Nezavismiya Gazeta, a Moscow newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya, the rebel republic where the guerrillas have made
their base, long ago slipped out of Moscow's control. The heirs of
the once-feared KGB network have proved incapable of anticipating
violence, even when it strikes at the heart of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Stroyev attributed the weakness of the central authority to a
flawed Constitution, drafted by Yeltsin in 1993, that gave him the
illusion of power, but none of its instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, he received enormous rights,'' Stroyev said
in an interview in the central city of Orel, where he is governor.
``But on the other hand, he was absolutely deprived of power over
the country. He may discharge his chief of staff and the prime
minister, but no one else. His power does not extend further than
the Kremlin walls. Nobody needs such a system of power. If it
remains, we will lose Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   For the seven years of his presidency, Yeltsin's power, illusory
or not, was enough to hold rivals in check. His instincts were also
acute enough to throw the challengers off guard, as he played his
favorite game of balancing different interest groups against one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as his status diminishes, and his opponents, including
former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of
Moscow, openly challenge his authority, reports of corruption in
his closest entourage have been met with a wearied yawn by many
politicians, among them Yeltsin's fiercest critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that in Russia there is terrible corruption, at all
levels,'' Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal opposition party
Yabloko, said in an interview last weekend. ``What difference does
it make what went on in Yeltsin's back yard?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stroyev showed the same indifference to reports of bribery and
kickbacks given to members of `the Family,' a term now used to
describe Yeltsin's inner circle. The reportsarose from an
investigation, conducted with the help of Swiss authorities, into
the Mabetex Project Engineering Group of Lugano, Switzerland, a
company that has won several lucrative Kremlin contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I, chairman of the Federation Council, am not interested
in what is going in the Kremlin,'' Stroyev said. ``I don't care
about the Family or its decisions. I know that they will not take
any decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The international dimension of the scandals, which now include
an investigation into suspicions that multiple billions of dollars
in Russian money had been flushed through accounts at the Bank of
New York, are also seen here as a sign that the Western world, too,
has had enough of the Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   In Yavlinsky's view, Western frustration and disgust with
corruption in the government and its highhanded treatment of
foreign investors and creditors peaked in August 1998, but was for
months kept muffled as banks and international agencies struggled
to retrieve at least some of the money that they had lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then and there it became clear to me that this cannot be
forgiven for long,'' Yavlinksy said. ``Sooner or later, it had to
explode. And it happened this summer. It happened because everyone
is sick and tired of the Yeltsin regime. Everybody. Western people,
non-Western people. The first were the Russian people. But that was
OK. Russians elected him, and it was their business. But when
everybody else got sick and tired of him, it all began. It was the
last straw.''

   ``The Corruption of American Politics: What Went Wrong and Why''
</P>
<P>
   By Elizabeth Drew
</P>
<P>
   Investigative journalism
</P>
<P>
   Birch Lane Press, $21.95
</P>
<P>
   American pundit Mark Twain once said, ``We have the best
Congress money can buy.'' After reading Elizabeth Drew's latest
book, ``The Corruption of American Politics: What Went Wrong and
Why,'' it looks like a million dollars doesn't buy what it used to.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, a seasoned Washington journalist, author and
Congress-watcher, looks at the pervasive, insidious role that the
all-mighty dollar plays in American politics. ``Corruption'' should
be required reading, not just for political wonks and editorial
writers, but for every voter and taxpayer in this country,
particularly as we get further into what is shaping up as the most
expensive presidential campaign ever. And that's saying plenty.
Total political spending just for TV ads during the '96 race was
$405 million, without counting the money paid to the people who
produced the ads.
</P>
<P>
   The entry fee into American politics is at an all-time high,
which means that men and women jockeying for the privilege of
serving the public spend an inordinate amount of time with their
hands out, palms up. The perception left in the public mind is that
the only citizens being served are the special-interest groups
anteing up the big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that Americans have grown cynical and apathetic
about politics.
</P>
<P>
   Even those weary few who attempt to address the ills of '90s
politics _ money, money and more money _ suffer at the hands of
their colleagues. Drew invites us to consider Fred Thompson. The
Tennessee Republican senator, tapped by Majority Leader Trent Lott
to conduct the hearings into the Clinton financial scandals of the
1996 election, never had a prayer. His desire to investigate how
campaign finance laws have been thwarted by folks on both sides of
the aisle was dead in the water before the echo of the convening
gavel rang through the Senate hearing room. Fellow Republican Lott
had a lot to do with torpedoing Thompson's effort.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem runs deeper than the pockets on a D.C. lobbyist.
According to Drew, civility, compromise, experience and a sense of
public purpose have evaporated from the halls of Congress. Drew
quotes one Senate aide: ``We don't have policy debates anymore.
Instead of voting on `the great issues of the day' _ whatever they
may be _ we haven't framed them very well. We go from skirmish to
skirmish until the next election. So much time is wasted on petty
issues instead of big ones.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Petty'' is also an accurate word to describe the relationships
that exist between policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marked decline in civility in both chambers in the past
few years has had an adverse effect on the job of doing the
people's business,'' Drew writes. ``Civility abetted the formation
of coalitions for large purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not uncommon, until sometime in the late '80s, for
senators and representatives to socialize across the aisle, go to
each other's homes. But now, serving in the Senate or the House is
an atomizing experience, what with the constant fund-raising
demands and the constituent demands.''
</P>
<P>
   The spate of 1996 retirements left ``a big hole in the center,
and a major hemorrhage of experience ... The collective departures
of, among others, Alan Simpson, William Cohen, Nancy Kassebaum, Sam
Nunn, David Pryor, Paul Simon, Mark Hatfield and Bob Dole removed a
substantial body of experience and judgment. A crucial core who
understood the point of compromising for the good of the whole was
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman members once looked to their elder statesmen for
guidance, deferring to their experience and knowledge in certain
fields; now they turn to their computers to try to become instant
experts on every subject. The world of an elected official consists
of the Internet, full-time campaigning and the latest polls showing
what folks back home are thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do everything they can do to avoid displeasing a
constituent or casting a controversial vote. They think in terms of
message rather than policy. The result isn't leadership,'' writes
Drew, a veteran political columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Drew's scrutiny of Washington insiders _ and outsiders who
desperately want in despite protests about how awful the place is _
has led to a string of books since 1994: ``On the Edge: The Clinton
Presidency; Showdown: The Struggle Between the Gingrich Congress
and the Clinton White House''; and ``Whatever It Takes: The Real
Struggle for Political Power in America''. This latest effort
paints perhaps the bleakest picture of the state of American
politics, but, unlike in some of her previous works, Drew does
offer seeds of hope for her readers. She just doesn't want them to
expect overnight miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Significant reform takes time, so Drew cautions Americans to be
prepared to hunker down for the long haul. But she firmly believes
that voters do care about campaign finance reform, and only need
the opportunity to focus on it. Evidence is available on the state
level; voters in several states have successfully adopted such
initiatives as public funding of state elections.
</P>
<P>
   Drew's look inside the halls of democracy gives readers an idea
of what they'll be up against in the fight to reform politics. In
any war, it's important to know how the enemy thinks.

SICKLE CELL PATIENT IS HOPEFUL DESPITE HER PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The worst part, perhaps, is not knowing when the pain will
strike.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, Kelley Lewis says, it is as if a truck ran over
her, backed up and rolled over her again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only way I know how to describe it,'' she says about
sickle cell disease. ``One day I'm feeling OK, and the next I may
be in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is where the 28-year-old Fort Worth woman was two weeks
ago. And a month or so before that. It is how her life is.
</P>
<P>
   It is enough to make you regret being born, because no amount of
time can erase the pain. There is no cure, so the debilitating pain
just keeps coming, like an uninvited guest banging on the door at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jones, executive director of the Sickle Cell Disease
Association of America/Greater Fort Worth, says that one in 12
people in Tarrant and Denton counties carries the sickle cell
trait. And contrary to popular belief, the disease is not limited
to African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sickle cell affects all of us,'' she says. ``It's not about
race, age, ethnicity, gender or social status.''
</P>
<P>
   But many contend that research funding would be more generous if
the disease did not primarily affect blacks and a small percentage
of people of Mediterranean, East Indian and Middle Eastern descent.
</P>
<P>
   In sickle cell disease, an inherited chronic anemia, blood cells
become sickle-shaped when deprived of oxygen. The results can
include pain, extreme fatigue and widespread, life-threatening
organ damage. The syndrome varies considerably in severity. Some
people live long and nearly normal lives; others, such as Lewis,
are plagued by strokes and painful ``crises.'' On average, sickle
cell patients die in their early 40s; 5 percent die before age 20.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' mother, Sandra, puts it this way: ``Sickle cell is a
disease that dominates the black Americans. It is a select killer
that needs to be eliminated in the worst way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Lewis said she believes that isn't likely to happen
unless people, African-Americans especially, give more generously
to organizations such as the local association. If they don't, she
says, a cure may never come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need help,'' she says. ``Not pennies, real money.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that although about half the association's budget
comes from United Way, it must raise $108,000 this year alone just
to stay afloat. Donations help pay for testing, counseling and
education.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Lewis just tries to take one day at a time.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, when doctors thought she might die, Lewis
moved in with her mother. Two weeks ago, she returned to the
hospital after another painful episode.
</P>
<P>
   Because the episodes occur so often, she has never held a
full-time job, and even the part-time ones are only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, I'd get blood transfusions every month,''
she says. ``Now I only get them to bring me out of crisis. It's
hard, but you just live the best way you can. I have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But she does have hope that a cure will come. Not so much for
herself, but for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe not in my life,'' she says. ``But it'll happen.''

metro Atlanta _ and even after the gleaming limousine has pushed
beyond the Perimeter and penetrated Mableton, problems loom.

   As incredible as it sounds (could you nod off in Atlanta
traffic?), consider that the Osmonds are each operating on about
two hours of sleep. They've tacked this surprise visit to Cobb
County's performing arts magnet school (think ``Fame'') onto the
end of a long day near the end of an even longer, multi-city
promotional tour for their daytime talk show, their hosting duties
on Saturday night's Miss America Pageant, their ``Larry King Live''
appearance, their, well, you name it. They're so busy. So in
demand. So . I . I . dare we say it?
</P>
<P>
   So cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boys think I'm the bomb,'' Donny confirms.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old father of five sons winks while saying this,
which goes a long way toward explaining his and his sister's
resurgent appeal as a TV team. They know jaws drop whenever hip-hop
phrases like ``the bomb'' fall from their seemingly squeaky-clean
lips, or when _ as happened one memorable afternoon last year _
they welcome the likes of gangsta rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg to the
set of their show.
</P>
<P>
   ```In the best tradition of Donny and Marie, it's Snoop Doggy
Dogg!' '' Donny booms in a slightly incredulous tone moments before
the students arrive. ``That's why it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' begins its second season Monday _
which is something Howie Mandel and other, now canceled, talk show
hosts only wish they could say. More immediately, the Osmonds are
helping rescue Miss America from recent sagging TV ratings and a
series of less-than-successful host pairings that culminated in
last year's decidedly oddball coupling of ``Monday Night Football''
commentator Boomer Esiason and ``The View's'' Meredith Vieira.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing the Osmonds, pageant officials cited their family
image and youthful appeal. But that was before this week, when a
series of controversies hit the pageant. First, pageant organizers
revealed they would allow divorcees or women who'd had abortions to
compete for the crown; the resulting outcry was so immediate and
intense, the pageant now says it's reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   Another announcement, that Saturday's televised performances
would be limited to only the Top 5 talent finishers, elicited boos
from what is usually a fawning preliminary competition crowd
Tuesday night. And early Wednesday, more than 14,000 casino hotel
workers along Atlantic City's famed Boardwalk went out on strike.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it seems like anything could happen during Saturday's
live telecast of a pageant long accused of being too staid and
anachronistic. A spokeswoman for the Osmonds said they were
traveling Wednesday and unavailable for comment on the pageant
controversies. No matter. The Osmonds seem to have been practically
prescient last month when they suggested during the Mableton
interview that their collective 60-plus years of show business
experience may have been the best reason to hire them as hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's three hours of live TV and there aren't many young people
who can do live TV,'' said Marie, a mother of seven (the youngest
is just 2 months old) and a veteran of numerous Children's Miracle
Network telethons and QVC appearances. ``I think they like the age
and the wisdom of the years!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think they went through many years of trying to find
people who can relate to each other and have chemistry,'' said
Donny. ``(People) who can on-the-fly handle things having to be cut
or extended because it's live television.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nothing is ever as simple as it seems. Especially not
the devoutly Mormon Osmonds. Even before Marie's first marriage
ended in divorce when she was in her mid-20s, for instance, she'd
pretty much seen it all _ and then some.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, somebody said, `You know, you have this naive,
goody-goody image,''' she recalled, shaking her head. ``People are
naive to think that, that you can grow up in this business naive.
Most of the celebrity friends that I had growing up, my friends are
dead. And that's probably one of the reasons I stayed away from
some of that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, for a couple of supposed innocent naifs, these
two are pros. They've been up _ their wholesome variety show was
the top-rated program for several years in the mid-1970s. And
they've been down _ without a hint of self-pity, Donny will later
tell the Pebblebrook kids about having been declared a ``has-been''
at 20.
</P>
<P>
   They clearly like up better.
</P>
<P>
   They also think they know what it takes to get all the way back
there. Their talk show, which airs at 2 p.m. weekdays on WAGA,
started slowly last year, attracting a 2.2 rating locally (one
local ratings point equals 16,750 homes). By the end of last
season, however, ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' was averaging a 3.4 rating here
_ largely, the stars say, because it truly was Donny and Marie.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we tried too hard to be the perfect hosts and
memorize the scripts and say it exactly the way it should be
said,'' Donny explained. ``And Marie and I said to each other, `You
know what, this just isn't fun. We know what we've got to do, now
let's just throw it away and produce the show on the fly.'''
</P>
<P>
   For this season, that means more ``cutting edge'' musical
artists; they pride themselves on having given Britney Spears her
first national TV exposure last year. Monday's second-season
kickoff also will feature the duo's interview with the new Miss
America, taped Sunday night in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   But it also means doing what they've always done best, which is
talk. To guests, yes, but mostly to each other. And at each other,
about each other, around each other and occasionally even on top of
each other in a way more authentic than Regis and Kathie Lee, less
mean-spirited than Sonny and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to them on the traditional ``Miss America'' serenade, for
instance. Saturday night's crowning of Miss America 2000 will be
``completely different,'' they hint tantalizingly, but the old
chestnut ``There She Is'' won't disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Donny: ``The song has to stay, but it will be done in a very new
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie: ``We don't want to make it sound like it's something
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Donny (insistently): ``I won't be singing like Bert Parks, let's
put it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie (witheringly): ``Yes, he will.''
</P>
<P>
   They've been up, they've been down, and as the new millennium
beckons, Donny and Marie will be crowning Miss America.
</P>
<P>
   Donny: ``I think that says something.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess it says they're the bomb.

FALL MEANS THE RETURN OF SCHOOL _ AND ALLERGIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest bullies on the playground this fall may be grass and
ragweed.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny airborne pollens from these plants plague children,
causing them to sneeze, sniffle and cough their way through the
school day. And sometimes it's even worse: Some children with
allergies say they get teased for their watery-eyed appearance.
They feel left out, and they have problems paying attention in
school.
</P>
<P>
   Allergies, in short, are nothing to sneeze at: Twenty percent of
all children are allergic to something, and allergies account for 2
million missed school days each year. On any given school day, more
than 10,000 children stay home because of allergies, statistics
from the National Institutes of Health show.
</P>
<P>
   Allergic reactions can affect some children year-round or be
triggered by specific allergens, such as cat or dog hair. But many
allergies are seasonal. Ragweed season generally rages throughout
September, meaning that for many kids, back to school means back to
sneezing.
</P>
<P>
   What's a parent to do? Know thy enemy and its reaches, and arm
yourself with the best information on treatment. There's no cure
for allergic rhinitis, or hay fever as it's more popularly known,
but your child doesn't need to be miserable.
</P>
<P>
   KNOW THY ENEMY ALLERGENS
</P>
<P>
   Ragweed is the most common seasonal allergen in this country,
with 60 percentof all allergic people reacting to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of children are allergic to ragweed, and we always have
a lot of ragweed in this area at this time of the year,'' said Dr.
Susan Wynn, an allergist with Fort Worth Allergy and Asthma
Associates. Wynn is also a member of the national Pediatric Allergy
Collaborative, a panel of experts sponsored by the University of
Cincinnati College of Medicine. ``Ragweed season just happens to
coincide with the start of school each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ragweed might be the most obvious culprit, many other
pollens and particles can make kids sick. ``Mountain cedar, oak,
Bermuda grass, dust mites and ragweed, those are the biggies,''
Wynn says. ``Also outdoor mold spores _ especially on high-wind
days. It really depends on the person, but pollens _ trees, grasses
and weeds _ seem to cause hay fever-type symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   The physical symptoms of seasonal allergies _ sneezing, runny
nose, watery eyes, nasal congestion _ are more than just
irritations for children. They can lead to difficulty sleeping,
limited attention spans, decreased ability to concentrate, fatigue,
irritability and cognitive impairment. Symptoms can compromise a
child's performance in school, according to the Pediatric Allergy
Collaborative.
</P>
<P>
   Sneezing and wheezing can also be emotionally draining for kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disrupting class can be embarrassing and humiliating to the
child,'' Wynn says. ``I have heard of teachers making children
leave the class if they are sneezing and disrupting.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new survey by Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, the maker of Children's
NasalCrom, 201 allergic children between the ages of 6 and 13 said
their allergies interfere with their studies. In fact, 29 percent
blame at least one poor test score on allergy symptoms; 11 percent
say they have trouble completing their homework. The survey also
found that 70 percent of the allergic kids are sometimes restricted
from participating in activities such as playing with friends
because of nasal allergies, and nearly half reported social
problems, such as an inability to make friends.
</P>
<P>
   TREAT THE SYMPTOMS
</P>
<P>
   Although a cure for allergies is still elusive, allergy shots
are an effective, long-lasting treatment for many kinds of
allergies, and medications that treat the symptoms have improved
significantly since today's parents were children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mom and Dad both had allergies, they may think it is normal
to have Kleenex in hand at all times and a box of Kleenex in every
room,'' Wynn says. ``That's not normal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have these good treatments when we were growing up.
Then it was, take a Benadryl and pass out, or just suffer. A lot of
people with allergies decided it was better to sneeze and blow your
nose than fall asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what parents need to know: Allergy testing is much
faster, less painful and more reliable than ever. Over-the-counter
antihistamines are the first line of defense against allergies,
especially when drowsiness is not an issue, such as bedtime.
Allergy shots are once again in favor as the best treatment for
many types of severe allergies. Prescription medication can also
offer relief for your child. For example, pediatric versions of the
minimally sedating oral antihistamines cetirizine (pediatric
Zyrtec) and loratadine (pediatric Claritin) have been approved by
the FDA for age 6 and older, and Tylenol offers children's Tylenol
Sinus and children's Tylenol Allergy-D (an antihistimine with a
decongestant and an analgesic). The FDA also approved Flonase nasal
spray for children 4 and up in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cromolyn, best known under the brand name NasalCrom, has been
available over-the-counter the past couple of years to prevent
allergic reactions, and children's NasalCrom came onto the market
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Taken every four hours as a nasal spray, it works by stabilizing
mast cells, which release histamine in response to injury or
inflammation of tissue. It is the production of excess histamine
that causes itchy eyes, runny nose and itchy skin in an allergic
response. NasalCrom prevents the production of histamine rather
than neutralize it after it begins causing symptoms, so it is not
considered an antihistamine. It does not make users drowsy. What
parents should like about cromolyn is that it is safe and
nonaddicting. What they might like less is that it's a preventive
measure, which means you must use it before you come in contact
with an allergen. And the effects are not long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big message,'' Wynn says, ``is pay attention to your
children's allergies. If over-the-counter antihistamines and
decongestants aren't helping, ask about prescription nasal spray.
Know that there are a lot of good, safe meds available to treat
your children without a lot of side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   DON'T TRIVIALIZE THE PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons a lot of children don't get the
treatment they need for allergies, Wynn says, is that society tends
to trivialize the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the media depicts a nerdy kid, you usually give him
allergies,'' Wynn says. ``You call him a snotty-nosed kid and think
of him as whiny, weak and inferior. You tend to not take allergy
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't buy into that thinking. If your child is having symptoms
on a daily basis _ sneezing, runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, if he
seems to be tired all the time or if symptoms seem to be disrupting
schoolwork because he is up getting a tissue every 20 minutes, he
needs help, Wynn says.
</P>
<P>
   Take your sneezing, wheezing child to an allergist whose
specialty is pediatrics, and get him or her the blood or skin tests
that will help identify the allergens that are causing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Help him fight the bullies..MDBU/.MDNM/

 &HT;    Baptist group's stance on church with gays draws mixed reaction
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just as friends tend to choose sides in a divorce,
Christian leaders are rallying around the Georgia Baptist
Convention and Oakhurst Baptist Church as the two entities come to
a parting of the ways.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the executive committee of the convention voted to
sever its relationship with Oakhurst because of the church's
acceptance of homosexuality. The full state convention is expected
to ratify the decision in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for the prophetic people at Oakhurst!'' said Harry
Knox of Atlanta, director of the Georgia Equality Project, a
justice organization for gays and lesbians. ``I am so grateful to
them for giving leadership on this at great risk to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Knox, a United Methodist layman, was trained for the ministry
but has not been ordained because his denomination prohibits
practicing homosexuals from being clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Another United Methodist, Faye Short of Cornelia, praised the
Georgia Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand with them as they stand for the biblical standard
regarding homosexual practice,'' said Short, president of RENEW,
the women's branch of Good News, a conservative caucus within the
8.5-million member United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Short said her organization does not advocate mean-spiritedness
toward gays and lesbians. Rather, she said, she encourages ministry
to homosexuals that would help them change.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement prepared for the state convention, Oakhurst
members acknowledged that ``gay and lesbian Christians serve as
Sunday School teachers, choir members, deacons and preachers'' in
the church. Although the Oakhurst membership is not unanimous, the
statement said, ``we came to believe that the biblical references
to homosexual behaviors do not address the Christian commitments
and loving relationships of our gay and lesbian members.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakhurst is the first congregation to be removed from Georgia's
state convention rolls because of its stand on homosexuality, but
not the first nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the North Carolina Baptist Convention dismissed Pullen
Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh for sanctioning the blessing of
a homosexual couple and Binkley Memorial Baptist Church in Chapel
Hill for licensing a homosexual student to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some real grief involved,'' said the Rev. Randy Hall,
Pullen's youth minister. ``You've shared ministries together, built
relationships. To be kicked out is sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Pullen continues to bless same-sex unions, and as for
ordination, homosexuality ``is not a consideration anymore,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Removal from the state convention strengthened the 900-member
Pullen congregation in some ways, Hall said, ``because we took a
stand we felt we needed to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Faircloth, pastor of First Baptist Church in
Ashburn and a member of the Georgia Baptist executive committee,
would say the same thing applies to the Georgia Baptist convention.
He compared the Oakhurst decision to surgery, done cleanly and
precisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear everybody involved had been gracious and
conscientious,'' he said, ``but there comes a time when there has
to be a delineation.''
</P>
<P>
   But former Southern Baptist Bruce Garner of Atlanta, past
president of Integrity, an Episcopal organization for gays and
lesbians and their supporters, said, ``I think it's time everybody
learned it is not our business to sort and choose who belongs at
God's table. Everything I've seen indicates God's table is big
enough for everybody.''

 &HT;    Guerrilla-ballerinas take the runways by storm
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you've ever stared quizzically at the apparel in
stores or magazines and wondered what designers were thinking when
they created them, read on for a glimpse into the minds of two of
Gotham's most glorified clothiers: John Bartlett and Cynthia
Rowley.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett unveiled warm-weather collections Tuesday that were
laden with light-colored leather. Bartlett's clothes for both sexes
bared a bounty of flesh. He winked at his jet-set clientele by
accessorizing outfits with flags-of-the-nations belts. Alternately,
the clothes looked militaristic, libidinously Latin, clubby and
equestrian.
</P>
<P>
   He dubbed his spring/summer styles ``Charo Meets Che.'' And the
collection, he said, ``incites a sensual revolution teeming with
guerrilla-ballerinas and deco-dent (sic) ex-patriot heiresses ...
the collection is a call for adventure, abandonment and a good
travel agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone home, John.
</P>
<P>
   After her womenswear presentation in the New Yorker Hotel's
ballroom, Rowley had to be dragged from backstage to take a bow by
one of her models. And she offered no pre-show explanation of her
design approach.
</P>
<P>
   But she did try to emphasize the whimsical nature of her
fashions by offering don't-take-this-so-seriously descriptions of
each outfit.
</P>
<P>
   She called one asymmetrically hemmed wrap sheath made from a
patchwork of handkerchief-weight floral fabrics her ``schizophrenic
dress with painted belt.'' Her titillating `` 3/4 of a swimsuit''
was just that, if not less. And the first in a series of eight
evening gowns with fiber optic lights woven into them was dubbed
``Black Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowley really does design pretty, lighthearted clothes. But the
motives behind her merchandise still leave many in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kors: As aggravating as the all-Abba soundtrack to
Michael Kors' spring/summer preview on Wednesday was, the music
couldn't have been more fitting. Front-to-back and back-to-front,
Kors' collection was divine.
</P>
<P>
   The men's and women's outfits modeled were dedicated to his
moneyed South Florida constituency, which golfs, plays tennis,
hosts parties and lounges poolside. To Kors, spring signals the
time for sun worshipping; and his white, pale green, yellow,
tangerine and coral clothes were ideally suited for his skin-baring
silhouettes. Skirts were either short or slit sinfully high. Shorts
and bikini briefs were hard to distinguish from one another. Tops
showcased the models' chests, arms and shoulders. Cushy cashmeres,
translucent lace and luxuriant leathers were Kors' materials of
choice. Animal rights activists might protest the designer's
outlandish use of cowhide, but his laced leather pants and dresses
were still wonders to behold.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren: Any designer with a vision as resolute as Ralph
Lauren's should be forced to design collections with one eye closed
or an arm tied behind his back. The man may not experiment much,
but he's awfully darned good at what he does. Lauren doesn't design
so much as he refines; and his spring/
</P>
<P>
   summer 2000 womenswear collection further updates his great
American sportswear aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   This time, his aim was to simplify: Except for a few ruffled
skirts and fringed pants and jackets, everything looked slim, sleek
and oh-so-modern. To make wardrobing easier, he mainly restricted
his colorations to red, black, white and navy and his patterns to
checks, stripes and polka dots. There were lots of lavish leathers
in the form of bikinis, jeans, jackets and blouses. The crowd's
reaction to the collection was so enthusiastic that Lauren
high-fived his wife and children after the show.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta note: Jeffrey Kalinsky's latest emporium is the toast of
New York. Recently opened in the suddenly chic meatpacking
district, Jeffrey New York is getting plenty of fashion press ink
as the hot spot to shop. The designer responsible for Jil Sander,
Jeffrey Atlanta and Bob Ellis Shoes at Phipps Plaza has made his
store both a place to see and be seen. Celebs who have wandered
amid the finery since it opened in August include Luther Vandross,
Kevin Costner and Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

   Hilfiger goes patriotic and country-rock to boot
</P>
<P>
   By A. Scott Walton
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tommy Hilfiger described the men's and women's
clothes he previewed Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden as
``one part country and one part rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   That's apt, if only because all 70 of the spring/summer outfits
he unveiled _ to deafening, live accompaniment by the
alternative-rock band Bush _ were accessorized with red, white and
blue cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   But where within the rock-country continuum will his crucial (if
not core) constituency of hip-hop youth fit in? Only time, and
retail figures, will tell.
</P>
<P>
   After the extravagant, super model-studded show, actor Samuel L.
Jackson said of Hilfiger's wild, western-style jeans, ``I can't
wear stars on my (backside). People might think I was conceited.''
</P>
<P>
   The jeans _ rendered in leather, snakeskin and tropical weight
mohair _ were embroidered, lasered, studded, fringed and beaded to
the point of excess. Only Hilfiger's tube tops and cashmere
T-shirts escaped his ``Viva Las Vegas'' treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Flames shot up the legs of jeans held up by rodeo-buckled belts.
Cowpoke cross-stitching covered the seams of shirts, vests and
jackets. The lapels and shoulders of men's suits were top-stitched
in a way not seen since Roy Rogers ruled the movies. Some printed
silk skirts and dresses Hilfiger sent out bore an uncanny
resemblance to bandanas.
</P>
<P>
   On women, who are allowed more freedom to dress flamboyantly,
the clothes looked refreshing and realistic. On men, they tended to
look a bit costumey.
</P>
<P>
   It was at once a tribute to rockabilly culture and a cheer for
the cult of Tommy: tops, bottoms and accessories were all
emblazoned with his logos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The silhouettes in this collection, like the exaggerated boot
leg pant, could be Jim Morrison or they could be Lenny Kravitz,''
Hilfiger said. ``They were cool then and it's the new details and
the new fabrications that make them cool now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the show if he thought hip-hoppers would hitch their
wagons to the rock-western look, three-piece-suited rapper-producer
Wyclef Jean replied: ``Well, I was looking at those white leather
pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the spirit of the collection,'' he added. ``It felt
like rock 'n' roll. Jimi Hendrix went for that look in his day. So
why shouldn't I?''

   CEDARHURST, N.Y. _ They walk to their Orthodox synagogues on the
Sabbath, where men and women are separated in prayer. But as the
adults worship, their sons and daughters, in the temple lobby,
trade Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   They follow the dietary laws, in center hall Colonials and Wall
Street boardrooms. But that often means business lunches at haute
kosher restaurants and birthday parties catered by Pious Pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Cedarhurst and the rest of the Five Towns on Long Island have
been a citadel of Jewish suburbia for generations and a stronghold
of Orthodoxy for more than a decade. But the new wave of young
families _ men who both pray and pump iron before work, women with
a cell phone at their ear and a baby at their breast, youngsters in
rollerblades and yarmulkes _ are inventing a style of Jewish life
that blends the rituals of Orthodoxy with the rituals of the mall,
the gym and the Long Island Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   This is the holiest time of the year for Jews, as they prepare
for the Yom Kippur holiday Sunday night, and these 20- and
30-somethings are their parents' equals or betters in piety. But
for this age group of observant Jews, whose influx from communities
like Forest Hills and Flatbush has swelled synagogue membership,
sent real estate soaring and inspired a spate of new businesses,
religion has become an intriguing mix of the sacred and the
mundane.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, Judaism has struggled to find its place
in modern America, looking for balance between participation and
isolation. That dilemma has been especially intense for Orthodox
Jews, some of whom have tried to meld Orthodox ritual with modern
life and some of whom have seen any accommodation as a betrayal of
Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   So while sectarian Jews might find this hybrid lifestyle
hopelessly inconsistent, other Jewish leaders see it as the
flowering of Modern Orthodoxy, which asks its followers to abide by
God's word while living in God's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``God did not create this world for us to escape, but as a place
to live,'' said Rabbi Robert Hirt, vice president of rabbinic
studies at Yeshiva University. ``The question is not whether to
live in the world but how.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirt said that ``knowing how to act in the synagogue is not a
test of commitment.'' Rather, ``the test of a religious person,''
and the ``more complicated and interesting challenge'' is to be a
good Jew in the business world or on the ball field.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Kaufman, 32, a vice president at a major Wall Street
investment bank, said this brand of Modern Orthodoxy, which also
has vibrant outposts in Teaneck, N.J., Oak Park, Mich. and
University Heights, Ohio, is the best of both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   He wakes at dawn, dons the tefillin that Orthodox men wear to
daven in morning prayer and goes to the synagogue to offer thanks
for the return of his soul, which overnight has been in God's
keeping. On Friday, he counts the minutes until sundown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Shabbos more than anything,'' he said. ``It's like a
special battery pack you get to put on. It's essential
psychologically, especially in the society we live in, which moves
way too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kaufman also has the thrill of closing a deal and the bounty
that brings. He and his family vacation in the Bahamas, with food
brought from home. And he entertains clients at the Haikara Grill,
which Zagat, the restaurant guide, says is so good you can't tell
it's kosher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I participate to the nth degree,'' Kaufman said of his
demanding religion. ``But I'm also a value-added member of the
greater society, whether it be Wall Street or Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   To be so openly in the world, with all its temptations, poses
knotty problems, grist for a Talmudic scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Take Starbucks coffee as an example, which has hung its
ubiquitous shingle on Central Avenue here. This is an easy one for
Kaufman, who is not a coffee drinker, but an issue much debated
here.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is over whether a food item is ``conceptually
kosher'' or ``officially kosher,'' Kaufman said. Starbucks labels
its one-pound bags as certifiably kosher, but not the bulk coffee
used for each cup. ``But with coffee, what could be wrong?''
Kaufman asked, taking the conceptual approach. ``The only issue is
the preparatory process. We know they didn't put lard in it. But
for some people even a 1 percent risk is too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Such close calls are familiar to Faye Markovitch. She is the
35-year-old daughter of a rabbi, the owner of a designer clothing
store here and the mother of two. ``We are not living life
haphazardly,'' Ms. Markovitch said. ``Every day there's a decision
to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   When her daughter, at 5, wanted to dress like one of the Spice
Girls, Ms. Markovitch told her ``not everything is for everybody,''
but let her keep watching MTV. When her son, at 7, rebelled at
covering his head with a yarmulke while eating, she let him
substitute a baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaufmans and Markovitches are among thousands of young
families who have flocked to the Five Towns recently, following in
the footsteps of the Orthodox who came here a dozen years ago and
built an infrastructure of shuls, religious day schools and kosher
merchants that rival Borough Park in Brooklyn or Monsey in Rockland
County, north of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest arrivals, unlike their more sectarian
predecessors, are not somber men and women in tall black hats and
long skirts heavy as drapery. They choose the corset of Orthodoxy.
But they wear it in their own way.

</P>
<P>
   Their wants and needs are vivid when it comes to real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The first requirement is proximity to worship, either at a
synagogue or what is known as a shtiebel, a private house where
devotees of a certain rabbi gather. Since Orthodox Jews can not
drive on the Sabbath, most home buyers want to be within a mile of
their temple. They also want to live within a designated area,
known as the eruv, where rabbinic decree says that Orthodox Jews
are allowed to push baby strollers or carry certain essential items
on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   The next requirement is more than three bedrooms for their large
families. Then a formal dining room, for Sabbath dinners. That
would have satisfied their parents, who were generally less
prosperous and less influenced by media images of the good life.
But postings on a bulletin board at one Orthodox synagogue here
show a taste for luxury. Some of the houses for sale boast cedar
closets, stone fireplaces and cathedral ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Realtors have learned to service their new clientele. Just as
maps of earthquake faults hang at real estate agencies in San
Francisco, maps of the growing eruv, and its latest proposed
extension, are displayed at Pugatch Realty here. Agents distribute
a guidebook called ``Shalom Five Towns'' and offer advice on how to
add a bedroom by building above the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Inventory is scarce. In Lawrence, huge houses are being torn
down to build even huger ones. In Cedarhurst and Woodmere, more
modest communities, houses that went for $400,000 two years ago now
sell for $600,000. Streets that had only one Orthodox family a few
years back now have only one family that is not Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   Synagogues are booming. Young Israel of Woodmere, one of 11
Orthodox shuls in the Five Towns, added a new wing and more than 80
families this year. But the more impressive growth, untallied, is
in the shtiebels, which open weekly, to the consternation of
non-Orthodox neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish day schools thrive. The Hebrew Academy of Long Beach, for
instance, one of the magnets for the Orthodox when they first came
here, began as an elementary school but has added a high school for
girls in Hewlett Bay Park and one for boys in Lawrence, with total
enrollment growing from 500 to 1300. Each expansion produces
intense, if short-lived, opposition, as with the shtiebels.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the influx of Orthodox Jews caused many secular
merchants to abandon Central Avenue, for decades the shopping mecca
on the South Shore of Long Island. Glatt kosher food stores and
Judaica shops took their place, but the street was gap-toothed with
empty storefronts. Two years ago, the few remaining non-Orthodox
merchants felt compelled to buy ads at Christmas saying they were
open on Saturdays, quelling rumors to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   But Central Avenue has a new wave of tenants now, including
chains like the Gap and Victoria's Secret, along with high-end
businesses catering to the Yuppie Orthodox. They include Yali's wig
store, owned by 26-year-old Yali Luss, wife of a day trader, which
has been open a year, sells $3,000 wigs and is already expanding.
Similarly, Jass Designs, owned by Suri and Steve Brody, has
branched out from high-fashion hats to maternity clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Club Central, a downtown gym, epitomizes the entreprenurial
spirit here. It is run by Skye and Eric Roberts, but is the
brainchild of a wealthy Orthodox woman from Lawrence, their silent
partner, who knows first hand the needs of her customers.
</P>
<P>
   So Club Central holds all-female classes in rooms sealed from
view by venetian blinds. There even the most observant women can
shed their wigs and wear sports bras. Plus, the gym is open
Saturday night, from 9 p.m. to midnight, for those who want to
exercise after sundown.
</P>
<P>
   But suburban plenty does not replace charity for these young
Jews, who say that at least 10 percent of their income goes to
tzedaka, as it is known in Hebrew. But Rabbi Kenneth Hain of
Congregation Beth Sholom, who preaches in the wealthy community of
Lawrence, said he is vigilant for the ``sin of shallowness'' even
as he permits co-ed dancing and strapless dresses at temple
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of shallowness haunts these families. One
businessman, asking that his name not be used to keep his religious
practices private, said he agonized about not wearing a yarmulke at
work. One rabbinic interpretation says that removing it is
permitted if it effects one's livelihood. But the businessman
remained unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole kepot thing,'' he said, using the Hebrew word for
yarmulke. ``It makes me worry about looking like a stereotypic Jew
who will do anything for a buck. I tell myself that I don't want to
put nonreligious people in an uneasy situation. But maybe I'm just
a mercenary.''
</P>
<P>
   He starts to describe his decision as a compromise, but balks:
``I hate that word. I just want to be thoughtful about what I do.
And about this, I don't think God cares.''
</P>

ECONOMIC SCENE: SOARING YEN THREATENS JAPAN MORE THAN U.S.

 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How's this for the next big American disaster scenario? The
dollar, which has been sliding relentlessly against the Japanese
yen all summer and hit a 43-month low Wednesday, continues to fall.
</P>
<P>
   A lower dollar, by driving up the price of imports and
threatening higher inflation, provokes the Federal Reserve to
increase interest rates to try to deflect the threat. That spooks
foreign investors, prompting them to pull their money out of U.S.
investments, letting the air out of inflated stock prices on Wall
Street. Consumers, worried about their portfolios, pull back on
spending, and the U.S. economy falls into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds scary, right? But for all the popular fears raised by a
falling currency, the direct threat to the U.S. economy is actually
quite small.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the threat to Japan from a stronger currency
_ by making its exports more expensive even as its economy teeters
on the edge of deflation while barely crawling out of recession _
is far more grave. It should be reassuring that Japan has all the
financial resources and monetary tools it needs to keep its economy
growing and spare everyone else pain. But its central bankers
remain frighteningly passive and unwilling to use them.
</P>
<P>
   The yen began to soar early this summer after the
recession-plagued Japanese economy suddenly showed signs of life.
Sensing a turnaround in sunken stock and real estate prices,
foreign investors bought yen, driving its value higher, so they
could reenter Japanese financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the dollar's woes is the overhang of a huge trade
deficit that has reached, according to data released this week, a
rate of more than $300 billion a year. The excessive outflow of
dollars accompanying the trade deficit could eventually force the
dollar down. That prospect may already be persuading foreign
investors to lighten up their holdings of American assets. The
dollar fell from about 120 yen in early summer to around 104
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in the greenback against the yen affects the pocketbooks
of American consumers, who must fork over more dollars to buy
Toyota minivans or Toshiba laptops. But the impact on the economy
of current slide against the yen is minimal because the dollar has
not dropped against most other major currencies. Over the past
several months, the dollar fell by an average of only about 2
percent against other currencies, according to Federal Reserve
data. The impact is further diluted by the fact that imports
account for less than 15 percent of national spending.
</P>
<P>
   It might also be argued that a lower dollar can even do some
good. Surely exporters think so. But there will probably be little
long-term benefit from higher export sales. The Fed is currently on
a campaign to slow the economy because it thinks spending is
growing at an unsustainably high rate. If exports pick up, the Fed
will be no doubt clamp down a bit harder to offset any unwelcome
stimulus.
</P>
<P>
   But if a sliding dollar is little direct threat to the United
States, the same is not true of the risk a swelling yen poses for
Japan. Despite having a government that is running a huge fiscal
deficit of nearly 10 percent of gross domestic product and has
pumped nearly $200 billion into commercial banks to get them
lending money again, the Japanese economy grew at a paltry 1
percent annual rate between April and June.
</P>
<P>
   ``A further blow to export sales from a rising yen hardly
helps,'' said Rudi Dornbusch, an economics professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem is that Japan suffers from insufficient
domestic spending, causing deflation.
</P>
<P>
   So what is to be done? The ultimate solution, many economists
say, is to print money _ lots of money. The idea, says Professor
Alan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University and an adviser to the
Bank of Japan, is to print enough money to stop prices from falling
any further. The extra yen will also dampen the rise in the yen.
</P>
<P>
   But having brought lending rates down to near zero, the Japanese
say that they have already pushed monetary policy as far as it can
go. Meltzer vehemently disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with interest rates near zero, monetary policy is not
dead,'' he said. The Bank of Japan can, he explains, still use its
infinite supply of yen to buy bonds, stocks and real estate. Buying
dollars would push down the value of the yen, promoting exports.
And buying assets would drive up the price of stocks and other
forms of wealth, another good way to generate consumer spending.
The upshot is that despite near-zero interest rates, Japan's
monetary policy is still too tight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Bank of Japan dithers. Indeed, over the weekend, a
prominent monetary official stated that the Bank would not throw a
lot more yen into the economy even as it intervened in the currency
market, at its government's instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan is, in the parlance of economics, engaged in
``sterilized'' intervention. It is temporarily buying dollars and
selling yen, hoping to stop the yen's rise. But at the same time it
is siphoning yen out of the domestic money market to keep the
overall supply of yen pretty much unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have continually sterilized intervention,'' said Bank of
Japan Governor Masaru Hayami this week, ``because we have provided
ample funds to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Most economists argue that sterilized intervention, because it
keeps the relative supplies of yen and dollars constant, cannot
change the relative value of the currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another reason to dismiss the importance of sterilized
interventions. According to the most recent worldwide survey, taken
in 1998, about $1.5 trillion of foreign currency trades took place
every day, of which about $300 billion involve the yen. But the
sterilized intervention by the Bank of Japan amounts to only a
couple of billion dollars' worth.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the Japanese will not aggressively address the soaring value
of the yen, will the Clinton administration? Probably not, and for
good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has made clear that it will not alter its
monetary policy solely to manage the value of foreign currencies.
Few economists would disagree with that policy. But that leaves the
administration with only sterilized intervention itself, which will
do no more good on this side of the Pacific Ocean than on Japan's
side. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers constantly reminds
investors, as did his predecessor, Robert Rubin, that the Clinton
administration favors a strong dollar. But he has limited tools to
pursue that specific goal.
</P>
<P>
   There is however, little cause for despair. Limited tools do not
mean no tools. Indeed, in the worst case, where speculative frenzy
begins to drive the dollar to worrisome levels, Summers' use of
well-timed sterilized interventions could be decisive in altering
the mood of market participants.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Alan S. Blinder of Princeton, and a former vice
chairman of the Federal Reserve, explains that the long-run value
of the dollar versus the yen largely depends on economic
fundamentals, like the relative growth rates, interest rates and
prices in the two countries. For example, stronger growth in one
country tends to attract capital from a country with weaker growth.
And a rise in interest rates in the United States relative to rates
in Japan would encourage investors to buy dollars to invest in
United States financial markets, driving up the value of the dollar
relative to the yen.
</P>
<P>
   But day-to-day exchange rates are driven by investor
expectations and speculators. The day-to-day rates can, says
Blinder, depart from long-run fundamentals by wide margins and for
prolonged periods.
</P>
<P>
   There is, he says, ``Blinder's law'' of speculative markets.
``Markets normally move in the right direction,'' he said, ``but
they exaggerate the magnitude by a factor of between 3 and 10.''
His point is that markets with speculators overreact and well-timed
intervention by governments can move exchange rates closer to their
proper levels, minimizing dislocation to exporters and importers.
</P>
<P>
   Dornbusch agrees. Nothing about economic fundamentals justified
pushing the yen to 80 to the dollar in 1995, he said, and nothing
would justify pushing it much below its current level. If the rate
drops lower than 100, he says, timely intervention by Summers and
his counterparts in Tokyo could scare investors from pursuing their
extreme expectations. The purpose of intervention is to make
speculators bear the risk of betting the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened speculators might not be so quick to push the yen to
90 from 100 if they believe that the lower rate is not sustainable
in the long run and that Tokyo and Washington are committed to
keeping it from going that low in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   So while the major onus for straightening out the dollar-yen
exchange rate lies in Tokyo, the Clinton administration is not
defenseless in the wake of Japanese monetary authorities who resist
doing what should come easy and cheap: turning on their printing
press.  &QL;

DEFENSE QUESTIONS EVIDENCE GATHERING IN DRAGGING-DEATH TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ Attorneys defending a white supremacist accused
in last year's dragging death of a disabled black man in Jasper
tried Wednesday to cast doubt on how investigators collected
evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-examining a dozen Jasper County lawmen and FBI agents,
lawyers for capital murder defendant Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr.
questioned who picked up and bagged each piece of evidence, what
training and experience they had and why some of the investigators
failed to change their gloves after handling each item.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick, pick, pick,'' Jasper County District Attorney Guy James
Gray said during a break in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   He said the defense was using a common tactic to make the jury
question whether the evidence could have been contaminated. But the
prosecutor insisted the evidence is solid and said the jury would
have to ignore the sworn testimony of several witnesses to conclude
that it was tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cops make mistakes, lawyers make mistakes, everybody makes
mistakes. I wouldn't pretend every single thing is done
perfectly,'' he said when jurors were excused for the day. ``But
these guys were so thorough and they worked so hard picking all
this stuff up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real proud of our Jasper guys,'' he added. ``They picked
it up, labeled it, did a good job.``
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers Doug Barlow and Layne Walker of Beaumont have
declined to comment on their defense strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than an hour Wednesday morning, Walked grilled
Jasper police detective Curtis Frame, seemingly questioning whether
a particular cigarette butt that Frame testified he recovered from
the crime scene could have instead come from a search of the
apartment of Brewer's co-defendant John William ``Bill'' King, or
from the search of another defendant's pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Frame insisted he had picked up the cigarette butt from a rural
logging road in the woods east of Jasper where prosecutors say
Brewer, King and Shawn Allen Berry beat and stripped James Byrd
Jr., chained him by his ankles to a pickup and then dragged him
more than two miles to his death early June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, prosecutors plan to call a DNA expert from the FBI
to testify that Brewer's genetic blueprint was discovered on a
cigarette butt and a Bud Light bottle recovered from the crime
scene, and that Byrd's blood was on Brewer's tennis shoe found in
the apartment search.
</P>
<P>
   Frame remained calm and smiled at the jury as Walker repeatedly
pressed him to describe exactly how he picked up each piece of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not that hard,'' Frame finally said. ``If you pick
an item up and put it in the bag, you've accomplished what you set
out to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Walker asked how Frame could presume that a certain
brown stain on the ground was blood, he answered: ``I've seen a lot
of blood, Layne. It's like if I ask you, is that water or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Frame testified that when he arrived at Huff Creek Road
the morning Byrd's dismembered body was discovered outside a rural
black cemetery, it was obvious to him from marks in the road that
something had been dragged.
</P>
<P>
   A long trail of what appeared to be flesh and blood and drag
marks ``went back and forth on this asphalt road from side to side
to the point where the body had slung off to the side so it struck
a culvert and ripped its head off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frame also was the officer who was called to inspect Berry's
pickup after he was stopped on a traffic violation the night after
Byrd's killing.
</P>
<P>
   Frame said the truck appeared to be clean, but when he looked
beneath it he saw clumps of dirt and fresh grass stuck underneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laid down under the truck and saw some red stains I
recognized as blood,'' he said, adding that he did a chemical test
to be certain. ``It showed positive.''
</P>
<P>
   In King's trial, DNA testing showed the blood belonged to Byrd,
49, whom witnesses said they saw riding in the back of the pickup
in the early morning hours of that day.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying Wednesday were numerous investigators who
collected or transported evidence, a nurse from a Jasper hospital
who went to the jail to draw blood samples from the three
defendants and a mortician from the Jefferson County Morgue in
Beaumont, who took blood, bile and urine samples from Byrd's corpse
and turned them over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of five women and nine men appeared attentive
throughout the day's slow, plodding testimony, as did Brewer, who
sat at the defense table, looking at the evidence and consulting
with his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boring, boring day,'' Gray said outside the courthouse. ``But
it's part of the law and you've got to do it. Pick up this little
piece of evidence and label it and carry it and who'd you give it
to or how'd you get it to the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think the jury paid a whole lot of attention to
all that chain of custody stuff,'' he added. ``All they wanted to
know is somebody picked it up somewhere and it got to the lab.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of capital murder, Brewer, 32, would face life in
prison or death by injection.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, was convicted and sentenced to death earlier this
year. Berry, also 24, will be tried later in his home town of
Jasper.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Agim Selmanaj, 27, a construction worker, knows he
must go back to work soon. It has been two months since he returned
from war in Kosovo, and finding a job should be easy _ there are
plenty of grateful Albanian-American businessmen who would hire
him.
</P>
<P>
   But he is tired. ``I saw a lot of no-good things over there,''
he said. ``My friends tell me I look sad all the time. I feel good,
not killing anymore, not burning houses. I just want to relax a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Fadil Idrizi, a Manhattan restaurant manager, returned from
Kosovo a big man in the Albanian-American community. When he joined
the Kosovo Liberation Army, they made him a commander; he went on
to lead a battalion of 480 guerrillas during weeks of battle.
</P>
<P>
   Now everybody wants to talk to him. But he has been ducking
parties and avoiding acquaintances. He hates all the questions.
``They ask, What did I do over there?'' he said. ``But what they
want to know is, `How many Serbs did you kill?'''
</P>
<P>
   Every Albanian-American knows about Haxji Dervisholli, whose
right foot was blown off by a grenade. Many American volunteers saw
the explosion and remember it with horror. ``I was screaming, `Look
what they did to my friend!''' Selmanaj recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But Dervisholli himself sounds matter-of-fact. ``I got up and
stopped the blood,'' he said. ``I tied rags tightly. They carried
me up a sheer, straight cliff. Grenades were being thrown at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon he will be fitted with a permanent prosthesis. His plans,
he said, are firm. ``I want to go to Pristina. I want to see my
family. Maybe I stay forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, these men were among 80 Albanian-Americans from the
New York area who volunteered to fight with the Kosovo Liberation
Army, flush with patriotism and dispatched with speeches, cheers
and weeping. ``I was very, very happy to go and serve in the army
for my country,'' said Selmanaj, echoing sentiments his fellow
soldiers expressed before embarking on their crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them have since returned, drifting home over the summer
after the Yugoslavians began withdrawing their troops in June. Some
are back in the Bronx, others in Brooklyn and Westchester _ all
heroes in the coffee shops, bars and living rooms of tight-knit
Albanian-American communities hungry for tales of bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the transition has not been an easy one for a group that
went to war emboldened more with passion than military knowledge.
The group left with romantic visions of saving their homeland and
returned with troubling memories of killing and dead bodies, of
dodging shells and shots.
</P>
<P>
   As they go back to their old jobs, or are looking for new ones _
as waiters, doormen, stockbrokers, students _ many are finding it
hard to resettle into civilian life.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought war would be somewhat like the movies,'' Florim
Lajqi, a student at John Jay College who fought with the KLA, said
as he and other volunteers gathered in the Gurra Cafe in the
Belmont section of the Bronx. ``But you don't see people getting
shot up and blown up and grenaded around you in the movies. I had
never seen a dead body before. I realized, `Oh, my God, I could get
killed any minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other volunteers was a 16-year-old high-school girl
from Brooklyn and two men who were pushing 60. A third, Avdyl
Gashi, was 73, though he told the local KLA recruiter he was only
59. Most had never even handled a gun. And about 20 of them
eventually deserted the battalion, Idrizi said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   They were given a month to become soldiers. At the rebel
training camp in Albania, they were trained in basic combat
procedures _ how to load and shoot a gun, defuse a mine, take cover
from shelling. About 2,500 volunteers from many countries were
crowded into the camp, and for days the rations consisted of bread
and onions.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Abrahams, a researcher for the nonprofit Human Rights
Watch, encountered some of the volunteers in May, when he was in
Kosovo. ``Two things amazed me,'' he said recently. ``Their
willingness to put their lives on the line to _ in their words _
free their homeland. And their total lack of military experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were quickly pegged as spoiled, arrogant and out
of shape, said Florin Krasniqi, a Brooklyn businessman who raised
money to send the group overseas and who visited the training camp.
``They don't listen,'' he said. ``They want good food. They want a
shower.'' Idrizi, who had served in the Yugoslavian army for more
than a year and was trained as a sharpshooter, was one of the few
Americans who knew what he was getting into.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in with different things in their mind,'' he said.
``War works completely differently. You do not make a soldier in
two or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Idrizi had his hands full with his recalcitrant colleagues. ``In
the army you have to walk in line,'' said Idrizi, who cajoled,
reasoned with and scolded the volunteers. ``These guys don't want
to walk in line. I say, `Get in line. Turn right. Turn left. Come
on, guys, you have to do it. You have to follow the rules.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The destination of the Atlantic Battalion, as the Americans and
other foreign volunteers under Idrizi were known, was Mount
Pashtrikut, a remote region on the border of southwest Kosovo.
According to the American volunteers, they camped there and fought
the Serbian forces for nearly a month. According to Idrizi, about
4,500 rebel guerrillas were stretched along a 10-mile range, facing
an unknown, but at least equal number of Serbians at close range.
</P>
<P>
   There were no journalists or other outside witnesses at the
Mount Pashtrikut battlefront. But Fatmir Lima, the senior KLA
commander who is now the deputy defense minister of the provisional
government, confirmed that the Americans were involved in combat
and, when the Serbians tried to take Mount Pashtrikut, participated
in a 10-day battle to hold it. The American volunteers, he added,
were better fighters than he had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought those boys and girls would find it very hard to
adapt to war conditions,'' said Lima. ``But I was pleasantly
surprised by their attitude and strong will. They adjusted very
fast to fighting conditions. They showed bravery on the
battlefield.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The mere presence of Americans on the battlefront boosted the
morale of the long-time guerrillas, he said. ``The first thing was
that they gave up everything they had on the other side of the
Atlantic to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the odds, nobody in the Atlantic battalion was killed,
according to Idrizi and other volunteers. The rebels took to
calling them ``the lucky Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Under fire, the Americans shaped up, said Idrizi. ``Our guys
learned so fast, so quick. There was lots of shooting. They saw the
wounded. They took it seriously. They kept their heads down.''
</P>
<P>
   The hike up Mount Pashtrikut took 8 hours. The bivouac, where
they remained for a month, was a rocky, treeless mountainside edged
by a forest. The volunteers had no tents. They dug trenches for
cover and bunkers _ stones piled in a circle _ to sleep in. It took
three hours to haul food and water from the storage side.
</P>
<P>
   Ilmi Berisha, a 29-year-old waiter from Brooklyn, said
volunteers boasted during boot camp about not being scared. ``But
when we get to the front,'' he said. ``I'm scared. Every time they
shell us, I'm scared.'' He actually felt safer as a spy on Serbian
territory, he said. ``No shelling.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Selmanaj said he had to force himself to shoot. ``I
saw something moving and I thought, `Oh, damn, let me just shoot
there.' Then they started shooting, too. I didn't really want to
kill somebody. But when I think what they do to us, torturing,
burning, I said, I have to do it. After two or three days. I didn't
really care.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the war's end, the volunteers made their way to Pristina
where NATO officials ordered them to hand in their weapons. Some
remained; other split off, searching for relatives and defusing
mines in rural areas. Lajqi said there were a few times he
protected Serbian residents from attacks by local rebels. But after
seeing the destruction of the house he was born he, he later
admitted torching the abandoned home of Serbian collaborators.
``I'd seen a lot of dead people and houses burned and I was going
crazy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to several Americans, Adrin Graatch, a volunteer from
the Bronx, was arrested by NATO for beating a Serbian man to death
in a Pristina restaurant but was just released.
</P>
<P>
   Ukaj said that as far as he knows, no other Americans were
involved in property destruction or attacks on Serbian civilians.
``We were busy trying to find our families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they are home again, the volunteers are heroes to
Albanian-Americans. Troubling memories become jumbled with the
cries of praise and the kisses and exclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Some volunteers are trying to forget, but others love the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls,'' said Berisha, who is married, ``go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of ex-girlfriends are calling,'' concurred Lajqi, who is
single. He is making back-to-back dates in order to squeeze them
all in. At home, he said, he has had numerous visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty people are listening to you tell your stories,'' he
said. ``You're the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Idrizi wants to forget, but some of his men are not ready to let
him. Late one night a few weeks ago, he meet with some of them
during a regular weekly gathering over drinks and talk. When he
walked in, they rose and saluted. When they spoke, they called him
``commander.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said no,'' said Idrizi. ``Not here. I am one of you now.''

CLINTON PUSHES HUMANITARIAN AID FOR EAST TIMOR 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand _ Expressing fears that more East
Timorese could die of starvation, President Clinton pressed
Indonesia on Wednesday to allow humanitarian aid into the province
and to renew efforts to stop the continued violence against
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations early Wednesday approved plans for an
international force, led by Australia, to restore security in East
Timor, where pro-Indonesian militias have run amok since last
month's independence vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the Indonesian military, accused of supporting the militia
bloodshed, has been holding up plans to drop food and medical
supplies to East Timor residents forced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he wanted to see the peacekeeping force move
into the Indonesian province within days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to receive reports of violence and intimidation,
which Indonesia has a responsibility to prevent. And also,
Indonesia has a responsibility to allow relief organizations access
to the refugees now,'' Clinton said during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said many East Timorese are ``still vulnerable to
attack. Many have fled their homes; many are short of food _ not
only those who have left the country, but those who are displaced
within East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters
that Pentagon officials were working with the White House on
details of the U.S. commitment to the peacekeeping force. Cohen
said information about specific units being deployed to East Timor
should emerge ``within the next day or so.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the troops _ possibly 7,000 _ likely will come from
the Australian and Malaysian militaries. France plans to send 500
soldiers, helicopters and an assault landing ship. Canada, New
Zealand, the Philippines, Portugal, Singapore and Thailand are
likely to contribute troops.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States will airlift 300,000 humanitarian
rations to Darwin, Australia, where food supplies will be stored
until Indonesian officials approve dropping the meals over East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies estimate hundreds of civilians were killed by
pro-Jakarta militias upset after the East Timorese overwhelmingly
voted for independence Aug. 30. More than 200,000 people were
rousted from their homes as thousands were forced into West Timor
or into the mountains of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sited the international effort to assemble a
peacekeeping force for East Timor as one of the successes of the
Asia Pacific Economic Conference forum held in Auckland earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wrapped up a weeklong trip here with an official state
visit with Prime Minister Jenny Shipley. He will return to
Washington early Thursday &UR;  &LR; , cutting short a planned golf outing in
Hawaii because of Hurricane Floyd. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Australians, who have taken the lead in convening the
security troops, will provide the largest contribution, 2,000
soldiers for a force of 8,000. The United States will provide
troops for logistics such as airlifts, communications, intelligence
and engineering work.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials made the rounds of Capitol Hill Wednesday
to bolster support for the U.S. role. Richard Holbrooke, the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, met with Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and several other senior lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution supporting the multinational force and commending
Australia for its role cleared the House International Relations
subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Shipley and Clinton praised the work of APEC, which
embraced a round of talks on global free trade that will begin in
Seattle in November. Clinton also said he was ``neither optimistic
nor pessimistic'' about a timetable for reaching an agreement with
China for its entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   China wants special concessions to protect some closed sectors
of its economy. The WTO would require China to play by
international trade rules. Clinton said the United States and China
had only a couple of issues outstanding but it was a decision China
must make if it wants WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations renewed their WTO talks during the APEC session.
Negotiations had been suspended following the mistaken bombing of
Beijing's embassy in Yugoslavia by a U.S. warplane.

 &HT;    N.C. residents seeking shelter
 &HT;    By Nancy McGillicuddy and Gene Metrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. _ As Hurricane Floyd tore into eastern
North Carolina, about 1,200 residents were expected to seek refuge
in shelters across the Twin Counties.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Lisa Richardson vacated her trailer Wednesday in
Nashville, N.C., and was among the first at the Red Cross shelter
at Northern Nash High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so nervous after Fran and Bonnie _ I didn't want to go
through the same thing,'' she said. ``They said 125 mph winds _
there was no way I was staying in the trailer.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, a 1983 graduate of the school, brought with her only
a bag of food, a blanket, water and her Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay here until the storm blows over,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross began delivering supplies to shelter sites at 4
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first disaster,'' said volunteer Elizabeth Whitford
of Nashville while unloading cots and blankets from the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross officials said they were expecting several hundred
people at each of the shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to estimate just how many people will come,'' said
Diana Burger, a Red Cross volunteer who is helping operate the
shelters. ``Right now, we are prepared for 200-300 per shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash County has four shelters staffed by the Salvation Army and
the Red Cross _ Benvenue Elementary, Southern Nash Junior High,
Northern Nash Senior High and Southern Nash Senior High schools.
Edgecombe County has three Red Cross shelters set up at Parker
Middle School in Rocky Mount, Martin Middle School in Tarboro and
Carver Elementary School in Pinetops.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get more (people), we'll open up more shelters,'' Burger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 people had already arrived at Benvenue Elementary
School 30 minutes before the shelter was scheduled to open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get here early,'' said Pam Vick of Edgecombe
County, who came to the shelter with her husband, John, and two
daughters, Matilda, 15, and Lucy, 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seeing the news and watching all the cars leaving the
coast, we didn't want to get stuck in something like that here,''
John said. ``We thought we had better play it safe _ I don't want
to take any chances with the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick said he had received notice not to come in for his
third-shift job at Abbott Laboratories because the plant was
reportedly closing at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there for 22 years, and this is the first time I can
remember them shutting down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those taking refuge were told to bring a pillow, blanket, any
prescription medications and toys for small children. Babies should
have a three-day supply of diapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we are looking to stay open until Friday,''
Burger said. ``But it depends on what Floyd wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army's two shelters are preparing for 300 people
each.
</P>
<P>
   Cots and blankets will be sparse, but meals will be served, said
Maj. David Johnston, commander of the Salvation Army in the Twin
Counties.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve volunteers will be working throughout the night to
prepare the shelter and to cook and serve meals, which will be
served as long as the shelter is open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be there until they don't need us,'' he said.

HACKERS CLAIM MARKET WEB SITES INVADED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The mysterious Web site crakcers known as United Loan Gunmen
(ULG) has struck again &UR;  &LR; -- &UR;  &LR; maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ULG, which has claimed responsibility for defacing several of
the Internet's best-known sites, said Tuesday night it had posted a
mock news story at the Web site of the Nasdaq stock exchange. But
no sign of any break-in could be seen on Wednesday morning, and
Nasdaq has refused to confirm or deny that anything happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NASDAQ Web site is operational and secure, and we will
continue to monitor our sites to maintain their integrity,'' said
Nasdaq spokesman Scott Peterson. In addition, Peterson said that
even if the exchange's public Web site were attacked, this would
pose no threat to the computer systems that Nasdaq uses for stock
market trades.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the alleged attack is the latest indication of how
insecure many Web sites are. That's a problem because millions of
Americans now get their news and information from the Internet, and
even purchase goods and services there.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Martin, co-founder of Attrition.org, the computer security
organization that discovered the attack, points out that an
intruder could do a lot of damage by publishing plausible-looking
but false information on a financial Web site. ``Instead of making
a wild, outlandish front page, what if they had changed stock
prices, or changed an article?'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an incident happened in April, when an engineer at PairGain
Technologies Inc. was arrested for publishing rumors that his
company was about to be sold. The engineer, who held PairGain stock
options, published a message that simulated a report from the
Bloomberg financial news Web site. PairGain shares rose 32 percent
before the hoax was spotted.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin thinks ULG just wants to mock powerful institutions,
including Wall Street and the news media. Someone claiming to be
ULG has also taken responsibility for recent defacement of the
Drudge Report Web site, as well as the sites of the political TV
channel C-SPAN and the ABC television network. ``It seems like
they're trying to prove that these big institutions like media, are
not secure, and you can't trust the information coming from them,''
said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way of knowing if ULG is really a team or an
individual, or even if the ULG who claimed responsibility for the
Nasdaq attack is the same who performed the other intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged attack came to Martin's attention at about 11:25
p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday night. Martin says he was contacted
over Internet Relay Chat, a system that allows people to type
messages to each other over the Internet. Martin said that someone
using the nickname ULG told him that the Nasdaq site had been
attacked and urged him to take a look.
</P>
<P>
   Martin did, and found a mock news story on the front page. In
part it read, ``Just moments earlier, the Elite Computer Hacking
group ULG (United Loan Gunmen) uprooted the NASDAQ Stock Market Web
Site...Their goal was an attempt to make stocks rise drastically,
thus making all investors happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Martin made a copy of the page, it disappeared
from the Nasdaq site and no further problems have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Attrition spokesman B.K. DeLong believes that Nasdaq won't
confirm that its Web site was raided because the exchange doesn't
want to spook nervous investors. ``People who are not familiar with
technology are not going to know that the Web site and the trading
network are two entirely different entities,'' said DeLong.
``Obviously they don't want to send the market into a spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq exchange fell anyway, though there's no evidence that
the attack had anything to do with it. The Nasdaq index closed at
2814.17, down 54.12 points.

HOW ONE MUSIC CRITIC WOULD CHANGE THE FACE OF CURRENCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The British just pulled way ahead in the friendly competition
for cultural superiority with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it looked as if our side of the Atlantic was ahead,
at least in the classical music category. They gave the world
Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Britten and Tippett. We gave the world
Copland, Ives, Gerswhin and Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   They have the beleaguered Royal Opera at Covent Garden. We have
the wealthy, opulent Metropolitan Opera and a host of healthy
regional opera companies.
</P>
<P>
   They have the Philharmonia Orchestra, the BBC Symphony, the City
of Birmingham Symphony. We have the Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston
and Cleveland orchestras and other good orchestras, more than you
can count. They have Simon Rattle. We have James Levine.
</P>
<P>
   They have the Leeds. We have the Cliburn.
</P>
<P>
   But, in one gigantically significant move, our cousins on the
other side of the pond have demonstrated the superior position of
classical music in their culture, leaving us as embarrassed as if
we had had a coughing fit in the middle of Handel's ``Messiah.''
</P>
<P>
   They put their money where their mouth is, literally.
</P>
<P>
   They put a picture of a composer on the widely circulated
20-pound note.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Treasury currently produces seven varieties of paper
currency with pictures of famous Americans on them. All dead white
guys. All politicians. Three of them slave holders. Four of them
military men.
</P>
<P>
   One, Alexander Hamilton, was an avowed opponent of democracy
because he viewed it as a threat to private property, which he held
sacred. He died in a pistol duel.
</P>
<P>
   Although unquestionably significant in the formation of the
young United States, Hamilton is not exactly a role model.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Edward Elgar, however, who graces the 20-pound note in the
United Kingdom, was a devoted servant of the art of music _ besides
being an avowed patriot. Throughout his life, he continually
sacrificed his financial security to continue composing. A
self-trained genius, he produced two universally acknowledged
masterpieces (the ``Enigma'' Variations for orchestra and the Cello
Concerto) and two universally recognized melodies (the ``Pomp and
Circumstance'' March No. 1 and the ``Salut d'Amour.'') Connoisseurs
on both sides of the Atlantic contend that several other of his
works are equally significant, among them orchestral tone poems,
symphonies, a violin concerto and three monumental oratorios,
including the bold and radiant vision of the journey of the soul
after death, ``The Dream of Gerontius.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us hang our heads in shame, until the U.S. Treasury wakes up
and replaces Alexander Hamilton with one of our own great
composers.
</P>
<P>
   Which of our great composers should it be?
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin, Copland, Bernstein, Ives? Maybe. Any of the first
three would be the first Jewish person on our currency. Copland or
Bernstein would be the first homosexual on American currency _
which would at least trigger some healthy controversy and
discussion in the country, along with a good deal of opposition.
</P>
<P>
   However, passing over Scott Joplin, a sentimental favorite as an
African-American born in Texas, the ideal figure for the redesigned
$10 bill would be jazzman Edward Kennedy ``Duke'' Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ellington has everything going for him as a candidate
for currency. He's immensely well-respected by classical and jazz
musicians for his wide-ranging creativity, obvious genius and bold
innovations. He would be the first African-American to appear on
U.S. currency _ a long-overdue tribute.
</P>
<P>
   He never owned slaves and never fought a duel with deadly
weapons. He was not a politician or soldier, and he was
consistently the most popular musician in America in an era when he
was officially a second-class citizen because of the color of his
skin.
</P>
<P>
   America is more than dead presidents. Our contribution to the
artistic growth of humanity is equal to our military, financial and
political contributions. It's time we claimed that heritage on our
money.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's called Excessive Sensual Indulgence, Isabella Blow said,
gleefully cranking up the electronic sequencer that regulates the
pulsating fountain-shaped light sculpture in the Vampire Room of
her new house in London's Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   By day, nothing about the conventional Georgian facade of the
former artisan's cottage Ms. Blow shares with her husband, Detmar
Blow, an art dealer, prepares visitors for the blazing modernity of
the interior or the eccentricity of its inhabitants. By night,
however, passers-by are often startled by the merrily demented
light show emanating from the curtainless ground-floor windows,
creating the impression that the house is throbbing with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was originally a hatter's house,'' Ms. Blow said with a
note of triumph as she led a visitor on a tour of the couple's
recently renovated home, where rooms are named after the art.
Dressed somewhat alarmingly for breakfast in a burnished steel
corset, Ms. Blow also sported a silver-disk hat created for her by
Philip Treacy, the milliner, to celebrate last month's lunar
eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   A blue-blooded renegade, Ms. Blow, 40, is an influential stylist
celebrated and pilloried for her role as muse to fashion's
avant-garde, including Treacy and Alexander McQueen, who is showing
his anticipated spring collection Thursday at Pier 94 in New York.
Ms. Blow makes a point of wearing the fantastical outfits that
critics often praise on the runway but are horrified to see in the
street, especially when coupled with a very large hat.
</P>
<P>
   But it is only with the purchase of her London home that Ms.
Blow has focused her energies on inspiring young artists and
architects to help conjure up a house for the new millennium,
complete with a transparent bathtub and a see-through sofa through
which movies can be projected. The result is no less outre than her
garb, but it is clearly a stimulating playhouse for a woman who is
passionate about forging connections between art and fashion.
</P>
<P>
   When speaking of design, Ms. Blow frequently sounds as if she is
declaring a cultural manifesto. ``I think the millennium is about
reflections and light,'' she said, adjusting her steel corset.
``And that's what our architects gave us _ modernity and light.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Blows bought their two-up two-down cottage for 195,000
pounds in 1997, it was woefully decrepit. ``It was dark, dingy and
the basement was flooded,'' Ms. Blow said. ``Someone said, `All you
need is a fishing rod.''' The unfashionable neighborhood was a far
cry from the swank of Belgravia, where the couple was renting, but
its advantages were swiftly recognized by the surprisingly
practical-minded stylist. `It's five minutes from the Savoy and 10
minutes away from communion at Westminster Abbey,'' noted Ms. Blow,
a devotee of ritual, who worships at an 11th-century private
chapel. Furthermore, her office at The Sunday Times of London,
where she is the fashion director, ``is only four quid away by
taxi.''
</P>
<P>
   To modernize and expand their hovel, the couple engaged Ferhan
Azman and Joyce Owens, talented young architects who added a
starkly modern two-story glass extension to the rear of the house
to provide a bathroom and a gleaming stainless-steel kitchen. The
newly transformed house has just been nominated for an award from
the prestigious Royal Institute of British Architects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very fortunate to work with Isabella, especially
when she has wild ideas,'' said Ms. Owens, who is currently
designing a Surrealist chandelier for Ms. Blow that will jut
horizontally from a wall in the Vampire Room and cascade in
crystals to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ferhan and Joyce told me, `This house is going to be like a
piece of couture,''' Ms. Blow said. ``They asked to see all of my
hats and shoes, and they measured them. Detmar asked for a place to
keep his cuff links and ties, and said he wanted a house where he
could run around naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Practiced at exuding an air of aristocratic nonchalance, the
couple's artful exhibitionism in public seems to extend to their
private life. Drawn blinds in the bedroom preclude curious glances,
but much of the house is open to inspection _ a sort of
blue-blooded reverse of ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a voyeur,'' Ms. Blow said. ``I think everyone in fashion
is a voyeur.''
</P>
<P>
   To transform the gloomy basement, Ms. Azman and Ms. Owens came
up with the ingenious idea of installing three glass panels in the
floor of the two original ground-floor rooms. Now awash with
natural light during the day, Ms. Blow's subterranean office is
lined along one wall with floor-to-ceiling stainless-steel closets
that bespeak a desire for uncompromising efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Blow introduced the architects to Ben Curnow, an artist
whose work she had admired, Ms. Owens suggested incorporating one
of his sculptures into a glass floor panel in the sparsely
furnished living room (which Ms. Blow refers to as the Battle Room,
after a set of arresting Sean Ellis photographs inspired by
medieval jousting that hang in one corner). Curnow's sculpture,
composed of a water tank and a powerful blue light, creates the
mesmerizing effect of waves lapping toward an ever-elusive shore.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, the whole place is blue,'' Ms. Blow said, referring
to the living room, hallway, basement and street. ``I think blue is
a spiritual color _ it purifies you.''
</P>
<P>
   Climbing the stairs, visitors come face-to-face with five
horizontally stacked portraits of Andy Warhol, who befriended Ms.
Blow in the mid-1980s during her stint as an assistant to Anna
Wintour at Vogue, after noticing that she was wearing one pink shoe
and one purple shoe. At the top of the stairs is Ms. Blow's
pristine dressing room, for which Ms. Azman and Ms. Owens designed
sleek glass-fronted closets to create a gallery-like setting to
display hats and shoes from her collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that it looks like an accessories shop _ it could be
Prada or Gucci,'' Ms. Blow said.
</P>
<P>
   For the bathroom, the architects designed a voyeuristic
glass-sided tub and a transparent rear wall. ``We came up with the
idea because we thought it would be a bit over the top,'' Ms. Owens
said with classic understatement. Ms. Blow, describing the
spectacle of her husband enjoying a soak, noted, ``It's like having
a little Botero in the bath.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do their friends make of it? ``Having a glass bathtub is
one thing, but having a glass-walled bathroom that the neighbors
can peer into is pretty wild,'' Treacy said. ``It's fairly explicit
at night, I'm sure.'' (Artfully concealed roller blinds protect
their modesty, but the Blows clearly enjoy visitors drawing the
same conclusion.)
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Blow, the house's lean modernity is a welcome antidote
to tragedies in her family's past and to the pace of her
professional life. ``I want it to be like a hotel you check into
with no memories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With its compact size, bright white walls and eye-popping
contemporary art, the Blow's London cottage is a dramatic contrast
to Hilles, the majestic Arts and Crafts manor house in
Gloucestershire where the couple entertain on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1913 by Blow's grandfather, a distinguished architect
who was also named Detmar Blow, Hilles is an imposing and somewhat
theatrical confection of yellow stone, Tudor portraits,
17th-century furniture, William Morris carpets and Burne-Jones
tapestries. Perched on a plateau overlooking the rolling Malvern
Hills, it offers a romantic, bird's-eye view of the winding Severn
River and of Gloucester Cathedral, where the couple were married
with giddy pomp and ceremony in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about Hilles is that it's one man's vision,'' Ms.
Blow said, leading a visitor on a recent tour. ``Every stone, every
hinge, was chosen by him. He designed it top-to-toe, as it were.''
</P>
<P>
   Magnificent at night, the house is decidedly melancholic by day.
Blow's father committed suicide there in 1977, and his heirs seem
not to have gotten around to burying his ashes, which sit in an
elegant box bearing his name on a desk by the dining table, in
front of a gilded 18th-century French clock, which has not been
wound since his death.
</P>
<P>
   Escaping the house for a rambling country walk one recent
afternoon, Ms. Blow introduced a visitor to a collection of
splendidly plumed Japanese chickens lent by the English couturier
Anthony Price. ``It's amazing they've got any feathers left,'' Ms.
Blow said with calculated astonishment. ``Philip Treacy's always
plucking them for hats.''
</P>
<P>
   An inspection of the family's short-tailed Soay sheep in a
nearby field prompted further sartorial anecdotes. ``Philip did a
hat based on the ram's horn, and Alexander McQueen did the horns in
gold for his first collection at Givenchy,'' she said. ``But I've
lost my ram _ they die from too much sex, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Having decided recently to create a new entrance to Hilles, the
Blows have commissioned Roderick Gradidge, a world expert on arts
and crafts architecture, to design a pair of gateposts in Cotswold
dry stone, topped with dovecotes.
</P>
<P>
   The Blows are legendary hosts, and the visitors' book at Hilles
is a veritable Who's Who of Britain's youthful haute bohemia. When
McQueen is in residence, he commandeers the vast Long Room, with
its William Morris carpets and a magnificent 17-century Mortlake
tapestry. Sophie Dahl and Honor Fraser, models whose careers were
begun by Ms. Blow, are also frequent guests, as is Jasper Conran,
the London designer, who is currently negotiating with Blow to
occupy a sprawling house on the estate.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is an impressive setting for house parties, Hilles
is the antithesis to the Blow's serenely modern cocoon in London.
``It's very overpowering,'' Ms. Blow said. ``It's a bit like living
inside a theater set.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience of owning her own house in London has an
emotional resonance for Ms. Blow. Her father, Sir Evelyn Delves
Broughton, died in 1993, leaving her only 5,000 pounds. Her
stepmother, whom Ms. Blow described as ``a creature called Rona who
he met on a bus in Hong Kong,'' inherited his country estate, which
had been in the family since the 14th century, along with the tidy
sum of 7 million pounds. ``I was shocked, because I had loved
him,'' Ms. Blow said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she seems to relish her role as a madcap
chatelaine at Hilles. Some may opt for faded jeans or tweeds in the
country, but not Ms. Blow. Wearing a frothy muslin floor-length
dress by Yoshiki Hishinuma, Jungle Red lipstick and silver
stilettos, Ms. Blow could hardly be mistaken for the housekeeper as
she greeted house guests in the kitchen at 8 a.m. and inquired,
saucepan in hand, ``Anyone for porridge?''

JUDGE REJECTS MOBSTERS' CLAIM OF FBI IMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For decades, the FBI protected its prized informants,
reputed South Boston crime boss James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger and his
sidekick Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, by tipping them to
investigations and ignoring their crimes, but they were never
promised they wouldn't be prosecuted, a federal judge concluded
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a long-awaited decision that threatened to derail a landmark
racketeering case against the region's top organized crime figures,
US District Judge Mark L. Wolf refused to drop any charges against
Flemmi, Bulger, reputed New England Mafia boss Francis P.
``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme, and two associates, or to toss out a
key piece of evidence -- a 1989 bugging of a Mafia induction
ceremony in suburban Medford.
</P>
<P>
   After 46 witnesses, 276 exhibits and 80 days of testimony that
stretched over most of last year, Wolf was unswayed by Flemmi's
central claim: He and Bulger were promised immunity from
prosecution for any crime short of murder in exchange for
information they fed the FBI on their Mafia rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-inch thick, 661-page decision, Wolf concluded that the
FBI broke its own rules while handling Bulger and Flemmi, but that
any agreement with the pair did not rise to the level of a formal
deal not to prosecute them.
</P>
<P>
   While Wolf did not dismiss any charges, he did bar federal
prosecutors from using any evidence gathered against Bulger or
Flemmi during a series of buggings in the 1980s because they had
given the FBI information that it used in applications for the
bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any victory for prosecutors may be shortlived. Wolf said
he plans to hold more hearings on whether information from four
bugging operations was presented to the grand jury that handed down
the racketeering indictment against Flemmi and the others in
January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   If it was, Wolf said he may throw out some or all of the charges
against the 65-year-old Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is it's very good news for Mr. Flemmi,'' said
his attorney, Kenneth J. Fishman. ``I certainly will be urging the
court that there really is no way for this indictment to survive as
a result of the evidence that is being excluded against Mr.
Flemmi.''
</P>
<P>
   Salemme's lawyer, Anthony Cardinale, said he will ask Wolf next
week to release Salemme on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinale said it was Salemme and reputed Mafia solider Robert
DeLuca who pushed Flemmi to reveal that he was an FBI informant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for us, and certainly for my client, for the
world to know that this wasn't sleuthing that was going on,'' said
Cardinale. ``It was nothing but outright rat snitching and it was
accomplished by a guy who professed to be one of (Salemme's)
closest pals.''
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald K. Stern, whose office is prosecuting the
case, issued a statement saying he was ``pleased'' that Wolf denied
a request by defense attorneys to dismiss the indictment or
suppress FBI tapes of the induction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, I am disappointed that the court is requiring
that further evidentiary hearings be held before it can make final
rulings on Flemmi's motions,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stern and Barry Mawn, special-agent-in-charge of the FBI's
Boston office, said they are continuing to investigate allegations
of FBI misconduct that surfaced during the hearings before Wolf
last year and were chronicled in his lengthy decision.
</P>
<P>
   Although Flemmi became an FBI informant in 1965, followed by
Bulger a decade later, Wolf wrote that the FBI ``played a pivotal
role in forging a formidable enduring partnership between Flemmi
and Bulger. ... The FBI made Bulger and Flemmi, who were previously
acquainted but not close, a perfect match.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Flemmi testified that he had stopped meeting with the
FBI for a few years when Bulger arranged for him to meet his
handler, Special Agent John Connolly, in 1976. At the time both
Flemmi and Bulger were reputed members of the Winter Hill Gang,
based in Somerville, just outisde of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   They became a team, allegedly shaking down bookmakers and drug
dealers together, then rendezvousing with agents to provide
information on the criminal exploits of their Mafia rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arrangement offered (Flemmi) an opportunity to use the FBI
to disable his enemies, enhance his safety, and with the
competition diminished and the protection of the FBI, make his own
criminal activities more profitable,'' Wolf wrote.
</P>
<P>
   There was ample evidence that Bulger and Flemmi were protected
over the years by many agents, said Wolf, citing the testimony of a
parade of former FBI agents, prosecutors and underworld operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said he was unable to rely on FBI records found in the
informant files of Bulger and Flemmi because there was
``substantial evidence that members of the FBI engaged in improper
if not illegal conduct'' and had a motive to tailor, omit or
distort the records.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Wolf said, he was drawing conclusions from some of
the testimony. Among his stunning findings: he believes that
Connolly, who retired in 1990, warned Bulger and Flemmi on the eve
of their January 1995 indicment so they could flee.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger left and remains a fugitive, named recently to the FBI's
Ten Most Wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said Flemmi's testimony that it was former FBI Supervisor
John Morris who warned Bulger to flee just wasn't ``credible.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, Connolly said, ``I did not tip Bulger,
Flemmi or anyone else with repsect to the indictment returned by
the grand jury in 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   While Connolly refused to testify at the hearings last year
citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Morris
was granted immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Morris admitted pocketing $7,000 in payoffs from Bulger and
Flemmi and claimed that Connolly delivered two of the payments,
each totaling $1,000. Connolly denies that.
</P>
<P>
   Morris also admitted tipping Bulger and Flemmi to an FBI
investigation of one of their associates, a Roxbury bookmaker, so
they would not be caught.
</P>
<P>
   Morris also claimed that he sent word to Bulger and Flemmi
through Connolly that another Winter Hill gang member, Brian
Halloran, was cooperating with the FBI and had implicated them in
the 1981 murder of Tulsa millionaire Roger Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran was murdered in 1982 and Morris said he suspected
Bulger and Flemmi were involved in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly denies ever warning Bulger and Flemmi that Halloran was
cooperating against them.
</P>
<P>
   There were numerous instances of FBI protection detailed by Wolf
involving more than a half-dozen current and former FBI agents.
Wolf said it was the FBI's way of keeping two informants who were
providing critical information against the Mafia on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI agents primarily responsible for dealing with Flemmi,
by word and deed, for thirty years, promised Flemmi protection in
return for the valuable information that he was providing,'' Wolf
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolf said Flemmi had no expectation that he had immunity
from prosecution, nor was the term immunity used in any
conversation between him and FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather, he expected that the FBI would overlook some of his
criminal activity, provide him information concerning any
investigations that were conducted, and warn him of any imminent
charges against him of which it learned,'' Wolf wrote. ``The FBI
performed its part of the bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge concluded that Flemmi and Bulger were promised that
information they gave the FBI so it could get court approval to
install listening devices in Mafia hangouts would not be used
against them.
</P>
<P>
   In particular Wolf ruled that prosecutors were barred from using
any evidence gathered from the following ``bugs'' to obtain its
1995 racketeering indictment against Bulger and Flemmi:
</P>
<P>
   -- The 1981 bugging of the North End headquarters of Patriarca
family underboss Gennaro ``Jerry'' Angiulo.
</P>
<P>
   -- A 1984-85 bugging by the FBI and the US Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   -- The 1986-1987 bugging of Vanessa's Italian Food Shop in the
Prudential Center by the FBI and Massachusetts State Police.
</P>
<P>
   -- The infamous Mafia induction ceremony from Oct. 29, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said Flemmi was ``expressly and implicitly promised'' that
in exchange for his help on the Angiulo bugging that led to the
convictions of the Boston hierarchy of the mob, none of the
interceptions would be used against him.
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI enlisted Bulger and Flemmi to visit Angiulo's
headquarters, Bulger voiced concern that they might be killed and
both informants worried that the FBI might learn about criminal
wrongdoings by Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Those tapes did reveal bragging by Angiulo's consigliere, Ilario
Zannino, about the murders of three Boston brothers and how Salemme
and Flemmi had participated in them. The current racketeering
indictment charges Salemme and Flemmi with those murders.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi was among a group of informants who gave the FBI
information that led to the bugging in Medford in 1989, when four
aspiring mobsters -- including his co-defendant DeLuca -- took a
blood oath to join the Patriarca crime family.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said the FBI ``recklessly disregarded the government's
legal obligation of candor to the court'' when applying, along with
the DEA, to bug Bulger's car and apartment in nearby Quincy in 1984
and 1985 and failing to disclose he was an FBI informant.

TWO SENATORS NARROW CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL TO DRAW SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take expected to move by 9:30 p.m. ET.) 
(nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an attempt to break the long Senate stalemate on
campaign finance, the two senators sponsoring overhaul legislation
say they will strip down their bill to focus primarily on large,
unregulated donations to political parties that were at the center
of the controversy in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell
Feingold, D-Wis., to narrow their bill came after the House _ for
the second year in a row _ passed the original, more comprehensive
legislation Wednesday night, which put the issue of campaign
finance back before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not at all clear that the legislative tactic would
achieve the senators' aim, which is to somehow find enough votes to
prevail if senior Republicans once again mount a filibuster against
the effort to change the campaign law. Democrats who oppose scaling
back the comprehensive legislation likely will object to the new
language, and the most vociferous Republican critics of the bill
were showing no sign of being mollified.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators said in separate interviews Wednesday that the
new version of their bill would ban the unlimited, unregulated
donations to political parties known as ``soft money.'' But it
would no longer include new regulations on so-called issue advocacy
advertisements by outside groups within 60 days of an election.
Those commercials, critics say, purport to explain a policy issue
but are, in effect, thinly veiled campaign advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the more comprehensive legislation drew a 52-vote
majority in the Senate, but not the 60 votes needed to break a
filibuster mounted by Republican opponents who killed the bill.
With the Senate set to take up the issue again for a week in
October, the sponsors say they are trying to find a way to create a
new dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that there will be ample opportunities for senators
to amend their bare-bones bill, possibly building legislation that
can pass. That would get campaign finance legislation to a
House-Senate conference committee that would reconcile the
differences between the approaches of the two chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that we didn't see 60 votes if you reintroduced
McCain-Feingold,'' said McCain. ``I believe that by introducing
just the bare bones we can go through an amending process,'' he
added, `` hopefully approve a bill, get more votes and go to
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold said the two had also considered the fact that
Sen.Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other chief opponents of the
overhaul legislation had long aimed most of their fire at the
provisions to regulate issue advocacy ads, arguing that they
amounted to an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, they could not make that complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``This forces them to say that a ban on soft money is wrong,''
he said. ``I think that's hard because it's become essentially a
system of legalized bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from clear Wednesday that the two men's move
would bolster their case. In fact it looked possible that it could
fracture their coalition since many Democrats argue that they are
often the targets of issue advocacy ad campaigns run by Republican
allies such as the National Rifle Association, the Christian
Coalition and anti-tax groups.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin T. Meehan , D-Mass., who is one of the chief
sponsors of the House companion bill, expressed doubts about the
maneuver by McCain and Feingold. ``We just had a great victory for
campaign finance reform and I hate to embrace the very next day a
weaker bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House
Minority Leader, was more blunt. ``There's zero support among House
Democrats for a watered down campaign finance bill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the political spectrum, McConnell showed no
inclination to drop his opposition to even the rejiggered bill. He
argued that Republicans needed the large cash infusions that come
to the party in soft money to pay for television ads to counter
advertisements by organized labor, which usually backs Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want our political party to be able to defend our
candidates,'' said McConnell, who is head of the Senate
Republicans' re-election effort.

WALKING A FINE LINE ON MOB-FBI ARRANGEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was, in retrospect, a prescient moment.
</P>
<P>
   On January 6, 1997, the first day of hearings that would last 80
days and generate 17,000 pages of transcripts, US District Judge
Mark L. Wolf glanced down at the group of defense lawyers assembled
before him and warned that their prospects were ``not promising.''
</P>
<P>
   Others before them had failed to convince judges to dismiss
criminal charges because the government _ police officers, FBI
agents, federal prosecutors _ had acted outrageously in building
the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Wolf followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   While he hadn't considered that specific claim -- that
``outrageous government misconduct'' should result in the charges
being dismissed -- Wolf offered to consider that issue at further
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, defense lawyers will have a tough time clearing
that even higher bar, particularly if it means that career
criminals could walk free as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dismissing a case before the government has a chance to put on
evidence that a person has committed a crime is sort of like the
atomic bomb of judicial remedies,'' said David Rossman, professor
of law at Boston University Law School. ``And judges are about as
reluctant to put their fingers on the red button as presidents
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the legal landscape, some wondered why it had taken Wolf
so long to reach what seemed a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was going to do nothing, he could have done that a year
ago,'' said Rosanna Cavallaro, an associate professor at Suffolk
University Law School. ``The fact that he took such care suggested
that he had in mind a bar that was achievable. He could have cut to
the chase much earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Others praised Wolf for not rushing to judgment, for
meticulously gathering evidence and holding hearings into
allegations that at first glance seemed fanciful: payoffs from
gangsters to an FBI supervisor, who in turn tipped off the
gangsters to wiretaps and investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Wolf has spent all the time in the world probing and
holding the government to close account,'' said Stanley Fisher, a
professor at BU Law School. ``He has been extremely meticulous and
fair . . . but you have to be extremely careful before you throw
out very serious charges against someone, much less someone who has
a history of very serious criminal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In refusing to dismiss extortion and racketeeering charges
against Winter Hill gangster Stephen Flemmi _ based on Flemmi's
claim that he was promised immunity from prosecution by the FBI _
Wolf walked a fine line. He acknowleded that Flemmi had been
promised ``protection'' by his FBI handlers and their superiors
during a 30-year span as an informant, but was not given formal
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI agents primarily responsible for dealing with Flemmi,
by word and deed, for thirty years, promised Flemmi protection in
return for his service as an informant,'' Wolf wrote. But, the
judge added, it wasn't the same as a formal immunity deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flemmi was not, however, explicitly or implicitly promised
immunity from prosecution,'' Wolf wrote. ``The term immunity was
never used.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Flemmi expected to be tipped off to investigations,
Wolf said, and the FBI ``performed its part of the bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavallaro believes a case could be made that the bureau indeed
struck a formal immunity contract with its prized informants, based
on the sheer length of the relationship: the hundreds of meetings,
the dinner parties, the Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have thought at least some judge might be willing to
find that there was an agreement, based on the depth of these
contacts: the conversations, the contacts, the acknowledgment of
payoffs,'' she said. ``There is no written contract, but there is
an implied contract.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she added, ``I think there is law out there that you could
hang such a finding on.''

<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Having already produced the greatest
evacuation in U.S. history, Hurricane Floyd skirted Florida and
Georgia on Wednesday and aimed itself directly at the low-lying
coastal border between the Carolinas, where its eye was expected to
come ashore early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although no widespread damage from hurricane force winds or
waves was yet reported on the East Coast, gusts exceeding 60 mph
began knocking down power lines and blowing billboards across
roadways on Wednesday evening along the South Carolina coast. And
with sustained winds of more than 40 mph, falling trees began
smashing windows and roofs at several houses northeast of
Charleston, according to the police. At least 86,000 homes were
without power in the Charleston region, and repair crews had no
plans to begin work until the storm passed.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, those homes were empty, as were all
others in dozens of counties from Jacksonville, Fla., to
Wilmington, N.C. Evacuation orders were in effect on Wednesday for
2.6 million people, and with the majority of those residents
obeying the orders, federal emergency officials said the evacuation
had now become the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 percent of Charleston's 87,000 residents had moved
inland, and Charleston County officials were amazed to report an 80
percent evacuation rate for the 230,000 people in the rest of the
county. The rate was far higher than for any previous hurricane,
and was attributed to the storm's enormous size and power, which by
evening appeared likely to spare the city. More than 90 percent of
neighboring Beaufort County was empty, according to county
officials, and 6,300 people were reported to be in shelters in a
three-county area.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm's eye moving to the north and east, residents of
North Carolina began adding to the exodus on Wednesday, filling up
hotels as far away as Alabama and Tennessee. The state government
ordered evacuations from the barrier islands around Wilmington, and
traffic began to clog the area just as heavy rains began falling at
midday. President Clinton declared coastal areas in the Carolinas
to be disaster areas, adding them to list of counties in Florida
and Georgia that were earlier made eligible for federal funds and
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Florida and Georgia at this point feel like
they've dodged a real bullet,'' said Richard Moore, the public
safety secretary for North Carolina. ``This thing is not going to
miss us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation numbers were particularly high given the extreme
difficulty many residents had in leaving their homes on Tuesday,
because of massive congestion. South Carolina waited until
nightfall to make all lanes of the main interstate highway
westbound away from Charleston. Joseph P. Riley Jr., the mayor of
Charleston, charged the state with ``staggering incompetence,'' and
expressed concern that many of those who tried to leave wound up
returning, putting themselves in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Although Florida was spared the heaviest winds of the hurricane,
which weakened on Wednesday to 115 mph as the storm moved north,
areas around Daytona and Titusville reported numerous damaged roofs
and power lines. About 290,000 customers remained without
electrical power as many of the 1.3 million residents who followed
evacuation orders began returning to their homes. A popular pier in
Daytona collapsed when it was inundated by waves, but the state
insurance commissioner's office said there was no major damage
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A 150-foot tugboat sank early Wednesday 345 miles off of
Jacksonville. The Coast Guard said that helicopters from the
aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy rescued three men, but the
other three crew members and their life raft were missing.
</P>
<P>
   The track of the storm left open the possibility that Floyd's
heavy winds and rain could continue north past the Carolinas into
Washington, D.C., New York City and even New England by the
weekend, even if it is not a hurricane at that point. Hurricane
force winds could reach the Chesapeake Bay by Thursday morning, and
federal emergency officials predicted significant tree damage in
Washington because of recent heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency told governors on
Wednesday afternoon that flooding as far north as New England
remains a high possibility through the rest of the week. Because so
much of the mid-Atlantic region is already saturated from Hurricane
Dennis, state agencies remain on high alert for inland river
flooding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already, an enormous swath of the country's East Coast was
virtually barren of visible human life. Charleston's historic
downtown was boarded up and deserted, the only movement the ominous
sway of trees and light poles. By 2 p.m., county police officers
had parked their cruisers and gone to shelters, and ambulances
stopped responding to any calls other than cardiac emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   In Horry County, the resort of Myrtle Beach had become an empty
stage set of abandoned hotels, seafood restaurants, waterslides and
miniature golf courses on Wednesday afternoon as the storm began to
produce significant swells in the Atlantic. Roads were empty and
gas stations, grocery stores and diners were boarded up and locked.
One facade of an old downtown building tumbled to the ground, and
police officers struggled to secure the exterior with plywood.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The usually animated beach town, a popular golf and retirement
destination, was projected to be very near the direct path of the
hurricane during the night, and though the storm's winds had
weakened to 115 mph from 140 mph the day before, officials were
still very worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in the path of some of the strongest winds and
largest storm surges,'' said Cheryl J. Henry, a county spokeswoman.
A curfew went into effect at 3 p.m., and similar restrictions were
imposed on Charleston after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Further north, in Wilmington, which has been affected by 16
hurricanes in the last decade, officials began preparing for the
serious flooding that occurred in storms such as Bertha, Bonnie and
Fran. Life jackets were placed on all fire trucks to assist in
water rescues. Having just gone through a weeklong pounding from
Hurricane Dennis, North Carolina officials predicted ruinous beach
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to damage this beach like we have not seen since
Hazel,'' said Michael Stokes, a spokesman for Wrightsville Beach,
referring to the 1954 storm.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that it has been only a decade since Hurricane Hugo
came ashore in downtown Charleston, killing 13 people, producing a
17-foot surge, and costing South Carolina more than $6 billion,
city officials said they were amazed the state did not have a more
effective evacuation plan for the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Riley and other regional mayors were furious that the Department
of Transportation did not immediately allow fleeing residents to
use all lanes of I-26, as Georgia officials did with I-16 out of
Savannah. Some Charleston residents were on the road for 10 or 12
hours just to reach other parts of the small state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't rocket science,'' Riley said in an interview. ``What
the state Department of Transportation should have had in place and
could easily do is a system where you close lanes of traffic on one
part of the major highways and let people go out, because when you
have a major evacuation from a hurricane and you're requiring
people to leave, then that of a necessity means that people are not
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges, who was blamed by most angry radio-show callers
for the snail's pace of the evacuation, said his transportation
advisers questioned the safety of reversing lanes on the
interstate, but said he finally overruled them at about 8 p.m.
Tuesday. Nonetheless, the issue was likely to remain a political
blow for him _ one handmade sign on a I-26 overpass read, ``Flog
Hodges.''

STATE SENATOR, 57, APOLOGIZES FOR GROPING COLLEGE STUDENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE OLAFSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGLETON, Texas _ State Sen. J.E. ``Buster'' Brown, the ranking
Republican in the Texas Senate, apologized Wednesday for making
unwanted sexual advances toward a former employee.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, a 20-year-old college student, had complained that
the longtime legislator groped her in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Angleton is about 35 miles south of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The apology averts any criminal prosecution of the senator for
the incident, but Lake Jackson police said Wednesday they will
investigate a complaint from another woman who is making similar
allegations against the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 57, apologized to his former employee, Tiffany Black, in
a face-to-face meeting Wednesday morning in an Angleton park, where
he read her a one-page written apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Ms. Black: I am sorry for making unwanted sexual advances
towards you,'' the senator's apology stated. ``You have been a good
employee and I should not have placed you in this situation. This
is my responsibility and I will seek any necessary corrective
measures, including counseling. I have not been forced or pressured
in any way to make this apology. I am doing this because it is the
right thing to do. Please accept this sincere apology.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   James E. (Buster) Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown handed the written apology to Black during the brief
meeting, which was attended by Brown's wife, Jill, Black's fiancee
and Black's mother, Renee Atmar, said Brazoria County District
Attorney Jeri Yenne, who also was there. She said Brown and Black
had agreed the park would be acceptable for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Yenne said no further action will be taken against Brown in
connection with Black's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Had Brown not apologized, Yenne said she ``probably'' would have
reviewed the case for possible prosecution as a Class C misdemeanor
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Black, a Brazosport College student who had worked for Brown
about a year, told police that Brown tried to kiss her and touched
her breasts and buttocks while he was giving her a golf lesson in
his Lake Jackson office Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   She resigned the same day and complained to Lake Jackson police.
</P>
<P>
   Black was unavailable to comment on Brown's apology, but Yenne,
the district attorney, said the apology was important to the young
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provided some validation to her complaint,'' she said.
``We're all human and I have victims tell me all the time that the
one thing that bothered them is they never got an apology.``
</P>
<P>
   Yenne said Brown's apology perhaps opens the senator to
liabililty in a civil lawsuit and that Black and her mother realize
that is a legal option.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Brown nor his lawyer, Michael Phillips of Angleton,
could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Jackson Police Chief Paul Hromadka, meanwhile, said police
have received a call from an Alvin woman who claims Brown made
similar unwanted sexual advances toward her.
</P>
<P>
   Police planned to interview the woman Wednesday night, Hromadka
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will investigate any and all allegations if it occurred in
our jurisdiction and within the statute of limitations,'' Hromadka
said.
</P>
<P>
   Misdemeanor cases must be presented to a grand jury within two
years of the incident, Hromadka said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how long ago this may have occurred,'' he said
of the latest allegations against Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a Lake Jackson lawyer, has been mentioned as a possible
candidate for lieutenant governor should Gov. George W. Bush be
elected president and be succeeded by Lt. Gov. Rick Perry.
</P>

 &HT;    Web provides instant updates on Floyd
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Who cares whether or not it's raining in Boise?''
sighed South Florida resident Linda Twersky while watching The
Weather Channel on Tuesday night. ``Somebody tell me if my house is
going to be oceanfront property in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the age of the Internet, television coverage often isn't
focused enough, specific enough or quick enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personalization of the Web is what makes is work,'' said
Charlene Li, a senior analyst with Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Twersky, like many residents of Florida, Georgia and South
Carolina, spent most of Tuesday night logging onto the Web and
watching in wonder as the gigantic multicolored radar swirl of
Hurricane Floyd moved toward the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   So did many other weather watchers, according to Li. ``It's so
annoying to wait for the media to come around for the news you
want,'' she said. ``It's insulting to have to wait eight minutes
for the next weather report. We've become used to having all this
information at our fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web is a great resource tool, Li said, because it allows
users to pinpoint the exact information they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want a lot more detail than just the weather report,''
added Lelia Lee, brand manager for The Weather Channel's Web site,
weather.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the latest information continuously updated.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather.com has a banner across the top of the page notifying
users it is in severe weather mode, meaning it's top priority is on
covering the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Weather was clearly on the minds of many Web surfers _ the site
recorded 23.5 million page views on Tuesday, setting an all-time
record for the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``In severe weather mode, we go in and strip anything that may
cause a slower download,'' she said. ``We take out some of the
graphics and other images. We show one really great map on the home
page and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the demand for instant information seems to overwhelm even
the best-prepared sites. Weather.com was ready to accommodate tens
of millions of users, but for many, pages were still slow to load
and at times the site was tough to access.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the Web is a perfect place to collect information to
help users cope with weather emergencies. The site includes a
weather news section that's updated hourly and a section on weather
safety called Project Safe Side, which is done in conjunction with
the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Interactivity and exchange of information between the sites and
users is also key. Lee said she was surprised by the users'
response to the on-camera meteorologists' call for viewers to send
in e-mails to be read on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised that people were using their laptops to get
information, and there were lots of people from the Carolina coast
looking for information and updates. That's what's fantastic about
the Web,'' she said. ``You can serve up all kinds of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather.com will probably always be the first destination when
weather emergencies arise. Yahoo!'s weather section
(weather.yahoo.com) has a special storm section with huge radar
maps, storm tracking and bulletins from the National Weather
Service in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   As Yahoo! shifts away from being simply a search engine to being
a one-stop source of news and information, it becomes more valuable
to Web surfers who want as much news as they can find on a
particular topic conveniently located in one place.
</P>
<P>
   During a weather emergency, people not only want to see the path
of the storm, but find out what they should be doing to prepare for
it. The ABCNews.com site (www.abcnews.com) has comprehensive
coverage on the hurricane including a section called ``Help for
Hurricane-Hampered Travellers.'' The area offers tips and advice
for stranded vacationers, flight cancellations and updates from the
Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina tourism boards.
</P>
<P>
   While the Web can provide breaking information on a variety of
weather-related subjects, Forrester's Li pointed out that right now
the Web still isn't as portable as the old-fashioned transistor
radio. ``But there are advances in wireless communication that will
change this,'' she said. ``The fact is people want constant
updates. Broadcast is great for reaching all the masses, but it's
not personalized enough.

MAYOR NOT APOLOGETIC FOR MISTAKEN SUMMER-SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As school officials revised the number of students
mistakenly assigned to summer school upward to 8,500, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Board of Education officials argued Wednesday that
parents of those children should be grateful for the mixup because
the faltering children were given a chance at more schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a parent of one of the children, I would say, `Thank
you for having the child in summer school' because the child got
more education,'' the mayor said at a City Hall news conference.
``You've got to understand, the alleged error is an error with the
children at the lowest end of the score.'' He added, ``They are
children who, next year, when the standards are just a little bit
higher, would not be promoted. So, these are children very much in
need of additional educational help.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who had strongly pushed the summer school program as
a way of getting tough with failing students, spoke in response to
questions about the revelations by Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew
that thousands of students in the third and sixth grades were
erroneously required to attend summer school because of a scoring
mistake by CTB/McGraw-Hill, the Monterey, Calif., standardized
testing company. As a result of that error, hundreds of students
were forced to change vacation plans or compelled to sit in often
sweltering classrooms. The board on Wednesday raised the figure of
mistakenly assigned students to 8,500 _ far more than the 2,000 to
3,000 first indicated by school officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the board tried Wednesday to find a silver lining in the
situation. Recalculating reading scores to compensate for the
scoring error showed that test scores last spring for the school
system had sharply improved, not remained flat as was first
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The board said that 48.5 percent of students _ not 44.6 percent,
as previously reported _ scored at or above the national average.
With the statistical adjustment the board uses to allow for
comparisons with previous years _ the 1999 test was much different
from previous years _ scores improved by 4.9 percent over 1998, the
board said.
</P>
<P>
   The flawed test results, announced last June, were one of the
grimmest chapters in Crew's tenure, creating the impression that
Crew himself, who had put a high focus on literacy, was
ineffective. At the time, Crew said he was determined ``not to make
excuses'' and vowed to take strong action to overhaul the system.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, many of those actions _ from removing
superintendents to sending children to summer school _ turned out
to be based to a considerable extent on a fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see no reason even amidst the turbulence to abandon the
standards,'' Crew said before a meeting Wednesday of the Board of
Education at its Brooklyn headquarters, in which he and the board
members expressed both anger at the testing company mistakes and
pride in the new results. ``I don't think we made a mistake here at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   David Taggart, the president of CTB/McGraw-Hill, his voice
shaking, told Crew and the board that the company believed the new
test results to be valid. ``Maybe the word apology isn't enough,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crew, who agreed with the mayor's assessment, said he would
advance all students who passed the spring exam, regardless of
their summer school performance, though he would encourage the
parents of borderline students to allow their children to be
retained.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants parents to think that ```I know my kid was
wrongly placed in summer school but, heck, I just know he or she is
not doing well enough yet to handle the fourth grade.' I want that
conversation to be had. But I also believe they are eligible for
promotion under the rules. Fair is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, just one week into the new school year, he predicted
confusion if many kids are moved around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it will be very disruptive and and I don't like to
do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The testing mistake elicited a range of emotion among school
officials, parents and students.
</P>
<P>
   Indira Baptise, whose son, Colin Bunbury, was promoted to the
fourth grade at Public School 41 in Brooklyn after attending summer
school there, said summer school got him so interested in reading
that he goes to the library after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not mind him doing the extra work because he needed it,''
Ms. Baptise said. ``But I am upset that I sent him to school all
year long and he could not pass all the things he had to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, outside a Bronx elementary school, Guillermo Rosado
offered a different view as he picked up his stepson, David, who
passed summer school and is now in the fourth grade at Public
School 69.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he didn't have to go to summer school we could have gone to
Florida as we planned,'' Rosado said. ``This definitely affected
our summer. We were going to go visit my mother and do all the
tourist things in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   David, for his part, did not seem to mind. ``I liked summer
school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was confusion Wednesday among schools administrators and
parents about what the revised scores may mean.
</P>
<P>
   The board began to focus in on the actual number affected by the
McGraw Hill miscalculation and found it was far larger than at
first believed. Board officials said that of the students
mistakenly assigned to summer school, more than 5,000 went and
passed a second test. But almost 3,500, the board said, either
never showed up for summer school or failed the second test by
scoring below the 15th percentile on a national curve.
</P>
<P>
   Those students will be promoted unless their parents request
they not be, Crew said.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake occurred through a miscalculation of the percentile
score that showed how the students compared to a national sample of
children across the country.

ARRINGTON'S SPECIAL TREATMENT DOESN'T WASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's barely the middle of September, but Penn State's LaVar
Arrington has basically wrapped up the Butkus Award, given to the
nation's outstanding linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   If voters seek a reason to wait before crowning Arrington,
though, they should remember the disgraceful way Arrington played
in last week's victory over Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington drew two personal-foul penalties for knocking Pitt
punter Greg DeBolt down after punts and violently keeping him on
the ground. He wasn't ejected because one was a dead-ball penalty _
and because he's LeVar Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   If he were playing for Miami or Florida State, Arrington would
have been quickly tossed from the game for his blatant attacks on
the punter.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Arrington professed ignorance over the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my job,'' Arrington said. ``That's what we were
planning on doing all week. I was just playing. I'm not mad at the
call. I went over to the officials and apologized if I did anything
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Awfully noble, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   But hey, this is State College, Pa., so let's see what demigod
Joe Paterno thought of the whole mess.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno said he hasn't looked at the special-teams game film. He
said he routinely watches only the offensive and defensive plays.
That's the slickest dodge Paterno has made in years, but when
gently pressed, he finally admitted that Arrington was out of line,
sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to LaVar about it,'' Paterno said. ``His job is to
make sure the punter punts the ball and then block him. If he did
anything beyond that, he's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami quarterback Kenny Kelly, who will face Arrington this
week, said he won't accept similar treatment during their game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a punter,'' Kelly said, ``but my reaction is that's
the last thing I'll put up with.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Lie of the week: In what could be a fixture in this column,
Ohio State coach John Cooper was once again caught lying to
reporters. This time, it was regarding his decision to insert
quarterback Steve Bellisari against UCLA immediately after
quarterback Austin Moherman led the Buckeyes to a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any kind of preconceived plan where we said,
`We're going to put this guy in after the third series,' '' Cooper
said. ``I think that would be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Bellisari let slip Monday that quarterbacks coach Tim Salem told
him the day before the UCLA game he would be going in on the fourth
series.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mental warfare: Why did Baylor inexplicably go for a
touchdown with eight seconds left and the ball at the 8-yard line
against UNLV, which led to a fumble that Rebels defensive back
Kevin Thomas returned 99 yards for a touchdown and a 27-24 victory?
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of speculation around Baylor that coach Kevin
Steele was going for an in-your-face touchdown to punish Rebels
coach John Robinson for his pregame comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play Baylor, it's always a physical game. But they
always do something to screw things up,'' Robinson said. ``That's
been the history of their program.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele denied he was trying to teach Robinson a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a one-in-a-million play and we got burned,'' Steele
said. ``It was a safe play. We were simply trying to create an
attitude about lining up and getting after people.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Who's at home? When Idaho plays at Washington State on
Saturday, it will technically be a road game for the Cougars as the
Vandals are borrowing Martin Stadium this year in an attempt to
meet NCAA-attendance standards in order to become a Division I-A
program.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State will comply with the charade by wearing its
white road jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, we will not be giving up too much,''
Washington State coach Mike Price said. ``We've got our same seats,
our same sideline, our same locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   And same crummy team?
</P>
<P>
   __ Pro placement: Entering this season, Colorado, Texas A&AMP;M and
Nebraska had 32 players each on NFL rosters, best among Big 12
schools. Next were Oklahoma (18), Texas (16) and Oklahoma State
(14).
</P>
<P>
   __ Media circus: Oregon coach Mike Bellotti banned a reporter
from practices because the journalist, who works for a publication
devoted to covering Oregon sports, posted a report on the Internet
that the coach thought gave away some secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The report, posted on the Fighting Ducks Review Web Site on Aug.
31, discussed some new offensive sets the Ducks ran through in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Bellotti became aware of the so-called breach following the
27-20 loss at Michigan State. Apparently, a Michigan State
assistant mentioned the Internet report to an Oregon assistant
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Bellotti said, making it clear that he didn't
think the report cost Oregon the game, but adding, ``Who's to know
if they would be prepared, but certainly now we know they were
prepared for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   __ League expansion: Conference USA could offer TCU and SMU
invitations to join the league this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the schools might not accept if their admittance fees are
too high or if they face the 2000 season as independents if they
are kicked out of the Western Athletic Conference after this year.
</P>
<P>
   There is also resistance from Louisville, DePaul, Saint Louis,
Cincinnati and Marquette, who are against adding the schools
because they would give the league 14 schools that play basketball
(Army and East Carolina are members of C-USA in football only).
</P>
<P>
   __ Add releaguing: ACC presidents met in Tallahassee this week,
and expansion was again one of the topics. The idea of adding Miami
as a 10th member will not die, even though several schools are
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The schools that do not like the idea want to preserve the
tradition that every football team plays every conference opponent.
And some would suffer significant financial losses from a smaller
allotment of tickets for the ACC men's basketball tournament.

CHECHEN MILITANTS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOSCOW BOMBINGS, RUSSIAN POLICE
SAY  
</HEADLINE>
  (See RUSSIA-BOMBS-POLITICS) 
(rk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian police said Wednesday that Chechen militants
had shipped tons of explosives into Moscow disguised as bags of
sugar and used them to carry out recent attacks that killed more
than 210 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found out who carried out the explosions,'' Moscow's
deputy police chief, Aleksander Veldyayev, said Wednesday. ``The
terrorist attacks were carried out by Chechen fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Muscovites believed that the bombings, which sent waves of
anxiety through the city, were the work of Islamic militants who
invaded Dagestan from bases in Chechnya, and people from the
Caucasus already have felt the backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the militants _ Shamil Basayev, the Chechen
warlord, and a Jordanian-born fighter known as Khattab _ insist
that they were not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not like to be compared to those who kill sleeping
civilians with bombs and shells,' said Khattab, referring to
Russian airstrikes against Chechnya in the war there.
</P>
<P>
   The charges and denials have prompted an important question: If
the aim of the bombings is to pressure Russia to abandon Dagestan,
why would the Islamic rebels deny any involvement?
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the mystery, a previously unknown group, the Dagestan
Liberation Army, Wednesday called the semiofficial Itar-Tass news
agency and claimed it had organized the attacks. But some experts
said they doubted the group even existed.
</P>
<P>
   Assigning responsibility is important. Public sentiment here for
tough action against Chechnya _ and the Chechens who live in Moscow
_ is running high. Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, has
said he planned to demand that Chechnya turn over the culprits
behind the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen government, however, asserts that Russian
conspirators carried out the attacks, possibly to provide a pretext
for the Yeltsin government to declare a state of emergency and
suspend the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one conclusion,'' said Chechnya's deputy prime
minister, Kazbek Makhashev. ``Russia needs a hot spot to solve its
own domestic political problems and its battle for power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen authorities do not support the militants, who have
become a power to themselves near the Chechnya-Dagestan border. But
they also do not want Russia to continue its bombing raids against
rebel positions inside Chechnya or step up its offensive by,
perhaps, launching a ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said that 27 suspects had been detained as
part of a campaign to find the people responsible for the
explosions, but in their briefings Wednesday, Russian police and
intelligence officials did not name any suspects.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted, however, that they had evidence that confirmed
the involvement of Chechen militants, aided by people of Slavic
appearance, an important asset since dark-skinned Chechens often
are viewed suspiciously in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining their case, Russian officials said that Chechen
fighters had shipped explosives disguised as bags of sugar to
Moscow by truck.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these bags were later found in the basement of a house
in southern Moscow. But it is not clear whether they were being
stored there or were to be used to blow up the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 19 tons of explosives were delivered to Moscow disguised
as sugar,'' Veldyayev said. ``Most of it has been discovered and
seized.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandr Zdanovich, a spokesman for the Federal Security
Service, one of the successors to the Soviet KGB, said, ``It is not
that important whether it was this organization or another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing,'' Zdanovich said, ``is that these
acts of terrorism are connected with the developments in Dagestan
and were planned in Chechnya by associates of Basayev and
Khattab.''

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS REOPENS LANDMARK THAT SNIPER USED IN 1966

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There are two buildings that lord over this
city, the state Capitol and the Tower, and officials at the
University of Texas like to point out that the Tower stands two
feet higher. On special occasions, such as a celebration of a
championship football season, the limestone structure is
illuminated in school colors and transformed into an orange torch
that glows above the campus.
</P>
<P>
   But if, as officials say, the Tower symbolizes the university's
heart and its aspirations, it is also tainted by tragedy _ one that
the university hoped would be finally put to rest as the Tower's
observation deck reopened Wednesday for the first time in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, 1966, a student, Charles Whitman, dragged a foot
locker filled with hunting rifles onto the Tower's observation deck
and fired at people below as if they were deer, killing 14 and
wounding 31. His rampage lasted 96 minutes, but has reverberated
for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as shootings at schools and office buildings occur with
disturbing frequency, the Whitman incident is mostly a grim
historic footnote. But in the 1960s, it helped define the decade
and further shattered the nation's sense of well being. If the
assassination of John F. Kennedy proved that even a president could
be killed, the Whitman attack marked a new and different terror _
that anyone anywhere could be killed at random, and by an Eagle
Scout, no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``People essentially said, `Don't ask about it. Please don't ask
about it,' '' said Dr. Kenneth Foote, a geography professor at the
university since 1982, recalling attitudes on campus about the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   After four other people jumped from the Tower, the last in 1974,
the stain of death became too great and the university closed the
observation deck. Wednesday, morning, in marking the university's
116th birthday, university president Larry Faulkner stepped onto
the deck and declared it reopened.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Faulkner noted that a generation of students not
yet born in Whitman's era wanted to enjoy the majestic views of
central Texas. But for an older generation of Texans, Faulkner's
gesture meant finally reclaiming the University's most beloved
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time for this university to move on and accept
the history that goes with this building and fully embrace the
positives,'' Faulkner said. Had he looked up, Faulkner could have
seen dark spots still marking where bullets had struck the stone.
</P>
<P>
   In reopening the deck at the request of student groups, Faulkner
faced skeptics who feared the Tower could again become a magnet for
suicides or a perch for a sniper. A stainless steel lattice was
erected to prevent jumpers and security checkpoints were built as
safeguards against weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lives of a lot of the survivors were terribly disturbed by
what happened,'' said Dr. Teresa Sullivan, the university's vice
president and graduate dean. ``We've still got people who can't
walk across the campus without looking over their shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, the 33rd anniversary of the shootings, university
officials dedicated a garden at the foot of the Tower to the memory
of the victims. Foote, who has written extensively about places
marred by violence, said that a sense of shame has often prevented
communities from publicly acknowledging heinous acts. He noted that
Salem, Mass., did not erect a memorial to the town's famous witch
trials for 300 years. Now, he said, events like the Oklahoma City
bombing or the Littleton, Colo., school shooting have changed
attitudes about how communities should deal with public grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing here is an attempt to come to terms with the
event,'' Foote said.
</P>
<P>
   Completed in 1937, the Tower is an architectural landmark, a
30-story beacon whose image is embossed on the university's logo.
Erected atop the central Main Building, the Tower has always served
as office space. In years past, students could ride the small
elevators to the 27th floor, then walk up a narrow stairwell to the
observation deck for a view that easily inspired wonder.

   ``That first morning,'' wrote the late Willie Morris in his
memoir, ``North Toward Home,'' reminiscing about his student days
in the 1950s, ``I took the elevator to the top, and looked out on
those majestic purple hills to the west, changing to lighter shades
of blue or a deeper purple as wisps of autumn clouds drifted around
the sun; this, they would tell me, was the Great Balconies Divide,
where the South ended and the West began.''

<P>
   Whitman, more than anyone or anything, shattered this serene
image.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Whitman was a married, 25-year-old ex-marine who was
studying architectural engineering. Shortly before noon on Aug. 1,
he carried a cache of weapons in his military foot locker up to the
deck. He killed a receptionist with the butt of his rifle, then
shot two tourists before barricading the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lavergne, author of ``A Sniper in the Tower,'' a
non-fiction account of the incident, said the entire campus lay
unaware below. Whitman had carried sandwiches, toilet paper and a
can of Spam, and as he took aim through his rifle scope, he fired
his first shot directly through the abdomen of a woman who was
eight months pregnant. When the unborn child's father bent over in
horror, Whitman killed him. The baby died, too, though the mother
survived.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Citizens rushed to the scene with hunting rifles and began
firing back as police officers armed with handguns were largely
helpless. Lavergne said the lessons of the Whitman case prompted
many police departments to develop the first SWAT teams. Until a
police officer finally broke through the barricade and killed him,
Whitman had been almost unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings horrified the nation. A television reporter, Neal
Spelce, broadcast a primitive audio feed to all three national
networks, foreshadowing today's all-encompassing media coverage of
such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``White middle-class America was shocked,'' said Dr. Rosa
Eberly, an assistant professor of rhetoric who has taught a course
on the Whitman attack and Wednesday participated with Foote in a
symposium on the Tower. ``Whitman was the smiling Eagle Scout.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's motive remains in dispute. Police discovered that he
had killed both his mother and his wife the night before the
shootings to spare them ``the shame'' for what he planned to do. He
had suffered headaches, and had even fantasized about killing
people from the Tower to a psychiatrist, who did not believe he
would do it. He left a note asking that an autopsy be performed on
his body to ``see if there is any mental disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy revealed a pecan-sized tumor in his brain, but
Lavergne said doctors disputed the possibility that it caused his
behavior. Other theories speculate that Whitman wanted to embarrass
his father or that he was under the influence of amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Without a concrete explanation and with university officials
long loath to discuss the attack, Dr. Eberly said, Whitman became a
minor cultural anti-hero. Country music singer Kinky Friedman
wrote, ``The Ballad of Charles Whitman,'' with the famous line,
``There was a rumor about a tumor.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many of today's students, Whitman is little more than a
vague figure. Adriana Mendoza, a 19-year-old sophomore from El
Paso, said she learned about the shootings this summer from a
television news program. Sitting on the grass beneath the Tower
this week, she said she wanted to go to the top, but she also
wanted assurances that she would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should be able to experience it and be safe when we
experience it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first public visits will occur Thursday. More than 500
people have booked reservations, nearly selling out the first two
weeks. Belongings must be left downstairs, and each group will be
escorted by an armed campus police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No foot lockers are going to go back up to the Tower again,''
said Dr. Sullivan, the graduate dean.
</P>
<P>
   Noting what she hopes are positive results from the reopening,
she added, ``One of the best ways we can say we are open for
business for all of you is to open the Tower. It's just too
important of a symbol of who we are.'' &QL;

INFLATION IS MISSING DESPITE FOUR YEARS OF BOOM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boom that has given such a strong lift to the U.S. economy
is four years old this quarter, but the much anticipated rise in
the inflation rate, which so often mars prosperous times, has
failed once again to make an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index rose in August by just 0.3 percent, the
Labor Department reported Wednesday. A spike in gasoline prices
accounted for most of the increase. Prices held pretty steady
otherwise, as they have month after month.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding food and energy, which tend to spike up in price and
then fall back, the so-called core inflation rate rose only 0.1
percent in August and 1.9 percent over the last year _ the lowest
yearlong rate in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that appears to be going up in price on a
consistent basis,'' said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist at the
Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, who helps to
calculate the monthly CPI.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of the last 25 years, mild inflation after so
many years of strong growth is an anomaly. Stock traders and
investors, uncertain how to interpret the low August inflation
rate, responded to the CPI report by driving up the Dow Jones
industrial average by more than 80 points in early trading, then
letting it fall by 108.91 points, to close at 10,801.42.
</P>
<P>
   The early run-up in stock prices suggested that Wall Street
initially interpreted the mild inflation number as reducing the
odds that the Federal Reserve's policy-makers would raise interest
rates at their Oct. 5 meeting. Higher rates tend to drive investors
out of stocks. And then later in the day, the initial
interpretation seemed to be reversed _ perhaps because of Tuesday's
report that retail sales had jumped in August. People are still
buying with abandon, which is potentially inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking a big rise in consumer spending this year,''
said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center
at Georgia State University. ``The Fed has to slow that down.''
</P>
<P>
   The mild CPI report is the last major economic statistic to be
released before the October Fed meeting. And with each month of
subdued inflation, despite the robust economy and the heavy
consumer spending, the Fed's top officials appear to be coming to
the conclusion that the economy has changed. The new view: Stronger
economic growth is possible without rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a general consensus within the Fed, between the hawks
and the doves, that you have this new higher speed limit on
economic growth,'' said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G.
Lanston &AMP; Co., a Wall Street firm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Fed's top officials appear to be demonstrating a willingness
to tolerate an economy that grows at an annual rate of 3 percent,
or even a bit more. That is still not as much as the actual growth
over the last four years, far and away the strongest of the current
expansion. The growth since late 1995 has averaged 3.76 percent
annually. But the 3 percent is considerably above the 2 percent to
2.25 percent that the Fed in the mid-1990s considered the upper
limit on growth before inflation would inevitably accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the Fed responded with higher rates to slow
growth, often acting ``pre-emptively'' before inflation actually
accelerated. Now the response is less aggressive. A quarter point
increase in short-term rates at the last Fed meeting, on Aug. 24,
came with the statement that the risk of rising inflation ``should
markedly diminish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed is sort of playing it by ear,'' said William Dudley,
director of domestic economic research at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve officials appear to increasingly accept the view
that the supply of goods and services, in this country and the rest
of the world, exceeds the demand and will most likely continue to
do so for months to come, eliminating inflationary shortages. Then,
too, a lower unemployment rate is possible without provoking
inflationary wage demands. And the productivity growth rate _
measuring the rising output of a worker for each hour on the job _
has gone to a higher level, if not permanently then for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unanticipated increase in the rate of growth of
productivity is an example of a favorable supply shock, temporarily
lowering inflation,'' Lawrence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, said in a
recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   Measurement changes also play a role. Even with energy and food
included, the CPI has risen by only 2.3 percent for the 12-month
period ending with August. But changes in the way the CPI is
calculated, to improve accuracy, have reduced the CPI by
four-tenths of a percentage point a year since 1995. If the old
practices were still used, the 12-month average would be 2.7
percent, not 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other than price spikes for gasoline and for citrus
fruit, the August report was notably weak. Prices for new cars and
trucks fell. So did apparel prices, computer prices and airline
fares, thanks to discounting. Health care costs have plateaued
since last summer at an annual increase of 3.4 percent, less than
forecasters had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rising home prices, shelter costs were up 0.2 percent in
August and only 2.2 percent over the last 12 months. And while
gasoline prices rose 5.6 percent in August and citrus prices by 4.8
percent, both seem likely to increase by smaller amounts in
September, according to various estimates. Tobacco prices, however,
which had fallen by 1.3 percent in August, are expected to spike
upward this month as a result of price increases announced by the
cigarette companies.

CONGRESS MAKES FINAL PUSH ON TAX CUT BILL 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress paid their last respects
Wednesday to their cherished $792 billion tax-cutting bill, then
sent it to the White House for a certain veto by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At successive campaign-style events on Capitol Hill, Republicans
said sending a portion of excess government revenues back to
taxpayers was only fair, and Democrats said the plan would require
deep cuts in essential government services while risking the
country's economic health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know this is dead on arrival at the White
House,'' said Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The initial round in the battle over how to apportion the
projected federal budget surplus will thus go to Clinton, who says
the money the Republican majority in Congress wants to use for its
tax cut over the next 10 years should be split among spending
programs, debt reduction and a much smaller tax cut. Clinton, who
is scheduled to return to Washington early Thursday from a trip to
New Zealand, is expected to veto the tax bill within days if not
hours of arriving home.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans remain a bit bewildered as to why their tax cut _
the largest to pass Congress since 1981 _ generated relatively
little public enthusiasm. But they have decided to cut their losses
and move away from the tax-cut fight to what they consider firmer
ground, their effort to hold the line on government spending.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the Republicans are trying to leave open the
long-range question of what to do with the $3 trillion surplus
expected to accumulate over the next decade, hoping they can work
that out with a Republican president in a year and a half. Instead,
they are now focusing on passing the spending bills needed to run
the government in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, and saying they
are uninterested in negotiating a compromise with the White House
that would trade a smaller tax cut over the long run for additional
spending on Democratic priorities next year.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the spending bills is a prosaic task, and the focus on
doing so illustrates how the Republicans have scaled back their
agenda in the face of Clinton's opposition since taking control of
Congress in the 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a job that Republicans believe will resonate
politically because it will revolve around the sensitive issue of
dipping into next year's projected surplus of $161 billion,
especially the $147 billion portion generated by excess Social
Security revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are still a long way from making their numbers add
up, Republicans say they can finance the government's operations
next year without dipping into Social Security. To do so,
Republicans will have to resort to an array of budget gimmicks and
use the $14 billion surplus expected to be generated next year by
general tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they are basically daring Clinton to prove he can do any
better, asserting that for the White House to make good on its
promises to spend more on education, health, the environment and
other areas would require one of two politically unacceptable
steps: raising taxes or raiding Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties for decades have routinely spent payroll tax
revenues earmarked to pay future Social Security benefits, simply
issuing government IOU's to Social Security in return. But with the
budget surplus swelling, Republicans and Democrats alike have
pledged to keep their hands off the Social Security money, in
effect designating that it be used to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say right now that we will not allow this president to
spend the Social Security trust fund dollars,'' said Sen. Trent
Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they can make their budget add up
without touching Social Security, albeit through steps like an
increase in tobacco taxes that Republicans say they will never
accept. White House officials are primarily interested in luring or
pressuring Republicans to come to the negotiating table to take up
not just next year's spending bills, but a broader agenda of issues
including Social Security, Medicare, reducing the national debt and
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we are going to reject this partisan, fictional
budget,'' Gore told the Democrats' rally on Capitol Hill. ``But in
the aftermath of its rejection, we want them to come back and work
out a reasonable solution so that we can avoid the kind of train
wreck that they have headed us toward.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the best forum for compromise may
prove to be the Senate Finance Committee, which is developing
legislation to deal with Medicare's long-term financial problems
and to add a prescription drug benefit to the program. The
committee is one of the few in Congress over the last few years to
have a record of bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Senate Finance Committee were to undertake Medicare in
a serious way,'' said Jacob J. Lew, the director of the White
House's Office of Management and Budget, ``one thing could lead to
another in ways that make it too soon to rule out having a broader,
more comprehensive set of outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is also talk among Republicans of trying to use a routine
tax bill that is likely to come up for consideration in the next
few months as a vehicle to resuscitate some of the more popular
provisions of the much larger bill Clinton is about to veto, such
as a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty that hurts many
two-income couples. The routine bill would extend expiring tax
provisions like a research tax credit for business.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said he was not yet sure whether there was any chance of
getting a substantial tax cut signed into law this year.
</P>
<P>
   But like other Republicans, many of whom feel they have come out
second best in budget negotiations with Clinton over the last few
years, Archer said he was suspicious that the White House would
insist on gutting the ideological core of the Republican tax plan
to get a deal by emphasizing income redistribution over tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm concerned about is that if the White House gets into
a negotiating mode with us,'' Archer said in an interview, ``they
will want to give tax relief to people who don't pay any taxes.
That runs against what we're trying to do, which is giving a refund
to the people who are overpaying what the government needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer said Republicans should be proud of having passed a big
tax bill, and of ``stemming the tide of the aggressive left.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans said they were nervous about assuming that
reaching a standoff with Clinton on taxes and spending amounts to
an accomplishment that voters will reward in next year's
congressional elections, in which control of the House will be up
for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is a similar debate under way among Democrats in Congress
and within the White House, with opinion divided about the relative
merits of sticking to a defensive strategy of blocking Republican
initiatives and of seeking progress through compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are also gauging the risks that the fiscal standoff
could escalate into a conflict that leads to a shutdown of parts of
the federal government, as happened during a similar showdown in
1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   G. William Hoagland, staff director of the Senate Budget
Committee, said that in the context of a $1.7 trillion federal
budget there was relatively little money separating the two parties
in their dispute over the spending bills and that the chance of a
government shutdown was low.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanley E. Collender, managing director of the
Fleischman-Hillard federal budget consulting group, said that the
difficulty Republicans have had in holding together their slim
majority in the House made the outlook risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood of a train wreck is not terrific,'' Collender
said, ``but an accident is much more likely to happen than people
are willing to admit.''

PRICES OF TREASURIES REBOUND AS FEARS OF RATE INCREASE EASE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities rebounded somewhat on Wednesday
from their previous day's losses after tame consumer price data
eased investor fears that the Federal Reserve would raise
short-term interest rates again at its monetary policy meeting next
month.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day the 30-year bellweather Treasury bond was up
8/32, to a price of 100 11/32, pushing its yield, which moves in
the opposite direction, down to 6.10 percent, from 6.12 percent on
Tuesday. Traders said early sharp gains were erased, when the
dollar dropped against the yen and the euro in currency trading,
sapping foreign investors' demand for Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   A weakening dollar makes foreign investors cautious about owning
American securities because they could lose money when they convert
from dollars into their own currencies.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the core rate of the August Consumer Price Index
showed a lower-than-forecast 0.1 percent gain from July, while the
overall CPI rose 0.3 percent in August, following a similar rise in
July. Ballooning energy prices fueled the increases in both months.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation data are producing mixed signals, according to
some economists, as the overall CPI is slowly but steadily inching
upward on a trend basis, while at the same time the core rate,
which excludes food and energy, continues to creep downward.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management
said, ``Without question, the overall strength of the economy,
particularly the recent statistics for consumer spending, coupled
with the slowing trend in the CPI must be causing some dismay for
the preemptive-minded Fed committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' he added, ``relatively benign wage
pressures and favorable core inflation trends certainly provide the
Fed with latitude to maintain its current policy stance.'' In
addition, Fine said, ``the usually prescient Treasury bond market
does not seem to be signaling an imminent Fed tightening, although
upcoming economic data releases between now and Oct. 5 that could
influence the FOMC decision process make this a fluid situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All things considered, another round of tightening seems
likely before the year is out, with the timing of the movement yet
to be determined,'' said Fine. ``Indeed, history shows that those
who ignore energy prices and their impact on overall inflation do
so at their own risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, strong gains were posted by corporate bonds, agencies
and other spread products that are priced off government bond
yields.

 &HT;    O'Connell hits LeMans stride
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service ATLANTA _ The record 50 cars lining up
<TEXT>
for Saturday's Petit Le Mans will be a severe traffic jam.
<P>
   Maybe Panoz driver Johnny O'Connell, who lives 15 minutes away
in Flowery Branch, and his teammates will benefit from having to
drive in Atlanta traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be quite the show, especially with all the
traffic,'' O'Connell said. ``That's going to be the determining
factor to me, whose car is best in traffic, who can go through 10
hours without having a wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell is an Indy 500 veteran, a driver now in the top five
of the American Le Mans Series' 80 prototype drivers, a potential
champion with 20 years of experience at age 37.
</P>
<P>
   But he's had an up-and-down career. He won at Sebring in 1994;
was on A.J. Foyt's IRL team in 1997; ran as high as eighth in the
1996 Indy 500 before his car failed with fuel pump problems; and
won the ALMS race at Mosport this year.
</P>
<P>
   He also wiped out a Panoz GTR-1 during Petit Le Mans qualifying
last year when he hit an oil slick; had a debilitating injury
during the 1997 Indy 500 qualifications; and lost his job with
Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the points race indicates, O'Connell is on a roll coming
into Saturday's race.
</P>
<P>
   After winning Mosport, he and co-driver Jan Magnusson of
Denmark, who is tied with O'Connell in points, have finished third
at Sears Point and Portland. Their consistency is a surprise,
because they're driving a car so new that it didn't exist when
Sebring ran in March.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiled at the ALMS race April 18 at Road Atlanta, the Panoz
Roadster S wowed the crowd and scared the competition by starting
35th and finishing fifth, a feat equaled only by the race-winning
MKIII Riley &AMP; Scott Judd, which started 34th.
</P>
<P>
   The Panoz Roadster S, a front-engined upstart, turned in the
third-fastest speed in Le Mans qualifying. The two Panoz entries
finished eighth and 11th in the race, another surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans called the old Panoz GTR-1 ``The Batmobile.''. They'll
have to call the new Roadster S a ``clown's shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Black, wide and low with front fenders rising out of the body
and a small cockpit way in back, it does look odd next to the
typical mid- or rear-engined LMP, but it's a screamer.
</P>
<P>
   They've done such a huge redesign,'' O'Connell said. ``Other
than the engine in front and the gear box in the back, it's all
new. It has transformed the car and it's much nicer to drive now.
It's such a well-behaved car.

 &HT;    European underdogs rising
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The European Champions League was expanded to 32 teams
to help the big boys ensure a place in the first-round draw, but a
surprising batch of opening-week results has given the underdogs
plenty of hope for further upsets.
</P>
<P>
   Late rallies by Barcelona and Real Madrid prevented certain
losses, and defending champion Manchester United was held to a
scoreless draw at home.
</P>
<P>
   In the most dramatic contest, goals in the 86th minute by
Abelardo Fernandez and three minutes into injury time by Dani
lifted Barca to a 2-1 win over AIK Stockholm in Group B Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   United, missing eight players because of injury, was drawn 0-0
at Old Trafford on Tuesday by Croatia Zagreb in Group D. Bayern
Munich, last year's runner-up, got two goals from Paulo Sergio,
including the winner in the 69th minute, to beat PSV Eindhoven 2-1
in Group F. NK Maribor of Slovenia downed Dynamo Kyiv, a
semifinalist last year, by a 1-0 count in Group A.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Real Madrid finished with a 3-3 draw against Olympiakos
thanks to an 80th-minute strike by Raul Gonzalez in Group E, while
a penalty kick by Gheorghe Hagi with four minutes left gave Turkish
champions Galatasaray a 2-2 Group H draw at Hertha Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Two highly anticipated games didn't live up to the billing. In
Florence, Arsenal's Nwankwo Kanu attempted a weak penalty kick late
that Fiorentina keeper Francesco Toldo saved easily for a 0-0 Group
B draw. Chelsea dominated its first match in the Champions League,
vs. AC Milan in London, but settled for another 0-0 draw in Group
H.
</P>
<P>
   UEFA Cup: Parma to defend
</P>
<P>
   After elimination from Champions League qualifying, Parma today
begins its reign as champion of the UEFA Cup _ think of it as
European soccer's version of basketball's NIT tournament, only
twice as big and just as meaningless. Parma plays at home against
Ukrainian side Krivbas in the first leg of a first-round series.
The UEFA Cup, which absorbed the now-defunct Cup Winners Cup,
features 96 teams and has been won by Italian clubs six of the last
seven years. In Sofia, Bulgaria, on Tuesday, Montpellier won 1-0
over Crvena of Yugoslavia. Also on Tuesday, Leeds beat Partizan
Belgrade 3-1 in a match in Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico: America tops Chivas
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Blanco had both goals as Club America bested Chivas
2-0 Sunday in the first major clash of the Invierno season. Blanco
leads the league with six goals in five games. The loss was the
first for Chivas, who host Toros Neza on Sunday seeking to keep
pace in Group 4 with leaders Necaxa, which romped over UAG 4-2.
Sergio Vazquez and Agustin Delgado had two goals each for the
winners, who have a league-high 13 points.... Struggling Cruz Azul
earned its first victory of the season in a 3-0 blanking of
Morelia.... Defending Verano champion Toluca surprisingly was tied
by Puebla 0-0 but still leads Group 1 by four points.... Atlas
remained tied with America at the top of Group 3 by routing Celaya
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   South America: Baring all
</P>
<P>
   Brazil: Sao Paulo club officials are unamused that goalkeeper
Roger is the current nude centerfold spread in G Magazine, a
national gay-men's glossy. He's not the first Brazilian league star
to pose for the publication.... Argentina: San Lorenzo stayed atop
the Apertura, but Boca Juniors kept pace with a 2-0 win over Ferro
Carril Oeste as Martin Palermo scored his eighth goal in six
games.... Uruguay: Antonio Pacheco had five goals to keep Penarol
ahead in the Clausura with a 6-1 win over River Plate.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: Hamburg rolling
</P>
<P>
   Hamburg hasn't added a trophy since the Cup Winners' Cup in
1987, and it's too early to talk about a first Bundesliga title
since 1983, when it also won the European Cup. But Saturday's 5-0
throttling of Hertha Berlin, thanks to a hat trick by Roy Praeger
to keep them atop the league, has raised hopes.... Less than a week
after Kaiserslautern sweeper and captain Ciriaco Sforza was taken
off the starting lineup for criticizing coach Otto Rehhagel's
tactics, he was asked to return after a 5-0 loss to Werder Bremen.
</P>
<P>
   England: Wednesday reeling
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield Wednesday remained on the bottom of the Premier League
table after a 2-0 loss to Everton, increasing talk that manager
Danny Wilson is out soon... Liverpool's resurgence was short-lived,
thanks to defensive mistakes in a 3-2 loss to Manchester United at
Anfield. The Red Devils scored twice courtesy of own goals by Jamie
Carragher.

WASHINGTON: re-election effort.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both Feingold and McCain conceded that they had no solid vote
counts and did not know whether their new approach could succeed.
They run the risk of gaining some new Republican supporters but
losing some of their Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Democrats will have concerns,'' Feingold admitted. But he
said he believed Democrats would be misguided to stand against a
soft money ban. ``I don't think Democrats either would on
philosophical grounds or should on practical grounds ever pretend
they will come out ahead if we continue with soft money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were some signs Wednesday that Democrats will still try to
fight for passage of the same bill that the House approved,
252-177.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think it would be too bad if we had the chance to
get comprehensive reform and it somehow got undermined by a less
comprehensive bill,'' said Ranit Schmelzer, the press secretary for
Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader. She added, however,
that ``if that is not feasible we're committed to getting a bill
though the Senate that will go to conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides banning soft money, the new McCain-Feingold bill will
codify a Supreme Court decision that gave people who work in union
shops where they are required to pay dues the right to ask for the
return of the portion of the money that is used for political
activity.
</P>
<P>
   That stops far short of calls by Republicans to require labor
unions to receive prior written consent from all union members
before using dues for political activity.

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The news hit close to home _ too close for comfort, in most cases.
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so nobody in college football tends to have much sympathy
for Steve Spurrier, the wisecracking, condescending,
beat-'em-as-badly-as-you-can head coach of the University of
Florida's Gators. In this instance, though, even a couple of
Spurrier's most bitter rivals were ready to offer tea and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that terrifies you as a coach, because you
really can't control it,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said.
``It's scary how they can get to these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Phillip Fulmer shares the fear. Volunteers fans may
smirk about a troubled offseason in Gainesville as the No. 2 Vols
and the No. 4 Gators get ready to meet again Saturday night at
``The Swamp,'' but the coach of the defending national champions
isn't smiling.
</P>
<P>
   (Well, not in public, at least.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely terrifying, from a coaching standpoint, to
even think about agents being on your campus,'' Fulmer said.
``We're trying all the time to educate our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Fulmer went to extreme measures to drive home the
message. Star linebacker and team leader Al Wilson agreed to
address a meeting, where he would offer a startling ``confession.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was almost in tears,'' Fulmer recalls. ``He told the team
he was real sorry, but he'd been involved with an agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer asked that his players turn in their 1997 Southeastern
Conference championship rings. The room fell silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dwayne Goodrich was about to cry,'' Fulmer said. ``His lip
started quivering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a set-up thing, but we wanted to make a point of how
big a deal the agents are.''
</P>
<P>
   That point has been made at Florida, where a disappointing 1998
season was made all the more dreary by revelations that several
players may have been receiving under-the-table payments from
agents before completing their eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Orange Bowl, the school suspended Tim Beauchamp and
Dock Pollard for violations of university rules. The two later were
alleged to have received money from an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Later, three former players _ Johnny Rutledge, Reggie McGrew and
Jevon Kearse _ were linked to agent William ``Tank'' Black. In
affidavits, the three alleged that a representative for Black paid
them thousands of dollars while they were playing for the Gators.
Rutledge also said he had been told former players Ike Hilliard and
Fred Taylor had received cash from Black during their college days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything we can to teach the guys the rules, what's
right and what's wrong,'' Spurrier said earlier this summer. ``We
suspended two players before the Orange Bowl _ the two we found out
about. We would have suspended the others, too, if we'd known about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just bad choices by those players. The only thing we
can do as coaches and administrators is to show them you can't
break the rules and be a Gator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those players broke the rules willingly, and they're not going
to be welcomed back. They're not going to be able to use the weight
room. They sort of lost a home there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Florida endured most of the negative headlines, other
coaches who regularly make the polls and flirt with national titles
worry about what might be going undetected on their own campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the irregularities _ what they're driving, clothes,
expensive coats _ we ask the questions,'' Fulmer said. ``We're
trying. What it comes down to is that the kid has to do what's
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, we agree not to have any contact. We've had this
going on for four years now. They're going to talk to (agents)
after the bowl game. That's when they need an agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some peer pressure. We all agree it's not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After a spring and summer of bad publicity, Florida tries to
make sure it doesn't happen again. In the meantime, the Gators also
hope to get back to the business of contending for the national
championship, a goal that went awry early last season when they
lost in overtime in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   That game provided the springboard for Tennessee's national
title run. It also relegated Spurrier's team to second place in the
Southeastern Conference Eastern Division.
</P>
<P>
   A similar crossroads awaits Saturday night. Spurrier hopes his
team is more focused than the one that later lost to Florida State,
the other team that went on to play for the national championship
in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Galling? Not immediately, Spurrier says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was galling was when UCLA and Kansas State lost,'' he
recalls. ``After we lost to FSU (in Tallahassee), there was a
feeling of, `Well, gosh, we weren't in the big game anyway.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, bang, those teams lose .''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, missing out on a trip to the desert would become a
lesser concern as tales of agents and runners and free-flowing cash
engulfed the program. Still, Spurrier regards the rout of Syracuse
in the Orange Bowl as a good starting point for 1999, and having a
younger, less-experienced team this season may come at just the
right time for all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``These players are a little bit more fun to coach,'' he said.
``They look at you a little more like the coaches know what you're
doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the coaches they are looking at are different,
too. Defensive coordinator Bob Stoops left to become head man at
Oklahoma. Assistant offensive coordinator and running backs coach
Carl Franks moved on to run the show at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   So far, results in their absence have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Gators are rolling. With Doug Johnson at
quarterback, Florida routed Western Michigan and Central Florida
and amassed 1,193 total yards in the two lopsided wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Doug has a better understanding and knowledge of our
offense,'' Spurrier said. ``He knows a little more what to check to
and what to get out of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early, but I really believe Doug's going to have a
big year.''
</P>
<P>
   He may need to do just that. The Florida defense, under new
coordinator Jon Hoke, has allowed 784 passing yards in two games,
405 of those against Western Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Gators put a 29-game home win streak on the line as
Tennessee tries to win in Gainesville for the first time since
1971. After owning the Vols for much of the '90s, Florida tries to
re-establish dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a bit of the swagger is returning to the tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we won't say more than we can back up,'' Spurrier
said. ``But I saw in the paper that we were favored by two points.
</P>
<P>
   ``So how are we supposed to act?''
</P>
<P>
   Like Florida, of course. With a chance to put an ugly 12 months
behind them, Spurrier and the Gators hope to see the skies finally
clearing in more ways than one.

   NASSAU, Bahamas _ Despite extensive damage to houses and land on
some of the islands east of here, Bahamian officials said Wednesday
they were cautiously optimistic that they survived a pummeling from
Hurricane Floyd with only one reported fatality.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after the hurricane lashed some of the
islands with 140-mph winds, officials were hampered in their damage
assessments by downed phone lines, blackouts, flooded runways and
insufficient aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Based on phone and radio reports received by disaster relief
officials, the worst hit islands were Abaco, Eleuthera, Cat and San
Salvador. There were reports of roofs being ripped off many homes,
extensive flooding, toppled utility poles and thousands of uprooted
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The only confirmed fatality was on Grand Bahama, where a man
driving along a flooded road was swept into the ocean and drowned,
Godwin Blyden, the national disaster coordinator, said.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial reconnaissance showed extensive damage on Little Abaco,
where Blyden said several people had been reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Coast Guard plane flying over Sandy Point on Little Abaco
observed large swaths of land covered with fallen trees whose thin,
brown limbs had been stripped bare of leaves. Almost every house
visible from the air had been damaged, from complete collapse of
walls that folded in on themselves, to roofs that were sent flying
across the road leaving behind concrete skeletons exposed to the
sky. Some roads were flooded, or covered with dirt and tree limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Though the winds were less severe on Nassau's New Providence
Island, blasts of up to 90 mph sent trees crashing to the ground,
while heavy rains inundated some roads. By late afternoon
Wednesday, most of the roads were passable, although trees and
pools of water limited passage to one lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were quite fortunate the damage was not more substantial
than it is,'' said Blyden, who has had to rely on sporadic phone
and radio contact with the most affected islands. ``Until we can do
a full assessment that may be different. It's difficult to say with
any degree of precision where the most serious damage occurred. We
have several reports of substantial damage, and I don't want to
minimize their losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach the affected areas Wednesday were delayed by a
lack of phone or radio service to the islands. While power and
phones have been restored to about 50 percent of capacity in
Nassau, service remains down on the other islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there was no communication we were not certain if
runways were open,'' Blyden said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard dispatched several helicopters to transport
Bahamian and U.S. officials to assess the damage on the outlying
islands. The Coast Guard also sent several small jet planes to
conduct aerial reconnaissance. A team from the Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance, from the U.S. Agency for International
Development, also arrived here Wednesday to assist the Bahamian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Martinez, the public affairs officer at the American
Embassy, said some of the Coast Guard planes dispatched Wednesday
had to first check out reports of people needing assistance before
they could do a more general survey of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't find any people in distress or critically
injured,'' Ms. Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, a Coast Guard jet flying over Freeport circled
the skies as the crew tried to find the source of a distress signal
that buzzed repeatedly. It turned out to be from an airplane part
near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Blyden said that there was substantial land erosion on
Eleuthera, leaving several houses teetering on their foundations.
He added that docks were seriously damaged and that wind and
flooding had damaged several farms. On San Salvador, he said, there
was extensive flooding of roads and a lot of roof damage.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were still signs of damage in Nassau, the airport
as well as government offices planned to resume normal operations
on Thursday. The weather was hot and sunny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely perfect now,'' Blyden said. ``The sea is calm.
You would not believe a hurricane went by yesterday.''

   DARWIN, Australia _ A day after they were evacuated from their
smoldering homeland, the refugees from East Timor told harrowing
stories here Wednesday of the terror that followed the province's
vote to be independent of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   There was a numbing sameness to the tales of violence and
brutality at the hands of street gangs who opposed East Timor's
independence. But each refugee seemed to recall an indelible moment
of fear.
</P>
<P>
   For Mario, a gnarled man of about 50, it was when he was trapped
in a schoolyard in the capital, Dili, by a gang of militia members.
As they advanced on him and his family with guns and machetes, the
family fled to the gates of the adjacent U.N. compound. But the
gates were closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Now we will all die,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, men and women began clambering over the wall of
the compound, slashing their arms and legs on the razor wire. They
tried to push babies through the wire, and then resorted to tossing
them over the wall. Mario watched as one boy got stuck and tumbled
across the wall, streaked in blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They destroyed all our houses,'' he said, brushing tears from
his eyes. ``There's nothing there now.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sebastiao Guterres, an East Timorese who worked at the U.N.
mission, the moment came two days after the independence ballot on
Aug. 30. The sudden explosion of violence forced his father, uncle
and brother to flee into the hills near Dili.
</P>
<P>
   His uncle, Manuel Sarmento, later returned to Dili to try to buy
rice and other supplies for the swelling number of people hiding in
the hills. As he drove into town, a gang of militia members stopped
his car and ordered him out. Several witnesses told Guterres that
he was gunned down on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back to East Timor as quickly as I can, so we
can kick those people out,'' Guterres said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the horror these people have witnessed, the atmosphere
in the camp Wednesday was not bleak. Children scampered amid the
olive-drab tents, laughing and hooting as they played ball. Their
parents sat on army-issue cots in the shade, talking softly and
smoking cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   One woman dressed in black was cradling a 12-day-old baby. She
explained that she was in mourning for her husband, who was slain
by a militia member last April. But she said she was hopeful for
her new son's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy is the future of East Timor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ugliness of East Timor seemed to follow them even to
the sanctuary of a refugee camp on the northern coast of Australia.
Australian police said they had pulled aside a small group of
people suspected of being militia members from the 1,460 refugees
who arrived in Darwin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   These people were being held in another location, and officials
said it was not yet known how they would be handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were identified as being in a potential conflict with
other people in the group,'' said Mick Van Heythuysen, an
Australian police officer who is overseeing the tent city.
</P>
<P>
   That a group of suspected militia members could climb on a plane
with refugees says a lot about East Timor. Despite their relentless
campaign of violence against pro-independence people, the villains
and their victims were close _ neighbors in what was a small place.
</P>
<P>
   Several refugees said Wednesday that they knew or even had
relatives who were members of anti-independence militias. That is
partly because the militia groups often force young people to join
their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Mendonca, 19, said he had been ordered to join a group to
provide security in a village near Dili. When he balked, the leader
said, ``If you don't come with us, you'll be killed.'' He sought
refuge in the U.N. compound.
</P>
<P>
   Guterres said he sympathized with these young people because he
believed that they were being manipulated by the gang leaders.
Refugees here spoke of gang leaders feeding amphetamine-like pills
to the young recruits to make them agitated and increase their
capacity to wreak havoc. A U.N. official said he had heard such
reports but could not confirm them.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials said it was too early to say where the
refugees would go from here. But in talking to the refugees
Wednesday, it was clear that most wanted to go back to an
independent East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If East Timor gains independence, we will all go back,'' said
Mendonca, as a circle of young men nodded vigorously in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   With the United Nations having approved a peacekeeping operation
early Wednesday, the opportunity may come before too long.
Australia is expected to lead the international force, which would
set off from Darwin.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GETTING THE U.N. ACT IN HIGH GEAR
 &HT;    For use on or after Sunday, Sept. 19
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Before the White House belatedly signed off on the
creation of a multinational force of up to 8,000 troops to quash
the violence in East Timor, national security adviser Sandy Berger
made the case for doing nothing. ``You know,'' he told reporters,
``my daughter has a very messy apartment up in college. Maybe I
should intervene to have that cleaned up.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her flaws, Berger's daughter hardly competes with the
mess created by Indonesian soldiers and militias on that forlorn
island. Beyond a fearful loss of life, the vandals looted some $10
million in equipment and vehicles. U.S. taxpayers no doubt will be
asked to pay up in making good the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Valuable time was lost because U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
needed to start from scratch in setting up an interim military
mission. Earlier this year, similar haggling within the Security
Council over who would do what prolonged the fighting in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the time has come to set up a permanent peacekeeping
force under the United Nations flag _ one that could be rapidly
deployed in such places as East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a novel notion. In 1993, Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
Annan's predecessor in the secretary-general's post, sought to sell
Madeleine Albright, then the U.S. envoy to the U.N., on the merits
of a standing quick-response force. But Boutros-Ghali's plan made
several senators livid and gave Albright yet another reason to have
him dumped.
</P>
<P>
   Now Annan has quietly circulated a draft that spells out ``the
need for a system of standby arrangements.'' It ought to be
considered. In its absence, we're left with an alphabet soup of
units, each operating under its own rules of engagement and each
more or less charged with keeping a distance between people who
hate one another.
</P>
<P>
   Before East Timor (UNAMET) and Kosovo (UNMIK), deployments were
brokered to serve in such diverse places as Bosnia (SFOR), Haiti
(UNMIH), Rwanda and Zaire (UNAMIR and UNMGLR), Cyprus (UNFICYP),
the Golan Heights (UNDOF), Lebanon (UNIFIL), Kuwait and Iraq
(UNIKOM and UNIMOG), Cambodia (UNTAC), India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP)
and Tajikistan (UNMOT) and Georgia (UNOMIG).
</P>
<P>
   Without any fanfare, the Pentagon already runs a 7-week
``Democratic Sustainment Course'' at Fort Benning, Ga., that covers
human rights and that could act as a training nucleus for a
permanent force. The syllabus calls for teaching the ``theory and
practice of military and civilian leadership in a constitutional
nation-state.''
</P>
<P>
   When the antagonists have felt queasy about the labyrinthine
U.N. process, a substitute has been found, such as the MFO team in
the Sinai, which was created in the aftermath of the 1978 Camp
David Accords. The 11 currently participating MFO states are as
good a model as any for a permanent force: Australia, Canada,
Colombia, Fiji, France, Hungary, Italy, New Zealand, the United
States, Uruguay and Norway. (Germany and Japan help out with the
bills.)
</P>
<P>
   Overall these forces have climbed from 30 soldiers in 1947 to a
high of 78,500 in 1993, before receding to 18,800 last year. In the
current world climate, a standing force of, say, 10,000 peacemakers
is apt to find suitable work.

WORRIES OVER INFLATION AND THE DOLLAR SEND STOCK PRICES LOWER
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks closed broadly lower on Wednesday, as
continued nervousness over interest rates and the dollar dashed an
early rally.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a market-friendly government report on inflation
sent prices up, but the market reversed course when some investors
used the strength to lighten positions, while others stood aside as
the bond market lost the bulk of its own gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're not through with this correction,'' said Charles
J. Pradilla, chief strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities. ``Both
markets are still very skeptical'' that the Federal Reserve, which
has twice raised interest rates this summer, will be able to avoid
doing so again as the economy keeps barreling ahead. The next
policy meeting is scheduled for Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which quickly sprinted to a
103-point gain after the Labor Department announced that consumer
prices edged up just 0.1 percent last month, not counting food and
energy, finished with a loss of 108.91 points, most of it in the
last 30 minutes. The blue-chip gauge lost 120 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the final hour, Birinyi Associates said, three sizable sell
programs chipped 93 points off the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ``People haven't got a conviction here,'' said Richard B. Hoey,
research director at the Dreyfus Corp., adding that the dollar's
weakness against the yen reflected investment money moving to
Japan, where the economy is expanding.
</P>
<P>
   Another depressant on Wednesday was Oracle's earnings, which
were announced late Tuesday and did not meet the most optimistic
hopes. The stock skidded 2}, to 42 11/16, as 64.2 million shares
changed hands. The second most active issue was Microsoft, the top
stock in total value, which slumped 2 7/16, to 92|, on 24.2 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   These issues, along with other high-technology stocks, also
dragged down the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq market, which
lost 1.37 percent and 1.89 percent, respectively. The S.&AMP; P. shed
18.32 points, to 1,317.97, while the Nasdaq lost 54.12 points, to
2,814.17.
</P>
<P>
   The S.&AMP; P. is now up only 7.2 percent for the year, barely half
the gain it had posted in hitting a new record on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   Some stocks involved in possible mergers bucked the downtrend.
Bestfoods climbed 4 3/16, to 53[, while H.J. Heinz, with which it
was reported to be negotiating, rose 1 7/16, to 44|. Visio, to be
acquired by Microsoft for stock, jumped 6], to 39~.
</P>
<P>
   But investors frowned on Motorola, down 6 9/16, to 86|, after
announcing the purchase of General Instrument, which fell 3 29/128,
to 47 35/128.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance stocks were fractionally mixed as Hurricane Floyd bore
down on the Southeast Coast. Allstate gained 7/16, to 32 9/16,
after losing 1 7/16 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some oil stocks were sizable losers, especially Mobil and Exxon,
on reports that they would be forced as a merger condition to give
up many branded stations in the Northeast. Mobil slumped 3 3/16, to
100[; Exxon 1 15/16, to 77\.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a moderate 787.38
million, with 1,772 stocks down compared with 1,201 that moved up.
New 52-week lows swamped new highs by 194 to 46.
</P>
<P>
   Dupont, down 4, to 62[, had the biggest negative effect on the
Dow industrials. The company said its nylon unit would halt or
delay some Asian projects.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas markets were moderately lower in Europe and Japan, but
Brazil's Bovespa tumbled 1.71 percent.

 &HT;    Miami game worries Penn State's Paterno
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No. 3 Penn State (3-0) has a lot to worry about when
it travels to No. 8 Miami (2-0) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1, the Hurricanes are rested after a week off. Penn State
coach Joe Paterno says this Miami team is close to those of old.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids play with a lot of emotion,'' Paterno said.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2, there is concern in Happy Valley that the beginning of
this season is too similar to last season's.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Penn State started 3-0 by beating No. 21 Southern
Mississippi, routing Bowling Green and struggling to get by
Pittsburgh. In their fourth game, the Nittany Lions were trounced
by Ohio State 28-9. That game exposed their weaknesses and led to
an 8-3 regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State opened with an impressive victory against then-No. 4
_ but overrated _ Arizona, a blowout of Akron and a 20-17 victory
against Pitt on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Is history about to repeat?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important that we go down there this week
and come away with a 'W,' especially coming out of last year,''
fullback Mike Cerimele said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other pieces of history should worry Penn State fans: The
Nittany Lions have not beaten a top-10 team on the road since
beating No. 5 Michigan 31-24 on Oct. 15, 1994. They have not won a
game in the Orange Bowl, the site of Saturday's game, since 1976.
And the Hurricanes expect a rare sellout Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State leads the series 6-5, but the Hurricanes have won
four of the six games since 1979. In 1981, the Hurricanes and Jim
Kelly upset No. 1 Penn State in what some Miami fans called the
biggest win in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Paterno had one of his biggest wins, when Penn
State knocked off No. 1 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Many people say this Penn State team could give Paterno his
third national championship. But Miami appears to be a dangerous
obstacle.

 &HT;    Tennessee State tries to end skid against FAMU
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Florida A&AMP;M and Tennessee State meet Saturday in
the 11th annual Atlanta Classic at the Georgia Dome, the longtime
rivals will be fighting for cloth as well as for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will take home a unique flag that captures the
essence of both schools _ thus, the theme of the game: ``The Fury
for the Flag.''
</P>
<P>
   TSU fourth-year coach L.C. Cole's team has taken two impressive
victories over SWAC teams as it comes to town for the classic,
sponsored by 100 Black Men of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering what FAMU has done to us the last few years, it
would really be great if we could take that flag back home and hang
it up somewhere,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers have beaten the Tigers eight years in a row,
including five times in the Classic. A crowd of 51,742 watched FAMU
win 31-23 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach (Billy) Joe has a great program,'' Cole said.
``Hopefully, we've closed the gap on them going into this game.''
</P>
<P>
   In its first two games of the season, TSU knocked off Alabama
State 41-8 and defeated highly regarded Jackson State 48-33.
</P>
<P>
   FAMU last weekend reached 1-1 after doing to Norfolk State what
No. 8 Miami did to the Rattlers the week before. Behind sophomore
quarterback Quinn Gray, who took a shot to the rib cage early in
the first quarter against Miami and sat out the rest of the 57-3
loss, the Rattlers waxed their MEAC rival 56-7.
</P>
<P>
   Gray threw for 381 yards and four touchdowns against Norfolk
State.
</P>
<P>
   His primary receiver has not been often double-teamed
All-American junior Jacquay Nunnally (12 catches, 106 yards) but
senior Cainon Lamb, who had five receptions for 111 yards and a
touchdown against Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike 1998, when its offense produced Division I-AA-leading
averages of 521 yards and 45.7 points per game, FAMU's success this
year might lie with its defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is much improved,'' Joe said, noting the size,
speed and strength of his players. ``We've also got more depth than
we've had before.''

 &HT;    Falcons must find running game
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes, Falcons center Robbie Tobeck likes to joke
around, even when the subject matter is serious. Not Wednesday; not
with the mood offensive line coach Art Shell is in this week.
</P>
<P>
   The question: What does Atlanta need to do better to win Monday
at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run for more than 80 yards, I'll tell you that,'' Tobeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobeck's point is crystal clear.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons are to have a realistic shot at getting back to
the Super Bowl, or, for that matter, at putting together
back-to-back winning seasons for the first time in the 34-year
history of the franchise, they've got to run the ball better.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons passed for 278 yards in a 17-14 loss to the Vikings,
66 more than they averaged while going 14-2 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But their 81 rushing yards were 21st in the league _ against a
defense that was supposed to be flimsy.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves said the Falcons were ``outworked'' up front,
as Viking defenders spun off blocks too easily. That's not a
function of power or technique; it's a matter of willpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about ... getting on guys, and finishing blocks ... going
until the whistle blows,'' Shell said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson rushed for franchise records last season of 1,846
yards and 14 touchdowns on an NFL-record 410 carries. Atlanta
averaged 131.4 rushing yards per game, sixth in the league last
year.
</P>
<P>
   There has been one change on his line. Bob Hallen, a
second-round pick and the backup guard last year, replaced Calvin
Collins at left guard. Collins is a backup guard and center.
</P>
<P>
   But the results were a lot different Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had 16 carries, almost 10 less than his average of last
year. That was partly because Atlanta fell behind 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   But other signs were ominous, too.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a 20-yard run where Anderson broke outside the
designed running lane, he had just 30 yards on 15 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you lose, it's because you got outworked,'' said right
guard Gene Williams. ``If we have everybody doing the right thing,
we make yards. It's that simple. But when we have eight or nine
people doing the right thing, it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings deserve some credit. All-Pro defensive tackle Randle
McDaniel, who often drew a double team, especially when he lined up
across from Hallen, was a pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hallen) did some good things,'' Reeves said. ``Randle caused
everybody some problems.'' Also, the Vikings were creeping strong
safety Robert Griffith and its cornerbacks toward the line,
reinforcing the run defense as they didn't seem to fear the deep
pass.
</P>
<P>
   And Anderson hinted that the excitement of facing the Vikings in
a rematch of the NFC Championship Game didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you try to do too much. I have to be a little more
patient so things can develop,'' he said. ``I know I missed at
least two holes where, if I hit them, I think big runs could've
changed the complexion of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas will try to do a lot of what Minnesota did, try to make
us run laterally.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coaches would like to get speedy reserve running back
Byron Hanspard more involved. He had just three carries for 9 yards
against the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Cowboys' undersized, quick and young defensive
front seven would seem the good foil for a big back like Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Washington rushed for 135 yards against Dallas in the Cowboy's
41-35 overtime win, sixth-most in the NFL last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, we were getting on the right man and doing
the right thing, but we weren't always holding our blocks,'' Tobeck
said. ``We've got to get after `em.

 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In by far his biggest philanthropic commitment to
date, Microsoft chairman and co-founder Bill Gates is pledging at
least $1 billion to fund full scholarships over the next 20 years
for minority students in education, math, science and engineering.
The program, which Gates and officials at his philanthropic
foundation plan to formally announce here Thursday, will seek to
help a minimum of 1,000 high school students a year, promising them
enough money to cover tuition, room and board and other expenses
through college and any graduate degrees, including a doctorate,
that they pursue.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion program is one of the largest philanthropic
donations in history to a specific cause, matching a commitment by
Ted Turner, the founder of CNN, of the same amount to United
Nations causes according to several experts on philanthropy. The $1
billion would come from existing money in the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The programs will also constitute the largest single scholarship
fund aimed at closing the gap between the rates at which whites and
some racial minorities attain advanced degrees in math and science.
While the program, called the Gates Millennium Scholarships, will
be open to all racial minorities, they will be especially be aimed
at black, Hispanic and American Indian students.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the impact of the program itself, the gift also
offers one of the first major indications of the priorities that
Gates, the wealthiest person in the world, will set in his
charitable giving. For all the publicity surrounding his wealth,
relatively little is known about Gates' political leanings, other
than that he generally regards himself somewhat as a libertarian on
some social issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which he and his wife
established this year through the merging of other foundations of
theirs and have financed with two large donations of Microsoft
stock, has about $17 billion in assets. That makes it the largest
philanthropic foundation in the United States, and it is soon
expected to become the largest such organization in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Gateses have already announced commitments of about $200
million for work on developing and distributing vaccines for
malaria, AIDS and other diseases. And they have pledged a similar
amount to a program that will bring computers and Internet hookups
to libraries in poorer areas across North America.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarship program marks Gates' first major commitment to
financing scholarships for minorities in education, although he has
repeatedly spoken of what he calls the need to get more minorities
into science, medicine and high technology. He has also said he
believes it is crucial to narrow the ``digital divide,'' or the
lower rates at which some racial groups are said to use computers
or be able to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A foundation official confirmed Wednesday evening that an
announcement of the scholarships would be made Thursday. But he
declined to provide more details, and aides to Gates said he would
make no comment until the formal announcement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Several leaders in the field of minority education, including
William H. Gray III, the president of the United Negro College Fund
who is a board member of a separate Gates foundation, were
traveling to Seattle on Wednesday to be on hand for Thursday's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   While never a particularly vociferous proponent of affirmative
action, Gates has generally indicated his support for strategies to
give minorities greater entree to higher education. And his father,
William H. Gates Jr., the co-chairman of the Gates charitable
foundation, donated $25,000 last year to the campaign to defeat a
Washington state ballot measure, known as Initiative 200 or I-200,
to ban any preferential treatment for racial minorities in the
state's hiring, contracting or school admission programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that opposition, voters decisively passed the measure.
Because Gates' scholarship program involves money from a private
foundation, it is not subject to any of the prohibitions covered by
the ballot initiative, although it could conceivably come under
legal attack by opponents who might argue that preferential
scholarships should not be allowed under federal laws covering
nonprofit charitable groups like the Gates foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Gates has come under heavy criticism from some quarters for not
giving away more of his wealth sooner. His critics have also
suggested that recent gifts were part of a public relations
campaign by Microsoft, whose image has been battered in the massive
antitrust court battle now under way in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivations, officials involved in minority
education said that Thursday's announcement would be a landmark in
their field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is simply a huge amount of money for scholarships,'' said
Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a biweekly
publication that covers nonprofit organizations and maintains a
ranking of their assets by size. Ms. Palmer said that other than
Turner's $1 billion pledge to the United Nations, she said she knew
of no other donation of that size to a specific cause.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming year only, the Millennium Scholarship Program will
target promising students who are already in college.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the fall of 2000, it will be opened specifically to
high school seniors, who must have a 3.3 grade average and be
nominated by a teacher or their school's principal. The students
must also write an essay outlining their life goals and make a
commitment to some form of community service.
</P>
<P>
   For those selected, the Gates foundation will pledge to make up
any difference in the cost of school between any other scholarships
the students are receiving and the total cost of their education.
</P>
<P>
   ``That difference is what keeps a lot of kids out of college,''
a foundation official said Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ It is early twilight, and the muezzin's call
from the Umayyad Mosque has summoned the devout to the sunset
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost story time at Al Nawfara cafe. The television is
turned off. The tea drinkers wait expectantly.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, his prayers completed, the storyteller, in red fez-like
hat and patterned vest, takes his place on an elevated chair. He
finds his place in the text, and he begins to read.
</P>
<P>
   For precisely an hour, until the night is shattered again with
the day's final call to prayer, the story unfolds. It is the epic
tale of Antar and Abla, one that takes 300 nights to read. The
audience is transfixed. This is a story familiar to every Arab, but
in an era of uncertainty about Syria's future, it casts a powerful
spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stories represent courage, kindness and truthfulness,''
said Mohammed Jamil, 39, a businessman from northwestern Syria, who
listened intently as the familiar syllables rolled. ``When the
people fight, they fight nobly. There is no backstabbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Arab folklore has been spun by storytellers for hundreds and
hundreds of years, but in most cities the practice has long since
been supplanted by more modern forms of entertainment. In Damascus,
it disappeared for 15 years, beginning in 1975, so abruptly that
many people suspect the end was ordered by a government that had
embarked on a modernization campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But every night since 1990, the stories have been told again at
Al Nawfara, their traditional Damascus home. And there, just steps
from the eighth-century mosque, they have gained a following not
seen in any other modern Arab capital _ perhaps in part because
Damascus remains a city caught between old and new.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a return to the old history books, and how it was when
the Arabs were in their glory times,'' said Rashid Abu Shadi, 55, a
grocer by day and, by night, the storyteller, or hakawati, at Al
Nawfara, where he reads aloud seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with new hope budding for peace with Israel, no one in
Syria knows whether years of conflict might really be near an end.
For that conflict, the country has paid a heavy price. Its economic
development has been stalled, with mobile phones and the Internet
only now beginning to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Political discussion is so circumscribed that on the major
issues of the day, television, radio and newspapers offer little
more than slogans.
</P>
<P>
   At Al Nawfara, under fluorescent light, the institutional-yellow
halls hint at the yearning for a simpler past.
</P>
<P>
   There are the portraits, ubiquitous in Syria, of Hafez Assad,
the longtime president, and his son, Bashar, his apparent preferred
heir.
</P>
<P>
   But not far away are depictions of Antar and Abla, fictional
characters who would undoubtedly be judged, if there were a poll
among Arabs, as heroes by one and all.
</P>
<P>
   Antar Ibn Sheded, a brave and courageous warrior, is in love
with Abla, the embodiment of virtue and beauty. She loves him in
return, and is willing to be married.
</P>
<P>
   But Antar is cursed by his birth as the illegitimate son of an
Arab tribesmen and a black slave. To overcome repeated rebuff's
from Abla's family, he must repeatedly demonstrate his worthiness
through unimaginable feats of strength, kindness and bravery.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the oral tale was finally put to paper, under
Ottoman rule in the 18th century, the story ran to 3,000 pages.
Simpler tales have long been staples of Arab television and film,
but it is the unabridged version that Abu Shahdi has been reading
out loud every night for several months at Al Nawfara, with several
months to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popular stories have meanings; they tell you the right
path of life,'' said Abu Shahdi, whose tenure at the cafe began
nine years ago, and revolves between Antar and Abla and two other
yearlong tales. ``They teach virtue, they teach sacrifice, and they
teach a love of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from the flu, Abu Shahdi cannot rely on the
storyteller's usual booming voice to drown out the tea-cup clatter.
But he makes up its absence with a flat sword, waving it in the air
for dramatic effect or slamming it against an iron table to
punctuate each turn in the story.
</P>
<P>
   A few tourists, and few women, are scattered among the 40 or so
people packed into the cafe.
</P>
<P>
   But most among the crowd are men, and many are regulars _
traders, businessmen and shopkeepers who, like Abu Shahdi, first
heard the stories at their fathers' sides, when they were small
boys. Over tea and narguila waterpipes, they listen as Abu Shahdi
picks up the classic tale.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, the story goes, Antar is preparing for a
dangerous journey over hundreds of miles of desert controlled by
hostile tribes. Only at that destination, in what is now Iraq, can
he find the 1,000 rare camels that Abla's father has so cruelly
demanded as her dowry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody besides Antar could get there,'' Mahmoud Jaffar, 35, a
trader who buys carpets from Iranian tourists, explained to a
visitor. ``They are just doing this to make things difficult for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Antar make it? And will he ever win Abla's hand?
</P>
<P>
   On this night, no one will find out. The muezzin's call rises
again from the minarets, and, with a smile, Abu Shahdi puts the
book aside.
</P>
<P>
   Men reach for a few small notes to pay a bill, and shuffle back
uphill toward the mosque. Soon, in the cafe, someone snaps the
television back on, to a Lebanese channel known for its relatively
racy fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best way these days,'' said Mahmoud Melhaan Abu
Marouf, 62, who remembers the old days at Al Nawfara, when the
storytelling would go on for hours. ``Now, everyone knows that it
will only take an hour; the story will last just from one prayer to
another.''

TWO SENATORS NARROW CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL TO DRAW SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
  ( Eds :  SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT, House passed bill on Tuesday,
sted Wed.; combines takes.) 
 (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an attempt to break the long Senate stalemate on
campaign finance, the two senators sponsoring overhaul legislation
say they will strip down their bill to focus primarily on large,
unregulated donations to political parties that were at the center
of the controversy in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell
Feingold, D-Wis., to narrow their bill came after the House _ for
the second year in a row _ passed the original, more comprehensive
legislation Tuesday night, which put the issue of campaign finance
back before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not at all clear that the legislative tactic would
achieve the senators' aim, which is to somehow find enough votes to
prevail if senior Republicans once again mount a filibuster against
the effort to change the campaign law. Democrats who oppose scaling
back the comprehensive legislation likely will object to the new
language, and the most vociferous Republican critics of the bill
were showing no sign of being mollified.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators said in separate interviews Wednesday that the
new version of their bill would ban the unlimited, unregulated
donations to political parties known as ``soft money.'' But it
would no longer include new regulations on so-called issue advocacy
advertisements by outside groups within 60 days of an election.
Those commercials, critics say, purport to explain a policy issue
but are, in effect, thinly veiled campaign advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the more comprehensive legislation drew a 52-vote
majority in the Senate, but not the 60 votes needed to break a
filibuster mounted by Republican opponents who killed the bill.
With the Senate set to take up the issue again for a week in
October, the sponsors say they are trying to find a way to create a
new dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that there will be ample opportunities for senators
to amend their bare-bones bill, possibly building legislation that
can pass. That would get campaign finance legislation to a
House-Senate conference committee that would reconcile the
differences between the approaches of the two chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that we didn't see 60 votes if you reintroduced
McCain-Feingold,'' said McCain. ``I believe that by introducing
just the bare bones we can go through an amending process,'' he
added, `` hopefully approve a bill, get more votes and go to
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold said the two had also considered the fact that
Sen.Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other chief opponents of the
overhaul legislation had long aimed most of their fire at the
provisions to regulate issue advocacy ads, arguing that they
amounted to an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, they could not make that complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``This forces them to say that a ban on soft money is wrong,''
he said. ``I think that's hard because it's become essentially a
system of legalized bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from clear Wednesday that the two men's move
would bolster their case. In fact it looked possible that it could
fracture their coalition since many Democrats argue that they are
often the targets of issue advocacy ad campaigns run by Republican
allies such as the National Rifle Association, the Christian
Coalition and anti-tax groups.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin T. Meehan , D-Mass., who is one of the chief
sponsors of the House companion bill, expressed doubts about the
maneuver by McCain and Feingold. ``We just had a great victory for
campaign finance reform and I hate to embrace the very next day a
weaker bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House
Minority Leader, was more blunt. ``There's zero support among House
Democrats for a watered down campaign finance bill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the political spectrum, McConnell showed no
inclination to drop his opposition to even the rejiggered bill. He
argued that Republicans needed the large cash infusions that come
to the party in soft money to pay for television ads to counter
advertisements by organized labor, which usually backs Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want our political party to be able to defend our
candidates,'' said McConnell, who is head of the Senate
Republicans' re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   Both Feingold and McCain conceded that they had no solid vote
counts and did not know whether their new approach could succeed.
They run the risk of gaining some new Republican supporters but
losing some of their Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Democrats will have concerns,'' Feingold admitted. But he
said he believed Democrats would be misguided to stand against a
soft money ban. ``I don't think Democrats either would on
philosophical grounds or should on practical grounds ever pretend
they will come out ahead if we continue with soft money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were some signs Wednesday that Democrats will still try to
fight for passage of the same bill that the House approved,
252-177.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think it would be too bad if we had the chance to
get comprehensive reform and it somehow got undermined by a less
comprehensive bill,'' said Ranit Schmelzer, the press secretary for
Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader. She added, however,
that ``if that is not feasible we're committed to getting a bill
though the Senate that will go to conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides banning soft money, the new McCain-Feingold bill will
codify a Supreme Court decision that gave people who work in union
shops where they are required to pay dues the right to ask for the
return of the portion of the money that is used for political
activity.
</P>
<P>
   That stops far short of calls by Republicans to require labor
unions to receive prior written consent from all union members
before using dues for political activity.

MOTOROLA CONFIRMS IT WILL ACQUIRE GENERAL INSTRUMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Pa.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola Inc. on Wednesday confirmed that it would
acquire General Instrument Corp., a leading maker of cable set-top
boxes, in a stock deal valued at nearly $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The move would make Motorola a key supplier of cable television
equipment and allow the company to develop what it calls a ``home
hub'' of products to offer broadband cable and Internet access to
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the deal gives it a passageway into the homes
of millions of consumers and that it plans to develop new set-top
boxes with cable modems that will enable consumers to surf the Web,
make telephone calls, access e-mail and even tune into interactive
video and pay-per-view digital television.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows us to participate in the fastest-growing segment
of the telecommunications industry,'' said Christopher Galvin, the
chairman and chief executive of Motorola, which is based in
Schaumburg, Ill. ``There's an insatiable demand for bandwidth into
the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Breen, the chairman and chief executive of General
Instrument, of Horsham, Pa., which has the dominant position in
set-top boxes, as well as a cable infrastructure, will head a new
unit of Motorola that combines his company with Motorola's
networking and Internet division to create a wired home that would
offer everything from burglar alarms to high-definition TV. General
Instrument had $2 billion in revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola agreed to offer 0.575 of a share of its own stock for
each share of General Instrument, which has 214 million shares
outstanding. Based on Wednesday's closing price for Motorola, the
deal would be valued at about $10.66 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Motorola, which skidded Monday on word of the deal,
tumbled again Wednesday, losing $6.5625, to close at $86.625 in
heavy trading. Shares of General Instrument also fell, closing at
$47.25, down $3.25.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have not reacted enthusiastically partly because
Motorola says the deal will dilute earnings in the first year
before bolstering them in later years. But Wall Street analysts say
the deal would give Motorola a dynamic new, high-growth component
and fit nicely with its fast-growing cable modem division.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential of the combination is just huge,'' said Mona
Eraiba, an analyst at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``It's going to open a huge
market that is considerably bigger than the current market.'' She
added, ``Everything is going to converge in the set top box.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire cable television industry is consolidating and
upgrading to offer high-speed Internet access, interactive video
and additional channels. Big cable operators, like AT&AMP;T, are
spending billions of dollars to upgrade their cable offerings and
buy set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   For Motorola, which has $29 billion in revenues and is
rebounding from a sharp slump, the new division and emphasis on the
Internet is expected to be a growth area that will complement its
strong positions in semiconductors and cellular telephones.

GROWTH AND GOVERNMENT COLLIDE IN CREATING A HAZARD 
</HEADLINE>
 (With HURRICANE-RDP, HURRICANE-FLORIDA, HURRICANE-BAHAMAS)

 By CORNELIA DEAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The evacuations, disaster declarations and emergency
proclamations that are accompanying Hurricane Floyd along the
Atlantic coast are a small taste of worse to come, say coastal
scientists and policy makers worried about rising sea levels, more
intense storms and a ballooning coastal population.
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters at the National Hurricane Center and
elsewhere have gotten better and better at predicting when and
where storms will strike, helping officials to move residents and
tourists out of harm's way in time. But population growth along the
coast _ fueled in part, some experts say, by government policies
encouraging development _ is more than outpacing them. Within a few
years, some demographers predict, most Americans will live in
coastal counties.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, timely evacuations in some areas are already
becoming impossible.
</P>
<P>
   And if the earth is warming _ and mainstream scientists believe
it is _ the rise of sea levels will accelerate, leaving low-lying
areas ever more vulnerable to flooding. Plus, because hurricanes
draw their energy from ocean warmth, warmer seas may mean stronger
storms.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest burst of development on the coast has occurred since
the 1960s, a time of relatively few hurricanes. Some
climatologists, notably William M. Gray of Colorado State
University, say this quiet weather cannot last. They believe that
hurricane frequency varies in cycles, and that another period of
high hurricane frequency is beginning. If the nation returned to
the prevailing patterns of the 1930s, '40s and '50s, they say,
hurricanes costing tens of billions of dollars would become
routine.
</P>
<P>
   But policy makers are finding it difficult to limit building on
some of the nation's most desirable, but most hazardous, landscape.
In fact, some experts say, they are doing the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations and demand that the federal government be
extremely generous and supportive of disaster victims, and the
property rights movement nationally, have in a broad sense
intimidated federal, state and local officials from limiting
development and redevelopment,'' said Rutherford H. Platt, a
professor of geography at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst. His new book, ``Disasters and Democracy,'' deals with
disaster assistance and its effects on development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the rhetoric about mitigation,'' Platt said in an
interview Wednesday, ``the broad thrust of federal policy is to
provide disaster grants, loans and tax deductions that encourage
investment in hazardous areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Hurricane Floyd, President Clinton issued
pre-emptive disaster declarations from New Zealand and the
governors of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina,
Virginia, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland all declared states of
emergency, hours before the storm made landfall.
</P>
<P>
   Like others who have studied coastal development, Platt says
programs like disaster assistance and the federal Flood Insurance
Program, which provides low-cost coverage in flood hazard areas,
can encourage unwise development. Some coastal scientists blame the
insurance program, in fact, for much of the unwise development that
has taken place on the coast since it went into effect in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But many involved in coastal development issues maintain that
even if federal agencies halted their grants, infrastructure
support and other spending, people might still flock to build on
the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to be on the beach because they like to be on
the beach,'' said Gerry Stoddard, president of the Fire Island
Association, which represents homeowners on the island.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But as more and more people settle at the coast, getting them
out safely in the event of a storm is turning into a logistical
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, evacuations should be carried out well before a storm
hits, at low tide so low-lying coastal roads are not flooded, and
in daylight. Even then, coastal highways are not designed to carry
such a load. In fact, the prospect of throngs of residents trapped
in miles-long traffic jams is what most frightens many disaster
planners.
</P>
<P>
   There are few places more dangerous to be in a hurricane than in
an automobile. But that was exactly where many people were up and
down the coast as Hurricane Floyd approached. Evacuation traffic
clogged almost to a halt in Florida, and Interstate 40 in North
Carolina was choked with cars.
</P>
<P>
   As the hurricane neared Georgia, state workers were able to turn
Interstate 16 into a one-way avenue out of Savannah, with traffic
on both sides of the divided highway headed west, inland. But, as
in this case, most coastal highways were built before engineers
realized they might ever have to run only one way. So highway
officials in coastal jurisdictions must scramble to retrofit,
stationing portable signs, traffic cones and the like in strategic
locations.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, though, disaster officials are reconciling
themselves to the reality that it will not be possible to get
everyone out in time. That is particularly true in places like
Florida, with its low-lying barrier islands and its high proportion
of elderly residents, many in frail health.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in places like the Florida Keys and Sanibel Island, on
Florida's Gulf Coast, are designating ``refuges of last resort,''
places where people can shelter if they cannot escape a storm in
time.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Americans' love for beach living serves to thwart
the coast's natural defense against extreme storms. Geologists know
that the more building there is on the coastal barrier islands that
line the East and the Gulf coasts, the more difficulty the islands
themselves seem to have in recovering from hurricanes and other
coastal storms.
</P>
<P>
   The geologists began studying the issue in detail more than 35
years ago, after the notorious Ash Wednesday northeaster of 1962.
That storm, which lasted for days, devastated much of the East
Coast. Undeveloped barrier islands recovered quickly; developed
stretches of coast were much slower to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this is because sand on these islands naturally shifts
from inland dunes to offshore sandbars, which form in storms and
then act as a kind of defense system, breaking waves before they
can crash more destructively on the beach. When calm weather
returns, gentle swells carry the sandbar sands back on shore.
</P>
<P>
   Platt and other experts on coastal planning say they wish
coastal officials knew more about this beach geology, and the
importance of keeping buildings off the beach. If they had acted on
that knowledge, these experts say, barrier islands might be better
able to survive storms, and there would be fewer people trying to
escape them.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as government assistance is available, it seems
likely that building in hazard areas will continue and disaster
declarations will follow.

U.S. LETS DISPATCHERS KNOW SOURCE OF CELLULAR CALLS TO 911 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reflecting rapid advances in technology, the
federal government on Wednesday announced new technical standards
that will enable emergency dispatchers to pinpoint the location of
cellular telephone calls to 911.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, which were approved unanimously by the
Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday and will begin to
take effect in 2001, dispatchers will be able to determine the
location of a caller to within an approximate range of 55 to 325
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision will save lives, it's as simple as that,''
William Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, said Wednesday. ``Locating people in threatening
situations is a life-and-death event. Right now, some 70 percent of
traffic deaths occur in the critical period two hours after the
accident. By giving public safety officials the ability to locate
callers, this will literally mean the difference between life and
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Most emergency dispatchers around the nation can already
determine the location of a call made from a conventional
telephone. But dispatchers and consumers have often complained of
the inability to locate a cellular phone caller in distress _ for
example, in a highway accident or in an unfamiliar neighborhood
where the caller has witnessed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is the second time in a month that the agency
has issued technical standards enabling the tracking of cellular
phone users. Three weeks ago, it announced standards to expand the
ability of law-enforcement agents to monitor conversations and
locate criminal suspects. Those rules, which were criticized by
privacy rights advocates, will enable federal and local agents who
obtain a warrant to identify the nearest cellular antenna that was
used by the phone company to transmit the beginning and end of any
call under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ruling last month, law-enforcement authorities would
be able to track a cellular phone user within a range of a few city
blocks to a few miles. Wednesday's decision would give far more
precision to locating a cellular phone user, and privacy advocates
said it was only a matter of time before law-enforcement officials
tried to use the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unrealistic to think there will be a generally deployed
tracking capability and that law enforcement will not seek access
to it,'' said David Sobel, the general counsel of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center in Washington. ``They already have their
foot in the door with last month's ruling, and it's a logical next
step for them to seek access to these emergency capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennard said that Wednesday's decision would protect
legitimate privacy interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer is in the driver's seat,'' he said, ``because the
location capability is only activated if you make a 911 call so you
choose when you will be subject to this technology. Most people in
an emergency are not as concerned about their privacy. They're
concerned about their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency gave the wireless telephone industry the choice of
how to comply with the requirements. The industry can make use of
its antennas and networks to calculate the location of the user
through such methods as trangulation, or using more than one cell
or signal sent by the same phone. It can rely on new technology
that will be embedded in the handsets, like circuitry that can be
used with the military's global positioning satellites system, to
determine the location of a caller. Or it can use a hybrid system
that uses the network in some places and technology in the handset
in others.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials applauded Wednesday's decision but said
difficult issues remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that the FCC has kept up with technology and that
the industry has beat the laws of physics and we can do this,''
said Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association. ``Now we've got to deal with the laws of
human nature and politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the thorniest issue involves who will pay for the new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is expected to decide that issue this year, although it
has largely left it to the states. About 30 states have adopted
legislation or regulations, many of which permit phone companies to
add a monthly charge of 50 cents to $1.25 to pay for the
technology.

 &HT;    Friendly policy keeps Ohio State's coffers full while giving
other schools exposure
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ John Cooper knows what it's like to be on the
losing end of a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   As head coach at the University of Tulsa 20 years ago, Cooper
made annual trips to Oklahoma and Arkansas, where beatings were the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was supposed to be happy about it,'' Cooper said.
``Everybody was happy but me.''
</P>
<P>
   As head football coach at powerhouse Ohio State, Cooper can
smile again because now the Tulsas of Ohio must come to him for the
poundings.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ohio University (0-2) of the Mid-American
Conference visits Ohio Stadium to face the 13th-ranked Buckeyes.
Next week, the University of Cincinnati, whose football program has
been as bad lately as its nationally ranked basketball program has
been good, comes to town. Next year, its MAC member Miami (Ohio)
and in 2001, Akron.
</P>
<P>
   The games are part of a new neighborly effort by Ohio State to
help put some extra money in the pockets of smaller in-state
programs while keeping OSU's coffers full.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always understood that the Mid-American schools kind of
struggled financially and it just seemed to me to make sense to
keep the money (from nonconference OSU home games) in Ohio,'' said
OSU athletics director Andy Geiger, who pushed to get the Ohio
schools back on the Buckeyes' schedule after a 58-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State earns about $3million in total revenues from ticket
sales, parking, concessions, etc., from each home game, according
to Pete Hagen, the school's assistant athletics director for
finance.
</P>
<P>
   For visiting teams, the payoff is enticing, too. Ohio University
will make $350,000 from its visit to the Horseshoe this weekend,
``more money than we'd make from a home game,'' Ohio University
athletics director Thomas Boeh said.
</P>
<P>
   The big paydays suppliment the much-smaller budgets of the MAC
schools. OU for example has a budget of just under $10million as
compared to Ohio State's $68million budget.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeh said he did not agree to the meeting just for the cash.
If the Bobcats were in it only for the money, he said, they'd go to
Penn State or Florida or LSU where the payouts are $500,000 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   An Ohio State match-up allows Bobcat players from Ohio, of which
there are many, to play a televised game in their home state. This
exposure, Boeh said, helps both recruiting and the team's
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this game does for us is allows us to measure our program
a little bit,'' he said. ``It also gives us additional visibility
that we might not otherwise get.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the money isn't nice, too.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo athletics director Pete Liske said the $350,000 the
Rockets made from its game at OSU last year (a 49-0 loss) enabled
their football program to buy state-of-the-art video equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beating we took in that game was only in the score,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Liske said the blowout was disappointing because ``we
thought we were much more competitive.'' He admits winning-minded
coaches are probably less enthusiastic about playing OSU than the
money-conscious athletic directors.
</P>
<P>
   If Ohio coach Jim Grobe feels that way about Saturday's game,
he's not showing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was a no-brainer,'' he said. ``What a great
experience for our program and our kids.

ADVERTISING: ARNOLD COMMUNICATIONS LEADS BIG ANTI-SMOKING
CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Texas, Ill., Fla.)  (EDS: this replaces PRE-GAME-AD-COLUMN, which has been held) 
(bl) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of agencies was selected Wednesday to create and produce
what is intended as the largest single national advertising,
marketing and public relations campaign to ``unsell'' cigarette
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which includes two agencies with extensive experience
in developing anti-smoking campaigns for two large states, was
chosen after a three-month review by the American Legacy Foundation
in Washington. The foundation was funded by the recent $206 billion
settlement between 46 state attorneys general and the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will include television, radio, print and Internet
advertising with a particular focus on discouraging teen-agers from
starting to smoke cigarettes. The initial annual budget will be
$150 million to $255 million, or 50 to 85 percent of the $300
million the foundation is to receive each year under terms of the
settlement between Big Tobacco and the attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is emblematic of a trend that is reshaping the
attitudes of Madison Avenue. After decades of helping to persuade
Americans to smoke, agencies are now switching sides to assist the
anti-tobacco forces. That fundamental shift coincides with a
turnabout in societal perceptions about smoking as well as the
growing popularity of efforts to change behavior through so-called
social marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, the change comes as increasing sums of money are
being devoted to a variety of campaigns to end smoking, under the
aegis of the foundation, states, pharmaceutical companies that sell
drugs meant to help smokers stop and even tobacco marketers like
Philip Morris Cos., seeking to improve their corporate image by
sponsoring anti-cigarette ads aimed at young people.
</P>
<P>
   The review began with the foundation soliciting agencies to take
part. The field was narrowed to nine teams, then four, then three
finalists.
</P>
<P>
   The lead agency on the winning team is Arnold Communications in
Boston, a unit of Snyder Communications that has created
anti-smoking ads for the Massachusetts Public Health Department.
Arnold's duties will include media buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity of a lifetime,'' said Francis Kelly,
managing partner and chief marketing officer at Arnold, in a
statement, ``to not only do great communications but to do it for a
great cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The other agency team member with a big state's anti-tobacco
work on its resume is Crispin Porter &AMP; Bogusky in Miami, which has
created anti-smoking ads for what is called the Florida Tobacco
Pilot Program. That campaign was centered on the concept of
promoting a brand named Truth that was intended to counter the
influence of cigarette advertising on teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Branding social change hasn't been done much before,'' said
Crispin Porter chairman and partner Charles Porter in a telephone
interview Wednesday. ``This is going to be exciting; we're very
eager for the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The tasks to be handled by Crispin Porter will include general
advertising and youth marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The Arnold-Crispin Porter team had been considered a
front-runner in the review not only because of its experience but
also because Chuck Wolfe, the executive vice president at the
foundation, ran a review in Florida that ended with the selection
of Crispin Porter as the agency for the anti-tobacco campaign
there.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the winning team are: Bromley, Aguilar &AMP;
Associates in San Antonio, Texas, a unit of MacManus Group, for
youth marketing and ads aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers;
Burrell Communications Group in Chicago, 49 percent owned by
Publicis SA, for youth marketing and ads aimed at blacks;
Circle.com in Boston, also part of Snyder, as the lead interactive
agency, and Nixon Group in Miami, for duties including promotions
and youth marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Porter Novelli in Washington, a unit of Omnicom Group, for
public relations and social marketing; Teen-age Research Unlimited
in Northbrook, Ill., for youth research, and Imada Wong
Communications Group in Los Angeles, an affiliate of the New
America Strategies Group of True North Communications, for tasks
that include ads aimed at Asian-American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two other finalist teams, one had as its lead agency
Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/Euro RSCG in New York,
part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising. Other
members included SFM Media in New York, also part of Havas, for
media buying, and Dan Klores Associates in New York, for public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The other finalist team had at its lead agency Richards Group in
Dallas. Other members included the Los Angeles office of Western
Initiative Media Worldwide, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos.,
for media buying, and the Golin/Harris International unit of
Interpublic, for public relations.
</P>
<P>
   The finalist team led by Arnold was chosen by the foundation
after a recommendation from a selection panel that included Lonnie
Bristow, a former president of the American Medical Association;
David Milenthal, chairman at HMS Partners in Columbus, Ohio, a
longtime opponent of Madison Avenue's handling of cigarette
accounts, and Wolfe.

 &HT;    Page with a 911 invites cops to crack party
 &HT;    By Ralph Schusler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Like many people who want a prompt response,
Jay T. McCarty added a 911 after his phone number on the page he
sent his girlfriend near dawn on Aug. 29 on this wealthy island
community.
</P>
<P>
   The three digits somehow resulted in a phone call to the Palm
Beach Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Officers arriving at the ground-floor Hammon Avenue apartment
from which McCarty had called came upon a door presumably left open
for Hubbard. Announcing themselves and entering, they said, they
found McCarty with crack pipes and other drug paraphernalia, as
well as a 12-gauge shotgun and .22-caliber rifle, both loaded.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty has a felony conviction for aggravated drug trafficking,
and state law prohibits his possessing firearms. He was arrested
and faces a second felony charge that carries a mandatory minimum
three-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Local 911 operators speculated that after punching in his number
to Hubbard's pager, McCarty must have inadvertently disconnected
and unknowingly gotten a dial tone before hitting the 911 and
inviting the police to his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a new one for me,'' said Mark Adler, Palm Beach
County's 911 coordinator. ``It's so off the wall, it's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Also disbelieving was McCarty's girlfriend, Kristen Hubbard, who
responded to his page by rushing in a cab to the apartment. Upon
arrival, she was arrested on an outstanding warrant. Police found a
crack pipe on her, too, they said.

COMMENTARY: THE LEFT'S NEW HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing ignominious defeat by Republicans in New
Hampshire _ a state whose primary he carried last time out _ Pat
Buchanan is now out to wreak vengeance as a spoiler. He can taste
the 13 million taxpayer dollars available to the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   A liberal former Democratic governor, hands clasped, tells me
fervently, ``Thank God for Pat Buchanan _ he could elect Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   That's assuming the billionaire Ross Perot still owns the party
he formed and can dictate its nomination. Gov. Jesse Ventura of
Minnesota, Reform's electoral success, has pledged to complete his
term and hopes to run in 2004. But Ross the Boss, badly beaten last
time out, has a way to block Reform's reform and maintain his
personal platform.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, rejected by GOP rank and file, is his warhorse. Never
mind the libertarian, pro-choice instincts of most past Perot
followers; by putting his anti-choice choice atop his ticket, and
taking the vice presidential slot himself, Perot can legally add
tens of millions of his own money to the taxpayer's $13 million and
try to become a player again.
</P>
<P>
   But my old Nixon-Agnew speech-writing colleague (I did
``nattering nabobs''; Pat did ``pusillanimous pussyfooters'') has
this strategic problem: his only success has been based on the
politics of economic resentment. Blaming Asians and Mexicans for
taking away jobs works in hard times, but loses all traction during
full employment.
</P>
<P>
   Because neither abortion absolutism nor class warfare will help
him with what used to be called ``Perot's people,'' the bolting
Buchanan is giving new emphasis to his old fallback position:
cultural resentment, especially of the dire influence of Jewish
Americans, with anti-Castro Cuban Americans tossed in.
</P>
<P>
   His selling of sellout became apparent when David Broder asked
him on ``Meet the Press'' about assertions in his campaign book
that ``after World War II, Jewish influence over foreign policy
became almost an obsession with American leaders.'' And ``the
Israeli lobby is the most powerful of ethnic lobbies.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, advocate of ``Arab East Jerusalem'' as the Palestinian
capital, plunged in deeper: ``If Pat Buchanan becomes president of
the United States,'' he said, ``the foreign policy of this country
and the Middle East policy of this country will be made in the Oval
Office by the president of the United States alone.'' Implicit: And
not by those rich, pushy Jews who put Israel's interest ahead of
America's. He drove that dual-loyalty canard home with ``I know the
power of the Israeli lobby and the other lobbies, but we need a
foreign policy that puts our own country first.''
</P>
<P>
   Was this calculated to whip up resentment at Jews' political
participation, even at the cost of stimulating anti-Semitism? Of
course; he knows exactly what he's doing. To pose as fair, he also
imputes policy disloyalty to Americans with ties to Cuba, Greece,
Armenia and a dozen other places, and is careful to say ``Israeli
lobby'' rather than ``Jewish lobby.'' But you know what he means.
</P>
<P>
   The roots go deep. I went up against Pat on aid to Israel in
Nixon's '68 campaign on the issue of the sale of Phantom jets to
Israel. Buchanan argued it would get us no Jewish votes; although
Nixon agreed that Jewish Americans would oppose him overwhelmingly,
he urged the sale of the jets anyway because he thought the Israel
of Golda Meir was a strategic U.S. asset with admirable moxie. In
went a line promising a ``a qualitative edge,'' bipartisan policy
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   During the Persian Gulf War, Buchanan's bile spilled out. His
``amen corner'' crack displayed not just his isolationism, and his
deliberate leaving out of a Jewish name in a litany of expected
ethnic casualties led William F. Buckley, inventor of Goldwater
conservatism, to conclude regretfully that Buchanan's barbs could
well be taken as anti-Semitic. When I agreed in this space, my
White House comrade in arms ended our friendship.
</P>
<P>
   So now Democrats root for the nativist Buchanan to get the
Reform nomination just as Republicans root for the liberal Warren
Beatty. Neither major party would allow those would-be spoilers to
be part of the Presidential TV debates; the Reform Party would be
doomed to represent the resentful fringes of left or right. You
don't have to be Jewish to know that's not in America's interest.

A MERGER WITH HEINZ? BESTFOODS TAKES PAINS TO SAY IT ISN'T SO 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.J., N.Y.)  (af) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bestfoods, the maker of the childhood favorite Skippy peanut
butter and of Hellmann's mayonnaise, said Wednesday that it was in
``no significant acquisition or combination discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   A report in The Wall Street Journal Wednesday morning had said
that Bestfoods was in talks with H.J. Heinz Co. about a proposed
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods issued its disclaimer in a statement _ a rare, almost
unprecedented departure _ from a usual policy of no comment. And it
left many Wall Street analysts, executives and traders scratching
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Was the chairman of Bestfoods, Charles R. Shoemate, rebuffing
Heinz, but in the process telling Wall Street that his company was
willing to hook up with a partner? Was a merger wishful thinking on
the part of acquisition-hungry Heinz executives? And who was the
driving force behind a pairing? Perhaps the chairman of Heinz,
Anthony F.J. O'Reilly, who ran the company for two decades but has
seen his stock languish, hitting a 52-week low last week?
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, Hurricane Tony blew into the United States
and created a stir by making some proposals,'' said John McMillan
of Prudential Securities. ``I sense that Tony has 12 months to go
as chairman, and he wants to get something going. If you know Tony,
he's a talkative guy. I'm not saying he is shopping Heinz, but this
might be a case where Tony wants to be hunted.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinz would not comment on the talks and refused requests for
interviews with executives. A Bestfoods spokeswoman would not
elaborate on her company's statement.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever heat was there though _ and people close to the two
companies say preliminary discussions ended Tuesday night _ seems
to have cooled. But it could signal that Heinz may be putting
itself on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods, with its strong international business, is not as
vulnerable as other food companies, like Heinz, which are primarily
dependent on sales in the United States for revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some investment bankers spent part of Wednesday on the
phone trying to find other suitable partners for the two companies.
That is because it's unlikely that talks would revive in the near
future given Bestfoods' statement, industry experts said.
Regulators would question whether talks had really ended. And if
they had not, Bestfoods could be the target of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz had been thinking about the idea of merging with
Bestfoods, based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., since early this year,
people close to those talks said _ an idea several investment banks
had promoted. But in an industry ripe for consolidation, analysts
said, Bestfoods was in a stronger position to negotiate because of
its profitable international operations.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, Heinz executives were not shy about expressing
their interest early. Jaine Mehring, a senior food analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney, said executives from Heinz invited her to
breakfast last spring and told her of their interest in a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were interested in a combination and asked me about the
synergies,'' Ms. Mehring said, recalling the conversation. Still,
Ms. Mehring said she thought it was surprising that executives _ if
indeed there were talks going on then _ would be so open with an
analyst. ``I thought, `Why are you telling this to me?''' she said.
``My response was, `Don't tell me, tell Shoemate,''' referring to
Bestfoods' chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Mehring said at the company's ``Heinz 57 Weekend''
conference in Dublin, Ireland, early in August, she joked about it
with a senior vice president, Michael J. Bertasso, and an executive
vice president, Malcolm Ritchie. When they started to talk about
Heinz's international operations, ``we teased them about merging
with Bestfoods,'' she said. ``They smiled but never said
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Heinz rose $1.4375 Wednesday, to $44.625, while
Bestfoods stock soared, up $4.1875, to $53.125.

vision of saving their homeland and returned with troubling
memories of death and destruction. (Barbara Alper/New York Times

09-15 --Under Hafez al-Assad's portrait, a storyteller, Rashid Abu
Shadi, reads tales of Arab tradition every night to his loyal

it was when the Arabs were in their glory times,'' says Shadi, 55.
Tales told at the cafe, just steps from an eighth-century mosque,
have gained a following not seen in any other modern Arab capital.

COMMENTARY: JUSTICE, NEW YORK STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Celeste Goring-Johnson would be considered a soccer
mom if she were white and lived somewhere other than Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   She is 42, married and the mother of three children. She's an
accountant with the city's Department of Youth and Community
Development. Her husband of nearly 16 years, Richard Johnson, is a
train operator for the Transit Authority. The family owns a
brownstone.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, a Saturday, Mrs. Johnson drove two of her children,
Elizabeth, 14, and Josiah, 3, to a dental appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took them inside, then I went back out to put some extra
coins in the meter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She noticed a jewelry store nearby and went in to get ring
guards for a couple of her rings. That took less than 10 minutes
and cost $6. She paid and was about to leave the store when the
proprietor locked the front door and declared that a diamond ring
was missing. He said no one could leave.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson recalled in an interview on Tuesday that there were
several other customers and employees in the store. But the owner,
Scott Middleberg, got it into his head that Mrs. Johnson had stolen
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the nightmare began.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson said she had not stolen anything. Middleberg asked
to search her handbag.
</P>
<P>
   She gave him the handbag and he looked through it. No ring. He
said he wanted to search her pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to feel this man on my person,'' she said. So
she told him no.
</P>
<P>
   Middleberg, according to Mrs. Johnson, said that if she didn't
cooperate he would have to call the police. Mrs. Johnson thought
that was an excellent idea, and told him so.
</P>
<P>
   The police were called. Other customers left the store.
</P>
<P>
   Four officers responded. Middleberg is reported to have told
them that he had a videotape showing that Mrs. Johnson was the only
person who had been near the ring that supposedly was missing. The
cops looked at the tape. They searched Mrs. Johnson, including her
pockets. No ring.
</P>
<P>
   Case closed, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not in New York in this day and age. Celeste Goring-Johnson, a
solid citizen who has never been in trouble with the law, whose
children were waiting at the dentist's for their mother to return,
who never in her life imagined that she might be charged with a
crime, was turned around, handcuffed and placed under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so humiliating,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``They took me
outside in handcuffs, and by this time people were gathering to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone brought the children outside and they saw their mother
being hauled toward a police car. An officer asked Mrs. Johnson if
she wanted the children turned over to the police. She said no,
they should wait at the dentist's office until their father could
pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of city we live in now. It's a city in which a
woman who had voluntarily undergone two searches can nevertheless
be dragged away in handcuffs, presumably because she was near an
item that was reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson's humiliation was just beginning. She was taken to
the 61st Precinct station house, where she was strip-searched. Her
mouth was searched. Hands were run all through her hair. She was
made to squat, etc. No ring was found.
</P>
<P>
   Case finally closed, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not in this town. Not in this era. Mrs. Johnson was
fingerprinted. Her mug shot was taken. And she was handcuffed to a
chair in the station house, where she remained for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the absence of any evidence whatsoever, she was
charged with a crime _ petty larceny, a Class A misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson is being represented by the Manhattan lawyer David
Everett. He had her take a polygraph test, which she passed with no
trouble. He went to see Middleberg, who, according to Everett,
``acknowledged that he never saw her take the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett asked to view the store's videotape of Mrs. Johnson. He
said Middleberg told him it no longer existed. He had recorded over
it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the humiliation of Mrs. Johnson is indelible, and the
criminal charge, incredibly, is still pending.

SOUTHEASTERN COAST BRACED FOR FURY OF FLOYD

<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ After forcing nearly 3 million people out of
their homes, Hurricane Floyd last night ended its seaward rumble up
the southeastern coast and was poised to wallop the Carolinas with
a storm surge that could rival Hurricane Hugo's catastrophic strike
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal residents who had yet to flee the storm were placed
under a dusk-to-dawn curfew, as police scurried from historic
Charleston to Wilmington, N.C., to clear the streets amid the
hurricane's howling advance.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted the 600-mile-wide hurricane, spewing
sustained winds of 115 miles an hour, would crash ashore with
devastating force about 2 a.m. between Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Cape
Fear, N.C. Potentially disastrous flooding and wind damage were
expected throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Before it blows out over the North Atlantic this weekend, the
storm is expected to menace most of the East Coast with high winds
and drenching rains as it roars toward New England. The National
Weather Service predicted the hurricane's remnants would pound the
New England coast through Friday with heavy rains and surging
tides, but with far less fury than the storm's assault on the
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Though Floyd's winds had diminished from their initial 155-mph
velocity, President Clinton issued preemptive disaster declarations
for North Carolina and South Carolina, and warned residents not to
defy orders to evacuate the low-lying coastal region. He said the
storm remained highly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that every citizen will heed the warnings of the
officials and the recommendations to take every action to protect
their families and stay out of harm's way,'' Clinton said, as he
rushed back to Washington from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane-force winds began ripping apart oceanfront sections of
South Carolina, although the Charleston area appeared to escape a
repeat of the Hugo disaster, which caused 29 deaths and $6 billion
of damage in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Floyd spared several hundred of miles of coastline from
Miami to Savannah, Ga., from the kind of destruction the storm
wrought Monday in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that Floyd would devastate the southeastern coast
triggered a full-scale exodus, which Vice President Al Gore
described as ''the largest peacetime evacuation of any disaster in
the history of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Floyd contributed to monumental traffic jams that
raised serious concern up and down the coast about the safety of
state and federal evacuation plans, the hurricane largely skirted
Florida and Georgia, causing far less damage than emergency
managers had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   At its worst in Florida, the hurricane washed out piers, knocked
out power to more than 200,000, and toppled streetlights. About 350
miles off the coast, the Coast Guard rescued three people from
18-foot seas in the hurricane's path, and the Navy was searching
for five crew members of a sinking tugboat.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was too soon to know just how badly the Carolinas
would be hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Florida and Georgia at this point feel like they've
dodged a real bullet,'' said Richard Moore, North Carolina's
secretary of public safety. ''This thing is not going to miss us.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the storm was as wide as Texas and one of the most
powerful to approach the Carolinas in recent years, authorities
left little to chance. The cobblestone streets of historic
Savannah, once considered to be situated in the hurricane's direct
path, were empty but for broken tree limbs and other debris.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hyatt Regency Hotel near the banks of the Savannah River,
nearly 200 police officers had moved in and were using the building
as an emergency staging area.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the river's churning waters battered a 103-year-old
wooden ship, the Barca Negra, as its captain and owner, Gerhard
Schwisow, 52, took last-minute precautions to try to save the
antique vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to turn it into a museum,'' Schisow said, as rain
pelted his yellow slicker and the river rose. ``But I'm afraid it
might end up in the parking lot,'' Schisow said, motioning toward a
paved lot on the river's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, boat owners trying to save their property filled a city
parking lot near the Charleston waterfront with their water crafts.
</P>
<P>
   As rain lashed the empty city streets, thousands of residents
were seeking refuge in shelters or hotels far inland. Similar
scenes were evident all along the coast, after South Carolina
Governor Jim Hodges ordered the entire coastal population _ about
800,000 residents _ to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This storm is so huge,'' said Charleston Mayor Joe Riley,
``it's very unlikely that this part of South Carolina can escape
without serious damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in North Carolina issued similar assessments.

BIAS WORSENS FOR MINORITIES BUYING HOMES, STUDIES SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Pa., N.Y.)  (rk) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Discrimination against black and Hispanic home
buyers has worsened as the economy has strengthened, two reports
released Wednesday by the Clinton administration show.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of ``a great economy, a great Dow Jones,
discrimination is getting worse, not just flourishing,'' said
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo at a news conference where he
introduced the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks were twice as likely as whites, and Hispanic-Americans 1
1/2 times as likely, to be denied a conventional, 30-year home loan
last year, according to one of the two studies, by the Association
of Community Organizations for Reform Now, a housing advocacy group
with branches in most big cities. ACORN, as it is known, reported
that disparities in rejections have worsened since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The second study, by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research
organization here, showed that discrimination was the reason for
the disparity, said Cuomo, whose agency commissioned the study. The
institute dispatched pairs of white and minority group members,
each pair with the same incomes, assets and job, credit histories
and neighborhoods, to seek mortgages from lenders throughout the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, minorities were less likely to receive information
about loan products, received less time and information from loan
officers and were quoted higher interest rates in most of the
cities where tests were conducted,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the only difference is the color of their skin,'' said
Cuomo, who presented the studies as part of an effort to press his
case for increases in money to enforce the Fair Housing and Equal
Opportunity law, which Republicans in Congress propose to cut.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Reid, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America, said, ``We'd be the first to admit that
there are some gaps to be closed in home ownership rates among
blacks and whites.'' The Census Bureau reports that 67 percent of
whites own homes, compared with 45 percent for both blacks and
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The figures also represent some closing of the gap, said Steven
Hornburg, director of research at the Research Institute for
Housing America, an affiliate of the mortgage bankers association.
Citing Census Bureau and other data, he said home ownership among
blacks has grown since 1994 by 7.8 percent, among Hispanics by 8.5
percent and among whites by 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the ACORN study said, a survey of mortgage loans
granted by 11,029 banks in 41 cities showed that black applicants
were rejected 217 percent as often as whites last year, or more
than double the rate. In 1995, which the group called the peak year
for lending to blacks, the rejection rate was 184 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The disparities varied greatly among the cities that the group
studied. In Chicago, it said, the black applicants last year were
denied loans almost four times _ the rate was 363 percent _ as
often as whites. At the other extreme was Pittsburgh, where the
rate was 128 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the rejection rate for blacks was relatively high _
228 percent last year, an increase from 184 percent in 1995. The
rates there for Hispanics were 182 percent last year and 170
percent four years ago. ACORN said the number of conventional
mortgages made to blacks declined 2.8 percent over the three years,
rose 3.6 percent for Hispanics and rose 61.1 percent for whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings are especially troubling,'' the group's study
concluded, ``in light of the fact that both the unemployment and
interest rates have been at their lowest in decades. Even with
these economic conditions, minorities were unable to gain much
ground, and black and Hispanic home-ownership rates are still less
than two-thirds the home-ownership rate of whites.''

FIRM IN BANK SCANDAL MAY HAVE USED FLEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A shadowy New York company at the heart of a growing
probe into an alleged multibillion-dollar Russian money-laundering
scheme had accounts at New England's leading bank, sources familiar
with the matter said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Benex International Co., opened approximately four
accounts at Fleet Financial Group Inc. branches in New York and
Pennsylvania, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, unnamed US firms used their BankBoston corporate
accounts to wire money to accounts held by Benex and related firms
at other banks, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Boston-based banks transferred several million
dollars on behalf of Benex and related companies over the past 18
months, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the midst of an extensive investigation that
surfaced last month say up to $10 billion tied to organized crime
and corporate fraud in Russia may have passed through accounts held
by Benex at the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators probing the Bank of New York, in what amounts to
the largest money-laundering inquiry in US history, suspect Benex,
a trading company, of having ties to alleged Russian mob boss
Semyon Mogilevich.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice,
and other investigators leading the inquiry have long suspected
that US and overseas banks have been used as ``revolving doors'' to
shift ill-gotten Russian gains into Western accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two major banks in Boston have been used for that
purpose,'' said one of the sources, adding that in contrast to the
Bank of New York, Fleet and BankBoston did not appear to be an
end-point for Benex-related money. In other words, the source said,
the Boston banks were conduits, rather than repositories, of
Benex-related finances, and transferred money to Benex accounts at
the Bank of New York. Still, sources said a dozen Fleet staffers
had been ``frantically'' combing through tens of thousands of
documents pertaining to Benex since the probe first came to light
Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of Fleet's and BankBoston's roles sheds new light
on what authorities suspect is a worldwide web of tainted money
flowing out of a corrupt and ailing Russia. Several European banks
recently notified regulators of suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston, which have merged, had not approached
regulators or authorities about their Benex-related activities and
had not been contacted by investigators, sources said. A Fleet
spokesman, James Mahoney, said Fleet had a policy of not discussing
individual accounts. BankBoston officials were not available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain how much of the money in question is linked to
organized crime, and how much is simply capital that fled Russia.
Money laundering _ the illegal shuffling of illicit gains through
shell companies and multiple bank accounts to make them appear
legitimate _ is difficult to track and even harder to prove. And it
is unclear whether Russian companies stashing profits abroad are
violating any laws other than their own.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Bank of New York probe has sparked fresh debate over
the West's political and economic support of Russia since the 1991
Soviet collapse. Investigators are exploring whether International
Monetary Fund aid to Russia was illegally diverted to Bank of New
York accounts, and whether Russian trading firms are using Western
banks to dodge tax inspectors back home.
</P>
<P>
   Benex, with operations in Queens, N.Y., and London, was headed
by Peter Berlin, a Russian emigre who is married to a former senior
Bank of New York executive, Lucy Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin and Edwards, a Leningrad-born emigre who set up Benex's
nine Bank of New York accounts and who was fired from her job after
the investigation surfaced, each held personal checking accounts at
Fleet, according to sources. The accounts were opened through Fleet
branches in New York and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment on money
transfers made by or on the behalf of Benex through Fleet and
BankBoston. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency also declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sources did not know what had triggered Fleet's inquiry into its
Benex-related activities but said the bank was hampered by obsolete
computer systems that made it difficult to track quickly the tens
of thousands of electronic wire transfers it processes daily. The
OCC, an industry regulator, launched a special inquiry of Fleet's
technology and monitoring systems earlier this year, one source
said.

MEXICO'S FORMER DRUG CHIEF, INDICTED IN U.S., FOUND DEAD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mario Ruiz Massieu, a volatile lawyer who was the most prominent
former Mexican official ever indicted on drug charges in the United
States, died Wednesday in New Jersey, an apparent suicide, his
lawyers and government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu, 48, who once headed anti-drug efforts under former
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, had been scheduled to
travel to Houston on Thursday for his first appearance in federal
court on drug and money laundering charges that were filed against
him there late last month.
</P>
<P>
   One of his Mexican lawyers, Xavier Olea Pelaez, said that after
living under house arrest with his family in New Jersey for the
last four years, Ruiz Massieu feared that he would be unable to
make bail and would be sent immediately to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have the money and he believed that he was not going
to be able to post bond,'' Olea Pelaez said. ``He got desperate,
and he took that very difficult decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution of Ruiz Massieu had been a landmark in efforts
by the United States and Mexico to challenge the official
corruption that has helped the drug trade grow into what Mexican
officials call the most serious threat to their national security.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said his death shut the door on a case
that took years to build, and one in which they had hoped he might
yet agree to reveal the complicity of even more senior Mexican
officials with the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Ruiz Massieu was found unconscious at his home in
Palisades Park, N.J., by his wife, Maria, who called 911 shortly
after 1:40 p.m. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Englewood
Hospital and Medical Center about 40 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu's principal lawyer in the United States, Cathy
Fleming, denied that he had been distraught over the legal case
against him, but noted that he had been treated for clinical
depression ``for a substantial period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   She said he had always insisted on his innocence and had done so
in a series of notes that he left behind for his family and
friends, as well as a public statement that was to be released at a
news conference on Thursday. Another person close to the Ruiz
Massieu family said the statement attacked the Mexican government
for what it characterized as malicious, unfounded attacks against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Two local officials in New Jersey speculated that Ruiz Massieu
had swallowed the contents of several bottles of prescription pills
that were found at his home. But an assistant prosecutor in the
Bergen County prosecutor's office, James Santulli, said the cause
of his death would have to be determined by an autopsy on Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The apparent suicide ends one of the more twisted political and
criminal sagas in recent Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu first gained wide notoriety in 1994, after Salinas
chose him to serve as deputy attorney general for the last seven
months of the administration. It was a period of political chaos in
Mexico, and a high point in the flow of South American cocaine
through the country to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Ruiz Massieu cast himself publicly as a crusader
against the drug trade and the corrupt officials who took bribes to
abet it. He also led a tumultuous investigation into the
assassination in that fall of his older brother, Jose Francisco, a
leading figure in the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, U.S. law-enforcement and intelligence
officials were already concluding that Mario Ruiz Massieu was not
the man he claimed to be. Even before he left office in late 1994 _
railing at supposed efforts by other governing-party leaders to
block the investigation into his brother's murder _ American
diplomats asked secretly that he be barred from any senior position
in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1995, Salinas' elder brother, Raul Salinas, was
arrested on charges of ordering the death of Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu. The two men were said to have had some personal
differences stemming from Ruiz Massieu's one-time marriage to the
Salinas brothers' sister, Adriana, and Mexican officials also
claimed that Ruiz Massieu had emerged as a political rival of Raul
Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the arrest of Raul Salinas, Mario Ruiz Massieu
fled Mexico after being questioned by the authorities there. He was
intercepted by federal agents as he waited for a connecting flight
at Newark International Airport and was held initially on charges
of failing to declare all the currency he was bringing through the
country.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs agents, however, had already come upon $9 million
that Ruiz Massieu had deposited in a pair of Houston banks during
the last two years of his service to the Salinas administration.
Most of the deposits were made by one of his close aides, who
routinely walked into the banks with huge amounts of cash stuffed
into suitcases and cardboard boxes.

SEVEN REPORTED KILLED AT FORT WORTH CHURCH

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A gunman walked into a sanctuary full of
young people at a southwest Fort Worth Baptist church Wednesday
evening and began firing, killing seven, including himself,
officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred at the Wedgwood Baptist Church about 7
p.m. during a rally related to ``See You at The Pole,'' which
attracted hundreds of teen-agers from several area churches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the gunman entered the church, a number of teens thought it
was a skit, witnesses said. But band members reportedly started
ducking behind amplifiers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports also indicated that a pipe bomb might have
exploded, sending shrapnel all the way into the balcony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's cartridges, shrapnel and empty cart boxes and blood
splattered all over the wall,'' said Lt. David Ellis, a police
spokesman at the scene. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was wearing a black leather jacket, bluejeans and a
bandanna when he walked into the church. A number of church members
said they did not recognize the man. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An off-duty police officer who lives near the church heard the
shots and called 911. &QL;

STOCK NETWORKS AGREE TO SHARE TRADING DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to create a single market for after-hours stock
trading, eight electronic stock trading systems signed a letter of
intent Wednesday to share price information and other market data.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, while preliminary, could reduce the fragmentation
that has developed as the new electronic trading systems have
competed for customer orders, thereby helping to make a new and
rapidly growing venue for stock trading fairer and more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, customers of any one of the trading systems could be
able to see prices being bid and offered for stocks on each of the
other seven systems, known as electronic communications networks,
or ECNs. In addition, customers could be able to route their orders
to whichever market has the best price, an executive of one of the
participating companies said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a commitment to create an after-hours electronic
trading network that will be the future of what the markets are
going to look like,'' said Michael Satow, president of MarketXT
Inc., an electronic network that last month began offering an
after-hours trading session to individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   The eight electronic communications networks that signed the
letter of intent _ MarketXT, Archipelago, Tradebook, Brut,
Instinet, Redibook, Strike and Island _ have emerged in the last
year as the most virulent competitive threats to the New York Stock
Exchange and the NASDAQ stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But even as investors and regulators have embraced the concept
of greater competition in financial markets, many of them have
expressed fears that the rapid growth of new trading systems will
result in a fractured market that is less efficient and more costly
for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have contended that instead of promoting a national
market for stock trading, the electronic networks will breed chaos,
a disconnected system of independent clubs whose members will never
know whether or not they were getting good prices for their trades.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to share price and other information addresses
those concerns, Satow said. ``All the competing players have come
together with a unified vision of what we want the market to look
like,'' he said. ``We believe it's in the interest of investors for
them to know they are able to get the best prices,'' whichever
network they use.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the networks have focused their efforts on
after-hours trading, which takes place outside normal market hours,
which on the East Coast last from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. In
addition, some of the trading networks have begun offering trading
early in the morning, before the national markets open for
business.
</P>
<P>
   One of the attractions of after-hours trading is that it opens
markets later in the day for investors in the western United
States, who currently are all but unable to trade stocks much after
lunch time.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet, the largest of the networks, has long offered big
institutions like pension funds and insurance companies the ability
to trade stocks with each other after normal trading hours. But
until recently, individuals have been shut out of those efforts. In
the last month, several electronic networks as well as some
traditional brokerage firms have begun to offer after-hours trading
to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, both NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange
said they planned to expand their trading hours, but deferred the
efforts until next year, partly in response to questions raised
about the plans by securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Further details of the agreement among the networks are expected
to be announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The very existence of networks as viable threats to the
established structure of the nation's financial markets has come
about because of cheap and powerful technology and a loosening of
rules that kept the stock-trading business in the hands of a few
powerful institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest investors in some of the networks are several
major Wall Street firms, including Goldman, Sachs; J.P. Morgan, and
Merrill Lynch.

WASHINGTON SCURRIES OVER FLOYD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The streets cleared. Grown men scurried out of
their Capitol Hill offices and rushed out the doors. The House went
home.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the nasty political fights and scandals. There is no
force that so instills fear into Washingtonians as weather _ any
kind of weather.
</P>
<P>
   This is a city that has closed schools at the threat of snow, a
place where children have been sent home from class because it was
too hot. Snow in Washington is treated as a space alien landing by
many skittish Washington drivers, even though there is some snow
nearly every winter.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise when Washington _ as of Wednesday night,
marred by only a mere drizzle of warm rain _ reacted Wednesday with
characteristic panic at the prospect of an unwelcome visit from
Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing, particularly when you're from New England,''
said Representative Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts.
``They are having an overreaction to the weather, definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   With tropical storm warnings for the metropolitan area, most
schools around Washington announced Wednesday afternoon that they
would be closed Thursday. District of Columbia employees were
offered ``liberal leave,'' meaning they can be late or not show up.
But federal employees in the nation's capital were expected to
arrive at work on time.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams warned of possible downed trees, power
outages, and flooding along the Potomac.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that House members might not make it their home
districts in time for the weekend because of flight delays or
cancellations, House leaders closed up shop Wednesday afternoon,
recessing until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate remained in session, with votes still scheduled
through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional committees and political candidates frantically
faxed cancellation notices around town of previously scheduled
hearings and appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole postponed a
planned visit Thursday to Melrose, Mass., where she was set to
discuss education issues. The event has been rescheduled for next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, stopping over in Hawaii on his way back from
New Zealand, dropped plans for a golf game to rush back to
Washington to monitor the weather emergency. He urged Americans to
``stay out of harm's way,'' and to leave affected areas if
necessary.

 &HT;    Bahamas take beating from Floyd
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSH HARBOR, Bahamas _ The idyllic coves of the Abacos were
littered with sunken and beached boats and lined with hundreds of
homes heavily damaged from the 150 mph winds and sea surges of
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 24 hours after the storm's eye passed over this
island, 170 miles east of Palm Beach, officials said damages would
run in the millions of dollars. It looked to be the hardest hit of
all the islands, according to the U.S. Coast Guard, which sent a
Falcon jet to survey the islands.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's winds also did significant damage to Treasure Cay, San
Salvador and Grand Bahama.
</P>
<P>
   But only one death was reported, a drowning on Grand Bahama
Island, 55 miles east of Palm Beach, in swells reported up to 6
feet. Freeport resident Bobby Tinker disappeared west of town when
he tried to swim from a van that got stuck in storm surge.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of deaths in the Abacos, which officials
said was due to a forced evacuation that began Monday night. More
than 900 people weathered the storm in the St. Francis de Sales
school in Marsh Harbour.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Sawyer, assistant chief of Marsh Harbor's 20-member
volunteer fire department said, ``Every time we go out, we see more
and more destruction,'' he said. ``It will take weeks to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the costliest damage to Marsh Harbor was on the downtown
waterfront, where a floating bar called the Tiki Hut sank, and
sailboats, 60-foot lobster trawlers and cabin cruisers, were pushed
on shore by sea surges. Car-sized shipping containers were tossed
into the air, landing at the door of the Pizza Hut and in
neighbors' yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``My refrigerator is on the other side of the canal and I got a
TV set down the road,'' said Wendy Gwynn, whose Abaco Club condo
facing the eastern ocean filled with 5 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a disaster like this,'' said Angela Cash, a
20-year-resident of the island who also has a home in Haverhill
near West Palm Beach. ``There is not a person that hasn't lost
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loss may have been on Hope Town, a key off the
eastern coast of the Abacos. The island was cut in half by the
storm, washing away seven homes and the Abaco Inn, said Silbert
Mills, mayor for the central Abacos. Ferry docks carrying
passengers to the key were destroyed by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   A central city shantytown called the Mud was knee-deep in water
and littered with tin and tarpaper from the homes occupied by the
island's Haitian residents.
</P>
<P>
   In Murphy Town just outside Marsh Harbour, several homes were
flattened by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the end,'' said Wellington Davis, 46, who
rode out the storm in his concrete block home on a ridge
overlooking the sea. Davis said he was holding on his door knob
with both hands when he saw the roof being lifted by the 150 mph
winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the roof going, I jumped out the window and ran
down the street,'' said Davis, who sat on the rumble of his home
Wednesday wondering why he didn't obey evacuation orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time they say go, they won't have to tell me twice,''
said Davis, still shaken by the afternoon of terror. ``The Bible
says the Lord will not put more burden on you then you can bear _
but he sure tested me yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   The eye passed over about 2 p.m., giving the island an hour of
moderate winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frightening,'' said Elizabeth Risberg, who spent
the night with her husband and three kids at a friend's house.
``The pressure was so bad it popped your ears as if you were on an
airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Seas surrounding the island looked like a muddy pond from silt
stirred up by the storm. Lobster fisherman Terrance Davis, 30, said
it would be about two months before the seas are clear enough to
set traps.

GOP CRITIC FAULTS WGBH ON USE OF CONSULTANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One month after WGBH-TV came under fire for sharing
donors' names with the Democratic Party, the station arranged a
series of focus groups to see how the public felt about the
controversy, station officials acknowledged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the station's choice of consultants that has aroused
WGBH's already energized critics.
</P>
<P>
   John Marttila, a Democratic consultant and pollster, was paid
approximately $20,000 by WGBH to gauge public sentiment toward
Boston's public television station in August, the chairman of the
House Telecommunications subcommittee said Wednesday.
Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, a Republican of Louisiana,
called the action ethically questionable and demanded further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has come to my attention that WGBH in Boston, which first
triggered the controvery over the sale, purchase, and rental of
donor lists between public broadcasters and political
organizations, has once again engaged in questionable ethical _ if
not legal _ practices,'' Tauzin wrote in letter to the inspector
general of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which oversees
funding for public stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH officials had thought they finished defending themselves to
Congress last week, following the release of the inspector
general's report that detailed the station's list-swapping
practices. The station gave out donors' names twice, both times by
mistake, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement was something of a surprise to station
officials, who said they had conducted the focus groups in good
faith. Jeanne M. Hopkins, vice president of communications for
WGBH, said, ``If the implication is that we hired a Democratic
pollster, that's simply not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Marttila has worked for Democratic Senator John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, as well as for Representative Edward J. Markey, the
Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the telecommunications
subcommittee that controls funding for public broadcasting. But
Hopkins said Marttila's political ties are irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Marttila is an opinion researcher, a well-respected
opinion researcher, who has been working in Boston for 20 years,''
Hopkins said. ``Is there supposed to be some kind of litmus test
for who you hire to do your work based on their personal
affiliation? I can't imagine it would be appropriate before you
hire somebody to ask whether they are a Democrat or a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, according to a spokesman for Tauzin, is not just
that Marttila has built a reputation on his success in helping
Democrats. It is that WGBH would do business with any political
entity, or perceived political entity, given the controversy over
the list-swapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't seem to get it,'' said Ken Johnson, Tauzin's
spokesman. ``We don't want any interaction at all between public
broadcasting and politicians and political parties. We are going to
put an end to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Marttila said the focus groups were not partisan. He called
Tauzin's allegations ``just disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was a shred of partisanship to it _ zero,
none, period,'' Marttila said of the focus groups. ``The WGBH
leadership conducted themselves in the most exemplary fashion. They
treated, I think, this entire issue seriously and appropriately.''
He said the use of the focus groups proved WGBH was ``extremely
responsive to its membership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really corporate concern at the highest level,''
Marttila said.
</P>
<P>
   Station officials did not disclose the amount paid to Marttila.
But Hopkins said he was not paid with federal funds. She also said
the focus groups helped shape new guidelines for WGBH, including a
provision that will clearly tell donors how to check off a box that
ensures their names are not swapped with other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped us understand what people viewed as important,''
Hopkins said. As for Tauzin's allegations, she said: ``I just don't
understand. We thought we were taking extra steps to be thorough
and responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Inspector General Kenneth A. Konz, Tauzin
requested an investigation to determine whether Marttila was paid
with federal funds. Konz did not return calls seeking comment.

CONSERVATIVE MUSICAL CHAIRS; QUESTIONS ABOUT BUCHANAN; DEMOCRATS
TAKE A CUE

   Musical Chairs Time in Conservative Camp
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the conservative advocate of family values, has been
riding high since he finished a solid fourth in last month's
Republican presidential straw poll in Iowa. The way he sees his
finish, though he was beaten by George W. Bush, Steve Forbes and
Elizabeth Dole, he nevertheless finished far enough ahead of the
rest of the 10-candidate field, especially other hard-core
conservatives like Pat Buchanan and Dan Quayle, to lay claim to the
title of new leader of the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But that's not good enough for Charles Jarvis, an old
friend who worked with Bauer in the Reagan administration, who has
strong ties to Christian conservatives and who has been national
chairman of the Bauer campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday he quit. Worse, he signed on as a strategist with
Forbes, whose national poll numbers are a bit higher than Bauer's,
whose pockets are infinitely deeper and who has recently been
laboring mightily to persuade Christian right Republicans that he
is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Bauer, my friend and colleague for 16 years, cannot
win,'' Jarvis said. ``We waged a valiant effort in Iowa. But we
must be honest with ourselves. This is now a race between George W.
Bush and Steve Forbes. Steve Forbes is the only conservative who
can win. It is time for all conservatives to rally behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Who Gets Hurt if Buchanan Bolts
</P>
<P>
   So far, Pat Buchanan is only talking about bolting the
Republican Party to join the Reform Party. But suppose he actually
makes the leap, as seems more and more likely with each passing
Buchanan lament about how the Grand Old Party has lost its
conservative moorings?
</P>
<P>
   The widespread assumption among political pros has been that
should he switch and go on to win the Reform nomination, his
hard-right following would make the switch with him. In such a
case, the reasoning goes, the Republican nominee would be hurt more
in the fall by his defection than the Democratic nominee, even
though Buchanan might siphon a nice bit of Democratic votes by
adding some Reform reformism to his hard-right pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a poll that gives a bit of underpinning to that
assumptive scenario, including the part that assumes Buchanan has
no real shot at becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Conducted last weekend by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center
for the People and the Press, the poll found that if the
presidential election were held now and the candidates were Bush
and Gore, Bush would win 54 percent to 39 percent, with 7 percent
undecided. But in a three-way contest between Bush, Gore and
Buchanan, Bush would win by 49 percent, with Gore finishing second
with 35 percent, Buchanan coming in third with 10 percent and 6
percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Buchanan would cut Bush's lead, albeit narrowly
_ but many presidential races are decided narrowly. In fact, when
the Pew people took a closer look at the results of the poll, which
covered 1,025 voters and had a sampling error margin of plus or
minus three percentage points, they found, ominously for Bush, that
of the voters who chose Buchanan in the three-way contest, two of
every three had been Bush supporters in the Bush-Gore matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this early state, Bush's big lead over Gore does not appear
vulnerable to a third party challenge from Pat Buchanan,'' Andrew
Kohut, the center's director, said. ``However, in a closer race, a
Reform Party bid by the conservative commentator might mean trouble
for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   UTAH: Democrats Learn A Republican Trick
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah finally jumped into the Republican
presidential contest last summer, the leader, Bush, was somewhere
up in the 50s in the polls and somewhere around the $36 million
mark in raising campaign cash. The senator predicted his message of
solid conservatism would eventually enable him to overtake Bush in
the polls. As for catching up with the governor in the
money-raising business, well, he had this hot idea.
</P>
<P>
   All it would take, he said, was for one million people to give
him $36 each. ``George Bush has the fat cats,'' Hatch said. ``I
want the skinny cats.''
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on how much cash that scheme has brought in. But it
has given Utah Democrats an idea.
</P>
<P>
   For next year's Senate race, they say they will make 15,000
phone calls and mail out 10,000 letters in which they will ask for
donations of $36 to take on Hatch or whomever else the Republicans
put up.
</P>
<P>
   One catch, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats don't have a candidate yet.

   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Negotiators for the United Automobile
Workers and DaimlerChrysler AG continued their round-the-clock
labor talks Wednesday after indefinitely extending their current
contract, which was to expire at midnight on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three-year contracts with General Motors and Ford Motor were
also scheduled to expire at midnight on Tuesday, and talks
continued with those companies, too. The union was expected to
reach an agreement with DaimlerChrysler first. In a sign that talks
were progressing, the union stopped five wildcat strikes that broke
out on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was expected to call for raises of at least 3 percent a
year for three or four years, increased pension benefits and
strengthened job security measures for workers, labor and industry
sources said. The generous wage increases come as the auto industry
is pulling in record profits and enjoying strong sales.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the union has agreed to contract terms with one
auto company and then insisted that the other two accept the same
terms. The contract will cover the nation's 400,000 unionized auto
workers.

GOP CRITIC FAULTS WGBH ON USE OF CONSULTANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One month after WGBH-TV came under fire for sharing
donors' names with the Democratic Party, the station arranged a
series of focus groups to see how the public felt about the
controversy, station officials acknowledged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the station's choice of consultants that has aroused
WGBH's already energized critics.
</P>
<P>
   John Marttila, a Democratic consultant and pollster, was paid
approximately $20,000 by WGBH to gauge public sentiment toward
Boston's public television station in August, the chairman of the
House Telecommunications subcommittee said Wednesday.
Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, a Republican of Louisiana,
called the action ethically questionable and demanded further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has come to my attention that WGBH in Boston, which first
triggered the controvery over the sale, purchase, and rental of
donor lists between public broadcasters and political
organizations, has once again engaged in questionable ethical _ if
not legal _ practices,'' Tauzin wrote in letter to the inspector
general of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which oversees
funding for public stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH officials had thought they finished defending themselves to
Congress last week, following the release of the inspector
general's report that detailed the station's list-swapping
practices. The station gave out donors' names twice, both times by
mistake, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement was something of a surprise to station
officials, who said they had conducted the focus groups in good
faith. Jeanne M. Hopkins, vice president of communications for
WGBH, said, ``If the implication is that we hired a Democratic
pollster, that's simply not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Marttila has worked for Democratic Senator John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, as well as for Representative Edward J. Markey, the
Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the telecommunications
subcommittee that controls funding for public broadcasting. But
Hopkins said Marttila's political ties are irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Marttila is an opinion researcher, a well-respected
opinion researcher, who has been working in Boston for 20 years,''
Hopkins said. ``Is there supposed to be some kind of litmus test
for who you hire to do your work based on their personal
affiliation? I can't imagine it would be appropriate before you
hire somebody to ask whether they are a Democrat or a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, according to a spokesman for Tauzin, is not just
that Marttila has built a reputation on his success in helping
Democrats. It is that WGBH would do business with any political
entity, or perceived political entity, given the controversy over
the list-swapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't seem to get it,'' said Ken Johnson, Tauzin's
spokesman. ``We don't want any interaction at all between public
broadcasting and politicians and political parties. We are going to
put an end to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Marttila said the focus groups were not partisan. He called
Tauzin's allegations ``just disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was a shred of partisanship to it _ zero,
none, period,'' Marttila said of the focus groups. ``The WGBH
leadership conducted themselves in the most exemplary fashion. They
treated, I think, this entire issue seriously and appropriately.''
He said the use of the focus groups proved WGBH was ``extremely
responsive to its membership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really corporate concern at the highest level,''
Marttila said.
</P>
<P>
   Station officials did not disclose the amount paid to Marttila.
But Hopkins said he was not paid with federal funds. She also said
the focus groups helped shape new guidelines for WGBH, including a
provision that will clearly tell donors how to check off a box that
ensures their names are not swapped with other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped us understand what people viewed as important,''
Hopkins said. As for Tauzin's allegations, she said: ``I just don't
understand. We thought we were taking extra steps to be thorough
and responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Inspector General Kenneth A. Konz, Tauzin
requested an investigation to determine whether Marttila was paid
with federal funds. Konz did not return calls seeking comment.

TOWN BACKS PRISON OVER UNTARNISHED SKY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (nk) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Vt. _ Amateur astronomers who cherish Vermont's
dark night skies suffered a blow on Tuesday when residents of this
economically depressed town voted to allow construction of a prison
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomy enthusiasts fear that the 350-bed prison's glaring
lights will spoil viewing from one of New England's main
star-gazing centers, Breezy Hill, which is 3.8 miles from the
prison site.
</P>
<P>
   Every August, amateur astronomers and telescope makers from
across the nation converge on the 80-acre Breezy Hill for a
gathering known as Stellafane, an annual event since 1926. It is
attended by thousands of star-gazing campers and others, many with
home-made telescopes the size of artillery pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Breezy Hill is also the site of a year-round observatory with
several research-caliber telescopes built by semiprofessional
astronomers. All of the work is carried out by volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Many organizers and participants in Stellafane have played
important roles in professional astronomy. Among Stellafane's
founders was Russell W. Porter, who was a major participant in the
design and construction of the 200-inch telescope on Mount Palomar,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Among Stellafane's most ardent partisans is David H. Levy,
co-discoverer with Dr. Eugene Shoemaker of a comet named for the
two that broke apart in 1994 as it was drawn toward Jupiter,
creating fireworks visible from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In a plea opposing the prison construction published in the
October issue of the magazine Sky &AMP; Telescope, Levy wrote:
``Stellafane is a magical place, a sanctuary to the stars. Steeped
in tradition, it is the birthplace of the hobby of amateur
telescope making.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the new prison, who include Gov. Howard Dean,
argued that the prison's lights would have a minimal effect on star
gazing.
</P>
<P>
   But Levy said: ``Its grounds will be as bright as day. I have
given astronomy lectures at prisons before, and I'm amazed at how
bright the sky glow can be, even if the lights are well shielded.''
</P>
<P>
   The balloting by Springfield residents on Tuesday was a re-vote.
The first, on June 29, was so close (1,633 in favor of the prison
and 1,564 opposed) that Stellafane supporters successfully
petitioned for a second vote. It went decisively against them, with
2,345 favoring the prison and 1,535 against.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield, once an important center of machine tool
manufacturing, has been economically depressed for many years, and
the state's offer of $7 million in incentives for allowing the
prison to be built nearby proved to be attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Maryann V. Arrien of Putnam Valley, N.Y., president of the
Vermont Amateur Telescope Makers Club and the spokeswoman for
Stellafane, said Wednesday that the group would continue to press
for light shielding and whatever measures might mitigate pollution
of the night sky when the prison is completed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we know that the Vermont prison at Newport near the
Canadian border is so bright that objects on the prison grounds
cast shadows on the clouds above,'' Ms. Arrien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're deeply sorry,'' she said, ``but we respect the
democratic will of the people of Springfield.''

SEVEN REPORTED KILLED AT FORT WORTH CHURCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A gunman walked into a sanctuary full of
young people at a southwest Fort Worth Baptist church Wednesday
evening and began firing, killing seven, including himself,
officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred at the Wedgwood Baptist Church about 7
p.m. during a rally related to ``See You at The Pole,'' which
attracted hundreds of teen-agers from several area churches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the gunman entered the church, a number of teens thought it
was a skit, witnesses said. But members of Forty Days, the band
playing at the event, reportedly started ducking behind
amplifiers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports also indicated that a pipe bomb might have
exploded, sending shrapnel all the way into the balcony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's cartridges, shrapnel and empty cart boxes and blood
splattered all over the wall,'' said Lt. David Ellis, a police
spokesman at the scene. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was wearing a black leather jacket, bluejeans and a
bandanna when he walked into the church. A number of church members
said they did not recognize the man. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An off-duty police officer who lives near the church heard the
shots and called 911. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One man was reportedly taken into custody for questioning, but
police did not say why. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Dickens, 14, said she was sitting in the second pew in
the sanctuary when the gunman entered through the rear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just finished singing and we were praying when he came
in,'' Dickens said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As many as 400 people may have been in the sanctuary, witnesses
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a joke,'' Dickens said. ``We were singing,
and he told us to shut up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gunman then began shooting in different directions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was our pastor playing a joke on us. But then
Cassie got hit in the throat. She never got up,'' Dickens said. &QL;

UNITED NATIONS PREPARES TO SEND PEACEKEEPERS INTO EAST TIMOR  
</HEADLINE>
  (See TIMOR-REFUGEES)

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As Australia prepared to land an international
force in East Timor to restore order, a U.N. emergency expert was
able to travel out of the capital for the first time Wednesday to
visit the largest concentration of refugees remaining in the
territory. He found them struggling to survive on rice handouts
from the military.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative calm prevailed in Dili, East Timor's capital, in the
hours that followed a Security Council vote after 2 a.m. Wednesday
approving the deployment of a force of up to 8,000 soldiers and
equipment offered by more than a dozen countries.
</P>
<P>
   The force will go in with Security Council orders to end the
violence that has raged for nearly two weeks and to safeguard the
return of aid workers and eventually many displaced people driven
from their homes by pro-Indonesian militias after the East Timorese
voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in New York, Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas,
said that the vote for a break with Indonesia could be recognized
by the national Parliament sooner than anticipated. Its new session
opens in Jakarta on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at the possibility of holding the peoples'
consultative assembly session earlier, but I don't know now whether
that is possible,'' Alatas said. A decision to accept the East
Timorese results would require a larger administrative role for the
United Nations, which under a May agreement would run the new
country until its first elections.
</P>
<P>
   The 50,000 displaced East Timorese around the town of Dare,
whose numbers are equivalent to half the population of the capital,
six miles to the north, have no milk for their children or
medicines to combat diarrheal diseases and malaria, the official,
Kevin M. Kennedy told U.N. headquarters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy, one of 12 U.N. staff members left in East Timor,
found that an Indonesian Jesuit with contacts in the Indonesian
Army had found a way to have six tons of rice delivered daily
throughout the mayhem of the last week, to be distributed to people
hiding in the surrounding hills.
</P>
<P>
   In Dili itself, U.N. security officers, led by Brig. Gen.
Razakul Haider of Bangladesh, have been able to return to their
looted compound from their refuge in the Australian consulate.
Wednesday they discovered that some of the radios stolen from
vehicles 24 hours ago had been returned and clumsily reinstalled in
cars and trucks _ not always the right ones _ said Fred Eckhard,
the U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   International human rights groups and relief agencies now making
plans to return to East Timor fear they will find evidence of many
killings, based on stories told by refugees who have fled the
territory, many of whom were evacuated by the United Nations to
Darwin, a northern Australian port from which the military and
relief operations will be launched.
</P>
<P>
   The first substantive report of damages and loss of life may
come from the Red Cross, which hopes to return to Dili as early as
Thursday, officials said here.
</P>

<P>
   The World Food Program is assembling a chartered helicopter
fleet for food drops, and will also experiment for the first time
with a ``snow-drop'' system by which 350,000 plastic packets of
high-energy crackers or cookies will be scattered from the air over
inaccessible regions of East Timor. The packages are designed to
float to earth in manageable sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian officials, who arrived in New York at the beginning
of the week bridling at the pace at which the United Nations had
been moving toward a virtual international takeover of East Timor,
are now down to working out details for the inevitable transfer of
power in the territory, which Indonesia seized in 1975 after the
colony was abandoned by Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly came here with a mandate to get this done, but
they were testing the bottom line, which rapidly became clear,'' a
Western diplomat said. ``They were pushing for a lot more than they
were going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Alatas, the foreign minister, said Wednesday his government
recognized that Indonesian troops in East Timor would be under
international command, and would serve largely in an advisory or
liaison role.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are going to discuss in detail is how the cooperation
will take place,'' Alatas said. ``I don't think that the question
of keeping the Indonesian armed forces in barracks is being
contemplated.'' But, he added, there will be ``no combat role'' for
them.
</P>
<P>
   If violence breaks out, he said, the troops of the international
force ``are quite prepared for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alatas said that he and his Portuguese counterpart, Foreign
Minister Jaime Gama, were also talking with Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and other officials about how much Indonesian civil
administration would be restored to the territory in this interim
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public services have to run,'' he said. ``People get sick.''
Water and electricity would have to be supplied, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council resolution adopted early Wednesday morning,
however, sets out some very specific tasks for the Indonesian
military, holding Jakarta's forces responsible for ``peace and
security'' in East Timor even with the international force there,
until power is transferred to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the resolution, Indonesia is also expected to bring
thousands of East Timorese back to the territory safely from West
Timor, the other half of the island, which has always been part of
Indonesia. Most of those refugees were apparently forced there at
gunpoint by the militias, who have been separating out men and boys
and may have been killing them or sending them to more distant
locations on other islands, refugees say.
</P>
<P>
   Who ultimately controls the border between East and West Timor
may be a key factor in the success or failure of the operation
about to begin on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Many questions were left unanswered by the resolution creating
the international force, diplomats acknowledged. But the strong
supporters of the British-sponsored resolution, led by the United
States, which forced the Security Council to stay in session until
the measure was adopted, despite stalling tactics and procedural
delays by the Russians and others who had no substantive problems
with the document, say that the overriding need was to find a way
to end the violence, even if most of the other work is still to be
done.

 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There are two buildings that lord over this
city, the state Capitol and the Tower, and officials at the
University of Texas like to point out that the Tower stands two
feet higher. On special occasions, such as a celebration of a
championship football season, the limestone structure is
illuminated in school colors and transformed into an orange torch
that glows above the campus.
</P>
<P>
   But if, as officials say, the Tower symbolizes the university's
heart and its aspirations, it is also tainted by death _ a legacy
that the university hopes finally ended Wednesday, as the Tower's
observation deck reopened for the first time in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, 1966, a student, Charles Whitman, dragged a foot
locker filled with hunting rifles onto the deck and, after killing
several people inside the Tower, fired at people below as if they
were deer, in all killing 14 and wounding 31 others. His rampage
lasted 96 minutes, but has reverberated for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as shootings at schools and office buildings occur with
disturbing frequency, the Whitman incident is mostly a grim
historic footnote. But in the 1960s, it helped define the decade
and further shattered the nation's sense of well being. If the
assassination of John F. Kennedy proved that even a president could
be killed, the Whitman attack marked a new and different terror _
that anyone anywhere could be killed at random, and by an Eagle
Scout, no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``People essentially said, `Don't ask about it. Please don't ask
about it,' '' said Dr. Kenneth Foote, a geography professor at the
university since 1982, recalling attitudes on campus about the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   After four people jumped from the Tower, the last in 1974, the
stain of death became too great and the university closed the
observation deck. Wednesday morning, in marking the university's
116th birthday, university president Larry Faulkner stepped onto
the deck and declared it reopened.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Faulkner noted that a generation of students not
yet born in Whitman's era wanted to enjoy the majestic views of
central Texas. But for an older generation of Texans, Faulkner's
gesture meant finally reclaiming the University's most beloved
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time for this university to move on and accept
the history that goes with this building and fully embrace the
positives,'' Faulkner said. Had he looked up, Faulkner could have
seen dark spots still marking where bullets had struck the stone.
</P>
<P>
   In reopening the deck at the request of student groups, Faulkner
faced skeptics who feared the Tower could again become a magnet for
suicides or a perch for a sniper. A stainless steel lattice was
erected to prevent jumpers and security checkpoints were built as
safeguards against weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lives of a lot of the survivors were terribly disturbed by
what happened,'' said Dr. Teresa Sullivan, the university's vice
president and graduate dean. ``We've still got people who can't
walk across the campus without looking over their shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, the 33rd anniversary of the shootings, university
officials dedicated a garden at the foot of the Tower to the memory
of the Whitman victims. Foote, who has written extensively about
places marred by violence, said that a sense of shame has often
prevented communities from publicly acknowledging heinous acts. He
noted that Salem, Mass., did not erect a memorial to the town's
famous witch trials for 300 years. Now, he said, events like the
Oklahoma City bombing or the Littleton, Colo., school shooting have
changed attitudes about how communities should deal with public
grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing here is an attempt to come to terms with the
event,'' Foote said.
</P>
<P>
   Completed in 1937, the Tower is an architectural landmark, a
30-story beacon whose image is embossed on the university's logo.
Erected atop the central Main Building, the Tower has always served
as office space. In years past, students could ride the small
elevators to the 27th floor, then walk up a narrow stairwell to the
observation deck for a view that easily inspired wonder.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``That first morning,'' wrote the late Willie Morris in his
memoir, ``North Toward Home,'' reminiscing about his student days
in the 1950s, ``I took the elevator to the top, and looked out on
those majestic purple hills to the west, changing to lighter shades
of blue or a deeper purple as wisps of autumn clouds drifted around
the sun; this, they would tell me, was the Great Balcones Divide,
where the South ended and the West began.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, more than anyone or anything, shattered this serene
image.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Whitman was a married, 25-year-old ex-marine who was
studying architectural engineering. Shortly before noon on Aug. 1,
he carried a cache of weapons in his military foot locker up to the
deck. He killed a receptionist with the butt of his rifle, then
fatally shot two tourists before barricading the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lavergne, author of ``A Sniper in the Tower,'' a
non-fiction account of the incident, said the entire campus lay
unaware below. Whitman had carried sandwiches, toilet paper and a
can of Spam, and as he took aim through his rifle scope, he fired
his first shot directly through the abdomen of a woman who was
eight months pregnant. When the unborn child's father bent over in
horror, Whitman killed him. The baby died, too, though the mother
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Heard, an Associated Press reporter, was among the first
reporters on the scene. Heard, now 69, watched as two police
officers sprinted across an open plaza, then raced after them when
he felt a rifle shot explode into his left shoulder. ``I staggered
about three steps and fell on the hot pavement,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Heard dictated a short story from his hospital bed that ran
around the world. In a grotesque variation of target practice,
Whitman picked off unsuspecting people for more than 90 minutes.
Lavergne said a customer in a barber shop four blocks away walked
to the door and was promptly shot in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Citizens rushed to the scene with hunting rifles and began
firing back as police officers armed with handguns were largely
helpless. Lavergne said the lessons of the Whitman case prompted
many police departments to develop the first SWAT teams. Until a
police officer finally broke through the barricade and killed him,
Whitman had been almost unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings horrified the nation. A television reporter, Neal
Spelce, broadcast a primitive audio feed to all three national
networks, foreshadowing today's all-encompassing media coverage of
such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``White middle-class America was shocked,'' said Dr. Rosa
Eberly, an assistant professor of rhetoric who has taught a course
on the Whitman attack and Wednesday participated with Foote in a
symposium on the Tower. ``Whitman was the smiling Eagle Scout.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's motive remains in dispute. Police discovered that he
had killed both his mother and his wife the night before the
shootings to spare them ``the shame'' for what he planned to do. He
had suffered headaches, and had even fantasized about killing
people from the Tower to a psychiatrist, who did not believe he
would do it. He left a note asking that an autopsy be performed on
his body to ``see if there is any mental disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy revealed a pecan-sized tumor in his brain, but
Lavergne said doctors disputed the possibility that it caused his
behavior. Other theories speculate that Whitman wanted to embarrass
his father or that he was under the influence of amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Without a concrete explanation and with university officials
long loath to discuss the attack, Dr. Eberly said, Whitman became a
minor cultural anti-hero. Country music singer Kinky Friedman
wrote, ``The Ballad of Charles Whitman,'' with the famous line,
``There was a rumor about a tumor.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many of today's students, Whitman is little more than a
vague figure. Adriana Mendoza, a 19-year-old sophomore from El
Paso, said she learned about the shootings this summer from a
television news program. Sitting on the grass beneath the Tower
this week, she said she wanted to go to the top, but she also
wanted assurances that she would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should be able to experience it and be safe when we
experience it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first public visits will occur Thursday. More than 500
people have booked reservations, nearly selling out the first two
weeks. Belongings must be left downstairs, and each group will be
escorted by an armed campus police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No foot lockers are going to go back up to the Tower again,''
said Dr. Sullivan, the graduate dean.
</P>
<P>
   Noting what she hopes are positive results from the reopening,
she added, ``One of the best ways we can say we are open for
business for all of you is to open the Tower. It's just too
important of a symbol of who we are.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Floyd leaves shift in Fla. business
 &HT;    By Stephanie Smith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Floyd flinched, but not before forcing
construction projects, restaurants, beer delivery trucks and
beachfront hotels to lose as much as two days of business.
</P>
<P>
   Barrier island hotels such as The Breakers in Palm Beach, the
Boca Raton Resort &AMP; Club and Sheraton Oceanfront Resort in Singer
Island bused patrons to safety, sending guests to hotels on
Florida's west coast or the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the inconvenience and fear, some guests such as a group
of vacationers from the United Kingdom found the thought of
impending disaster fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could sense they found it intriguing, they're eyes were wide
open like it was an adventure,'' said Stephen Kappeler, the
Sheraton Oceanfront's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-room hotel lost about $20,000, which includes
cancellations of 80 reservations because of Floyd, he said. The
hotel hired a bus to take 43 guests to a four-star resort in
Marathon Key on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, inland hotels did a banner business, with rooms
filled to capacity by residents forced to evacuate their homes or
stranded travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Taylor West, a professor at the University of Florida's
Bureau of Economics and Business Research, said Wednesday that it
would be difficult to gauge the storm's economic impact because
services and sales merely may have shifted from one business to
another or may have been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't get my hair done for a day because of the
hurricane, it doesn't mean I'm not going to get it done at all for
the next two months,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   At William Thies &AMP; Sons in Fort Pierce, which typically makes
350 deliveries of Miller, Heineken, Molson and Samuel Adams beers
from the Palm Beach County line north to Indian River County, brisk
beer sales offset a delivery shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the week, it'll be a wash,'' said general
manager Pete Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants such as Howley's in West Palm Beach closed Tuesday,
anticipating the arrival of Floyd. The restaurant opened for
breakfast on Wednesday, but had to close at 2 p.m., because of a
shortage of food and staff.
</P>
<P>
   Many construction companies didn't bother to reopen Wednesday
because of the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Roberts, manager of Zeiger Crane Rental Inc. in West Palm
Beach, said the business was closed Tuesday and Wednesday because
construction projects stopped. The company typically handles 35
jobs a day, renting 180-foot cranes.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Home Depot, which shipped more than 580,000 sheets of
plywood to Florida stores Monday and Tuesday, compared to the
typical 13,000 sheets a day, it wasn't all good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't building decks or reseeding lawns when there's a
hurricane approaching,'' said Home Depot spokesman Don Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, those people were snapping up flashlights and
batteries. Every Home Depot from Marathon Key to Virginia Beach,
Va., sold a year's supply of those items on Monday alone.
</P>
<P>
   The company allows returns of unused storm supplies, such as
lumber and generators, but there weren't many returns Wednesday.
Hurricane Gert and concerns about year 2000 computer problems
probably have people holding onto their generators and plywood,
Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Even newspapers have to cope with losing business because of a
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Post's Advertising Operations Manager Gregg Harr
said that businesses typically pull their advertisements in advance
of a storm, although some of that loss is made up with unexpected
advertisers, such as insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, a lot of stores are preoccupied by being closed so
there's no use advertising,'' Harr said. ``And, a lot of
advertisers are concerned about how much time people are going to
spend reading their paper or even if the paper will be delivered,''
Harr said.

SEVEN REPORTED KILLED AT FORT WORTH CHURCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A gunman walked into a sanctuary full of
young people at a southwest Fort Worth Baptist church Wednesday
evening and began firing, killing seven, including himself,
officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred at Wedgwood Baptist Church about 7 p.m.
during a rally related to ``See You at The Pole,'' which attracted
hundreds of teen-agers from several area churches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the gunman entered the church, a number of teens thought it
was a skit, witnesses said. But members of Forty Days, the band
playing at the event, reportedly started ducking behind
amplifiers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports also indicated that a pipe bomb might have
exploded, sending shrapnel all the way into the balcony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's cartridges, shrapnel and empty cart boxes and blood
splattered all over the wall,'' said Lt. David Ellis, a police
spokesman at the scene. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was wearing a black leather jacket, bluejeans and a
bandanna when he walked into the church. A number of church members
said they did not recognize the man. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An off-duty police officer who lives near the church heard the
shots and called 911. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One man was reportedly taken into custody for questioning, but
police did not say why. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Dickens, 14, said she was sitting in the second pew in
the sanctuary when the gunman entered through the rear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just finished singing and we were praying when he came
in,'' Dickens said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As many as 400 people may have been in the sanctuary, witnesses
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a joke,'' Dickens said. ``We were singing,
and he told us to shut up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gunman then began shooting in different directions. &QL;
</P>
<P>

MARKET PLACE: SIGNS OF DROPOFF IN ONLINE STOCK TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although some stock market pundits are still worried about
irrational exuberance, Bill Hatcher, a retiree who trades stocks
and options online, worries more about misplaced melancholia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sensation mongers out there have scared everyone to
death,'' said Hatcher, referring to the zeitgeist of the online
chat rooms he constantly monitors. ``Whether it's Y2K, or
inflation, you just don't see as many happy people out there
trading now.''
</P>
<P>
   It may just be the laws of gravity. But the outlook of
individual investors has been taking a dive. And that is bad news
for online brokerage houses, which have seen trading volumes ebb
recently. If the trend holds, investors are on course to trade
fewer shares online this quarter than they did in the previous
three-month period, making it the first such sustained decline in
Internet trading volume for the nascent online brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is rarely a record-breaking time for stock trading. But
trading volume _ on which online brokers depend mightily for
revenues _ slumped more than just about anyone expected in July and
August. September, at least so far, has not offered much relief.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the indicators: Charles Schwab, the largest online
brokerage firm, reported Wednesday that average daily revenue from
trades by its customers dropped 14 percent from July to August, a
figure that some analysts viewed as a leading indicator for the
industry. Credit Suisse First Boston noted that trading in a sample
basket of high-flying Internet stocks was off 2 percent for the
second quarter. And two brokerage analysts on Wednesday downgraded
earnings estimates for Knight/Trimark Group, the biggest market
maker for shares traded on the NASDAQ, including many big Internet
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Appleby, online brokerage industry analyst for BancBoston
Robertson Stephens, reduced his estimates for Knight's earnings per
share for the July-September quarter to 31 cents from 36 cents, or
14 percent. That is the second time in a month he has lowered his
profit targets for the market maker, whose revenues have
skyrocketed in tandem with heavy trading in Internet stocks and
individual investors' migration to online brokerage houses. In
early August, he revised estimates for Knight downward from 40
cents. Knight's shares closed Wednesday at $30.625, down $1, or 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an industry-wide issue,'' Appleby said. ``We expected a
seasonal trough in the summer. But the volume has been unexpectedly
poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Few believe that America's love-affair with online trading has
faded. On the contrary, most analysts say that Internet brokerages
have just begun to tap a huge pool of savings still stored in banks
and in accounts with full-service brokers. Americans have 70
million brokerage accounts, but only 10 percent of them permit
online trading. And as more people move their assets online, taking
a more active role in their investment decisions, trading volume
tends to rise substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the decline in trading in the third quarter comes
after a nine-month growth frenzy that saw Internet broker
transactions double in size. By the end of June, they accounted for
one in six stock trades made in America. That pace was not viewed
as sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even a temporary trading slump could be hazardous to the
online brokerage industry's health. Schwab, for example, derives
almost half its total earnings from trading commissions, and most
of its trades are now conducted online. For smaller brokers _ there
are three score of them competing for Internet investors now _ the
dependence on trading commissions is far greater.
</P>
<P>
   All have seen sharp drops in their share prices. Schwab shares
have fallen by half since April and closed Wednesday at $36.4375,
up 6.25 cents. Etrade has tumbled 63 percent in the same period,
closing Wednesday at $23.5625, down 46.875 cents.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, many of the leading Internet brokers are geared for
growth, not for a grinding battle for market share. ETrade and
Ameritrade, two of the best-known online brokers, are spending
hundreds of millions of dollars to promote themselves, sacrificing
earnings today for rapid growth tomorrow. Ameritrade said Wednesday
that it planned to spent $200 million over the next year on
advertising, about as much as Mazda spent advertising cars and
trucks last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``ETrade and Ameritrade depend on commission much more than
Schwab,'' said L. Russell Keene, a brokerage analyst at Putnam,
Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton. He has a relatively bearish
``hold'' recommendation on both stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Internet brokerages will report third quarter
earnings in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Keene said he now saw the first and second quarters of this year
as exceptional. Internet investors, Internet stock and Internet
brokerages found themselves then in a virtuous circle. Investors
opened new brokerage accounts and seized on high-flying Internet
stocks, including the brokerage firms themselves, sending share
prices skyward.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really fueled an anomaly in trade volumes,'' Keene said.
``If you ignore the first and second quarter and look at the trend,
what we see this year is less worrying.'' He said stock trading
volumes were still up over year-earlier periods, even though the
increase was less robust than it was in the recent past: Third
quarter commissions grew 40 percent in 1997 over 1996, 30 percent
in 1998 over 1997, and seem likely to grow 20 percent in 1999 over
1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures of online investment activity are also slowing,
but not as much as trading commissions. Customers at Schwab, which
reports certain operating statistics more regularly than most of
its rivals, added $8 billion to the company's assets under
supervision in August, allowing the firm to keep pace with
expectations. Schwab also reported that it had 6.3 million customer
accounts in August, up from 6.2 million in July and not far off
analysts' predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Etrade and Ameritrade seemed to have slowed more, Keene said. He
expects that Ameritrade will add about 50,000 new accounts for the
quarter, down 50 percent from account growth in the second quarter.
ETrade, Keene estimates, will add about 200,000 accounts, well off
its stellar performance in the second quarter, when 332,000
customers opened new accounts at that firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other indicators of a slow down in the quarter,'' he
said. ``But it is by no means a terminal slowdown. The long-term
trend is still healthy.'' But the summer swoon may give a clue as
to how fickle retail investors are. They have fired the rise of
Internet brokerages and then given them the shivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like we were seeing people act like cheerleaders for
companies before, now you often see people just fan the fires of
negativity,'' said Joe Andras, an electrical engineer in Laguna
Beach, Calif., who manages his own stock portfolio and trades
online. ``It can be frustrating, but it shows you that you have to
look long-term.''

FLORIDIANS EXPECTED TO JAM ROADS TO GET BACK HOME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TERRY KLIEWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ It promises to be a beautiful day in the
neighborhood all along Florida's upper east coast Thursday after
Hurricane Floyd spent most of Wednesday pushing northward toward
the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday morning also promised headaches for tens of
thousands of residents trying to get back to their storm-swept
neighborhoods along the coastline from Melbourne up to
Jacksonville, north Florida's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
   Fallen power lines, broken tree limbs, nonworking traffic
signals and wary cops patrolling beachfront roads combined to slow
the return of hurricane evacuees as officials reopened access
points along coast-hugging U.S. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problems stemmed from power lines snapped by the 60
mph wind gusts on Floyd's outer fringe. The hurricane itself passed
out of Florida waters with the eye never closer than 150 miles to
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the state had at least 100,000 homes without
power but expected 75 percent to be restored by Thursday afternoon.
Contractors from across the country worked with local utility
companies to do repairs. Meanwhile, traffic congestion grew
steadily through the day on the roads leading to beachfront
communities, starting just after noon EST Wednesday when
authorities began opening barrier island bridges to local-only
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Police continued into the evening to check identification for
drivers headed east, creating long lines at several chokepoints in
the Daytona Beach and St. Augustine areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers who waited up to two hours to get through were
philosophical, largely because officials repeatedly advised anxious
evacuees that beachfront housing generally appeared to be in good
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jim Raner, a retiree headed back to Neptune Beach after
spending a couple of days in an area hotel: ``I can stand to wait a
little while for good news. They say everything's probably OK.''
</P>
<P>
   His main worry were his two dogs, left behind inside his mobile
home. ``I got my own cleanup to do, I imagine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials were advising the 7,000 residents of Raner's
beachside hometown to boil their tap water as a precaution against
bacteria because water pressure had been lost briefly earlier
Wednesday. Most of the influx of evacuees was expected to come
Thursday morning under what weather forecasters said might actually
be the region's first sunshine and blue skies in three days.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville Mayor John Delaney urged the returning residents to
be patient, even to stay put at inland shelters, hotels, and
friends' and relatives' homes until Thursday to give work crews
time to restore power.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Friday we expect everything to be back to normal in
Jacksonville, Florida,'' he told reporters at a Wednesday afternoon
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the city's airport and public transportation
would be up and running again Thursday, and the port would resume
operations, too.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario was replayed all along the upper Florida coast
Wednesday as the departing hurricane finished its long good-bye
here with continuing showers, drooping clouds and blustery winds.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and homes remained boarded up in all north Florida
coastal towns apparently because, as one convenience store operator
put it, ``Why bother with it now? The weekend is soon enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees and customers alike promised to remain scarce until
Friday, and gasoline and grocery deliveries were slow to resume in
many places. The grungy weather had departed much of the south
Florida coastline by late Tuesday, and the homeward stampede of
residents there was winding down by Wednesday night. Although the
hurricane stayed well offshore and only grazed Florida's Atlantic
coastline with mostly tropical storm-force winds, its storm surge
and tumbling surf took a toll on beaches and ocean piers.
</P>
<P>
   A 100-foot section of Jacksonville Beach's oldest tourist pier
was toppled by heavy waves Wednesday. But those same waves were
already being eyed by local surfers, among them a young hotel desk
clerk here who said he expected to be on the water today ``when it
ought to be about perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning Gov. Jeb Bush told Floridians they had done
the right thing by departing coastal areas starting early in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to know'' what's in store with a hurricane, he
said. ``You have to prepare and you have to evacuate,'' and pointed
out that only a slight westward drift by Floyd could have brought
catastrophe to the state. Later in the day, Mayor Delaney spoke for
himself, Bush and probably everyone else on the coast when he
summed up the past few days for reporters:
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very, very, very, very lucky. Frankly, this was
amazing.''

 By BRENDAN M. CASE 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MILPA ALTA, Mexico _ Marcos Rosas Abad has a simple question:
Why, in the age of the North American Free Trade Agreement, should
small farmers like him limit themselves to Mexico's modest domestic
market? After all, exports lead to prosperity.
 &HT;    Rosas Abad thinks he might have the right crop: the nopal, an
edible cactus that traces its roots back to pre-Columbian times and
to Milpa Alta, this quaint district of rural hamlets that is
actually part of Mexico City.
 &HT;    The fleshy cactus leaves were once derided as cattle feed. But
today, it's popular all over Mexico. Now some would-be exporters
claim it's catching on with Mexican-food aficionados in the United
States and health food junkies in North America and Europe _ and
are doing everything they can to supply them.
 &HT;    ``We need new markets,'' says Rosas Abad. ``We need to find a
way to improve our production and export the nopal, because people
would like it if they tried it.''
 &HT;    Help is on the way. Budding entrepreneurs are trying to add the
nopal to the long list of Mexican folk products such as tequila,
tortillas and salsa that have found favor abroad. Their goal is to
transform the cactus leaf industry from an agricultural backwater
into another Mexican export success story.
 &HT;    ``There's definitely a market abroad for the nopal, I can see
it,'' says Ismael Rivera Cruz, director of Nopal del Carmen, a
small company in Milpa Alta that exports a portion of its canned
cactus leaves to Germany, Holland, Belgium and Spain. ``We need to
work a little harder and we need some more financing.''
 &HT;    Its name means ``high cornfield'' in Mexican Spanish, but Milpa
Alta has become the nopal capital of the world, producing 280,000
metric tons last year worth some US$63 million, according to the
Agriculture Ministry. The town of 90,000 _ really a collection of
12 separate villages _ is a borough of Mexico City and just an hour
from downtown.
 &HT;    But you'd never guess how close the town lies to the world's
most populous city. Earthen hills separate Milpa Alta from the rest
of the capital, keeping the great metropolis out of sight and out
of mind. A single winding road snakes through rolling countryside
and nopal fields, connecting villages where cobblestone streets and
colonial churches have retained their timeless rural tranquility.
 &HT;    Cactus leaves are the town's main business year round,
accounting for 60 percent of the local economy. And no place in
Mexico would benefit as much from their exports as Milpa Alta.
 &HT;    There are a few signs the nopal is catching on beyond Mexico's
borders. Farmers now grow nopales as far away as Japan and Italy.
Health food companies in the United States and Canada are packaging
nopal-based capsules as an aid in easing indigestion, controlling
body weight and even managing high cholesterol and diabetes. The
cactus leaves are also gaining acceptance thanks to the increasing
popularity of Mexican food worldwide.
 &HT;    ``Nopales have been on my menu since we opened 14 years ago, and
they've been very well received,'' says David Suro, a Guadalajara
native who owns a restaurant in Philadelphia called Tequilas.
Indeed, one of the house favorites is Filete Grito, a slab of beef
tenderloin on a nopal leaf spiked with serrano chiles. ``Some
people are not very adventurous,'' Suro says. ``But when they try
nopal, I would say 90 percent of them like it.''
 &HT;    Still, boosting the homely nopal's popularity outside Mexico a
hard sell. Cacti may be picturesque along the highway, but they
don't exactly have the natural appeal of aged tequila or Corona
beer. The leaves get slimy after being cooked, sliced and
incorporated into classic dishes like tacos de nopales or nopales
con jitomate (cactus leaf with red tomatoes). And the wild
vegetable flavor leaves even Mexicans split into opposing camps of
supporters and detractors.
 &HT;    Then there's nopal juice, often available in the breakfast
spreads at trendy restaurants and Mexican hotels. Some laud the
stuff as a healthy potable that's easy on the stomach and not too
sweet. Others describe it as green saliva.
 &HT;    But in Milpa Alta, the natural goodness _ and commercial promise
_ of the nopal is an article of faith. Townspeople have been
growing the cactus since before the Spanish conquest. The plants
are a staff of life rivaled only by corn.
 &HT;    ``Where there are nopal plants, there are people,'' says Esteban
Olvera Gomez, a physician and Milpa Alta native who harvests a
nopal field in his spare time.
 &HT;    Olvera Gomez, who is now a top political official in Milpa Alta,
remembers when the nopal began its commercial conquest of Mexicans.
People in Milpa Alta and pockets of central Mexico have eaten
cactus leaves for centuries, but many others didn't catch on until
the 1970s. Now the plant is common in supermarkets nationwide.
Farmers from states like Morelos, Hidalgo, Aguascalientes and San
Luis Potosi have made pilgrimages to Milpa Alta and taken home seed
plants that provided the basis for their own fields. Milpa Alta is
still the national leader in nopal production, but it has plenty of
competition.
 &HT;    ``When I was in medical school, I had friends from northern
Mexico City who thought nopal leaves were just cattle feed,''
Olvera Gomez says. ``They changed their minds after trying it.''
 &HT;    Farmers in Milpa Alta switched to nopal production en masse in
the 1960s as traditional subsistence farming gave way to the search
for a cash crop.
 &HT;    But cactus farming provides only a modest living to farmers like
67-year-old Rosas Abad. Making the business more profitable through
exports could be crucial to fighting off the chief threat to Milpa
Alta's future. Mexico City is just a few miles away over the nearby
hills, and urban sprawl might one day destroy the rural, small-town
life that still predominates here.
 &HT;    ``The nopal is the economic sustenance of our community,''
Olvera Gomez says. ``The more we promote nopal production, the
better our chances of preventing the city from taking over Milpa
Alta.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MILPA ALTA, Mexico _ Marcos Rosas Abad has a simple question:
Why, in the age of the North American Free Trade Agreement, should
small farmers like him limit themselves to Mexico's modest domestic
market? After all, exports lead to prosperity.
 &HT;    Rosas Abad thinks he might have the right crop: the nopal, an
edible cactus that traces its roots back to pre-Columbian times and
to Milpa Alta, this quaint district of rural hamlets that is
actually part of Mexico City.
 &HT;    The fleshy cactus leaves were once derided as cattle feed. But
today, it's popular all over Mexico. Now some would-be exporters
claim it's catching on with Mexican-food aficionados in the United
States and health food junkies in North America and Europe _ and
are doing everything they can to supply them.
 &HT;    ``We need new markets,'' says Rosas Abad. ``We need to find a
way to improve our production and export the nopal, because people
would like it if they tried it.''
 &HT;    Help is on the way. Budding entrepreneurs are trying to add the
nopal to the long list of Mexican folk products such as tequila,
tortillas and salsa that have found favor abroad. Their goal is to
transform the cactus leaf industry from an agricultural backwater
into another Mexican export success story.
 &HT;    ``There's definitely a market abroad for the nopal, I can see
it,'' says Ismael Rivera Cruz, director of Nopal del Carmen, a
small company in Milpa Alta that exports a portion of its canned
cactus leaves to Germany, Holland, Belgium and Spain. ``We need to
work a little harder and we need some more financing.''
 &HT;    Its name means ``high cornfield'' in Mexican Spanish, but Milpa
Alta has become the nopal capital of the world, producing 280,000
metric tons last year worth some US$63 million, according to the
Agriculture Ministry. The town of 90,000 _ really a collection of
12 separate villages _ is a borough of Mexico City and just an hour
from downtown.
 &HT;    But you'd never guess how close the town lies to the world's
most populous city. Earthen hills separate Milpa Alta from the rest
of the capital, keeping the great metropolis out of sight and out
of mind. A single winding road snakes through rolling countryside
and nopal fields, connecting villages where cobblestone streets and
colonial churches have retained their timeless rural tranquility.
 &HT;    Cactus leaves are the town's main business year round,
accounting for 60 percent of the local economy. And no place in
Mexico would benefit as much from their exports as Milpa Alta.
 &HT;    There are a few signs the nopal is catching on beyond Mexico's
borders. Farmers now grow nopales as far away as Japan and Italy.
Health food companies in the United States and Canada are packaging
nopal-based capsules as an aid in easing indigestion, controlling
body weight and even managing high cholesterol and diabetes. The
cactus leaves are also gaining acceptance thanks to the increasing
popularity of Mexican food worldwide.
 &HT;    ``Nopales have been on my menu since we opened 14 years ago, and
they've been very well received,'' says David Suro, a Guadalajara
native who owns a restaurant in Philadelphia called Tequilas.
Indeed, one of the house favorites is Filete Grito, a slab of beef
tenderloin on a nopal leaf spiked with serrano chiles. ``Some
people are not very adventurous,'' Suro says. ``But when they try
nopal, I would say 90 percent of them like it.''
 &HT;    Still, boosting the homely nopal's popularity outside Mexico a
hard sell. Cacti may be picturesque along the highway, but they
don't exactly have the natural appeal of aged tequila or Corona
beer. The leaves get slimy after being cooked, sliced and
incorporated into classic dishes like tacos de nopales or nopales
con jitomate (cactus leaf with red tomatoes). And the wild
vegetable flavor leaves even Mexicans split into opposing camps of
supporters and detractors.
 &HT;    Then there's nopal juice, often available in the breakfast
spreads at trendy restaurants and Mexican hotels. Some laud the
stuff as a healthy potable that's easy on the stomach and not too
sweet. Others describe it as green saliva.
 &HT;    But in Milpa Alta, the natural goodness _ and commercial promise
_ of the nopal is an article of faith. Townspeople have been
growing the cactus since before the Spanish conquest. The plants
are a staff of life rivaled only by corn.
 &HT;    ``Where there are nopal plants, there are people,'' says Esteban
Olvera Gomez, a physician and Milpa Alta native who harvests a
nopal field in his spare time.
 &HT;    Olvera Gomez, who is now a top political official in Milpa Alta,
remembers when the nopal began its commercial conquest of Mexicans.
People in Milpa Alta and pockets of central Mexico have eaten
cactus leaves for centuries, but many others didn't catch on until
the 1970s. Now the plant is common in supermarkets nationwide.
Farmers from states like Morelos, Hidalgo, Aguascalientes and San
Luis Potosi have made pilgrimages to Milpa Alta and taken home seed
plants that provided the basis for their own fields. Milpa Alta is
still the national leader in nopal production, but it has plenty of
competition.
 &HT;    ``When I was in medical school, I had friends from northern
Mexico City who thought nopal leaves were just cattle feed,''
Olvera Gomez says. ``They changed their minds after trying it.''
 &HT;    Farmers in Milpa Alta switched to nopal production en masse in
the 1960s as traditional subsistence farming gave way to the search
for a cash crop.
 &HT;    But cactus farming provides only a modest living to farmers like
67-year-old Rosas Abad. Making the business more profitable through
exports could be crucial to fighting off the chief threat to Milpa
Alta's future. Mexico City is just a few miles away over the nearby
hills, and urban sprawl might one day destroy the rural, small-town
life that still predominates here.
 &HT;    ``The nopal is the economic sustenance of our community,''
Olvera Gomez says. ``The more we promote nopal production, the
better our chances of preventing the city from taking over Milpa
Alta.''

MEXICO'S FORMER DRUG CHIEF, INDICTED IN U.S., FOUND DEAD
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS lede to rephrase `apparently a suicide'; ADDS two grafs
before optional material with quote from his lawyer; adds
background in optional material on the Salinases and attempts by
Mexico to extradite Ruiz Massieu.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mario Ruiz Massieu, a volatile lawyer who was the most prominent
former Mexican official ever indicted on drug charges in the United
States, died Wednesday in New Jersey, apparently a suicide, his
lawyers and government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu, 48, who once headed anti-drug efforts under former
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, had been scheduled to
travel to Houston on Thursday for his first appearance in federal
court on drug and money laundering charges that were filed against
him there late last month.
</P>
<P>
   One of his Mexican lawyers, Xavier Olea Pelaez, said that after
living under house arrest with his family in New Jersey for the
last four years, Ruiz Massieu feared that he would be unable to
make bail and would be sent immediately to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have the money and he believed that he was not going
to be able to post bond,'' Olea Pelaez said. ``He got desperate,
and he took that very difficult decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution of Ruiz Massieu had been a landmark in efforts
by the United States and Mexico to challenge the official
corruption that has helped the drug trade grow into what Mexican
officials call the most serious threat to their national security.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said his death shut the door on a case
that took years to build, and one in which they had hoped he might
yet agree to reveal the complicity of even more senior Mexican
officials with the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Ruiz Massieu was found unconscious at his home in
Palisades Park, N.J., by his wife, Maria, who called 911 shortly
after 1:40 p.m. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Englewood
Hospital and Medical Center about 40 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu's principal lawyer in the United States, Cathy
Fleming, denied that he had been distraught over the legal case
against him, but noted that he had been treated for clinical
depression ``for a substantial period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   She said he had always insisted on his innocence and had done so
in a series of notes that he left behind for his family and
friends, as well as a public statement that was to be released at a
news conference on Thursday. Another person close to the Ruiz
Massieu family said the statement attacked the Mexican government
for what it characterized as malicious, unfounded attacks against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Two local officials in New Jersey speculated that Ruiz Massieu
had swallowed the contents of several bottles of prescription pills
that were found at his home. But an assistant prosecutor in the
Bergen County prosecutor's office, James Santulli, said the cause
of his death would have to be determined by an autopsy on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming, Ruiz Massieu's lawyer, said he had never given a
thought to changing his story of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was actually looking forward to the fight,'' she said. ``I
think he just didn't want to put his wife and child through it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The apparent suicide ends one of the more twisted political and
criminal sagas in recent Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu first gained wide notoriety in 1994, after Salinas
chose him to serve as deputy attorney general for the last seven
months of the administration. It was a period of political chaos in
Mexico, and a high point in the flow of South American cocaine
through the country to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Ruiz Massieu cast himself publicly as a crusader
against the drug trade and the corrupt officials who took bribes to
abet it. He also led a tumultuous investigation into the
assassination in that fall of his older brother, Jose Francisco, a
leading figure in the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, U.S. law-enforcement and intelligence
officials were already concluding that Mario Ruiz Massieu was not
the man he claimed to be. Even before he left office in late 1994 _
railing at supposed efforts by other governing-party leaders to
block the investigation into his brother's murder _ American
diplomats asked secretly that he be barred from any senior position
in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1995, Salinas' elder brother, Raul Salinas, was
arrested on charges of ordering the death of Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu. The two men were said to have had some personal
differences stemming from Ruiz Massieu's one-time marriage to the
Salinas brothers' sister, Adriana, and Mexican officials also
claimed that Ruiz Massieu had emerged as a political rival of Raul
Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials quickly concluded that Mario Ruiz Massieu had
been instrumental in limiting the investigation into his brother's
slaying in order to cover up the role of Raul Salinas. Although
Ruiz Massieu's possible motive for doing this was never clear,
Mexican officials speculated that the Salinas family may have been
able to block the inquiry by having knowledge of corrupt activities
by Ruiz Massieu.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas has never been formally accused of any illegal
activity. Raul Salinas was convicted of murder earlier this year,
and is serving a prison sentence of 27-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the arrest of Raul Salinas, Mario Ruiz Massieu
fled Mexico after being questioned by the authorities there. He was
intercepted by federal agents as he waited for a connecting flight
at Newark International Airport and was held initially on charges
of failing to declare all the currency he was bringing through the
country.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs agents, however, had already come upon $9 million
that Ruiz Massieu had deposited in a pair of Houston banks during
the last two years of his service to the Salinas administration.
Most of the deposits were made by one of his close aides, who
routinely walked into the banks with huge amounts of cash stuffed
into suitcases and cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration initially deferred attempts by the
Mexican government to extradite Ruiz Massieu on various charges of
graft, money laundering and torturing criminal suspects in order to
cover up his brother's murder case. The extradition efforts failed
again and again, however, and Ruiz Massieu stuck fast to his claims
that he was innocent and knew nothing of any wrongdoing by either
Carlos Salinas or his brother.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a civil jury in Houston confiscated most of Ruiz
Massieu's money after federal prosecutors presented evidence that
he had taken huge bribes from Mexican drug traffickers in order to
protect their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately afterward, Customs officials set out to build
a criminal case that would land Ruiz Massieu in prison. American
officials said the government of Salinas's successor, President
Ernesto Zedillo, was helpful in that effort, sending several
witnesses to Houston to testify before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Among those was one of Mario Ruiz Massieu's closest former
associates, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, a former federal police chief
who told the grand jury that he had collected nearly $2 million in
drug bribes in 1993 and 1994 and had given the money to Ruiz
Massieu.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in a statement
Wednesday night that the death of Ruiz Massieu would end the
prosecution against him.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MILPA ALTA, Mexico _ Marcos rosas abad tiene una pregunta
simple: por que, en la era del TLC, los pequenos agricultores como
el deben limitarse al modesto mercado mexicano? A fin de cuentas,
la prosperidad depende de las exportaciones.
 &HT;    Rosas Abad cree que a lo mejor tiene la cosecha indicada: el
nopal, un cactus comestible cuyo cultivo se remonta a la epoca
precolombina, y a Milpa Alta, un singular distrito de aldeas que
forma parte de la Ciudad de Mexico.
 &HT;    Las carnosas hojas del cactus solo se usaban antes para
alimentar ganado. Pero hoy son populares en todo Mexico. Varios
posibles exportadores afirman que el nopal se populariza entre los
aficionados a la comida mexicana en Estados Unidos y a la comida
sana en Norteamerica y Europa.
 &HT;    ``Necesitamos mercados nuevos,'' dice Rosas Abad. ``Necesitamos
mejorar nuestra produccion y exportar el nopal, porque a la gente
le gustaria si lo probaran.''
 &HT;    La ayuda ya esta en camino. Varios empresarios incipientes
tratan de agregar el nopal a la larga lista de productos tipicos
mexicanos como el tequila, las tortillas y la salsa picante, que
tienen una gran demanda en el extranjero. Su objetivo es
transformar la industria de la hoja del cactus, hasta ahora una
actividad agricola secundaria, en otra historia de exito entre las
exportaciones mexicanas.
 &HT;    ``Definitivamente hay un mercado para el nopal en el extranjero;
lo veo,'' dice Ismael Rivera Cruz, director de Nopal del Carmen,
una pequena compania de Milpa Alta que exporta parte de sus hojas
de cactus enlatadas a Alemania, Holanda, Belgica y Espana.
``Necesitamos trabajar un poco mas duro y tambien necesitamos mas
financiamiento.''
 &HT;    Milpa Alta (una milpa es un maizal) se ha convertido en la
capital mundial del nopal. El ano pasado produjo 280.000 toneladas
metricas por valor de US$63 millones, segun la Secretaria de
Agricultura. El pueblo de 90.000 habitantes (en realidad es un
conjunto de 12 aldeas) esta a una hora de camino del centro de la
capital. Un grupo de colinas que separa a Milpa Alta del resto de
la capital no deja ver la metropoli. Un camino tortuoso que
serpentea entre el terreno ondulado y los campos de nopal une a las
tranquilas aldeas, en cuyas calles de adoquines y sus iglesias de
la era colonial el tiempo parece haberse detenido.
 &HT;    Las hojas de cactus son la principal actividad del pueblo
durante todo el ano y el 60 por ciento de la economia local. Y
ningun lugar de Mexico se beneficiaria tanto de su exportacion como
Milpa Alta.
 &HT;    Hay algunas senales de que el nopal gana reconocimiento mas alla
de las fronteras mexicanas. Ya se cultivan nopales en Japon e
Italia. Companias de alimentos sanos en EU y Canada venden capsulas
con nopal para combatir la obesidad y hasta para controlar el
colesterol y la diabetes. Las hojas de cactus tambien se hacen
celebres gracias a la gran popularidad de la comida mexicana en
todo el mundo.
 &HT;    ``En mi menu siempre he ofrecido nopales, desde que abrimos hace
14 anos, y han sido muy bien recibidos,'' dice David Suro, un
empresario nacido en Guadalajara que tiene un restaurante en
Filadelfia llamado Tequilas. Es mas, uno de los platos favoritos
del establecimiento es el Filete Grito, un filete de carne servido
en una hoja de nopal con chiles serranos. ``Hay gente que no prueba
muchas cosas,'' dice Suro. ``Pero cuando prueban el nopal, diria
que al 90 por ciento les gusta.''
 &HT;    Sin embargo, impulsar el consumo del nopal fuera de Mexico es
dificil. Los cactus son pintorescos a la orilla del camino, pero no
tienen el atractivo del tequila reposado o de la cerveza Corona.
Las hojas se cocinan, se cortan y se anaden a platos clasicos como
los tacos de nopales o los nopales con jitomate (hojas de cactus
con tomates rojos).
 &HT;    Lo mismo sucede con el jugo de nopal, que se sirve en
restaurantes de moda y en hoteles mexicanos. Algunos lo elogian,
diciendo que es saludable, que cae bien y que no es demasiado
dulce. Para otros, es saliva verde.
 &HT;    Pero en Milpa Alta, las bondades y la promesa comercial del
nopal son articulo de fe. El cactus, que se cultivaba antes de la
llegada de los espanoles, es un alimento basico cuyo unico rival es
el maiz. ``Donde hay nopales, hay gente,'' dice Esteban Olvera
Gomez, medico y nativo de Milpa Alta que cultiva un campo de
nopales en su tiempo libre.
 &HT;    Olvera Gomez, que ahora es funcionario del pueblo, recuerda
cuando el nopal comenzo la conquista comercial de Mexico. En Milpa
Alta y en otras zonas del centro del pais se comia hojas de cactus
desde hacia siglos, pero en otras partes se empezaron a consumir en
los anos 70. Ahora la planta es comun en los supermercados de todo
el pais. A Milpa Alta han ido agricultores de Morelos, Hidalgo,
Aguascalientes y San Luis Potosi en busca de semillas para iniciar
sus cultivos. Milpa Alta aun esta a la cabeza en la produccion de
nopal, pero tiene mucha competencia.
 &HT;    ``Cuando estudiaba en la escuela de medicina, tenia amigos del
norte de la Ciudad de Mexico que pensaban que las hojas de nopal
solo servian para el ganado,'' dice Olvera Gomez. ``Pero cuando las
probaron, les gustaron.''
 &HT;    Los agricultores de Milpa Alta pasaron a la produccion en masa
del nopal en los anos 60 cuando la tradicional agricultura de
subsistencia cedio su lugar a los cultivos lucrativos.
 &HT;    Pero el cultivo del cactus solo permite vivir modestamente a
campesinos como Rosas Abad, que tiene 67 anos. Lograr que el
negocio sea mas rentable por medio de la exportacion es vital para
rechazar la mayor amenaza que afronta Milpa Alta. La Ciudad de
Mexico esta a pocos kilometros, al otro lado de las colinas, y la
expansion urbana podria destruir en un futuro el ambiente rural y
la tranquilidad del poblado.
 &HT;    ``El nopal es el sosten economico de nuestra comunidad,'' dice
Olvera Gomez. ``Mientras mas impulsemos la produccion de nopal, mas
probabilidades tendremos de que la ciudad no se apodere de Milpa
Alta.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MILPA ALTA, Mexico _ Marcos rosas abad tiene una pregunta
simple: por que, en la era del TLC, los pequenos agricultores como
el deben limitarse al modesto mercado mexicano? A fin de cuentas,
la prosperidad depende de las exportaciones.
 &HT;    Rosas Abad cree que a lo mejor tiene la cosecha indicada: el
nopal, un cactus comestible cuyo cultivo se remonta a la epoca
precolombina, y a Milpa Alta, un singular distrito de aldeas que
forma parte de la Ciudad de Mexico.
 &HT;    Las carnosas hojas del cactus solo se usaban antes para
alimentar ganado. Pero hoy son populares en todo Mexico. Varios
posibles exportadores afirman que el nopal se populariza entre los
aficionados a la comida mexicana en Estados Unidos y a la comida
sana en Norteamerica y Europa.
 &HT;    ``Necesitamos mercados nuevos,'' dice Rosas Abad. ``Necesitamos
mejorar nuestra produccion y exportar el nopal, porque a la gente
le gustaria si lo probaran.''
 &HT;    La ayuda ya esta en camino. Varios empresarios incipientes
tratan de agregar el nopal a la larga lista de productos tipicos
mexicanos como el tequila, las tortillas y la salsa picante, que
tienen una gran demanda en el extranjero. Su objetivo es
transformar la industria de la hoja del cactus, hasta ahora una
actividad agricola secundaria, en otra historia de exito entre las
exportaciones mexicanas.
 &HT;    ``Definitivamente hay un mercado para el nopal en el extranjero;
lo veo,'' dice Ismael Rivera Cruz, director de Nopal del Carmen,
una pequena compania de Milpa Alta que exporta parte de sus hojas
de cactus enlatadas a Alemania, Holanda, Belgica y Espana.
``Necesitamos trabajar un poco mas duro y tambien necesitamos mas
financiamiento.''
 &HT;    Milpa Alta (una milpa es un maizal) se ha convertido en la
capital mundial del nopal. El ano pasado produjo 280.000 toneladas
metricas por valor de US$63 millones, segun la Secretaria de
Agricultura. El pueblo de 90.000 habitantes (en realidad es un
conjunto de 12 aldeas) esta a una hora de camino del centro de la
capital. Un grupo de colinas que separa a Milpa Alta del resto de
la capital no deja ver la metropoli. Un camino tortuoso que
serpentea entre el terreno ondulado y los campos de nopal une a las
tranquilas aldeas, en cuyas calles de adoquines y sus iglesias de
la era colonial el tiempo parece haberse detenido.
 &HT;    Las hojas de cactus son la principal actividad del pueblo
durante todo el ano y el 60 por ciento de la economia local. Y
ningun lugar de Mexico se beneficiaria tanto de su exportacion como
Milpa Alta.
 &HT;    Hay algunas senales de que el nopal gana reconocimiento mas alla
de las fronteras mexicanas. Ya se cultivan nopales en Japon e
Italia. Companias de alimentos sanos en EU y Canada venden capsulas
con nopal para combatir la obesidad y hasta para controlar el
colesterol y la diabetes. Las hojas de cactus tambien se hacen
celebres gracias a la gran popularidad de la comida mexicana en
todo el mundo.
 &HT;    ``En mi menu siempre he ofrecido nopales, desde que abrimos hace
14 anos, y han sido muy bien recibidos,'' dice David Suro, un
empresario nacido en Guadalajara que tiene un restaurante en
Filadelfia llamado Tequilas. Es mas, uno de los platos favoritos
del establecimiento es el Filete Grito, un filete de carne servido
en una hoja de nopal con chiles serranos. ``Hay gente que no prueba
muchas cosas,'' dice Suro. ``Pero cuando prueban el nopal, diria
que al 90 por ciento les gusta.''
 &HT;    Sin embargo, impulsar el consumo del nopal fuera de Mexico es
dificil. Los cactus son pintorescos a la orilla del camino, pero no
tienen el atractivo del tequila reposado o de la cerveza Corona.
Las hojas se cocinan, se cortan y se anaden a platos clasicos como
los tacos de nopales o los nopales con jitomate (hojas de cactus
con tomates rojos).
 &HT;    Lo mismo sucede con el jugo de nopal, que se sirve en
restaurantes de moda y en hoteles mexicanos. Algunos lo elogian,
diciendo que es saludable, que cae bien y que no es demasiado
dulce. Para otros, es saliva verde.
 &HT;    Pero en Milpa Alta, las bondades y la promesa comercial del
nopal son articulo de fe. El cactus, que se cultivaba antes de la
llegada de los espanoles, es un alimento basico cuyo unico rival es
el maiz. ``Donde hay nopales, hay gente,'' dice Esteban Olvera
Gomez, medico y nativo de Milpa Alta que cultiva un campo de
nopales en su tiempo libre.
 &HT;    Olvera Gomez, que ahora es funcionario del pueblo, recuerda
cuando el nopal comenzo la conquista comercial de Mexico. En Milpa
Alta y en otras zonas del centro del pais se comia hojas de cactus
desde hacia siglos, pero en otras partes se empezaron a consumir en
los anos 70. Ahora la planta es comun en los supermercados de todo
el pais. A Milpa Alta han ido agricultores de Morelos, Hidalgo,
Aguascalientes y San Luis Potosi en busca de semillas para iniciar
sus cultivos. Milpa Alta aun esta a la cabeza en la produccion de
nopal, pero tiene mucha competencia.
 &HT;    ``Cuando estudiaba en la escuela de medicina, tenia amigos del
norte de la Ciudad de Mexico que pensaban que las hojas de nopal
solo servian para el ganado,'' dice Olvera Gomez. ``Pero cuando las
probaron, les gustaron.''
 &HT;    Los agricultores de Milpa Alta pasaron a la produccion en masa
del nopal en los anos 60 cuando la tradicional agricultura de
subsistencia cedio su lugar a los cultivos lucrativos.
 &HT;    Pero el cultivo del cactus solo permite vivir modestamente a
campesinos como Rosas Abad, que tiene 67 anos. Lograr que el
negocio sea mas rentable por medio de la exportacion es vital para
rechazar la mayor amenaza que afronta Milpa Alta. La Ciudad de
Mexico esta a pocos kilometros, al otro lado de las colinas, y la
expansion urbana podria destruir en un futuro el ambiente rural y
la tranquilidad del poblado.
 &HT;    ``El nopal es el sosten economico de nuestra comunidad,'' dice
Olvera Gomez. ``Mientras mas impulsemos la produccion de nopal, mas
probabilidades tendremos de que la ciudad no se apodere de Milpa
Alta.''

 &HT;    Some evacuees say they'll ride out next storm
 &HT;    By Staff Reports

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Suzanne and Bill Mahrenholz, who returned to St.
Simons Island as soon as Glynn County officials sounded the
all-clear, survived Hurricane Floyd but were nearly done in by the
massive evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   The couple were among the multitude that fled coastal areas of
Florida, Georgia and South Carolina as the monster hurricane
menaced the lower Southeast coast. And they were among the first to
return late Wednesday, shortly after officials reopened the
causeway to St. Simons, the only way to drive to the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove 500 miles and never found a place to stay,'' said
Mahrenholz, a 69-year-old retiree. ``I don't think we'll do this
evacuation thing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those making it back home from their western flight had
to use secondary roads because eastbound Interstate 16 remained
closed between Savannah and the Swainsboro exit by order of the
Georgia Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although Florida residents had been cleared to return home,
coastal Georgia counties were lifting the evacuation order one by
one. ``Although evacuation orders are issued by local officials,
the state will not approve any re-entry until the eye of Hurricane
Floyd passes the coastal counties of Georgia and South Carolina,''
said GEMA spokeswoman Pam Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the scenes and situations from across the
coastal South as Hurricane Floyd moved north:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach resident Jack Nee, 70, rode six hours Tuesday in
his Geo Metro to Ocala with his two toy poodles, Vinnie and
Squeaky. But when they arrived, hotel operators said the nearest
rooms available were in Alabama. ``I said to hell with that, I'm
coming back,'' said Nee, who got the last room available Tuesday
night at the Ramada Inn in Daytona Beach across from the speedway.
Nee lives five blocks west of the beach and doubts he'll evacuate
next time. ``I spent last night on route 40 and I'm not going to do
that again,'' Nee said. ``What a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   A skeleton staff was at work Wednesday at the Orange County
Convention Center, where exhibitors for the American Academy of
Family Physicians were allowed to set up. The annual meeting,
seminars and exhibition were delayed because of Hurricane Floyd.
``We still have no idea how many folks will or will not be able to
get here simply because of the storm,'' said Kathy Canning, the
center's marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd took a historic souvenir Wednesday before
leaving Daytona Beach and the Sunshine State. The storm's 15-foot
waves swallowed a 300-foot span of the landmark Main Street Pier,
built in the 1920s. Local television stations kept cameras trained
on the popular tourist destination throughout the day, making it
the image of the day for Florida's brush with Floyd. Just before
high tide at 12:32 p.m., a wave rolled underneath the Daytona Beach
pier and wiped out wooden pilings, crumpling the structure like it
stood on dominoes. Before bridges linking the mainland opened to
the public early Wednesday afternoon, locals gathered on the
boardwalk to watch the spectacle of the sea's violence. ``When
people come to Daytona Beach, this is where they come,'' said
resident Charles Beers, a timeshare marketer. GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   The governor's Office of Consumer Affairs in Atlanta reported
fielding about 50 complaints about price gouging, mostly for
high-priced gasoline and hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   That volume of calls is expected to grow substantially over the
next few days when people return to their homes and get the bills
for tree removal and home cleanup, said spokesman Bill Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite so far is a hotel in south Georgia that advertised
rooms for $12.95 on its billboard and is charging $130 a night,''
Cloud said. He said the report was unconfirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1995 law, it is a misdemeanor to take advantage of a
state of emergency by raising the price of items beyond prevailing
prices or beyond their cost plus a regular mark-up.
</P>
<P>
   Some coastal communities that were forced by Hurricane Floyd to
suspend candidate qualifying for municipal elections may extend the
qualifying deadline beyond 4:30 p.m. Friday, a spokesman for
Secretary of State Cathy Cox said Wednesday. Although the law
doesn't appear to require them to extend qualifying in these
circumstances, Savannah, Hinesville and Tybee Island are among the
municipalities that have asked Cox how they should go about doing
so. Cox said they must obtain both a court order from a Superior
Court judge and approval from the U.S. Justice Department. The
statewide qualifying period for municipal elections began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 p.m. _ hours before the hurricane's eye was expected to
pass 90 miles east of Savannah _ power was knocked out to about
50,000 homes throughout the county, said Billy Hair, chairman of
the Chatham County Commission. Sustained winds of 41 mph with 60
mph gusts were reported at the Savannah airport. By late afternoon,
tree limbs and dead palm branches were scattered on streets but
traffic lights still worked.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Rosenzweig considered Wednesday a nice day to go for a
swim at Tybee Island. ``I just wanted to see the beauty and power
and fury of Mother Nature,'' said Rosenzweig, a self-employed
tombstone cleaner in Savannah. ``I was swimming out here with
(Hurricane) Dennis a few weeks ago.'' Walter Strong ventured from
his Savannah home to Tybee Island with a friend, Dudley Stone, a
Savannah resident physician. ``It's fairly impressive,'' said
Strong, 26, wiping the driving rain from his eyes and his drenched
camera. ``I'm just a hurricane buff, I guess.'' The pair took
photos from the end of Tybee's pier, which was shaken by 8-foot
waves.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Terry Hurley, who showed up Wednesday at a Wilmington shelter
with his wife and two young children, said his family stayed home
for Hurricanes Fran and Bertha in 1996, but not Floyd. ``They talk
like this one is going to be pretty mean. It's got everybody shook
up,'' he said. About 110 people were in the middle school shelter
an hour after it opened. At Wrightsville Beach, Pam Carroll and her
husband, Bernard, nailed plywood to the door of their King Neptune
Restaurant before leaving Wednesday afternoon. ``This is very
nerve-wracking. We're all stressed,'' she said, holding her
2-year-old son, Patterson, in her arms. Said her husband, ``My
son's not quite 3 years old and this is his third storm.''
</P>
<P>
   While the southern North Carolina coast braced for Floyd, the
Outer Banks took the storm in stride _ evacuating tourists but not
expecting much heavy weather. Emergency management spokeswoman
Martha Wickre said a mandatory evacuation, and Floyd's fierce
reputation, cleared most of the thousands of visitors out of Dare
County. Wickre said county officials expected high winds but
thought the storm, on an inland track, would clear out of the state
by this evening and largely miss this area. Just two weeks ago,
Hurricane Dennis dawdled off the Outer Banks for days, stirring up
a damaging surf before it backtracked and came ashore to the south
at Cedar Island in Carteret County. Cars streamed along U.S. 64 and
158, the two approaches to the county and its barrier islands,
during the day. By midafternoon, just a few vehicles moved along
the normally busy main road through Nags Head, Kill Devil Hills and
Kitty Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   With gale force-winds already upon them, Charleston officials
hoped that a northern shift in Hurricane Floyd would save them from
the devastation they remember from Hurricane Hugo. Still, 70 mph
winds whipped the city Wednesday evening and some feared they could
reach 115 mph. By 7 p.m. several roofs had blown off of homes on
the barrier islands and there was moderate flooding in some areas.
Before nightfall almost 200,000 people had lost power. Shelters
were filled with thousands of people. Christena Watkins, 59, moved
from Jones Island to the Econo Lodge with her sister and grandson.
She sat in her room watching a religious television show as the
storm raked the area. ``I just hope that everybody makes it
through, that nobody dies.'' But some people braved the slashing
rain. A soaking Curtis Chisolm, 26, didn't bother with an umbrella
as he walked down Rivers Avenue. ``This is the wrath of God. Who
ain't afraid of the wrath of God?'' he said.

   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Having already produced the greatest
evacuation in U.S. history, Hurricane Floyd skirted Florida and
Georgia on Wednesday and aimed itself directly at the low-lying
coastal border between the Carolinas, where its eye was expected to
come ashore early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although no widespread damage from hurricane force winds or
waves was yet reported on the East Coast, gusts exceeding 60 mph
began knocking down power lines and blowing billboards across
roadways on Wednesday evening along the South Carolina coast. And
with sustained winds of more than 40 mph, falling trees began
smashing windows and roofs at several houses northeast of
Charleston, according to the police. At least 86,000 homes were
without power in the Charleston region, and repair crews had no
plans to begin work until the storm passed.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, those homes were empty, as were all
others in dozens of counties from Jacksonville, Fla., to
Wilmington, N.C. Evacuation orders were in effect on Wednesday for
2.6 million people, and with the majority of those residents
obeying the orders, federal emergency officials said the evacuation
had now become the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 percent of Charleston's 87,000 residents had moved
inland, and Charleston County officials were amazed to report an 80
percent evacuation rate for the 230,000 people in the rest of the
county. The rate was far higher than for any previous hurricane,
and was attributed to the storm's enormous size and power, which by
evening appeared likely to spare the city. More than 90 percent of
neighboring Beaufort County was empty, according to county
officials, and 6,300 people were reported to be in shelters in a
three-county area.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm's eye moving to the north and east, residents of
North Carolina began adding to the exodus on Wednesday, filling up
hotels as far away as Alabama and Tennessee. The state government
ordered evacuations from the barrier islands around Wilmington, and
traffic began to clog the area just as heavy rains began falling at
midday. President Clinton declared coastal areas in the Carolinas
to be disaster areas, adding them to list of counties in Florida
and Georgia that were earlier made eligible for federal funds and
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Florida and Georgia at this point feel like
they've dodged a real bullet,'' said Richard Moore, the public
safety secretary for North Carolina. ``This thing is not going to
miss us.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm disrupted travel along the East Coast, as the Federal
Aviation Administration shut down control tower operations on
Wednesday at airports in Wilmington, N.C., Charleston, S.C., Myrtle
Beach, S.C, West Palm Beach, Fla., Daytona Beach, Fla. and
Jacksonville, Fla. Some airlines canceled flights as far away from
the storm as Richmond and Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, more than 80 Navy ships with an estimated 30,000
sailors, including three aircraft carriers, took to sea on
Wednesday from the Norfolk Naval Base to escape the storm. The
exodus took all day. Also 180 Navy and Air Force planes flew to
inland bases from the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach
and Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Va., to inland bases.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation numbers were particularly high given the extreme
difficulty many residents had in leaving their homes on Tuesday,
because of massive congestion. South Carolina waited until
nightfall to make all lanes of the main interstate highway
westbound away from Charleston. Joseph P. Riley Jr., the mayor of
Charleston, charged the state with ``staggering incompetence,'' and
expressed concern that many of those who tried to leave wound up
returning, putting themselves in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Although Florida was spared the heaviest winds of the hurricane,
which weakened on Wednesday to 115 mph as the storm moved north,
areas around Daytona and Titusville reported numerous damaged roofs
and power lines. About 290,000 customers remained without
electrical power as many of the 1.3 million residents who followed
evacuation orders began returning to their homes. A popular pier in
Daytona collapsed when it was inundated by waves, but the state
insurance commissioner's office said there was no major damage
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A 150-foot tugboat with eight crew members sank early Wednesday
345 miles off of Jacksonville. The Coast Guard said that
helicopters from the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy rescued all
eight crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The track of the storm left open the possibility that Floyd's
heavy winds and rain could continue north past the Carolinas into
Washington, D.C., New York City and even New England by the
weekend, even if it is not a hurricane at that point. Hurricane
force winds could reach the Chesapeake Bay by Thursday morning, and
federal emergency officials predicted significant tree damage in
Washington because of recent heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency told governors on
Wednesday afternoon that flooding as far north as New England
remains a high possibility through the rest of the week. Because so
much of the mid-Atlantic region is already saturated from Hurricane
Dennis, state agencies remain on high alert for inland river
flooding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already, an enormous swath of the country's East Coast was
virtually barren of visible human life. Charleston's historic
downtown was boarded up and deserted, the only movement the ominous
sway of trees and light poles. By 2 p.m., county police officers
had parked their cruisers and gone to shelters, and ambulances
stopped responding to any calls other than cardiac emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   In Horry County, the resort of Myrtle Beach had become an empty
stage set of abandoned hotels, seafood restaurants, waterslides and
miniature golf courses on Wednesday afternoon as the storm began to
produce significant swells in the Atlantic. Roads were empty and
gas stations, grocery stores and diners were boarded up and locked.
One facade of an old downtown building tumbled to the ground, and
police officers struggled to secure the exterior with plywood.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The usually animated beach town, a popular golf and retirement
destination, was projected to be very near the direct path of the
hurricane during the night, and though the storm's winds had
weakened to 115 mph from 140 mph the day before, officials were
still very worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in the path of some of the strongest winds and
largest storm surges,'' said Cheryl J. Henry, a county spokeswoman.
A curfew went into effect at 3 p.m., and similar restrictions were
imposed on Charleston after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Further north, in Wilmington, which has been affected by 16
hurricanes in the last decade, officials began preparing for the
serious flooding that occurred in storms such as Bertha, Bonnie and
Fran. Life jackets were placed on all fire trucks to assist in
water rescues. Having just gone through a weeklong pounding from
Hurricane Dennis, North Carolina officials predicted ruinous beach
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to damage this beach like we have not seen since
Hazel,'' said Michael Stokes, a spokesman for Wrightsville Beach,
referring to the 1954 storm.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that it has been only a decade since Hurricane Hugo
came ashore in downtown Charleston, killing 13 people, producing a
17-foot surge, and costing South Carolina more than $6 billion,
city officials said they were amazed the state did not have a more
effective evacuation plan for the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Riley and other regional mayors were furious that the Department
of Transportation did not immediately allow fleeing residents to
use all lanes of I-26, as Georgia officials did with I-16 out of
Savannah. Some Charleston residents were on the road for 10 or 12
hours just to reach other parts of the small state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't rocket science,'' Riley said in an interview. ``What
the state Department of Transportation should have had in place and
could easily do is a system where you close lanes of traffic on one
part of the major highways and let people go out, because when you
have a major evacuation from a hurricane and you're requiring
people to leave, then that of a necessity means that people are not
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges, who was blamed by most angry radio-show callers
for the snail's pace of the evacuation, said his transportation
advisers questioned the safety of reversing lanes on the
interstate, but said he finally overruled them at about 8 p.m.
Tuesday. Nonetheless, the issue was likely to remain a political
blow for him _ one handmade sign on a I-26 overpass read, ``Flog
Hodges.''

 &HT;    Chandler between `doubtful and out'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The sight of Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler
jogging Wednesday while teammates practiced 100 yards away was not
enough to buoy the spirits of coach Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches were walking as fast as Chandler was jogging three days
after aggravating a previously strained right hamstring in a 17-14
loss to the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   He may be a spectator Monday at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he would be ready to go,'' said Reeves, who gave
most of the work with the No. 1 offense to backup quarterback Tony
Graziani. ``I would say he's extremely doubtful. He's between
doubtful and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler sounded only a little more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Other aches and pains
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Tim Dwight (strained right hamstring) also missed
Wednesday's light practice, and like Chandler is listed as doubtful
on the injury report. ... Reserve cornerback Michael Booker
returned for the first time since aggravating a strained thigh
muscle Aug. 27. He ended up doing little. ``I'm not where I want to
be,'' he said. ... Defensive tackle Ben Huff, who had been out
since Aug. 27 with a sprained foot, also returned. ... The Cowboys'
injury report: Tight end Mike Lucky (foot) and cornerback Kevin
Smith (back), out; cornerback Deion Sanders (toe), doubtful; tight
end David LaFleur (ankle), wide receiver Jeff Ogden (thigh), and
strong safety Darren Woodson (biceps), probable. Sanders, the
former Falcon sidelined all but a couple of days after surgery to
correct ligament damage in a big toe, may practice today.
</P>
<P>
   Big numbers
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Travis Hall's four-year extension gives him a
seven-year deal worth $52.5 million, more than any contract in team
history.
</P>
<P>
   But as with all big NFL contracts, the numbers need
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Including Hall's $5.1 million signing bonus, it's likely to end
up a four-year, $16.5 million, or three-year, $10.5 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson's five-year, $32 million deal, which had a $7.5
million bonus, can be broken down into a four-year, $21.3 million
deal, or a three-year, $15.3 million deal
</P>
<P>
   All big NFL contracts have breakoff points, where they're likely
to be terminated or re-worked because the annual salary-cap charges
get so high.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's cap charges in 2002, '03, '04, and '05 are scheduled at
$6.7 million, $10.7 million, $12.7 million and $14.7 million.

<P>
   Planning ahead
</P>
<P>
   Among the seven Falcons starters who can become unrestricted
free agents after this season, talks are most active with left
defensive end Lester Archambeau and center Robbie Tobeck, and also
reserve linebacker Craig Sauer.
</P>
<P>
   There is little going on regarding extensions for tight end O.J.
Santiago or strong-side linebacker Henri Crockett, who can become
restricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons signed defensive end Emil Ekiyor to the practice
squad. He replaces wide receiver Jammi German, who was activated
Tuesday, when defensive tackle Shawn Swayda was waived. ... There
were huge speakers on either side of the practice field Wednesday,
as the team prepared for anticipated crowd noise. ... While Atlanta
will have just five days after the Monday night game to prepare for
its next game, the Falcons' Sept. 26 opponent will have two weeks.
The Rams (1-0) are off this week. ... An example of how numbers can
obfuscate: The Falcons are 0-4 in games Calvin Collins doesn't
start at left guard or center, and 23-9 in games he does.

   BRITAIN: 2 TORIES EYE MAYOR'S JOB
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Conservatives moved closer to choosing a
candidate in next May's election for a mayor of London. Lord
Jeffrey Archer, a millionaire writer and party stalwart, and Steven
Norris, a former transport minister, emerged as front-runners in a
vote among party members. The final choice will be made in a
broader, postal ballot. The Labor Party has not yet named a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: TEENS FIGHT JAIL TERMS
</P>
<P>
   Two teen-agers complained to the European Court of Human Rights
that their rights had been violated in a 1993 trial when, as
10-year-olds, they were jailed for beating a 2-year-old child to
death. Lawyers for Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, both
imprisoned in England, said the trial had been unfair. Lawyers also
said the prison terms, extended to 15 years from eight by a
government minister, had been arbitrarily set.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: FRANCO CONDEMNED
</P>
<P>
   A parliamentary commission for the first time officially
condemned Francisco Franco's rebellion in 1936 for starting the
civil war that ushered in his 36-year dictatorship. But the ruling
Popular Party, which has long downplayed the fact that some of its
members worked for the former regime, abstained from the vote.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  GERMANY: EUROPEAN PANEL APPROVED
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament of the European Union approved the union's new
executive body, led by Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy. The
approval of the 20-member executive, known as the European
Commission, ends six months of uncertainty since the Parliament
forced the previous commission to resign after allegations of fraud
and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   NETHERLANDS: U.N. PROSECUTOR TAKES OVER
</P>
<P>
   Carla del Ponte took office as the new chief prosecutor for the
U.N. war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia,
replacing Louise Arbour, who was appointed to Canada's Supreme
Court. Mrs. del Ponte, 52, has been attorney general and chief
federal prosecutor of Switzerland since 1994, a post in which she
often challenged Swiss banking secrecy. In her new post she will
head an international staff of some 400 lawyers and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE: MILITANTS SENTENCED
</P>
<P>
   An antiterrorism court sentenced 21 Muslim militants to prison
sentences of from six months to 10 years. They had all been charged
with organizing or playing a role in a terrorist network that
planted bombs in several French cities in 1995. Ten people were
killed and more than 170 wounded in the attacks, some of which were
claimed by Algerian insurgents known as the Armed Islamic Group.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY: OCALAN TWIST
</P>
<P>
   A new file has surfaced in the case of the Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, giving judges the opportunity to reopen the case
if they wish. All prosecutors were to have submitted their cases
before his trial, but a prosecutor in the eastern town of Sanliurfa
has reportedly found one he did not submit. Ocalan was sentenced to
death in June, but his case may now be judged still open.

   The government has dropped charges against 37 sympathizers of
the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas who were indicted during army and
police operations last year to seize towns that the rebels
controlled. In what officials hoped would be seen as a conciliatory

warrants were canceled.

<P>
   Exit polls show that the Bharatiya Janata Party is in line to
win 145 of the 268 parliamentary seats that were at stake during
the first two of five phases in the current elections, according to
state television. The same polls show that the Congress Party is
likely to win 105. The third phase will take place on Saturday.

   INDIA: GANDHI ON SPOT AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has demanded that Sonia
Gandhi, the Italian-born leader of the Congress Party, explain why
she waited 15 years before becoming an Indian citizen. ``The
question is crying for proper answer,'' he said, further pushing
the ``foreigner issue'' in India's election campaign.

HOMEWORK MUST-HAVES 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights. 
 By ALYSON WARD 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's officially homework season again. No more summer slacking,
no more first-of-school light workloads.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to get down to business, whip out the sharpened No. 2
pencils _ or turn on the computer _ and do some real work.
</P>
<P>
   Here, some of the best ideas, products and resources for getting
out from under that pile of work:
</P>
<P>
   1. Start with basic organizers. Organize your study area with
two stationery musts: a calendar and an assignment book. Keep a
calendar by the homework area to keep track of projects and
long-term assignments. (That science fair can sneak up on you if
you don't see it approaching, circled in red.) Consider mounting a
reusable two-month or three-month wipe-off calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Students will also need a totable form of date-tracking: an
assignment book. They're crucial. Assignment notebooks come in all
forms, from the cheap and simple spiral notebook styles to the
personal organizers with leather covers and refillable pages.
</P>
<P>
   The key is to get into the habit of writing homework assignments
down. Remembering the homework assignment is half the battle. Well,
almost.
</P>
<P>
   2. Get a CD-ROM Encyclopedia. Time was, ``encyclopedia'' meant a
collection of heavy books that cost hundreds if not thousands of
dollars and were outdated within a couple of years. No more. These
days, encyclopedias come on CD-ROM and go for less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   The just-released Microsoft Encarta Reference Suite 2000
contains four major CD-ROM reference guides: the encyclopedia, the
Encarta Interactive World Atlas, the Encarta World English
Dictionary and Encarta Online Deluxe, an online version of the
encyclopedia. The set of four costs about $65 after a company
rebate _ the deluxe encyclopedia by itself is about $40 after the
rebate.
</P>
<P>
   One caveat: The ``Microsoft'' Encarta products run only on
Windows. A Mac version of the encyclopedia has been produced in
years past, but it's not known if one will be made for the 2000
edition.
</P>
<P>
   3. Turn to online homework helpers. There's more to the Internet
than junk e-mail and advertising _ it's probably the fastest,
easiest way to get information children might need to complete
homework assignments. Try these two exceptional Web sites that
specialize in getting students the homework help they need:
</P>
<P>
   The www.homeworkcentral.com site lets students pinpoint the
information they need by helping them narrow down their topics. The
site is divided into age groups, and the search engine is designed
to serve academic purposes. For instance, if you type in ``George
Washington,'' you'll get information about the first president _
NOT a list of every site with the word ``George'' or ``Washington''
in it.
</P>
<P>
   The www.schoolwork.org site offers numerous topic categories,
then provides a fairly comprehensive list of Web sites that contain
specialized information about each topic.
</P>
<P>
   4. Keep those papers in place. There's always that book that
won't stay open or that piece of paper that keeps disappearing.
Eliminate frustration with some products that keep flyaways in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Try an adjustable bookstand that props up your textbook _ and
keeps it open to the right page; The Container Store chain has a
version for $35.
</P>
<P>
   Or use a book weight that'll weigh down the page you need.
Levenger's Web site (www.levenger.com) offers really nice leather
book weights for $17.99 _ or find a cheaper one at bookstores or
office supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   5. Parents: provide practical inspiration. Sometimes the work
gets done faster when the right tools are also fun to look at.
Hence the Pokemon Study Kit, based on the Japanese animation game
that has taken over the lives of everybody younger than 12.
</P>
<P>
   These little desk-supply packs (ruler, eraser, pencil sharpener,
pencil pouch) cost less than $5 at toy stores that carry Pokemon
products.
</P>
<P>
   Or spring for the Deluxe Desktop Set, which includes a
Jigglypuff tape dispenser, a Bulbasaur pencil sharpener, a
Poliwhirl tape measure and a Pikachu stapler; it goes for about
$10. Not a bad investment if it helps get the homework done.
</P>

<P>
   Meet: Emily Hart, little sister of Melissa Joan Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: Stars in ``Sabrina, the Animated Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Age/grade: 13; eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbies: Basketball, spending time with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Career plans: Marine biology.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite subjects: math, French, science.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' TV show. Another Hart as
the star.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Hart is the voice of half-mortal, half-witch Sabrina in a
new animated spinoff of the prime-time show that stars her older
sister, Melissa Joan Hart.
</P>
<P>
   The new show, which will run Sunday through Friday afternoons on
UPN and on Saturday mornings on ABC, is a prequel to the sitcom,
and centers on the mishaps of Sabrina Spellman at age 12 _ before
she has full access to her powers and spells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sabrina's got the same attitude, but she's kind of just
finding out who she is,'' Emily said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa, 23, is in the animated show, too. She lends her voice
to two characters, aunts Hilda Spellman and Zelda Spellman. In this
prequel, they are both centuries-old witches who have taken on
mortal form as teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Emily, who got her acting start at 9 months in a commercial, has
recorded 65 episodes. Emily does her part while alone in a studio,
so technically, she's not working with her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in after school and I acted out two scripts per
session. When I go into the studio, it takes about an hour and a
half so it doesn't really interfere with school,'' Emily said,
adding that she doesn't see the animated action while she records.
``I kind of imagine it in my head because they match the animation
to my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily is serious about a career in marine biology and is
decorating her room with posters of whales, dolphins and seals.
It's a big deal, Emily says, because she just got her own room
thanks to two sisters who went off to college, and Melissa, who
recently moved into her own house.
</P>
<P>
   Emily is the fifth child in a family of eight kids. The
children, seven sisters and one brother, have all done some acting,
she added.
</P>

VIDEO REVIEW: ``BELLE'S TALES OF FRIENDSHIP: CHARMING STORYBOOK
ADVENTURES'' 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<P>
   VIDEO: ``Belle's Tales of Friendship: Charming Storybook
Adventures''
</P>
<P>
   Stars: Live-action Belle: Lynsey McLeod. Voices of Paige O'Hara,
as Belle (animated); Jerry Orbach, as Lumiere; David Ogden Stiers,
as Cogsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   Plot: This is another story about Belle, the main character in
the movie ``Beauty and the Beast.'' In this video, a human Belle
narrates five stories about friends working together. The stories
are ``acted out'' in animation.
</P>
<P>
   Some characters from the movie are back: the candelabra named
Lumiere and Cogsworth the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The movie started out without animation, which
surprised me. It had some cute stories about friendship and working
together, and the songs that go along with each of the stories are
really sweet. Very cute for younger viewers.

MUSIC REVIEW: CD: JESSE CAMP'S ``JESSE AND THE 8TH STREET KIDZ'' 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<P>
   CD: ``Jesse and the 8th Street Kidz''
</P>
<P>
   Artist: Jesse Camp.
</P>
<P>
   Label: Hollywood Records.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Camp is like millions of other guys singing about girls,
hitchhiking and being a kid _ except that he has a record deal and
name recognition from being a VJ on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   He got the gig in April 1998 by winning the cable channel's
first VJ search contest. There were 4,000 other people who
auditioned.
</P>
<P>
   If Jesse is trying to send any profound messages, it's not
working, since his trademark voice is garbled when he's talking and
it's even harder to understand when he's singing. But the CD has a
good guitar sound, and there are a few catchy tunes, such as
``Crazy for You'' and ``Summertime Squatters.''
</P>
<P>
   I like the CD. Camp's brash personality comes through, and he's
not afraid to say what he thinks, though he doesn't have much to
say. It's just a cut above what you might hear the band next door
playing, but maybe that's part of the charm.

</P>
<P>
   This is a short (48 pages) educational book about Earth's oceans
and the creatures that live in them. It has 12 fun experiments to
do at home.
</P>
<P>
   This book has almost 50 colorfully illustrated pages of ocean
facts and cool experiments like how to make a tsunami, also called

neat experiments, step by step.
</P>
<P>
   I thought this was a really interesting book, and I learned a

DID YOU KNOW ... ALL ABOUT YO-YOS? 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>

 By JESSAMY BROWN 
 c. 1999 Compiled from reports by The Associated Press and Fort
Worth Star-Telegram. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did you know that yo-yos _ invented 2,500 years ago _ are more
than just toys to some kids? They can be serious competition.
</P>
<P>
   Picture 350 people spinning, looping, flipping and twisting
yo-yos for three days. That was the scene at the 1999 Bandai World
Yo-Yo Competition in Honolulu last month.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants came from countries around the world, including
Russia, Korea, Japan, Germany and Taiwan, but only a handful were
named World Champions.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old Takumi Nagasse of Japan won the World Champion
title in the double-handed division. American brothers, Joel and
Matt Zinc, came away victorious in the single-handed and
recreational divisions.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS: The word yo-yo apparently came from Tagalog, the native
language of the Philippines. It means ``come back'' or ``come
come.''
</P>
<P>
   For 400 years, the yo-yo was used as a weapon to fling at
enemies or animals. The early yo-yos had sharp edges and studs, and
were attached to thick, 20-foot ropes. Ancient Greeks made yo-yos
of wood, metal or clay.
</P>
<P>
   The yo-yo became popular as a toy in Europe in the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Today's versions are made of plastic and even Space-Age metals
developed by scientists at NASA.
</P>

JUDGE POSTPONES BRANCH DAVIDIANS' WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GABRIELLE CRIST 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr. postponed the Branch
Davidians' wrongful death lawsuit Wednesday because it's taking
longer than expected to move the physical evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Smith did not order a new trial date, but said he will not agree
to a previous proposal by the government to delay it until next
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Because the trial was already scheduled close to the holiday
season, it probably will be delayed until the first of the year,
one attorney involved in the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is presiding over a multimillion-dollar wrongful death
suit against the government for the 1993 Branch Davidian siege just
outside Waco, Texas. At the end of a 51-day standoff with the FBI,
Mount Carmel burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Religious leader David Koresh and about 80 of his followers were
found dead inside.
</P>
<P>
   Branch Davidian survivors, as well as relatives of Branch
Davidians who died in the fire, allege in their suit that the
government used excessive force during the ATF raid on the compound
Feb. 28, 1993. In addition, they say the government was negligent
for the April 19, 1993, fire at Mount Carmel and for not
extinguishing it.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Lon Horiuchi also is named as a defendant, accused of
firing shots at the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Horiuchi is the only individual defendant named in the lawsuit,
mainly because he is the only one plaintiffs specifically accuse of
excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   Horiuchi and the United States now are the only defendants.
Jurors will decide if Horiuchi fired at the Branch Davidians and
Smith will hear the excessive force and negligence issues.
</P>
<P>
   Horiuchi, an FBI sharpshooter, fired the shot that killed Vicki
Weaver in August 1992, during the government siege in Ruby Ridge,
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has appointed former Sen. John
Danforth to head an independent investigation into the events
surrounding the standoff, after recent revelations that the FBI
fired pyrotechnic tear gas grenades during the standoff. Reno and
FBI officials now admit the pyrotechnic canisters were used, an
about-face from six years of adamant denials.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Smith ordered that all evidence in the case be turned
over to the U.S. District Clerk's office, at the request of
officials at the Texas Department of Public Safety, who are storing
the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   DPS officials have said they are frustrated because requests to
review the evidence were being bounced back and forth between the
DPS, which had possession but no control over the evidence, and the
Justice Department, which had control, but not possession of the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   DPS spokeswoman Tela Mange said DPS officials have been waiting
to find out if Smith wants the evidence taken to the U.S. District
Clerk's office in San Antonio, Texas, or the clerk's office in
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Once Smith decides, Mange said, it will take several weeks to
inventory the evidence. DPS officials couldn't inventory the
evidence while they waited for a decision, she said, because the
items will be moved as they are itemized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a while,'' Mange said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Michael Caddell, who represents most of the
plaintiffs in the wrongful death lawsuit, said the delay will give
attorneys on both sides time to prepare their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he's done is very reasonable,'' Caddell said. The
trial can't just be delayed a few weeks, he said, because then it
would start in the middle of the holidays. With the trial expected
to last about a month, it's more likely for it to start at the
first of the year, he said.

MEXICO'S FORMER DRUG CHIEF, INDICTED IN U.S., FOUND DEAD
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS lede to rephrase `apparently a suicide'; ADDS graf
before optional material with quote from his lawyer; adds
background in optional material on the Salinases and attempts by
Mexico to extradite Ruiz Massieu.)

 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mario Ruiz Massieu, a volatile lawyer who was the most prominent
former Mexican official ever indicted on drug charges in the United
States, died Wednesday in New Jersey, apparently a suicide, his
lawyers and government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu, 48, who once headed anti-drug efforts under former
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, had been scheduled to
travel to Houston on Thursday for his first appearance in federal
court on drug and money laundering charges that were filed against
him there late last month.
</P>
<P>
   One of his Mexican lawyers, Xavier Olea Pelaez, said that after
living under house arrest with his family in New Jersey for the
last four years, Ruiz Massieu feared that he would be unable to
make bail and would be sent immediately to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have the money and he believed that he was not going
to be able to post bond,'' Olea Pelaez said. ``He got desperate,
and he took that very difficult decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution of Ruiz Massieu had been a landmark in efforts
by the United States and Mexico to challenge the official
corruption that has helped the drug trade grow into what Mexican
officials call the most serious threat to their national security.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said his death shut the door on a case
that took years to build, and one in which they had hoped he might
yet agree to reveal the complicity of even more senior Mexican
officials with the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Ruiz Massieu was found unconscious at his home in
Palisades Park, N.J., by his wife, Maria, who called 911 shortly
after 1:40 p.m. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Englewood
Hospital and Medical Center about 40 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu's principal lawyer in the United States, Cathy
Fleming, denied that he had been distraught over the legal case
against him, but noted that he had been treated for clinical
depression ``for a substantial period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   She said he had always insisted on his innocence and had done so
in a series of notes that he left behind for his family and
friends, as well as a public statement that was to be released at a
news conference on Thursday. Another person close to the Ruiz
Massieu family said the statement attacked the Mexican government
for what it characterized as malicious, unfounded attacks against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Two local officials in New Jersey speculated that Ruiz Massieu
had swallowed the contents of several bottles of prescription pills
that were found at his home. But an assistant prosecutor in the
Bergen County prosecutor's office, James Santulli, said the cause
of his death would have to be determined by an autopsy on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming, Ruiz Massieu's lawyer, said he had never given a
thought to changing his story of innocence.``I think he just didn't
want to put his wife and child through it,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The apparent suicide ends one of the more twisted political and
criminal sagas in recent Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu first gained wide notoriety in 1994, after Salinas
chose him to serve as deputy attorney general for the last seven
months of the administration. It was a period of political chaos in
Mexico, and a high point in the flow of South American cocaine
through the country to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Ruiz Massieu cast himself publicly as a crusader
against the drug trade and the corrupt officials who took bribes to
abet it. He also led a tumultuous investigation into the
assassination in that fall of his older brother, Jose Francisco, a
leading figure in the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, U.S. law-enforcement and intelligence
officials were already concluding that Mario Ruiz Massieu was not
the man he claimed to be. Even before he left office in late 1994 _
railing at supposed efforts by other governing-party leaders to
block the investigation into his brother's murder _ American
diplomats asked secretly that he be barred from any senior position
in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1995, Salinas' elder brother, Raul Salinas, was
arrested on charges of ordering the death of Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu. The two men were said to have had some personal
differences stemming from Ruiz Massieu's one-time marriage to the
Salinas brothers' sister, Adriana, and Mexican officials also
claimed that Ruiz Massieu had emerged as a political rival of Raul
Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials quickly concluded that Mario Ruiz Massieu had
been instrumental in limiting the investigation into his brother's
slaying in order to cover up the role of Raul Salinas. Although
Ruiz Massieu's possible motive for doing this was never clear,
Mexican officials speculated that the Salinas family may have been
able to block the inquiry by having knowledge of corrupt activities
by Ruiz Massieu.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas has never been formally accused of any illegal
activity. Raul Salinas was convicted of murder earlier this year,
and is serving a prison sentence of 27-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the arrest of Raul Salinas, Mario Ruiz Massieu
fled Mexico after being questioned by the authorities there. He was
intercepted by federal agents as he waited for a connecting flight
at Newark International Airport and was held initially on charges
of failing to declare all the currency he was bringing through the
country.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs agents, however, had already come upon $9 million
that Ruiz Massieu had deposited in a pair of Houston banks during
the last two years of his service to the Salinas administration.
Most of the deposits were made by one of his close aides, who
routinely walked into the banks with huge amounts of cash stuffed
into suitcases and cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration initially deferred attempts by the
Mexican government to extradite Ruiz Massieu on various charges of
graft, money laundering and torturing criminal suspects in order to
cover up his brother's murder case. The extradition efforts failed
again and again, however, and Ruiz Massieu stuck fast to his claims
that he was innocent and knew nothing of any wrongdoing by either
Carlos Salinas or his brother.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a civil jury in Houston confiscated most of Ruiz
Massieu's money after federal prosecutors presented evidence that
he had taken huge bribes from Mexican drug traffickers in order to
protect their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately afterward, Customs officials set out to build
a criminal case that would land Ruiz Massieu in prison. American
officials said the government of Salinas's successor, President
Ernesto Zedillo, was helpful in that effort, sending several
witnesses to Houston to testify before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Among those was one of Mario Ruiz Massieu's closest former
associates, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, a former federal police chief
who told the grand jury that he had collected nearly $2 million in
drug bribes in 1993 and 1994 and had given the money to Ruiz
Massieu.

 &HT;    Carolinas in bull's eye today
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ And now it's the Carolinas' turn. Again.
</P>
<P>
   After threatening Florida and Georgia with much bluster but
little punch for the better part of two days, Hurricane Floyd
turned its menacing eye and potentially devastating 115-mph winds
toward North and South Carolina. Landfall was expected early today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to get ugly,'' said Huey Marshall, Brunswick
County attorney. ``It is going to hit at night, at near high
tide.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be the second hurricane to hit North Carolina in two
weeks and the fifth in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   With Floyd's center still 150 miles offshore, the storm's
leading edge had already knocked out power, flooded streets with
drenching rain and spun off tornadoes Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, hurricane-strength gusts of 79 mph were buffeting
Charleston, S.C., and 86,000 people in the area had lost electrical
power. One of several tornadoes near Wilmington destroyed one home
and damaged two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of strength and speed and force of the wind, it looks
to be a once-in-a-decade storm, or even longer,'' said Richard
Moore, North Carolina's public safety secretary. ``I know that
Florida and Georgia at this point feel like they've dodged a real
bullet. ...This thing is not going to miss us.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, one of the most powerful and largest hurricanes in
recorded history, had been headed toward Florida before veering to
the north Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively good fortune of Florida and Georgia caused no
small amount of chagrin for the 2.6 million people who fled their
homes. The fear of Floyd led to the largest peacetime evacuation in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Floyd caused mostly superficial damage along the
coast and knocked down trees in Orlando and other inland areas.
Some parking lots and portions of Florida's famous A1A highway were
awash with ocean water and sand.
</P>
<P>
   The storm gobbled a huge chunk of the famous Main Street Pier at
Daytona Beach and bit off a section of a large pier in
Jacksonville, leaving beams jutting from the surf.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Kennedy Space Center and its four shuttles were largely
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials reported no injuries or fatalities related to
Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed the brunt of this monster storm, and we all feel
pretty blessed in that respect,'' said Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Florida attractions are expected to return to normal today.
Disney World and other theme parks near Orlando will reopen, after
closing Tuesday as the storm threatened to bear down on the state.
Orlando International Airport started operating early Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County Commission Chairman Mel Martinez said the governor
called him Wednesday morning to ask when Disney World and the
airport would reopen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the main economic engine of the state, so it's
important to get those open,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney World suffered little damage except a few downed trees,
spokesman Bill Warren said. ``It's nothing we don't get in a
regular heavy rainstorm.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Bahamas were not so fortunate, with many of
them shoveling sand from homes and removing uprooted trees from
streets Wednesday. There were reports of widespread destruction on
distant islands raked by Floyd on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One man was missing on northern Grand Bahama Island after the
van in which he was riding got stuck in a storm surge and he tried
to swim to high ground.
</P>
<P>
   On the Great Abaco Islands, entire neighborhoods were flooded by
the storm surge. Homes, viewed from the air, looked as though they
had been randomly pushed together. In the island's Marsh Harbour,
some wooden homes were flattened and reduced to debris. Others were
left partially standing or turned on their sides.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was similar in northern Eleuthera, where winds reached
110 mph Tuesday. Homes were left without roofs, boats tossed like
toys onto the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Several people, including one who fell off a roof during the
storm, were treated for minor injuries in Nassau, the Bahamian
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, about 350 miles off the coast, the Coast Guard
rescued three people from 18-foot seas while five others who fled a
sinking tugboat in a life raft were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Now attention turns to the Carolina coast, where officials were
worried that Floyd's landfall would cause tidal surges that would
cover fragile barrier islands. It's a scene with which they're all
too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Hurricane Dennis skirted along the North Carolina
coast and then backtracked as it passed the Outer Banks. On its
return trip, it washed out a half-mile stretch of N.C. 12, Hatteras
Island's main road, and soaked the coast with heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Floyd was taking aim at North Carolina's
southeastern tip, which was battered by Hurricane Bonnie a year ago
and Fran and Bertha in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters are calling for another 10 to 15 inches of rain as
the weakened yet massive storm smacks coastal North Carolina towns,
which ordered evacuations and imposed curfews on residents who
refused to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane is poised to unleash its most punishing
northeastern winds and storm surge on five Brunswick County beach
towns. Sunset Beach, Ocean Isle Beach, Holden Beach, Oak Island and
Caswell Beach jut eastward toward the sea between the South
Carolina line and the Cape Fear River.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared North Carolina, South Carolina and
Virginia federal disaster areas Wednesday in anticipation of storm
damage. He had already declared Florida and Georgia disaster areas
the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Officials opened additional shelters to handle evacuees. In a
minor replay of Tuesday's traffic jams that snarled Interstates 95
and 26 in South Carolina for hours _ and roads throughout Georgia
and Florida _ North Carolina motorists hit delays traveling inland
on rain-puddled highways.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd is spinning out hurricane-force winds 140 miles from the
eye. Its breadth prompted officials across eastern North Carolina
to close schools and set up emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is moving fast, Floyd is so wide forecasters believe
it could pound North Carolina communities for 10 to 12 hours before
moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``A constant beating will play havoc on all of us,'' said Bobby
Greer, vice chairman of the New Hanover Board of Commissioners in
Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   One of the century's most devastating storms, Hurricane Hazel,
made landfall in 1954 in Brunswick County. Floyd is following a
similar course.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the folks who was around during Hazel left the island
today,'' said Bob Grant, assistant manager of Oak Island. ``He was
a barometer for a lot of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant said most of Oak Island's 6,200 residents evacuated
Wednesday, in the hours before Floyd's outer bands hurled waves
across sand dunes and flooded streets. It also knocked the end off
the Long Beach pier.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted a storm surge from 14 to 30 feet along
Brunswick County beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to cover a lot of the island with water,'' Grant
said. ''Those folks who chose not to leave, that is a major
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   On Bald Head Island, at North Carolina's extreme southeastern
tip, three of an estimated 1,000 residents refused to evacuate,
said Kent Brown, the island's emergency management director. ``I
wish that nobody had stayed on the island given the severity of the
storm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By noon Wednesday, ``absolutely monstrous'' waves had breached
ocean-front dunes, a stretch vulnerable in past storms, said Wayne
Kester.
</P>
<P>
   One of three people who stayed on Bald Head Island, 58-year-old
Kester is staying with his dog, Roux, in a house whose first floor
is 13 1/2 feet above sea level. Still, he said he's not worried by
forecasts for a huge wall of water hitting the beach several
hundred yards from his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just another rainy day,'' Kester said. ``I feel as safe
as I would anywhere on the island, except at the top of the Old
Baldy lighthouse.''

FOX'S `ACTION' GETS DOWN AND DIRTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's dispense with weighty discussions about whether TV
reflects values or creates them, and simply note that a prostitute
holds the moral high ground in the new Fox comedy series
``Action.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone to the south of hooker Wendy Ward (Illeana Douglas) is
snared in the bowels of hell, the Mariana Trench of moral
turpitude, the ethical black hole from which the light of grace
cannot escape.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Hollywood entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' debuts Thursday night with two episodes, first the
stunner of a pilot at 9 p.m. and then an episode at 9:30 that
wasn't sent out for preview.
</P>
<P>
   There's little room for ambivalence on this one. ``Action''
carries the dreaded TVMA (mature adult) rating and wears it like a
badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   You will love ``Action'' as a scathingly funny satire of
moviemaking or hate it for its coarse language, sexual content and
insistence on shoving a scoundrel forward as the lead character.
</P>
<P>
   That's Jay Mohr as Peter Dragon, the divorced, dyspeptic,
Xanax-gobbling producer of big-screen action fare such as ``Slow
Torture'' and ``Beverly Hills Gun Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohr was in one of the lesser ``Saturday Night Live'' casts and
played Tom Cruise's obnoxious rival in ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is more perfectly cast on TV this fall; Mohr projects
prickly anger lathered over a spot of vulnerability. He has about
six expressions each for contempt and disgust, and the role of
Peter Dragon requires them all.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Dragon? Not according to his ex-wife (Cindy Ambuehl), who
dumped him and entered into a show marriage with Bobby G. (Lee
Arenberg), the gay billionaire studio chief who distributes
Dragon's films.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby G. has the famous appendage that does all the draggin';
Peter Dragon, pleading with Bobby G. for his ``Show Torture''
sequel, glimpses it Thursday night and confesses afterward, ``I
folded. I completely collapsed under its majesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas' Wendy Ward enters the picture as a sort of accidental
trick on the night of Dragon's ``Slow Torture'' premiere. In the
theater, she gets cozy with guest star Keanu Reeves, who plays
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter, I have some concerns,'' Reeves whispers to Dragon
during the movie. ``I'm a little concerned that your date has her
hand down my pants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan,'' says Wendy, who soon proves to be such an
astute judge of movie scripts that Dragon hires her as a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Watch Thursday night and you'll also see an agent pitching O.J.
Simpson to Dragon for a film role. Hey, even kids in Calcutta know
his face. He'll work for scale, and his recent acting lessons
included a moving scene from ``Raisin in the Sun.'' Still, not
Dragon's idea of a leading man.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about a villain?'' says the agent, not giving up. ``He'll
play a villain. C'mon, who's scarier?''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Hackett is in the cast as Dragon's uncle and chauffeur,
and Jarrad Paul plays a screenwriter named Adam Rafkin. He sold
Dragon the ``Beverly Hills Gun Club'' script for $250,000. Thing
is, Dragon meant to buy a script from someone named Alan Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you telling me we spent a quarter of a million dollars and
we got the wrong Jew?'' an exasperated Dragon asks his production
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Created by veteran writer and producer Chris Thompson (``The
Naked Truth''), ``Action'' is the spotlighted front-runner in a TV
season that veers audaciously from the old ``honey, I'm home''
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Under chief programmer Doug Herzog, the Fox network in
particular seems to have come to a decision that in competing
against cable, the broadcast networks need to pander or perish. Fox
will pander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' smashes the old rules about language; bleeps cover
Mohr's f-words about as effectively as a thong bikini covers its
wearer's behind. It treats sexual material as if there were no
children in the audience, and it dispenses with the cautionary veil
of political correctness. While that isn't all wonderful,
``Action'' comes with blessings, too.
</P>
<P>
   Think of all the TV shows that have been squeaky-clean and
thoroughly insipid. ``Action'' willingly dirties itself, but it
does have a brain. And one thing it doesn't have, refreshingly, is
a laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   It's taken a mere half century, but network TV finally has a
comedy show that's glaringly and exclusively tailored for adults,
in the same acidic way that HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'' was
for grown-ups.

   WASHINGTON _ The White House enlisted the help last year of
federal regulators who were auditing banks to find bank executives
who would join the Clinton administration in opposing Republican
financial legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The episode, which involved 36 federal examiners _ who are
supposed to work independently of partisan considerations _ and an
unknown number of banks, was described Wednesday in a Senate report
and confirmed by Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared by the staff of the Senate Banking
Committee at the direction of its chairman, Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas. Gramm has sponsored legislation, adopted by the Senate in
May, that overhauls the nation's financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which the White House has said President Clinton
would veto if the full Congress approves it, would take regulatory
authority away from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
a unit of the Treasury, and vest it instead with the Federal
Reserve. It would also relax key elements of a 22-year-old law, the
Community Reinvestment Act, which encourages lending to minorities,
farmers, poor neighborhoods and others historically denied access
to credit.
</P>
<P>
   Internal e-mail messages and memorandums by officials included
in the report show that regulators at the Comptroller of the
Currency, which supervises 2,400 nationally chartered banks,
attended a White House political strategy session last Dec. 14
concerning the legislation. Soon after the meeting, White House
aides sent e-mail to top Washington officials in the comptroller's
office to assign specific areas of research. The officials then
instructed bank examiners in field offices to seek testimonials
from bankers about the C RA.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen banks were contacted by the examiners; one
soon complained to the staff of the Senate Banking Committee that
the solicitations for positive comments were inappropriate,
particularly coming in the middle of routine bank examinations. The
bank said the requests put them in a difficult position: whether
the adoption of a public position over the legislation might be a
factor in their regulatory evaluations. The report did not identify
which bank registered the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   After committee aides confronted the comptroller's office about
the episode, regulators in Washington reversed their instructions
to the examiners and rewrote the agency's policies and procedures
manual to require that all agency employees have ``no
communications with national banks that could be perceived as
suggesting that the examination process is in any way influenced by
political issues or considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Garsson Jr., the top spokesman at the comptroller's
office, said the agency had ``made a mistake, but one that was made
for the best of intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not appropriate,'' Garsson said. ``The basic principle
is that the examination process just must be kept free from
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   While the report said that the comptroller's office had, with
the assistance of examiners, compiled a list of 18 ``pro-CRA''
bankers from 11 institutions, Garsson said that the examiners
ultimately did not find any executives to speak on behalf of the
CRA.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dorton, the White House spokesman for the National
Economic Council, said the episode was the result of ``an
interagency policy discussion on the functioning of the CRA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intent or instruction for any inappropriate
contacts to be made,'' he said. ``However, we recognize that
greater care must be taken to prevent even the possibility of such
an impression.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gramm said the incident had demonstrated ``an incredible
misuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows once again that the Clinton administration corrupts
everything,'' Gramm said Wednesday. ``They're like a sewer leak in
the main water line. They pollute and corrupt everything by making
everything political.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode marks the second known instance in recent years in
which banking regulators at the comptroller's office were drawn
into a political controversy. Three years ago, federal banking
regulators acknowledged that they should not have attended a coffee
klatch held at the White House with some of the nation's most
prominent bankers during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Arranged by the Democratic National Committee, that meeting was
attended by Clinton, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury
secretary and the top fund-raiser for the Democratic Party. That
meeting was one of several heavily criticized by Republicans and
campaign finance reform advocates, who said that the Democratic
Party improperly traded access for campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the latest controversy is the CRA, which Gramm
has criticized as unduly burdensome on banks, though some civil
rights groups have said that by forcing institutions to lend to the
under-served, the act has served as a cornerstone of ending
discrimination in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the examiners occurred a few weeks after the White
House made a recess appointment of John D. Hawke Jr. to serve as
comptroller after the Senate had refused to act on his nomination.
Hawke's recess appointment expires later this year, though he has
been nominated to serve through the end of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   His nomination has been delayed in large part because of the
banking committee's investigation into the use of the examiners to
find executives who favor the CRA.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm and Senate aides said that there was little evidence to
indicate Hawke was involved in the political use of the examiners
and that he acted promptly to stop the practice as soon as he
learned of it. Gramm said that Hawke would most likely be approved
for confirmation by the Senate banking committee later this month,
though Senate aides also noted that when he served as Treasury
undersecretary, Hawke had attended the 1996 White House coffee
meeting with the Democratic fund-raisers, bankers and regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The internal communications at the comptroller's office show
that some officials were sensitive to the use of bank examiners to
further a political fight. In one e-mail, for instance, a top
official balked about attending political strategy sessions, and in
another, an agency lawyer wrote to another official that ``we need
to be careful to not be perceived to be in cahoots with WH
political strategizing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the third week in December, after a meeting at the White
House, an official at the White House's National Economic Council
sent e-mail to 22 top officials at the Treasury, the comptroller's
office and the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates
savings and loans. Under the heading ``CRA success stories,'' the
e-mail said the comptroller's office would be taking the lead and
should ``identify list of bankers willing to make statements in
support of CRA.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 13, officials at the comptroller's office instructed
national bank examiners ``for a short list of bankers that would
most likely say positive things'' about the act.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, on Jan. 15, in response to a question about the
request, Chris Lewis, a senior adviser to the comptroller, wrote an
e-mail to Dave Hammaker, a deputy comptroller for compliance
operations, suggesting that the request for the examiners was being
pressed by the Treasury Department
</P>
<P>
   ``I am, personally, not wholly comfortable with the request,''
Lewis wrote. ``But the comptroller would like us to be responsive
to the Department request (within measure).''
</P>
<P>
   Then on Jan. 29, executives from a large bank that the report
did not identify contacted the Senate Banking committee to complain
that while the bank was undergoing an examination, examiners had
sought names of bank officers that the agency could cite publicly
as supporters of the CRA. After being contacted by the staff of the
committee, the agency said the project was ``undoubtedly
inappropriate,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 5, the comptroller issued a memorandum saying that
``contacts we may have with a national bank through the examination
process concerning legislative or political issues might be
misperceived as implying that the bank should take a particular
position on such issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accordingly,'' the memorandum continued, ``it is imperative
that no communications be made with the banks we supervise that
could be perceived as suggesting that the examination process is in
any way colored by political considerations.''

CHECHEN MILITANTS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOSCOW BOMBINGS, RUSSIAN POLICE
SAY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS ``buildings'' to ``building'' in graf that begins: ``Some
of these bags...'') (See RUSSIA-BOMBS-POLITICS) 
(rk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian police said Wednesday that Chechen militants
had shipped tons of explosives into Moscow disguised as bags of
sugar and used them to carry out recent attacks that killed more
than 210 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found out who carried out the explosions,'' Moscow's
deputy police chief, Aleksander Veldyayev, said Wednesday. ``The
terrorist attacks were carried out by Chechen fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Muscovites believed that the bombings, which sent waves of
anxiety through the city, were the work of Islamic militants who
invaded Dagestan from bases in Chechnya, and people from the
Caucasus already have felt the backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the militants _ Shamil Basayev, the Chechen
warlord, and a Jordanian-born fighter known as Khattab _ insist
that they were not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not like to be compared to those who kill sleeping
civilians with bombs and shells,' said Khattab, referring to
Russian airstrikes against Chechnya in the war there.
</P>
<P>
   The charges and denials have prompted an important question: If
the aim of the bombings is to pressure Russia to abandon Dagestan,
why would the Islamic rebels deny any involvement?
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the mystery, a previously unknown group, the Dagestan
Liberation Army, Wednesday called the semiofficial Itar-Tass news
agency and claimed it had organized the attacks. But some experts
said they doubted the group even existed.
</P>
<P>
   Assigning responsibility is important. Public sentiment here for
tough action against Chechnya _ and the Chechens who live in Moscow
_ is running high. Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, has
said he planned to demand that Chechnya turn over the culprits
behind the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen government, however, asserts that Russian
conspirators carried out the attacks, possibly to provide a pretext
for the Yeltsin government to declare a state of emergency and
suspend the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one conclusion,'' said Chechnya's deputy prime
minister, Kazbek Makhashev. ``Russia needs a hot spot to solve its
own domestic political problems and its battle for power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen authorities do not support the militants, who have
become a power to themselves near the Chechnya-Dagestan border. But
they also do not want Russia to continue its bombing raids against
rebel positions inside Chechnya or step up its offensive by,
perhaps, launching a ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said that 27 suspects had been detained as
part of a campaign to find the people responsible for the
explosions, but in their briefings Wednesday, Russian police and
intelligence officials did not name any suspects.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted, however, that they had evidence that confirmed
the involvement of Chechen militants, aided by people of Slavic
appearance, an important asset since dark-skinned Chechens often
are viewed suspiciously in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining their case, Russian officials said that Chechen
fighters had shipped explosives disguised as bags of sugar to
Moscow by truck.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these bags were later found in the basement of a house
in southern Moscow. But it is not clear whether they were being
stored there or were to be used to blow up the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 19 tons of explosives were delivered to Moscow disguised
as sugar,'' Veldyayev said. ``Most of it has been discovered and
seized.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandr Zdanovich, a spokesman for the Federal Security
Service, one of the successors to the Soviet KGB, said, ``It is not
that important whether it was this organization or another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing,'' Zdanovich said, ``is that these
acts of terrorism are connected with the developments in Dagestan
and were planned in Chechnya by associates of Basayev and
Khattab.''

KREMLIN'S KEEPER, THE WORLD AT HIS FINGERTIPS, IS UNDER A CLOUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ By most accounts, Pavel Pavlovich Borodin is a nice
guy. The Kremlin's property manager plays Ed McMahon to President
Boris Yeltsin. He is self-effacing. He is loyal. Legend says he is
the one person who can tell Yeltsin jokes to Yeltsin and come away
with belly laughs instead of his head on a stick. He has five
children, four of them adopted; three dogs, two chins and an
agreeably crooked grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very pleasant man,'' said Mikhail Berger, editor of the
Moscow daily Segodnya. ``A typical Siberski muzhik'' _ in Western
terms, the sort of fellow who would make a good fishing buddy.
</P>
<P>
   And not someone who, as Swiss and Russian prosecutors keep
whispering to reporters, has pocketed millions in bribes and _ just
perhaps _ passed some of the take to Yeltsin himself. Borodin and
Yeltsin have firmly and repeatedly called the accusations
politically motivated ``rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   But as people learn just what it is that the Kremlin property
manager does, his denials inevitably lose traction. For whatever
his guilt or innocence, one fact is clear: Borodin is
unequivocally, far and away the Russian whom people would most love
to bribe. Forget Russia. Few people on earth have this much
largesse at their fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin's job is the upkeep of the Russian Federation's assets _
that is, its land, its palaces, its dachas, farms and apartments;
its fleets of automobiles, aircraft and yachts; its hospitals, spas
and buildings; its antiques, art, and its furniture factory.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 200 ostensibly profit-making businesses, from
tailors to undertakers. There is also a stake in a $12 billion
Arctic diamond mine.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin has estimated the value of his empire at $600 billion
and change _ the change being scores of millions of dollars in
embassies and other property in 78 foreign nations _ and he is
aggressively proud of his stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``All property I accepted in 1993 was in terrible condition,''
he told the weekly journal Argumenty i Fakty in 1998, on the fifth
anniversary of the creation of his department. ``When I entered
this office and opened the door, it fell off. I opened a window and
it fell, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds of that happening today would seem to be sharply
reduced, for Borodin has spent freely and with Yeltsin's blessing
to wipe away decades of Soviet grime. Shabby government-owned
hotels in Moscow have gotten five-star face-lifts; ministries have
moved into freshly marble-sheathed headquarters; the upper and
lower houses of parliament have gotten new homes.
</P>
<P>
   After tanks shelled and set afire the White House, the towering
former parliament building overlooking the Moscow River, during a
coup attempt in 1993, Borodin personally oversaw the building's
conversion into executive offices.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, he has lavished attention on the Kremlin. According
to the parliamentary Audit Chamber, much like Washington's General
Accounting Office, Borodin's department spent $823 million in the
last few years restoring Kremlin palaces, churches, administrative
offices and Yeltsin's Kremlin residence to their czarist splendor.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the government could not pay pensions to its
teachers, miners and soldiers. Nor could its hospitals afford
medicine. Borodin nevertheless calls the work a bargain: the
Kremlin had not been renovated since the 19th century, parts were
sinking at a rate of 2 inches a year, and the Soviets had endowed
its finest rooms with the grandeur of a high-school gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At $14,087 a square meter for Yeltsin's residence and offices,
the cost was far less than the United States has spent renovating
its own White House, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that Borodin likes to tell of the time he took
President Clinton on a Kremlin tour, saying ``yes,'';
``certainly,''; ``of course,'' as his guest asked time and again
whether this inlaid table or that statue was genuine marble or wood
or gold.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Borodin is said to have stopped Clinton. ``Everything
in the Kremlin is the complete, genuine article,'' he supposedly
said, ``including the president.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Squirreled among those hundreds of millions of dollars, Russian
and Swiss investigators now say, is the evidence that threatens
Borodin's career and Yeltsin's historical legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of it centers on Mabetex Project Engineering, the Lugano,
Switzerland, company that landed a healthy share of the Kremlin
renovation project _ a reported $30 million for work on Yeltsin's
residence, and an undisclosed amount for work on adjacent palaces
and churches.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Moscow newspaper Versiya printed photographs of
Borodin's passport and his signature _ or a decent forgery of it,
as he insists _ among ownership documents for a Lugano bank account
being investigated for money laundering. The account, the newspaper
said, was opened jointly with Borodin's daughter and Beghet
Pacolli, Mabetex's current president.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera said
prosecutors believe Pacolli placed at least $2.85 million in the
same account in 1995, $1 million of which was then shunted to a
bank account in Budapest, Hungary. The paper stated that Russian
investigators believe that account was controlled by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   It also has been widely reported _ and not denied by the Swiss _
that investigators there found the names of Yeltsin and his two
daughters on Mabetex credit cards seized during a raid on the
company's offices early this year. A former debt collector for
Swiss banks has said he saw charge slips bearing the Yeltsin
signatures, but did not estimate the value of the purchases.

MOSCOW: the purchases.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the record, Swiss authorities have said only that Borodin is
implicated in their investigation. The Kremlin has denied that
Yeltsin has any foreign bank accounts whatsoever, but has been
silent on the question of credit cards. Borodin has promised to sue
Corriere della Serra for libel.
</P>
<P>
   Pacolli insisted this week in an interview with The Washington
Post that the so-called Borodin bank account was used only by
Mabetex, partly to pay employees working in Kosovo. The $1 million
supposedly shunted to Yeltsin in Budapest actually went to an
advertising and public-relations firm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacolli has allowed that he secured credit cards for several
senior Russian officials, including Borodin but not the Yeltsins.
In any case, he said, the cards were used to cover expenses when
Russians came to Lugano for contract negotiations _ an expense he
said was stipulated in all contracts with Borodin's office.
</P>
<P>
   There have been more than a few such contracts, for Pacolli and
Borodin did business even before Borodin came to Moscow in early
1993.
</P>
<P>
   For Borodin, who will turn 53 in October, the trek to the
Kremlin was all uphill. Born only 400 miles east of Moscow, he grew
up in Tuva, a remote patch of Siberia on the Mongolian border where
life is so hard that, even today, most men die before age 50.
Borodin began working at age 6, first on a farm, then in a brick
factory, then moved to a Volga River city for an agricultural
education.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up in Yakutsk, a city of 250,000 built atop eastern
Siberian permafrost that is a center for Russian gold, diamond and
tin mining. There he shot up the ranks of a state-run mining
company, went to Communist Party school, entered politics and won a
seat on the city council. By the time Yeltsin came to visit Yakutsk
in December 1990, Borodin was mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin asked President Nikolayev who cared for the city,
because all the buildings were heated well and everything was OK,''
said Berger, referring to President Mikhail Nikolayev of the Sakha
republic, whose capital is Yakutsk. ``Nikolayev said that we have a
bright mayor, Borodin. And very soon, Borodin was invited to
Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   First, however, Borodin met Pacolli, who had set up Mabetex
months before Yeltsin came to Yakutsk and was scouring the
democratizing Soviet Union for business.
</P>
<P>
   In Borodin, he found some: according to the Mabetex Web site
(www.mabetex.com), ``a dairy project in Yakutsk was followed by the
government administration hall, a pediatric and maternity hospital,
a business center, an administrative building and production plant
for the Precious Metals and Stones administration, the central
plant for the treatment of sewage disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those projects, as well as a hotel and other Mabetex
ventures in Yakutsk, were undertaken by other governments or after
Borodin left. On the other hand, Mabetex has found business with
Borodin in Moscow as well. Besides the Kremlin renovations, the
company won contracts to rebuild the fire-gutted Parliament
building, to outfit new offices for the upper and lower houses of
Parliament and to renovate a government-owned hotel in downtown
Moscow as part of a venture between Borodin's office and a Swiss
hotel chain.
</P>
<P>
   Mabetex's Web site lists other projects in Russia as well, from
a pharmacy to an outpatient clinic to housing projects, but their
genesis was not immediately known. Borodin has said that the firm
has had only six contracts from his office in six years and that
its total business with the Russian government is a minuscule
fraction of the billions that have been spent.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Mabetex does not live and die by the Kremlin's
beneficence. Among many other jobs, the company has built much of
an entire city in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, on a
spot chosen by the nation's president for a new capital.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the inquiry into Borodin and Mabetex involves a
single contract, for the renovation of Yeltsin's offices.
Unofficially, those Russians who are jaded by scandal _ and that is
most of them _ say it would be naive to think corruption could be
so compartmentalized.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, the iconoclastic leader of the Yabloko
political faction, said in an interview that the notion that
Yeltsin would abuse a credit card is laughable. Yeltsin with a
credit card, he cracked, ``is like a bear with a violin.''
</P>
<P>
   But real corruption is different. ``No one doubts that, if in
Russia, someone builds a fence, then half of the fence, even if it
is being built for a kindergarten, will be stolen,'' he said.
``This was known in Soviet times, and it is known now. If there is
reconstruction at the White House and the Kremlin and the Duma,
then half of the money is stolen. Every child knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the mindset Borodin is up against _ that, the mounting
evidence, and a bit of dark history, too. For the last time anyone
seriously campaigned against government corruption, in the final
days of the Soviet Union, a senior Communist official and his
retired predecessor leaped from their apartment balconies to their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow newspapers speculated at the time that the two were
fearful that ``shady financial operations'' would come to light.
Both men had run the business department of the Communist Party
Central Committee _ the office that preceded the job of Kremlin
property manager.

 New Job for Former BofA Chief
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
David Coulter, the Bank of America chief executive ousted a year
ago after North Carolina's NationsBank bought the San Francisco
bank, is about to take a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter is near an agreement to become senior partner and a
private investment fund manager for Beacon Group, a New York buyout
and merger advisory firm, according to people familiar with his
plans. They said the former BofA chief would set up a West Coast
office for Beacon in San Francisco or Los Angeles, the &LR;  sources
said &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Joining a private investment partnership is a common step for
well-heeled refugees from the corporate world, especially when they
have large amounts of money to invest. Coulter's severance package
from BofA could be worth as much as $100 million over his lifetime,
providing him a large sum to contribute to Beacon's investment
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Private equity investment firms such as Beacon use their own
capital and money raised from outside investors to buy controlling
or minority stakes in corporations. Companies turn to such private
investors as alternatives to public stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   For the 52-year-old Coulter, the job would mark a new stage in
his gradual return to professional life after a humiliating
departure from the No.2 position at the merged BofA 11 months ago.
Earlier this year, he became a director of the San Francisco
investment bank Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh McColl, the NationsBank CEO who became chief of the
combined bank, fired Coulter 16 days after the takeover took
effect, blaming him for $372 million in losses in an investment
portfolio managed for the bank by the Wall Street firm D.E. Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter's high-profile ordeal didn't make him a pariah. People
familiar with Coulter's plans said he has been courted by several
U.S. and British investment banks and asset management firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In large organizations, people get outmaneuvered all the
time,'' said one executive search specialist. ``It's not a mortal
sin; it's a venial sin. After six months or so, you're free.``
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area investment professionals described Coulter as a
brilliant financial manager who didn't deserve the rough treatment
he got. If he had a flaw, they said, it was in his bargaining
skills, not his ability to understand how companies make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very smart man, and extremely personable,'' said Harlan
Kleiman, president of Shoreline Pacific Institutional Finance, a
Sausalito investment firm. ``If he is going to be managing a
private fund, he'll have an opportunity to show how good he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Coulter nor Geoffrey Boisi, Beacon's founder and chief,
returned telephone calls seeking comment. Coulter's discussions
with Beacon were first reported by the trade newspaper Investment
Dealers Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Boisi, who previously ran the merger advisory practice of the
prestigious investment bank Goldman Sachs, founded Beacon in 1993
to buy out public companies. Many of the firm's deals have been in
the energy industry, such as its purchase several years ago of the
coal operations of Mapco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   During his 21/2-year stint as BofA's CEO, Coulter developed a
keen interest in electronic commerce, and he has recently spoken of
possible ventures in computer-based payment systems. Several people
who know Coulter expect him to focus his investments in those
areas.

 _ SF CHRON   Plugging In To Your Computer 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Q: The computer I got last year has two USB ports in the back, but
they're both being used, for a mouse and a Zip drive. I'm thinking
of adding a USB scanner, but as you can see, there's no place to
plug it in. Is it possible to ``split'` the USB ports so that I can
add more devices? Also, I have an older PC that doesn't have USB
ports. Is it possible to add them?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: First questions first. What you need is a USB hub, which lets
you attach multiple devices to a single USB port on your computer.
The most common hubs offer four connections and cost $50 to $60.
You should be able to find one at your local computer store.
Incidentally, by daisy chaining hubs together you can connect up to
127 USB devices to a single port. That's a lot of scanners.
</P>
<P>
   As to your second question, you should be able to add USB ports
to your computer if you have an empty PCI slot inside the case.
You'll need to buy a USB card (about $35) and plug it into the
slot. The card has two USB ports, which will be accessible through
the back of the PC once the thing is installed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Cable vs. DSL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm eager to get high-speed Internet access, but I'm not sure
which way to go. Cable modem and DSL are now available in my area.
Any suggestions about which one is faster, more convenient,
cheaper, etc.?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Both DSL and cable modems are ``always on,'' which means you
never have to dial up to get connected to the Internet. And both
offer speeds far faster than 56K modems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's a tough comparison. On the one hand, DSL never slows
down, like cable modems can when too many people are online at the
same time. On the other hand, cable modem service usually costs
about $10 less per month than DSL.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the issue of technical support. Cable modem
companies aren't known for their fabulous service _ in fact, you
probably could get Boris Yeltsin on the line faster than you can
get someone to troubleshoot your modem. But phone companies are no
great shakes, either.
</P>
<P>
   What I'd do is seek out folks in my area who have DSL or cable,
get their opinions on the quality of the services and make my
choice based on that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Modem Musings &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently upgraded my PC from Windows 95 to Windows 98, and
now my modem doesn't work. It keeps asking for a TCP/ IP
connection. The PC once was connected to a network. Any
suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: I'd reinstall your modem driver. (That's the software that
lets the modem communicate with the PC). To do so, go to
Start/Settings/Control Panel and double-click the Modems icon.
Click Add, then follow the onscreen instructions to install the
modem driver. (You don't have to delete modems that currently are
installed. But after adding the new one, make sure to designate it
as the default for use with all Windows programs).
</P>
<P>
   As for the driver itself, it may be included with the Windows 98
disc. If it's not, you'll have to download it from the Web site of
either the modem manufacturer or the company that made your PC. And
there's the Catch-22 of the day because how can you download
something if your modem doesn't work? (Actually, you should be able
to use one of the generic drivers on the Windows disc until you can
find the specific driver for your modem.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; The Outlook on E-Mail &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: My situation is that I want to switch from Outlook Express to
Outlook 2000 for my e-mail. Is this an easy thing to do, or will I
have to go through the torture of setting up all my e-mail settings
again? And how do I transfer my stored messages into Outlook?
</P>
<P>
   A: Relax. When you start Outlook for the first time, it should
launch a dialog box that guides you through the whole thing. You'll
have the option of transferring your e-mail settings, stored mail
and address book into Outlook from Outlook Express.
</P>
<P>
   However, if all you plan to use Outlook for is e-mail, I'd stick
with Outlook Express. It's faster and, in my opinion, easier to
use.
</P>

ECONOMIST IS STRUGGLING FOR VOTES IN ARGENTINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENDOZA, Argentina _ The campaign stop had much potential for
pizazz _ the inauguration of a glassy shopping mall, complete with
a brass band, a fashion show and mountains of caviar. But as
Domingo Cavallo climbed to the stage, his smile was a tad too
broad, his wave a tad too perky and long.
</P>
<P>
   If economics is the dismal science, then Cavallo, the former
economy minister credited with whipping Argentina's hyperinflation
in the early 1990s, is the dismal third-party candidate in the
presidential election in October.
</P>
<P>
   But as quixotic as his candidacy may be, Cavallo has the
potential of shaking up the two parties that have dominated
Argentine politics for most of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at 9 percent in the polls, he is poised to win a
substantial bloc of congressional seats for his new conservative
Action for the Republic party. That will probably make Cavallo, now
a senator, a swing negotiator in Congress and an important player
in economic policy, no matter who is elected on Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for big things is there, although Cavallo's
campaign style could use polishing. And most often, Cavallo's
speeches are minilectures on ways to cut interest rates, increase
productivity and increase investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   His slogan is characteristically uncatchy _ ``Cavallo has a
plan.'' One can only wonder what television commercials would look
like, but the campaign cannot afford any.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two traditional parties are personality, sentimental
parties,'' Cavallo, 53, said in an interview. ``Argentines have
traditionally looked for the most sensitive and most affectionate
candidate, not for the best to govern. But every day the people are
thinking more carefully about their vote, and my candidacy is
reinforcing that process.''
</P>
<P>
   In a race in which the two leading candidates offer many vague
promises, Cavallo issues detailed position papers. Although his
true love is talking economics, he appears to be most effective
when he discusses the darker side of Argentine society.
</P>
<P>
   Organized crime, he said on a talk show, ``has infiltrated the
courts, all levels in government, in the police and in the
military.'' And he suggested that a three-year series of suicides
of people suspected of being witnesses to or actors in scandals
that involved the Menem administration was more than a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Cavallo keeps returning to his pet subject, the ins and outs
of monetary and fiscal policy. At one point, Cavallo drove an
interviewer to exasperation by refusing to let him take a break for
a commercial before he had completed a professorial critique of
International Monetary Fund policies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fullness of his oratory and the sparsity of his
campaign resources, Cavallo is receiving significant media
attention, in large part because he is recognized as the most
important cabinet member of the early years of President Carlos
Saul Menem's 10-year presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As Menem's first foreign finister, Cavallo restored ties with
Britain for the first time since the 1982 Falkland War. Then, as
economy minister, he engineered a plan that pegged the value of the
peso to the dollar, a policy that made him a hero on Wall Street
and the most acclaimed economist in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to resign in 1996, after describing to Congress an
expanding web of organized crime with links to the highest levels
of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cavallo is like a doctor,'' Joaquin Morales Sola, a columnist
for the newspaper La Nacion, said. ``You don't have to like him.

 _ SF CHRON  
 New Visor Organizer Thumbs Its Nose at Rival Palm
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Henry Norr &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
With one bold leap, a startup called Handspring has catapulted
itself into the front ranks of the fast-growing market for
pocket-size digital devices.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain View company this week announced Visor, a new line
of handheld organizers, a.k.a. personal digital assistants or PDAs.
</P>
<P>
   The devices go on sale next month &LR;   &LR; but only online
(www.handspring.com); they won't get into retail stores until next
year. But when they do, I'm convinced they'll be big winners _ even
though I've had some serious problems with the prerelease unit I've
been trying out this week.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Visors are just clones of the wildly
successful Palm PDAs from 3Com's Palm Computing division (soon to
be spun off into an independent company). Handspring's hardware
looks similar to Palm's, and its software is all but identical.
</P>
<P>
   But the Visors offer some compelling advantages over current
Palm models, not to mention competing devices from a variety of
vendors that use Microsoft's Windows CE software.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Handspring's products are cheaper, faster and easier
to hook up to a PC or Mac, at least if your desktop system is
relatively new. And by the end of this year, there likely will be
many more ways to add cool new capabilities to a Visor than to
other PDAs.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that the Visor is a lot like its Palm
predecessors. After all, Handspring was founded just over a year
ago by the people who created Palm Computing and designed its first
model, the Pilot, before a series of corporate buyouts made it a
part of networking giant 3Com. And when they left, instead of
attempting to reinvent the wheel, the Handspring team members opted
to license back much of the technology they had already created.
</P>
<P>
   Included in that license is the Palm OS _ not just the
underlying code that brings the handheld hardware to life, but also
the easy-to-use personal-information applications that have made
the Palm devices so popular: the electronic address book, calendar,
memo pad, to-do-list manager, expense tracker and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Visors also come with Graffiti, the Palm software that lets
you enter information by writing on the screen in a simplified
alphabet with a plastic stylus; Palm Desktop for Windows or Mac,
programs for keeping your calendar and contacts on your desktop
computer; &UR;  &LR; and Palm's HotSync technology, which lets you share data
between the desktop and handheld systems at the touch of a button.
For those who use Microsoft Outlook on Windows, there's also
software for synchronizing between that application and the Visor.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when you fire up the Visor, the software environment is
so similar, you can hardly tell you're not using a Palm device.
According to Handspring, Visors also will run all of the thousands
of free, shareware and commercial software add-ons available for
the Palm products. I wasn't able to test that claim, but I have no
reason to doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few differences in the Visor software, though, and
while they're not earthshaking, they're all improvements.
Handspring's developers, for example, added some new features to
Palm's Date Book software: To-do items now appear in the calendar
and even roll over to the next day if not completed, and there are
several new views, including a biweekly one.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Handspring added an advanced mode, with an array of
new financial and other functions, to Palm's electronic Calculator.
And there's a new World Clock module that lets you simultaneously
see the time in five cities.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of hardware, the Visors are about the same size as the
Palm III, but at 5.4 ounces, the former are a shade lighter. The
standard unit's plastic is black rather than the gray of most Palm
models or the brushed aluminum of the slim and sleek Palm V, but
the Deluxe version will be available in your choice of five colors.
</P>
<P>
   All Visor models, like recent Palms, have infrared ports for
close-range wireless data exchange with other handhelds and some
printers. Handspring also borrowed a good idea from the Windows CE
world: Visors have built-in microphones.
</P>
<P>
   And like most Palm models, the devices run on two AAA alkaline
batteries; Handspring says a fresh pair will last six to eight
weeks in normal use.
</P>
<P>
   The viewable part of the Visor's monochrome screen, not counting
the Graffiti text-entry box at the bottom, measures about 2.25
inches square, with a resolution of 160 by 160 pixels. Like Palm's
screen, Handspring's is very readable in bright light, and there's
optional backlighting to help in darker environments, but it's
nowhere near as bright and crisp as the color displays on
more-expensive Windows CE devices.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, nothing I've mentioned so far sounds like a
breakthrough. So what's the big deal? Three things:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Price: Unless Palm responds to the new competition with sharp
price cuts, Visors will have an appreciable price advantage.
Handspring will offer three versions of the Visor, ranging from
$150 to $250, whereas Palm's comparable models start at $229 and go
up to $449. (The Palm VII costs even more _ $599 _ but includes a
wireless radio modem that Handspring doesn't yet offer and for now
still is sold only in the New York area.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Connectivity: The docking cradle included in Handspring's standard
Visor and Visor Deluxe packages connects to the PC or Mac via a
technology called Universal Serial Bus, which is significantly
faster and _ in principle _ less hassle-prone than the traditional
serial-port connection on which current Palm models rely.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, switching to USB also has its downsides. Most PCs
manufactured in the past two years and Macs built in the past year
have USB ports, but older computers don't. And even if your PC has
the requisite ports, you can't use them unless you're running
Windows 98, because older Microsoft operating systems don't fully
support USB. At The Chronicle, for example, I have a spanking new,
USB-equipped PC on my desk, but because our official OS standard is
still Windows 95, I couldn't use the cradle that came with my test
unit at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, even if your system meets all the requirements for
USB, it might not work. At least that was my experience when I
hooked up the Visor cradle to my year-old, Windows 98-based home
PC. Despite repeated software installations, countless tedious
restarts and more than an hour on the phone with a Handspring
support engineer, the Visor still reports that it can't make the
connection every time I press the HotSync button.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Handspring has a solution for us suffering souls who,
for whatever reason, can't use USB: It's offering an alternative
cradle that exchanges data via a conventional serial port. But
that'll cost an extra $30, and it won't offer the speed and
convenience that USB promises.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Expansion: Handspring's biggest coup is the Springboard, an
expansion slot on the back of all three Visor models. Handspring
and a slew of other developers are creating an amazing array of
add-on modules that will plug into this opening, including extra
memory, games, reference works, voice recorders, GPS systems,
digital music players, pagers and both wired and wireless modems.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, Handspring says it designed the Springboard
technology with users, not engineers, in mind. All modules are
supposed to start up automatically when plugged in _ you won't even
need to load drivers or configure the software.
</P>
<P>
   I did test one such module, a product called EA Sports Tiger
Woods PGA Tour Golf, which Handspring itself will sell for
$29.95. &UR;  &LR; It worked as advertised, though I can't say I find golf on
a 2-inch monochrome screen exhilarating. The other modules won't be
available until sometime this fall, if not later, and prices for
most of them haven't yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea of a PDA that easily can be configured to meet
different needs _ and even reconfigured repeatedly through the
course of a day _ is pretty exciting. Of course, it could be an
expensive habit, and I'm sure there soon will be users demanding a
way to run multiple modules at once _ something Handspring says is
technically quite feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, despite my negative experience with USB, I found the
Visor an innovative and exciting product. If Palm and Microsoft's
Windows CE licensees respond as I hope they will _ with price cuts
and innovations of their own _ the already lively PDA market is
sure to see even more vitality in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope that Palm won't pull an Apple and change its mind
about licensing its OS after seeing an aggressive offspring
leapfrog its own products.

 How Whisper Estimates Can Affect Stocks
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Stein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
So-called whisper numbers are starting to speak volumes about
whether a company's stock soars _ or plummets.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle Corp. found that out the hard way. The company this week
posted earnings of 16 cents a share, which were in line with the
published consensus estimates of analysts. But that didn't stop
Oracle's stock from falling 6 percent yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   That's because whisper estimates _ the scuttlebutt floating
around Internet sites and chat rooms, which might come in part from
analysts' unpublished tips but also heavily relies on rumor _
predicted 19 cents a share. Oracle proceeded to drop $2.75
yesterday to close at $42.69, after trading as low as $39.88.
</P>
<P>
   More than 64 million shares changed hands, making it the most
active stock in U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   So why are investors disregarding the published reports of
respected analysts who cover companies like Oracle and instead
betting heavily on what might amount to little more than gossip?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whisper number more accurately reflects the true
expectations of analysts.'' said Shannon Puls, co-founder of
EarningsWhispers.com, a popular Web site that calculates and posts
whisper estimates. ``Analysts are taught to be conservative, so in
their reports they tend to publish lower estimates even though they
believe the numbers will be higher.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that some analysts give the juiciest bits of
information to select clients only but that this information often
leaks out and eventually gets incorporated in whisper estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Eisenbarth, an analyst with Collins and Co. in San
Francisco, said that for the most part, he does not know where
whisper numbers come from, but he believes that the whisper
phenomenon is directly related to the growth of the Internet. ``You
never heard about this whole whisper thing until a few years ago,
when the Internet got really popular.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it is not uncommon for an analyst to mention an
unpublished tidbit to a client and then see that nugget circulated
all over Yahoo and financial chat rooms. In the case of Oracle,
EarningsWhispers spoke to analysts off the record to gauge their
true feelings about the stock. It also factored in rumors it was
hearing that Oracle had closed several very big deals at the tail
end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But when those rumors did not pan out yesterday, Oracle paid the
price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We attribute the whisper numbers to day traders and momentum
players who are looking for some excitement,'' said an Oracle
spokeswoman. ``Sure, the whisper numbers bother us, but we're not
going to change the way we do business to accommodate these
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that recently have fallen prey to whisper
estimates include Dell Computer, whose fourth-quarter earnings
reported on February 16 jumped 55 percent but whose stock slumped 8
percent because it missed its whisper estimate by 2 cents a share;
Hewlett-Packard, whose shares fell nearly 6 percent in August after
it missed its ``unpublished forecasts'' by 6 cents; and Ethan Allen
Interiors, whose net income for the third quarter ended March 31
rose 40 percent but whose stock nose-dived about 9 percent after
the results missed its whisper numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the power of whisper numbers and their ability to
greatly impact the stock market, &UR;  &LR; Boston's First Call Corp. this
week started publishing what it calls ``hisper estimates,'' along
with its traditional consensus estimates based on analyst reports.
First Call compiles all analyst reports for a particular company to
create its estimates; until recently, those were the numbers by
which performance was judged.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call, said his hisper
numbers will be different from whisper numbers because ``they are
based on the historical performance of a company over at least the
last four quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   If a company consistently beats its published estimates by an
average of, say, 2 cents, the hisper number will reflect that
historical pattern. By contrast, adds Hill, ``whisper numbers are
based on who knows what.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he admits that analyst estimates, which typically are
published a month before a company reports earnings, are not always
the best gauge for investors because the numbers quickly get stale,
especially in today's highly volatile economy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a study of 101 high-tech companies' earnings reports by
Bloomberg News showed that estimates on EarningsWhispers.com and a
similar site called StreetIQ.com were off by 21 percent, while the
analyst estimates as aggregated by First Call missed by 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Market experts believe that companies themselves are encouraging
the proliferation of whisper numbers by being overly conservative
with their financial forecasts. Until yesterday, Oracle, for
instance, had trounced analyst estimates for the past six quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company has a pattern of beating the numbers, the
expectation is that it will continue to do so every quarter,'' said
First Call's Hill. ``But once you establish this pattern, it can
always come back and bite you in the rear.''

 _ SF CHRON   Ethical Journalism in a Market-Mad World 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Media ethicists increasingly are posing a question: Can journalists
covering the stock market also trade stocks?
</P>
<P>
   MarketWatch.com Editor in Chief Thom Calandra poses a different
question: Can he fairly tell his reporters that they should give
readers information about stocks but not use any of that
information to trade themselves?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the new MarketWatch stock ownership policy,
posted on the company Web site at
cbs.marketwatch.com/news/edpolicy.htx?sourcehtx/http2mw. (You also
can find it from the main page at cbs.marketwatch.com by clicking
on Site Map at the top of the page and then clicking on Editorial
Policy under the About Us heading.)
</P>
<P>
   The policy is harder to find than that of rival TheStreet.com,
which links its policy at the end of every story. And it's not
nearly as stringent: TheStreet prohibits reporters from owning
stocks, except through mutual funds and except in TheStreet itself.
(That doesn't go for columnists, however, such as co-founder James
Cramer, a walking conflict-of-interest case who writes about
everything, including firms in his hedge fund's portfolio, and then
discloses everything.)
</P>
<P>
   The expanded MarketWatch policy prohibits newsroom staffers from
trading securities of companies they regularly cover. If they write
about another company, they can't trade that stock until 48 hours
after their story is published. If they own stock in a company and
are assigned to write the story anyway, their interest will be
disclosed on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 53 full-time journalists; 49 of them said they did not
want to be excluded from the stock and bond markets,'' Calandra
said.
</P>
<P>
   Calandra reviewed proposals with his newest columnist, Marshall
Loeb, the former editor of Columbia Journalism Review, and picked
the two-day ban even though they figured that ``makes no sense,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, our journalists are not trading on news that they are
withholding, are they? Why should we trust their judgment when it
comes to the delivery of news, then devise some policy that in
effect says, `If you trade before 72 hours, or three weeks, or
three months, you're in deep doo-doo.' Our editorial trading
policies, which have worked very well for three years now, are to
guide our writers and editors, not penalize them or straitjacket
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a fine bunch of folks with the highest standards, and
that's the way they get treated.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A NEW SALON: Salon.com is moving, but not too far. The online
magazine is leaving its home above the Rochester Big and Tall shop
on Mission Street and moving to new digs around the corner at 22
Fourth St.
</P>
<P>
   The move should happen by the end of November, and the company
will double the size of its quarters, from 10,000 square feet to
20,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the growing of a plant,'' said Chief Financial
Officer Todd Hagen. ``You put a plant in a small pot, it only grows
so big. lf you put it in a bigger pot, it grows bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon already is too big for its current space, but the new
offices will have room to grow further. It's part of Pacific
Resources PCX Development's $200 million project, Pacific Place,
which includes the new Hotel Palomar and the 102,000 square foot
Old Navy flagship store, opening in October.
</P>
<P>
   Salon is the last tenant in the 16-story office tower, which is
anchored by the advertising and media departments of Macy's,
according to Jeff Vance, Pacific's directing manager.
</P>
<P>
   It was tough to find space close to downtown, Hagen said, but
the company nailed down the new office with a 10-year lease that
over time will average $42.50 per square foot _ or $850,000 _ per
year.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, even a company in cyberspace needs some real estate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NEWS? AD?: Talk about blurring the lines. Running alongside news
stories on the Forbes.com Web site is something headlined
``Microsoft Daily News.'' Beneath it are headlines and links that
look an awful lot like news _ even though it's all a paid promotion
from Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Standard first called the ads to the attention of
the Magazine Publishers Association, which now is investigating.
The association, which doles out prestigious National Magazine
Awards each year, can sanction members who violate the ad-editorial
wall.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes is comfortable that the ads don't violate guidelines,
which require that ads be clearly labeled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe it's an issue. We do our best not to mix
advertising and editorial issues,'' said David Churbuck, editor of
Forbes.com.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spokeswoman Monie Begley said the site is ``absolutely in
compliance'' with APME's guidelines. The Microsoft ad is ``readily
identifiable'' as an ad, with no hint of it being editorial
content, she said. The Standard story represents ``the first time
any of this has been brought up. There hasn't been a phone call or
a complaint,'' Begley said.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Kahan, executive director of the American Society of
Magazine Editors, declined to comment, noting that an ASME
committee is reviewing the ads for any possible policy violations.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SENSATIONAL SALE?: Tech publishing giant Ziff-Davis publicly denied
this week's report in the London Observer that media mogul Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. was about to gobble up Ziff for $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Murdoch, who owns the Fox television network and the New
York Post, would have a hard time sensationalizing the bits and
bytes in PC Week or the geeks at ZDTV.
</P>
<P>
   But the price may look like a bargain. After all, Ziff _ which
is, indeed, on the block _ was sold in 1994 to New York's Forstmann
Little &AMP; Co. for $1.4 billion and then sold again to Japan's
Softbank for $2.1 billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Things are back to normal here, sort of. As
normal as they can be when a team sees its world nearly crumble.
This was Day 3 without Vinny, Vinny Testaverde, last season's
Cinderella quarterback whose season abruptly ended on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, coach Bill Parcells said he warned his team to
take it one game at a time. ``I told them to focus on Buffalo, not
the season,'' Parcells said, ``because people will try to make you
think the season is over, and it's not.''

<P>
   As the daily news media session ended with more gloom and doom
questions about the Jets' season and future without Testaverde,
Parcells finally said, ``Why do I feel I'm at a funeral today?''
</P>
<P>
   Two scenes from Sunday's loss to New England already set the
tone for the Jets' season and may well define it: Testaverde,
crumpled on the turf, grabbing his ankle, then being carried from
the field. Then, after the game, Keyshawn Johnson, the Jets All-Pro
wide receiver, at the postgame news conference. As Johnson tried to
put the loss of his quarterback and the team leader in perspective,
he was overcome with emotion. He cursed, pounded his fist on the
lectern in frustration and abruptly walked out. It was a dramatic
moment that framed a traumatic day.
</P>
<P>
   My initial reaction to Johnson's outburst was that of being
jolted. We are so used to seeing stoicism and cliches from athletes
that hard-edged, emotional responses take us by surprise. Johnson
said Wednesday that he was consumed by loss: loss of a hard-fought
game, loss of a quarterback and, for a moment, what he thought was
the loss of a winning season.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Johnson and Rick Mirer joked across the locker room
about the Notre Dame-Southern Cal rivalry. Mirer, who played at
Notre Dame, had beaten the Trojans three times while Johnson, a
star at USC, had never beaten Notre Dame. Less than a week later,
Mirer holds Johnson's fate in his hands. The Jets acquired Mirer on
Aug. 20 in a trade with the Packers. Mirer has attempted 11 passes
in the regular season since 1997, and all 11 were against New
England last Sunday. Now he will start this Sunday against the
Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson lamented how, in Testaverde's absence, the Jets offense
stalled and the passing game flew out the window. He mentioned a
couple of costly interceptions, which prompted some to believe he
was pointing fingers at Mirer, whose interception on Sunday led to
New England's winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Johnson said repeatedly that he was merely
expressing the frustration of the moment, that he was as much to
blame for the interception as Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep on rolling,'' Johnson said. ``Rick is
going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the handwringing, the fundamental question now is how
debilitating is the early season loss of Testaverde? This is not
Raymond Berry losing Johnny Unitas, Jerry Rice losing Joe Montana,
Denver losing John Elway or Miami losing Dan Marino. The Jets lost
a vital cog in a system, a cog who last season mastered the art of
playing within himself, playing within a system tailored for his
skills. Most of all, Testaverde mastered the art of not losing
games.
</P>
<P>
   What skills does Rick Mirer have that the Jets can build around?
No one knows for sure. But no one knows what twists and turns lie
ahead, either.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he never thought he would lose Testaverde. At this
time last season, many fans thought that Glenn Foley would lead the
Jets to Shangri-La. Last season, some of the premier quarterbacks
in the league weren't even starting: Doug Flutie, Testaverde, Chris
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   What's curious about the Jets' sudden turn of events is that the
focus reverts to running back Curtis Martin. Last season the
questions centered around his big contract. This summer Martin
pledge to gain 2,000 yards rushing. At the time everyone nodded
respectfully, then chortled.
</P>
<P>
   Where would Martin get the opportunities to gain 2,000 yards?
Johnson would get his 13.6 catches per game; Wayne Chrebet his 12.4
per game. The all-round Leon Johnson had to have his all-purpose
yards. Now Chrebet is out until October, and Testaverde and Leon
Johnson, the third-down back, are out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   How will Johnson respond to this unprecedented setback? Coolly,
like a seasoned veteran? Heroically, like the leader with the world
on his shoulders? Or emotionally, like the player who feels all is
lost? That is the most crucial question of all.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Sept. 16: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To call the calm at the center of a hurricane an ``eye'' is a
metaphor, and a peculiarly disembodied one at that. The image is
barely anatomical, as the term ``eye wall,'' which has no
anatomical equivalent, suggests. The eye wall is the tight,
circular boundary of wind and cloud that separates the eye from the
swirling body of the storm. Sometimes it shapes itself into a
pantheon of clouds through which a lens of clear, blue daylight is
visible at the very top. The eye wall is also the most violent
region of the hurricane, the place where research aircraft flying
into the storm are most severely buffeted and where heaviest damage
is inflicted when a hurricane moves inland.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking about a hurricane like Floyd, which at this
writing is moving up the Atlantic coast at a four-minute-mile pace,
is the amount of information being drawn from it. Aircraft from the
53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron have been flying into the
storm, clocking wind speeds and dropping weather-instrument
packages called dropsondes in the exact pressure center of the
vortex. Satellites have been tracking Floyd's movement from high
above, returning readings on every possible parameter. As Floyd
approaches and passes over them, weather buoys weigh in, as do
land-based weather-instrument stations. An astonishing amount of
this information _ gathered for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration _ now makes its way promptly onto the
Internet, which has become something of a weather watcher's dream.
</P>
<P>
   It feels almost Olympian to look down on this hurricane from the
vantage of a weather satellite, the early sun catching the
symmetrical, flattened whorl of clouds as it scudded toward Florida
before turning northward Tuesday morning. From a satellite view,
the size of this storm, the extent to which it dwarfs Hurricane
Andrew, for instance, is immediately visible. Its nucleus alone _
the core mass of unbroken clouds _ is the size of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the sublime has almost vanished in this century. The
mountain scenes that so moved Goethe and many others in the late
18th century now seem ornamental at best. But a storm of this
magnitude still bears along with it the terrifying sublimity of the
winds and seas. To that we have added this serene, supernal vista.
It seems inevitable, by now, to personify a hurricane as the
National Weather Service has been doing since 1947, to call it
Floyd, to speak of its eye and its wrath. But to see a hurricane as
we do now, in its symmetrical wholeness as well as in its fury,
makes personification a little like an act of hubris. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ As the Clinton administration discussed which U.S.
forces would take part in a peacekeeping mission to East Timor, a
senior U.S. military official met Wednesday at the United Nations
with an Indonesian counterpart and sought to ensure the full
cooperation of the Indonesian military, the White House announced.
</P>
<P>
   In an exception to a recent ban by the White House on military
contacts with Indonesia, Gen. Joseph Ralston, the vice chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, flew to New York Wednesday to meet Lt.
Gen. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who has been put in charge of
coordinating how Indonesian forces work with the Australian-led
peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress and Pentagon officials have insisted that
the mission include strong measures to protect all the forces
involved, and the United Nations is seeking assurances from
Yudhoyono that his troops will cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Wednesday that a
decision about specific U.S. units for the mission would be made
``within the next day or so.''
</P>
<P>
   The troops will provide transportation, logistics, communication
and intelligence, and the United States is likely to station only a
few hundred in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cargo planes, ships, tankers and specialists will be
drawn from bases in the Pacific command, according to Rear Adm.
Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A team of 15 U.S. military experts from the Pacific command has
been working with the Australian military since Friday, drawing up
detailed plans for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is waiting for the United Nations to decide which
countries are going to take part and what they will need for
support.
</P>
<P>
   Washington expects to be asked to use its huge cargo planes to
help countries in the region bring in the jeeps, trucks and other
equipment that will be needed to support their troops in East
Timor.

 &HT;    Texas talk show host to help build church at Mount Carmel
 &HT;    By Mark England and Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Austin talk show host Alex Jones, described by one
journalist as a man who ``never met a conspiracy he didn't like,''
plans to come to Waco this Sunday to start building a new church
for the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you in three months they're going to have a
substantial church built on their original site _ unless tanks
drive up and stop us,'' said Jones, who hosts a radio program aimed
at the dark side on, appropriately, KJFK-FM.
</P>
<P>
   Jones plans to lead a convoy from the Capitol Plaza in Austin to
what's left of Mount Carmel, about 10 miles east of Waco. He's
using his radio program _ where he once accused the Federal
Emergency Management Agency of building concentration camps on
military bases _ to ask for volunteers from all the construction
trades as well as anyone wanting to donate materials and funds.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Lambert, a Waco bank auditor, heard the call. He's
already phoned the volunteer line (512-292-0070).
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been wishing this would happen since the compound
burned in 1993,'' Lambert said. ``And I called to see what I could
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert views the project as a form of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is basically a peaceful protest to let the government know
that we are not going to take them coming down here and burning
churches for no reason at all,'' Lambert said. ``In addition, it is
just a good neighborly gesture. The Branch Davidians were wronged
by the government, and we are going to pull together as neighbors
to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone doesn't have to be as sure as Lambert as to the origin
of the fire at Mount Carmel to pitch in, according to Jones. He's
not looking to build Mount Carmel II, he said, just ``an old
country church.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea came up while talking to his friend, Mike Hanson, a
building contractor, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an endorsement of anyone,'' Jones said. ``It's not
even an attack on the government. It's act of defiance, if
anything. It's just saying you can't come here and spread
half-truths and wipe people out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Jones, who got his start on Austin's public access
television, doesn't have a theory on Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was about heralding in a police state,'' Jones said.
``Clinton came to power and designated the right-wing groups as the
enemy. This little band in Texas was picked as a test case. For six
years, America has gotten an A-plus for reveling in the
establishment of a police state. It's wrong to allow the government
to paint people as evil and everyone join in on the barbecue.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidians are taking a wait-and-see approach to the offer of
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been very supportive,'' said Sheila Martin, who
lives in Waco. ``They want to help us get back on our feet. But
this is a situation where we're waiting on God to do what he thinks
he should do. That's the peace we have, knowing God will direct
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clive Doyle, who survived the fire that destroyed Mount Carmel,
said the offer to build the Davidians a church showed a ``kind
spirit.'' There are about 20 Davidians who still live in the Waco
area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Doyle isn't getting his hopes up yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are willing to donate to a project when they
can see that it is up and running, but not so much if they can't
see anything going on,'' Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   As with most things dealing with the Davidians, the ownership of
Mount Carmel is not clear-cut. Surviving Davidians are not the only
ones claiming the property. Also making claims are Amo Roden Bishop
(ex-wife of George Roden, who lost a power struggle with David
Koresh) and Douglas Mitchell, who belonged to the pre-Koresh
Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   While ownership of the land is disputed, there's nothing to keep
a church from being built on the property, said Houston attorney
Percy Isgitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest ruling was that the land belongs to the church,''
said Isgitt, who represents Doyle. ``Now what is left to determine
is who are the representatives of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be the second building project this year for Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he organized an effort to build a home for disabled
World War II veteran Joe Campana, who refused to abandon a house
falling down on him.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' listeners built a small two-room house for Campana in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, about 10 a.m., Jones hopes to stake out the church,
for which architectural plans have already been drawn, put down
rebar and get everything ready to pour the construction columns.
Besides volunteers to provide labor, Jones said he needs materials
such as concrete and rebar. He's also looking for a backhoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'll really be trying to build back is the First
Amendment,'' Jones said. ``That's freedom of the press, the right
to freely assemble, freedom of religion and a lot of other things.
Basically, the freedom not to be bothered when you're not messing
with anyone.''

 &HT;    Judge delays start of Branch Davidian civil trial
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon and Mark England
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Delays in transferring custody of tons of evidence
related to the death of David Koresh and 75 followers at the Branch
Davidian compound near Waco have forced the postponement of the
wrongful-death civil lawsuit against the government set for next
month.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco, in an order
released Wednesday, stated the Oct. 18 trial date ``will be
impossible to maintain.'' Smith did not set a new trial date.
However, he said the government's proposed trial date of fall 2000
``is not realistic, and the trial date will not be postponed for
that length of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the government and the plaintiffs had motions pending with
Smith to postpone the trial. A court official, however, said
earlier this month that the judge was trying hard to stick with the
scheduled trial date.
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Mike Caddell of Houston, who represents some of the
plaintiffs, said he wasn't surprised by Smith's order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expected the judge to grant a continuance,'' Caddell
said. ``It's clear that the developments of the last few weeks have
raised a lot of issues that would make it very difficult to prepare
for trial by Oct. 18. I always believed Judge Smith would recognize
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said the continuance
was merited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the judge appropriately recognized the gathering of
materials would take longer than October 1,'' Marlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's order Wednesday also granted the plaintiffs' request for
a status conference on the case, although it did not set a date for
it. That will be done ``once the logistics of the evidence transfer
and storage have been resolved,'' according to Smith's order.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said both sides will benefit from the continuance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have more time to digest the evidence that has become
available in the last few weeks,'' Caddell said. ``It will also
give both sides an opportunity to prepare their case in a way that
the presentation of the evidence can be more efficient and focused.
You can sometimes do a better job and be quicker when you have time
to get ready than when you have to do things in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit stems from the the 1993 raid by the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents on Mount Carmel, the
Davidians' residence about 10 miles east of Waco. Four agents and
five Davidians died in a gun battle. Following a 51-day siege, a
fire consumed the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving Davidians and the relatives of the dead later sued,
challenging the government's conclusion that the Davidians shot
first during the raid and started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's order defuses what had seemed like a growing conflict
over custody of the evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Smith was said to have been angered by the
apparent reluctance of government officials to comply with his
sweeping order to turn over all evidence related to the Branch
Davidian case, much of which has been stored for years by the
Department of Public Safety in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney William Blagg of San Antonio challenged Smith's
discovery order, saying it placed an ``unwarranted and substantial
burden'' on the government and hampered its preparations for the
wrongful-death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In an order filed earlier this month, Smith countered by calling
the government's claims ``somewhat disingenuous since the
government has been in possession of the material for six years and
has been aware since 1994, when the civil suits were originally
filed, that this material could very well be subject to
discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith on Wednesday, however, granted a continuance after the
government made it known through informal channels that it would
bow to the court's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has been informed that the Justice Department
intends to comply with the court's order,'' Smith wrote. ``However,
the physical transfer of control of all of this evidence will take
longer than originally anticipated by the Court.''

COURT RULING SETS GUIDES ON USE OF INFORMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a ruling on a case with unusually broad implications
for the murky world of criminal informers, a federal judge on
Wednesday rejected a claim by an informer that he deserved blanket
immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, Mark Wolf of U.S. District Court here, affirmed
specific assurances the defendant said he had received that he
would not suffer because of information gained from electronic
listening devices that the bureau planted with his help. The
defendant, Stephen Flemmi, is described by prosecutors as a career
criminal who was also a longtime informer for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ordered more hearings next month to determine if
the recorded conversations are so central to racketeering and
extortion charges against Flemmi that the case should be dismissed
altogether. Flemmi is said to have served as the sidekick-in-crime
to James Bulger, the black-sheep brother of the current president
of the University of Massachusetts, William Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   James Bulger was the sometime head of the closest thing to an
Irish mob in Boston, prosecutors say. Bulger, who had also been
recruited as a bureau informer, fled in 1995 when he was about to
be indicted in the case. He is now on the FBI's list of 10
most-wanted fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling, tangled, ever-so-Bostonian story of how Bulger
and Flemmi were recruited to inform for the bureau in the
anti-Mafia fever of a generation ago and the warm relationships
they formed with their FBI handlers, seem so much the stuff of
books and movies that several are reportedly in the works.
</P>
<P>
   But the trial of Flemmi and other defendants has been hung up by
pretrial hearings largely focused on the questionable ties between
FBI agents and their informants.
</P>
<P>
   One unsettling aspect of the case that has emerged is that such
confidential informers, in exchange for the information they
provide the bureau, are allowed to commit certain crimes and
promised the agency's protection if other law-enforcement branches
come after them. Flemmi testified that an FBI supervisor told him
and Bulger they would not have to worry about their crimes as long
as they did not kill someone, quoting the agent as saying, ``You
can do whatever you want, just don't clip anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's ruling, Wolf noted that deals with criminals must
sometimes be struck and that ``informants are valuable, if not
vital, assets in combating serious crime.'' But he also took the
FBI to task on some aspects of its relationship with Flemmi, noting
at one point that it had ``routinely ignored'' guidelines requiring
it to report informers' crimes to the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The case has prompted the Department of Justice to review and
tighten its rules on how such informers are handled.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, both sides in the case declared themselves at least
partly happy with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Stern, the U.S. attorney here, said in a statement that
he was pleased that Wolf had ``flatly rejected Flemmi's claim that
he was provided immunity from prosecution.'' But he said he was
disappointed by the judge's call for further hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Fishman, Flemmi's lawyer, called the ruling ``a major
victory,'' saying the judge had believed most of what Flemmi said.
Fishman predicted that the government's case against Flemmi would
be substantially weakened by the new strictures on the material it
can use.
</P>
<P>
   In broader terms, Fishman said, ``I think this decision will
become a standard for the all-important concept that when the
government makes a bargain, they need to live by it.''
</P>
<P>
   However the current trial turns out, Flemmi's troubles are far
from over. Federal prosecutors here announced last week that they
had cemented a plea deal with a confessed hit man, John Martorano,
who is expected to testify against Flemmi and Bulger.

CAROLINAS BRACE FOR DANGEROUS FLOYD

<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ After spawning the biggest peacetime
evacuation in U.S. history, a weakened but still dangerous
Hurricane Floyd headed for landfall on the Carolina coast
Wednesday, bringing with it the threat of high winds and torrential
rains as far north as Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people were ordered out of their homes as
Floyd, with winds of 115 miles per hour, churned toward a landing
somewhere between here and Myrtle Beach, S.C., early Thursday
morning. As its eye approached late Wednesday, Floyd was already
causing extensive street flooding and power outages as far south as
Charleston, S.C. which was experiencing hurricane force wind gusts.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmington had already received more than a foot of rain and a
tornado had been reported on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Wednesday, residents in the Carolinas
streamed away from their coastal communities, jamming freeways as
they headed inland for shelter. In all, 2.6 million people from
Florida to North Carolina were ordered evacuated in what officials
described as the largest evacuation for a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, Floyd was considered one of the biggest storms ever
to threaten the United States. While it tore up the Bahamas on
Tuesday, it was about 600 miles wide and carried winds in excess of
150 miles per hour. But after delivering a glancing blow to Florida
on Tuesday night, it steadily weakened as it took aim at the
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, because of its enormous size, forecasters warned
Floyd could still drop copious rain as it moved inland on its
predicted track up the Eastern Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, where about 1.3 million people were ordered out of
their homes, squalls in the outer bands of Floyd were strong enough
to knock down trees and power lines and churn up waves big enough
to consume a 100-foot section of a pier at Daytona Beach. At NASA's
Kennedy Space Center, gusts of wind up to 81 miles per hour were
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   And about 350 miles off the coast of Jacksonville, Fla., U.S.
Navy helicopters rescued eight crewmen from a tug bout that had
floundered in 30-feet seas kicked up by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   But while Florida and Georgia were breathing collective sighs of
relief, authorities in the Carolinas were bracing for the full
impact and officials in states as far north as New York were
expecting heavy rains, high winds and high tides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Florida and Georgia at this point feel like
they've dodged a real bullet,'' said North Carolina's public safety
secretary Richard Moore. ``This thing is not going to miss us.''
</P>
<P>
   While significantly weaker than the Category 4 monster it was 36
hours ago, Floyd was still a 300-mile wide system with hurricane
force winds extending as far as 140 miles from its center on its
northeast flank, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the damage Floyd could inflict on the coast,
President Clinton on Wednesday extended an emergency declaration to
include North and South Carolina. On Wednesday, the president, in
what he called an ``unprecedented'' action, declared emergencies in
Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of Hurricane Floyd prompted Clinton to abandon a day
of golf in Hawaii during a refueling stop on his way back from a
trip to New Zealand and head directly to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done everything we know to do,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of residents evacuated the North Carolina coast
Wednesday, clogging interstate highways and main roads leading
inland. One official estimated traffic along I-40 west stretched
100 miles as people fled Floyd as it approached the shore near
Wilmington. At 4 p.m. CST vehicles were at a virtual stand still on
I-40 for the last 50 miles heading into the Raleigh-Durham area.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal counties were under a mandatory evacuation, especially
those living in mobile or manufactured homes and along the beaches.
David Paynter with the Wilmington emergency operations center said
tens of thousands had evacuated New Hanover and Pender counties.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuations were also ordered for the barrier islands off the
coast near Wilmington, as well as for the ecologically fragile
Outer Banks that were severely damaged by Hurricane Dennis only a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Four shelters were set up at area schools in Wilmington where
150,000 people live, Paynter said. By evening, all but one were
filled to capacity. Each could hold 200 to 250 people.
</P>
<P>
   While several streets in Wilmington already were flooding by
Wednesday evening, Paynter said many still were passable. Power
outages, he said, were increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty calm right now,'' Paynter said. ``We've had a few
slight gusts of wind but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has been preparing for the storm for several days, said
Cam Griffin, with the emergency operations center. ``We are as
prepared as you can be for a storm. We are ready for it to hit.``
</P>
<P>
   In Charleston, where the memory of Hurricane Hugo, which scored
a direct hit on the city almost exactly 10 years ago, is still
fresh, authorities expressed relief that Floyd appeared to be
moving north of the city, but were still concerned about winds in
excess of 110 miles per hour, heavy rains and flooding caused by a
storm surge which could be as high as 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Slater, a spokeswoman for the Charleston County Emergency
Operations Center, said that at least 75 percent of the county's
316,000 residents heeded warnings to evacuate on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very fortunate that it has drifted a little bit north
of us,'' Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   In this city of historic houses and handsome boulevards,
comparisons to Hugo _ which killed 49 and caused damage worth $8.4
billion _ are inevitable when talking hurricanes and one resident
scoffed at the idea that Floyd was a more powerful storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can be worse than Hugo,'' said Bobby Drainer, a
longtime Charleston-area resident who stopped by a local motel to
seek out a cup of coffee and said he was going to ride out the
storm in the city. ``If it was worse than that, I'd be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't taking chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got insurance on the house,'' one man declared, as he bought
a pack of smokes. ``I don't need to stick around here.''
</P>
<P>
   After avoiding the full wrath of Floyd, many of the 1.3 million
people in Florida who had been told to evacuate began returning to
their homes to find tree limbs and power lines down.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, at least 100,000 people in Florida remained
without power, which was expected to be restored to at least 75
percent of the customers by this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In Jacksonville, Mayor John Delaney urged returning residents to
be patient, even to stay put at inland shelters, hotels, and
friends' and relatives' homes until Thursday to give work crews
time to restore power.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Friday we expect everything to be back to normal in
Jacksonville, Florida,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush praised the citizens of his state for
heeding calls to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to know'' what's in store with a hurricane, he
said. ``You have to prepare and you have to evacuate.''

AS BANK SCANDAL WORSENS, INDONESIA ASSAILS THE AUDITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the shadow of violence in East Timor, the Indonesian
government has been shaken by a growing bank corruption scandal
that has put a $48 billion international economic rescue package in
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal appeared to worsen Wednesday when the nation's
central bank assailed auditors working at the request of the
International Monetary Fund, who have implicated the central bank
in a questionable deal surrounding Bank Bali, a troubled Indonesian
commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
   Sjahril Sabirin, the central bank's governor, called a report by
the auditors unfair and speculative. He threatened to sue the
auditing company, PricewaterhouseCoopers, if its conclusions were
proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian regulators commissioned Pricewaterhouse to audit the
Bank Bali case in August. The IMF, which is leading the economic
rescue effort, then demanded that the investigation be expanded to
include the central bank. At that point, Pricewaterhouse was
engaged as an agent for Indonesia's Supreme Audit Agency. After a
two-week inquiry using 20 auditors, Pricewaterhouse submitted its
findings, copies of which have since circulated to the press.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's protest is the latest fallout from a campaign
by the IMF and the World Bank to force Indonesia to eliminate
persistent corruption in its financial system.
</P>
<P>
   While the United Nations prepares to send in troops to protect
the people of East Timor from militias bitterly opposed to the
recent referendum vote for independence, the two lending agencies
are threatening the financial equivalent of armed intervention, a
strategy that bankers and economists warn could easily backfire.
``It's a dangerous ploy,'' said David Fernandez, an economist for
J.P. Morgan in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and the World Bank have already poured $10 billion into
Indonesia as part of the economic rescue package, assembled in
1997, early in the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When Indonesian soldiers joined in or countenanced the militia
violence, and the government initially refused to accept a peace
force, the two international lenders suspended discussions with
Jakarta on releasing an additional $2.3 billion in aid.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie has since bowed to foreign pressure to
allow U.N. troops into East Timor. But the talks on aid remain on
hold amid accusations that Habibie's party tried to siphon campaign
funds from the troubled Bank Bali.
</P>
<P>
   Two top Indonesian officials, Finance Minister Bambang Subianto
and the chairman of the Bank Restructuring Agency, Glenn Yusuf,
testified in the Indonesian lower house this week that they were
under pressure by one of the president's close associates to help
cover up the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Those accusations came on top of the Pricewaterhouse report.
According to press reports, the audit uncovered ``numerous
indicators of fraud, noncompliance, irregularity, misappropriation,
undue preferential treatment, concealment, bribery and corruption''
in the transaction between Bank Bali and a company connected to
Habibie's ruling party, Golkar.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank Bali scandal revolves around a 546 billion rupiah fee,
now about $67 million, that the struggling bank paid in June to
recover money owed it by other banks. Technically, Bank Bali did
not need to pay anything, since the banks had been taken over by
the Bank Restructuring Agency and their obligations were
guaranteed. But to hasten repayment, Bank Bali paid the money to
Era Giat Prima, a company controlled by Golkar's deputy treasurer.
Though Golkar denies ever having received the money, the
transaction has fueled accusations that it was meant to help
finance Habibie's campaign for election in November.
</P>
<P>
   The concern among lenders is that money designated to salvage
Indonesian banks will end up feeding a system of corruption that
regulators are trying to eradicate.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF already faces criticism over charges that aid to Russia
may have been diverted to officials and organized crime. And the
World Bank has held back $600 million in loans for Indonesian
poverty relief amid assertions that this money was being used to
sway voters in the June Parliament elections. ``We've got some
concerns about the Bank Bali case,'' an IMF spokesman in
Washington, Bill Murray, said. ``We're not going to make a
disbursement until those questions are resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Threatening to halt the flow of aid is a potent form of
persuasion. Indonesia's economy and government depend, day to day,
on the IMF-led rescue package. But economists say the IMF and World
Bank face a quandary: Having already handed over so much money to
the Indonesians, they have little choice but to keep plowing funds
into the country to make good on their investment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the same time, threatening to cut off the aid has rattled the
financial markets, raising the eventual cost of achieving a
favorable economic outcome in Indonesia, a nation of more than 200
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that aid might not be forthcoming sent Jakarta's stock
market down Wednesday, with the benchmark index losing 2.39
percent. The rupiah has fallen 15 percent since the Bank Bali
scandal broke, making it harder for Indonesia to repay
dollar-denominated loans.
</P>
<P>
   Political scandal is also keeping interest rates high, raising
the cost of borrowing for the government and widening the budget
deficit that the IMF will have to help fill. Jakarta now pays
investors an annual rate of 13 percent on one-month loans. The
United States, by contrast, pays 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and bankers also worry that the scandal has
irreversibly undermined the authority of the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency, which is in charge of administering the IMF
bank bailout that accounts for the bulk of the aid package. Before
the June elections, the Bank Restructuring Agency was winning
praise for what was seen as its tough stance against politically
connected borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank Bali has undermined just about all of that,'' said Bruce
Gale, regional manager in Singapore for the Political and Economic
Risk Consultancy of Hong Kong.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman declared a state
of emergency because of concern about major coastal flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, stepping into his
familiar role as the city's top crisis counselor, said he would
open 20 shelters Thursday _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   And on Long Island, the Suffolk County executive, Robert J.
Gaffney, urged residents of Fire Island to evacuate before wind and
rain made it impossible to escape by ferry.
</P>
<P>
   All over the region Wednesday, local officials and emergency
personnel scrambled to prepare for Hurricane Floyd, which, by the
time it passes through Thursday night, could have weakened to
Tropical Storm Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Wednesday night that it was still too early
to predict the path the storm would follow or what kind of wallop
it might pack, but they were preparing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service was predicting that Hurricane Floyd
would make landfall in the Carolinas and whip through the New York
metropolitan area by late Thursday, bringing up to 8 inches of
rain, winds of at least 40 mph, widespread coastal flooding and
major beach erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of a torrential downpour that crippled New York City's
transportation network three weeks ago, when just three inches of
rain fell in a short period, officials said Wednesday that they
were concerned about flooding.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Giuliani said that he would open 20
shelters Thursday at noon for people who might need to evacuate
low-lying areas.
</P>
<P>
   The shelters will be able to hold up to 70,000 people, although,
the mayor said, ``I highly doubt we will need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Reuter, president of New York City Transit, said storm
drains had been cleaned, flood-prone areas had been fortified with
sandbags and water pumps had been checked to ensure optimal
service. ``We plan to run service through the storm as long as we
are able,'' Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City schools are expected to close at 6 p.m. Thursday,
cancelling all evening programs and classes, Giuliani said. But it
was still not clear Wednesday night whether those cancellations
would extend into Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   And while city officials have distributed 50,000 brochures in
the last two days offering tips on handling the storm, Giuliani
also urged people to remove from yards and balconies any items _
such as gas-grill tanks and folding chairs _ that could become
projectiles in furious winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have things out on a balcony, if they have things on a
roof, if they have things even on their lawn or on the sidewalk
that could easily blow away, you know that, remove it, put it
inside, secure it and you'll be protecting yourself and protecting
others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the city will have a better idea later Thursday
what measures are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer we can get to the event and therefore have to take
action, the more intelligent the action is going to be,'' he said.
``So the best thing to do is for people to be warned.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Whitman declared a kind of pre-emptive state of
emergency, warning against the danger of coastal flooding coupled
with high winds. And she said she would decide early Thursday
morning whether to close the state's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Moore, New Jersey's chief coastal engineer, said his
inspectors spent most of Wednesday checking the state's 127 miles
of Atlantic coastline, particularly beachfronts in Cape May County.
At the moment, Moore said, he was taking a ``wait and see''
approach.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, Gaffney, the county executive, said he might
convert the voluntary evacuation of Fire Island into a mandatory
one, depending on the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the coastal city of Long Beach, officials had already checked
and fueled emergency vehicles, primed their power generators and
prepared to deal with fallen trees and windblown objects, said
Eugene C. Cammarato, the city's director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the city handed out 4,000 sandbags to people,
businesses and local institutions to wall off the rising tide,
which meteorologists said may climb to eight feet above normal.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since 1995, Cammarato said, that the city
had distributed sandbags.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The region's utility companies were busy Wednesday , too.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison has alerted its tree-trimming contractors to
be on standby, to help crews fix fallen power lines if necessary.
The utility said it plans to provide dry ice to customers to help
preserve food if the power fails.
</P>
<P>
   Keyspan, the holding company for the union of Brooklyn Union Gas
and the Long Island Lighting Co., has canceled training classes
Thursday at its Coney Island center because that area is prone to
floods, said Robert Mahoney, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   And Public Service Energy and Gas has recruited 50 workers from
Illinois Power to join its crews in New Jersey to assist with any
electrical failures, said Beth Derin, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   It may turn out that the bark of Floyd is worse than the bite,
that Floyd will turn out to be more a lesson in preparation than an
exercise in emergency management. Still, many area residents, like
the officials, were preparing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricane Floyd may still be a long way off, but everyone's
afraid of it. Nobody wants to see it hit,'' said Joe Matlaga, 36,
who was battening down the hatches of his 25-foot fishing boat, the
Phoenix, at the Covesail Marina in Sea Bright, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at the gathering gloom, then added: ``I went fishing
yesterday, because I figured I may not have a boat left after this
storm hits.''

EIGHT KILLED AT FORT WORTH CHURCH
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Raises death toll to eight) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A gunman walked into a sanctuary full of
young people at a southwest Fort Worth Baptist church Wednesday
evening and began firing, killing eight people, including himself,
officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred at Wedgwood Baptist Church about 7 p.m.
during a rally related to ``See You at The Pole,'' which attracted
hundreds of teen-agers from several area churches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the gunman entered the church, a number of teens thought it
was a skit, witnesses said. But members of Forty Days, the band
playing at the event, reportedly started ducking behind
amplifiers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports also indicated that a pipe bomb might have
exploded, sending shrapnel all the way into the balcony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's cartridges, shrapnel and empty cart boxes and blood
splattered all over the wall,'' said Lt. David Ellis, a police
spokesman at the scene. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was wearing a black leather jacket, bluejeans and a
bandanna when he walked into the church. A number of church members
said they did not recognize the man. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An off-duty police officer who lives near the church heard the
shots and called 911. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One man was reportedly taken into custody for questioning, but
police did not say why. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Dickens, 14, said she was sitting in the second pew in
the sanctuary when the gunman entered through the rear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just finished singing and we were praying when he came
in,'' Dickens said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As many as 400 people may have been in the sanctuary, witnesses
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a joke,'' Dickens said. ``We were singing,
and he told us to shut up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gunman then began shooting in different directions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was our pastor playing a joke on us. But then
Cassie got hit in the throat. She never got up,'' Dickens said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Rutledge and wife, Sundi, both 22, were in the fellowship
hall attending a prayer meeting when they heard a commotion
elsewhere in the church. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was hammering,'' said Kevin Rutledge, a
ministerial student at Dallas Baptist University. But minutes
later, he heard someone saying, ``I'm not joking, I'm shot.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The church's pastor, Al Meredith, was at home when the shooting
occurred and was notified when a reporter called him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A woman in the lobby of John Peter Smith Hospital, her clothes
splattered with blood, said her 17-year-old daughter, Heather
MacDonald, was saved by her best friend who was sitting next to
her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the gunman approached, the woman said, her daughter's friend
``laid on top of my daughter to protect her, and she got shot.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The injured teen-ager, believed to be 17, was not immediately
identified. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Brown said his wife, Jaynanne, was grazed in the head. His
wife was supposed to pick him up from work last night but instead
decided to take their children to a prayer meeting and concert at
the church, Brown said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said his wife was taken to Harris Methodist Hospital but that
his children were all right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank the Lord somebody protected her,'' Brown said. ``But
it's just a shame you can't go to church without something like
this happening.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Readin', writin' and rasslin'
 &HT;    By Frank W. Rabey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, N.C. _ Fame drives the dream: A young man swaggers
through swirling smoke into the big ring, a bikini-clad babe on
each arm. The crowd boos. The man destroys all who oppose him. The
crowd cheers. The bank account grows.
</P>
<P>
   But for the thousands of youngsters dreaming the dream, only a
small handful will make the big time. That's why the wrestling
industry has its version of the wakeup call _ the indy leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Many would-be wrestlers get a cold dose of reality in the
independent training centers that are cropping up all over. From
there, if you get a gig, it's in the local community center, where
crowds can be tiny. If you get paid, it may be little better than
squat. Broken bones are routine. The blood is very real.
</P>
<P>
   One such place is the Great American Wrestling Federation
Training Center in this small town just west of Asheville where
wrestlers named Pain and the World's Strongest Teenager dream of
the big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job to smack 'em with reality,'' says J.D. Sullivan,
37, GAWF's principal trainer and current heavyweight champion who
works by day at a furniture factory. ``Not every guy is gonna get a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the big schools don't do that,'' he adds. ``They just
take a young kid's money, beat the crap out of him for six months,
and if they like him, they keep him; and if they don't, they send
him on his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some small schools have their own problems, too, according to
GAWF owner Bill Hagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of little fly-by-night organizations have people in the
ring that are not ready to be there, and they get hurt,'' Hagan
says. ``We just don't let 'em in the ring if they're not trained.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't break into the big time anymore without wrestling
school, Sullivan says. A young wrestler may have years of
indy-circuit experience, but if he wants to get picked up by the
World Wrestling Federation, World Championship Wrestling or Extreme
Championship Wrestling, he's probably going to have to school with
one of the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Big-league wrestling schools like the WCW's Power Plant and
those of the WWF and ECW fuel big-league dreams, but have
big-league fees.
</P>
<P>
   Indy schools tend to be much cheaper, and maybe more honest.
Sullivan and Chris Wright, who runs a wrestling-training program in
Smithfield, N.C., tell their young wrestlers up front: This is a
hard road you're starting, bub.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I can guarantee,'' Wright says, ``is that you're
not going to come out of my school until you're ready. I'm not
going to put a kid out on the mat and let him hurt somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety is one thing you can train, but the biggest hurdle for
some neophyte wrestlers comes in putting on their game faces.
Believe it or not, they're shy. Sullivan says that the majority of
the guys he's trained over the years have battled shyness.
</P>
<P>
   Wright tries to offset those initial jitters by letting some of
his students go into the ring for the first time with masks on.
They get a cautious taste of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence takes time, but finding your own identity as a
wrestler is something else entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charisma's something you can't teach,'' Wright says. ``Some
kids have it, some kids don't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got several guys here now that you'd swear are eating
some type of drug or something,'' Sullivan laughs. ``They lose
their minds from time to time. They scare me.''
</P>
<P>
   The eternal teenager
</P>
<P>
   The World's Strongest Teenager turns 20 in October. What will we
call him then? He'll still be the World's Strongest Teenager.
</P>
<P>
   The title was won at a 1997 powerlifting event in Blackpool,
England. ``I'll hold it until somebody breaks it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of wrestling, even on the indy circuit, you can
call yourself anything you want, so long as you're winning.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he loses the title, he'll probably keep the name,
which has a certain poetry to it: Wrestling is where grown men
extend those testosterone-addled teen years indefinitely. They
dress up scarier than the rock group KISS. They shout in each
other's faces. They puff up their chests like fighting cocks,
pushing and pulling and whacking and slamming each other between
boastful sashays around the ring.
</P>
<P>
   The WST has another name, too: Steve Crowe. By that one, he
lives with his dad, a truck driver, in Statham, Ga., just outside
Athens. And he lays floor covering. ``Until the 'rasslin' takes
off,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like other young hopefuls, Crowe is ready to ditch the day job _
just as soon as he doesn't need it to finance his road trips. And
his training.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe trains in Athens, Ga., with ``Fast Track'' John Aaron and
``Outlaw'' Tommy James, affiliates of GAWF.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's instructors have taught him ``a lot about life,'' he
says. ``They taught me from becoming a boy into a man. They taught
me a lot about business, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He was trained hard, the old-school way. ``It's real rough, what
I had to go through. A lot of it's mental. You've got to be able to
block pain out. If you get hurt, you've got to keep on going.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe vividly recalls his first day at GAWF. It began with
running. Then there were squats _ 1,000, without stopping.
Push-ups. Sit-ups. Step-ups. A short break. And more running _
``constant, nonstop running.''
</P>
<P>
   Before wrapping up, he practiced some basic moves, which mainly
involved Crowe getting knocked around. GAWF owner Hagan calls it
``taking bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next few months, training sessions remained heavier on
physical conditioning than wrestling technique.
</P>
<P>
   Once that was over, Crowe would say to people he knew who'd been
through military boot camp, ``Man, you ain't did nothin' with what
I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, he's wrestling in venues throughout Georgia and
across the Carolinas. He loves it, especially the crowd. ``How they
react when you do a move,'' he explains. ``Or how they react when
you get hit. It's awesome, how it goes on like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Crowe, like thousands of other young wannabe ringmasters,
has his sights set far above the high school gymnasiums, bingo
halls and National Guard armories where most indy matches are
fought in front of anywhere from a handful of people to a couple
thousand. He has the dream bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to get up there with the big boys in a few more
months,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF. The WCW. The guys on TV.
</P>
<P>
   `He's a monster'
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling may be a youthful pursuit, but it isn't just a young
man's game: Old-school dynamo Ric Flair, 50, is still working, as
bottle-blond as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Wright's students are kids. But the average age of guys
in training at GAWF is between 25 and 28, Sullivan says.
</P>
<P>
   John Boyer is 33.
</P>
<P>
   Boyer lives in Swannanoa, just east of Asheville. At 6-foot-8,
he's almost as big as the mountains he lives in. ``In my wrestlin'
boots, they put me at 6-foot-10.''
</P>
<P>
   And he weighs 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a monster,'' Sullivan says.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the bigger guys can't take the rigors of training,
Hagan says. ``I've had some train for an hour and go get a drink of
water, and I've never seen them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyer is another story. He's determined and eager.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wrestle,'' he says, ``it'll be against two or three
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyer's past is as colorful as he's trying to make his future:
Bouncer. Bodyguard for the Rolling Stones. Bodyguard for a Saudi
prince.
</P>
<P>
   He left the Middle East for Asheville more than a year ago to be
with his wife, whom he'd met on a Stones tour stop in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most wrestlers are usually family people with kids and regular
jobs,'' Boyer says.
</P>
<P>
   In the ring, he's Pain. Out of the ring, he drives a milk truck
and owns his own ice cream truck.
</P>
<P>
   One of his customers told him about the GAWF school. ``I just
said, 'Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Boyer did a little investigating anyway, and liked what he
found out about Hagan and the GAWF organization. His training began
a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing they taught him, he says, ``was how not to hurt
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After being taught for his whole life that falling down was to
be avoided, now he was being told to throw his arms and feet up in
the air and land squarely on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your brain just doesn't want to let your body do that,''
Sullivan says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   On Boyer's first day, he and his brain disagreed, and he nearly
broke an ankle when he unconsciously tucked one of his legs in
during a staged fall.
</P>
<P>
   He's also learned to watch out for his opponent's safety. At his
size, if he hits somebody hard enough, he could kill them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to worry about that,'' he says. ``Safety's the
number one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the risks are part of the show. And Boyer really digs the
show. He's got the dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead and pay me a couple hundred thousand dollars a
year,'' he says, ``and you can beat me with a baseball bat, I don't
care.''

 &HT;    Grapevine: Eric Bischoff's rise and fall
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eric Bischoff's rise was also his fall.
</P>
<P>
   In making his organization the biggest in the sports
entertainment business, the WCW president, who was fired Sept. 10,
had hooked his star to Hulk Hogan and a new Monday night program
called ``Nitro.'' In the end, a weaker Hogan could no longer carry
WCW, and Bischoff was killed with his own weapon _ the rival Monday
show from the World Wrestling Federation that has destroyed WCW in
the ratings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bischoff was replaced by Bill Busch, formerly the senior vice
president for strategic planning. Busch, who's been with WCW for 10
years, now holds the title of executive vice president of WCW,
supervising all day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive spending on wrestling talent, coupled with falling
ratings, was the main reason for Bischoff's ouster. In trying to
combat WWF's raunchier and more creative offerings, WCW seemed to
get sloppy in the losing cause.
</P>
<P>
   Bischoff's ouster on Friday came two days before the ``Fall
Brawl'' pay-per-view, which suffered from the the same symptoms as
other WCW efforts lately. Slow ticket sales and weak story lines
were rumored. For years ``Fall Brawl'' has featured War Games, a
trio of concurrent tag-team matches, but not this year _ perhaps a
factor of a lack of story lines to support the action.
</P>
<P>
   The pinnacle for Bischoff and WCW began in 1996. Bischoff made a
bold move by signing two of the WWF's biggest stars _ Kevin Nash
and Scott Hall. Nash, Hall and Hogan formed a new organization _
the New World Order _ that battled the WCW stars. The new group was
a phenomenon and made ``Nitro'' and WCW pay-per-views the most
popular wrestling shows.
</P>
<P>
   After a year, the WWF hit back, signing some smaller WCW stars
and including more sex and violence in its story lines. The WWF
caught and passed the WCW in the Monday night television wars, then
grabbed a lot of the merchandising and pay-per-view money.
Eventually the WWF doubled its ratings.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bischoff got Hogan back in the ring, along with the
Hulkster character of the late '80s and early '90s. The results
were less than spectacular. Recent problems, including wrestlers
leaving the WCW fold and high-priced wrestlers who weren't
wrestling (such as Bret Hart, Hall and Nash), spelled the end for
Bischoff.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of his tenuous situation were reflected in a story line
that brought Bischoff into the ring this winter. According to the
story line, he lost control of the WCW to Ric Flair and had been
scheming to regain the reins. Reality has intruded, and Bischoff's
fate is sealed, both in the ring and in reality.
</P>
<P>
   So where does WCW go now? Expect a lot of changes.
</P>
<P>
   In the ring, Sunday night's heel turn of Sting, the WCW's
constant face, was a dramatic and popular move. The return of Bret
Hart to the ring to join Hulk Hogan is also interesting.
</P>
<P>
   For Busch's part, he's 35 with a finance degree from Louisiana
State University. He reportedly has a reputation for the bottom
line.

 &HT;    Terms in the wrestling world: Blading
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Act of a wrestler cutting himself with a sharp object,
usually a part of a razor blade, in order to bleed. The act is
usually done when the wrestler is face down and moves his hands to
his forehead. The wrestler will pull the blade from his trunks or
wrist band and open the cut. Former wrestlers like Dusty Rhodes and
Wahoo McDaniel did it so much that they developed scar tissue on
their foreheads.

CHARTRAND MADE IMPACT IN EXHIBITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When they are growing up and dreaming of
reaching the NHL, players don't dream of such unglamorous roles as
checking forward or defensive specialist.
</P>
<P>
   But as he sized up his chances of reaching the big-time, Brad
Chartrand realized he wasn't going to fool anyone into thinking he
was the next Jaromir Jagr, Pavel Bure or Paul Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 24-year-old Chartrand is trying to make the Los
Angeles Kings as center on the team's third line, the ``stopper''
unit, to borrow the terminology used by coach Andy Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Chartrand was more than a defensive specialist,
assisting on Garry Galley's overtime goal as the Kings beat the
Colorado Avalanche 3-2 before an announced crowd of 7,216 at the
Forum. The Kings improved to 2-0 in the exhibition season and
dropped the Avalanche to 0-2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, I look at myself as an underdog,'' Chartrand
said when asked to evaluate his chances of winning a spot on the
Kings' opening-night roster. ``At the same time, I think I've shown
the coaching staff that, `Wow, this kid is for real.' All you're
looking for is an opportunity and to try to seize the moment, and I
don't want to give them a reason to send me down.''
</P>
<P>
   The assist provided one more reason for the Kings to let
Chartrand stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good as a player,'' Chartrand said of the opportunity
he is getting to try to win a spot. ``It doesn't come without hard
work. That's what I try to stress in my game _ work ethic and
commitment to defense. When you do that, you get rewarded. I think
I earned the chance to be out there (in overtime).''
</P>
<P>
   Murray is well aware of Chartrand's abilities. Chartrand played
for Murray's Canadian national teams for two seasons, captaining
the squad in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Chartrand said he's getting a much better chance to make the
Kings' roster than he got a year ago when he was in Toronto's camp.
On Murray's recommendation, the Kings signed him as a free agent
this summer after he spent last season with the Maple Leafs'
American Hockey League affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule helps:With the teams testing the NHL's new 4-on-4
overtime rule, Galley scored the game-winner with five seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely opens up the ice,'' Galley said of the new rule.
``The league wants to see more wins and to make the game more
exciting for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rule, if the game had been played in the regular
season, the Kings would have gotten two points in the standings,
the Avalanche one for a regulation tie.
</P>
<P>
   __ Roster trims: The Kings assigned defensemen Trevor Gillies,
Richard Seeley and Kevin Bolibruck and right wing Kevin Baker to
their Lowell affiliate in the American Hockey League and sent left
wing Kip Brennan back to his junior team in the Ontario Hockey
League.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The church shootings in Fort Worth, Texas, came as area youths
gathered to culminate local activities that were part of the
nationwide prayer initiative called See You at the Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The annual student-led prayer meeting was first conducted in
1990 by a group of students in Burleson, a Fort Worth suburb. Since
then, interest in the event has increased to an estimated 3 million
students worldwide, youth ministry organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a national effort to establish prayer groups on
public secondary school campuses, a North Texas network of church
youth leaders began meeting to coordinate their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   This year, students from church youth groups bolstered fledging
school Christian clubs and applied for permission to start Bible
studies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to North Texas efforts, national networks of youth
ministers have been encouraging students to begin Bible study
groups, said Doug Clark, director of field ministries for the
National Network of Youth Ministries in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the network started the Challenge 2000 Alliance, made
up of about 60 denominations and national youth ministries
dedicated to encouraging students to start campus Christian groups.
</P>
<P>
   Campus prayer groups have been officially allowed in schools
since 1984, when Congress approved the Equal Access Act. The
federal law was upheld in 1990 by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   It requires that students lead the groups and prohibits school
officials from sanctioning or discouraging their activities, said
Steven Green, general counsel for Americans United for Separation
of Church and State, a national nonprofit group with headquarters
in Washington, D.C.

 &HT;    Floyd brushes by Florida
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Having spared Florida the full force of its
fury, Hurricane Floyd tore into the Carolinas early today, its
winds weakened but its destructive potential still formidable.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation from Floyd's path became the largest in peacetime
in U.S. history. Some 3.5 million people in four states have fled
the storm that now is on track for landfall between Charleston,
S.C. and Wilmington. At 10 p.m., the storm was about 120 miles
southwest of the line between the states and blowing at 115 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters warned that Floyd's huge area of influence, roughly
the size of Texas, could inflict damage far into the interior and
cause problems over a broad region. Washington, D.C., Mayor Anthony
Williams ordered public schools there closed because major flooding
is expected from the hurricane's outer bands. The rain could reach
into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Floridians spent Wednesday counting their blessings and
recalling their hurricane experience for what did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression really is how fortunate we were as a state to
have had Floyd brush by us but not really impact us,'' Gov. Jeb
Bush said. ``By and large, it was pretty remarkable how close we
got to having serious, serious property damage and perhaps loss of
life. And yet it looks as though we escaped quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   The toll in Palm Beach County and along the Treasure Coast was
limited mostly to uprooted trees, power blackouts, beach erosion
and a half-dozen sunken sailboats off Peanut Island in Riviera
Beach. A wind gust on Hutchinson Island in Martin County was
clocked at 80 mph as Floyd scurried by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people don't think they've lived through a hurricane,''
said John Bonde, administrator of the Indian Trail Improvement
District in The Acreage. ``We've gotten afternoon storms worse than
this. Don't become complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd sideswiped the northern Florida coast Wednesday. A weather
buoy more than 20 miles off Cape Canaveral measured a 54-foot wave,
but Cape Kennedy NASA's space compound, with its four shuttles, was
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred miles off the Jacksonville coast, a tugboat sank
in 30-foot seas. Its eight crew members were rescued by the Coast
Guard and Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The thrashing ocean swallowed about 100 feet of the century-old
Daytona Beach pier and sheared off the end of the Jacksonville
Beach pier.
</P>
<P>
   Floridians prepared for their encounter with Floyd as they had
never done before. The Home Depot said it shipped 580,000 pieces of
plywood to Florida, 25 times the usual amount, on Monday and
Tuesday. Laid end-to-end, that's enough sheets to run from West
Palm Beach to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Along Interstate 10, rest stops became makeshift shelters where
motorists spent the night in their cars. The Salvation Army
provided breakfast to about 1,500 people at rest stops from
Tallahassee through the Panhandle. Traffic backed up 30 miles or
more as people headed inland from the east coast. One motorist
reported taking five hours for what usually is a 30-minute drive
across Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel rooms and many shelters were packed, leaving some people
with hours-long searching for a safe place.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 15-year-old son, Jebbie, told his father it took him
eight hours to get from Jacksonville Beach, where he attends
private school, to Tallahassee. That's about twice as long as
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave people enough advance notice and their lives were not
in jeopardy,'' Jeb Bush said. ``That's the most important thing.
They evacuated. There were lines. It took a while, but people got
out of harm's way. That's the ultimate objective here.''
</P>
<P>
   No fatalities or injuries have been attributed to Floyd in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling evidence of Floyd's power came from the
Bahamas where hundreds of wooden homes lost their roofs and dozens
of small boats were thrown onto the shore. Electricity and
telephones remained down throughout the 700-mile long archipelago
Wednesday. Despite the direct hit, no deaths there have been
confirmed, though one man is reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's winds reached 150 mph on Abaco, Eleuthera, San Salvador
and Cat Islands, where damage was not yet assessed but feared
extensive.
</P>
<P>
   The mass exodus from the Carolinas left eerie scenes behind it
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 26 into Charleston was dotted with empty vehicles,
cars that died or ran out of gas waiting to inch closer to safety
the night before.
</P>
<P>
   On talk radio, evacuees told of three-hour trips that took 14
hours instead. Frustrated travelers walked their dogs in the
median.
</P>
<P>
   Mayors from across the coast vented as well, angered that it
took so long for South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges to turn the
interstate into a one-way exit.
</P>
<P>
   The last time South Carolina took a direct hit from a major
hurricane was almost exactly 10 years ago, when Hugo struck near
Charleston with 135 mph winds. The storm killed 29 people and
caused $5.9 billion in damage, the most costly hurricane to hit the
U.S. mainland until Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Florida and Georgia at this point feel like
they've dodged a real bullet,'' said North Carolina's Public Safety
Secretary Richard Moore. ``This thing is not going to miss us.''
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle Beach, a usually bustling resort, was a virtual ghost
town as people fled or stayed indoors, and highways were jammed
around Wilmington. In both Carolinas, many hurricane-hardened
people who rode out earlier storms left this time.
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle Beach authorities imposed a 3 p.m. curfew and turned off
the water supply. The hospital sent its patients inland but kept a
doctor and three nurses on emergency duty.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina officials banned price gouging on essential
items, threatening fines up to $100 or 30 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In Beaufort County, at South Carolina's southern tip, an
estimated 90 percent of its nearly 120,000 residents heeded the
call to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tomb out here now,'' said Bud Boyne, a county
emergency spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina authorities issued evacuation orders for the
barrier islands outside Wilmington and for the Outer Banks, the
fragile line of islands that were battered by a lingering Hurricane
Dennis last week.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, hurrying back from New Zealand to deal with
the hurricane, pre-emptively declared federal disaster areas in
South Carolina and North Carolina. He had issued similar
declarations Tuesday for Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done everything we know to do,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney World remained closed Wednesday, the second day of
its first weather-related shutdown in its 28-year history. But
SeaWorld reopened and scheduled a ``Farewell to Floyd'' fireworks
show.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville, a sprawling city of 1 million, looked deserted
Wednesday morning, with funnel clouds visible and dark clouds
circling overhead. Three downtown bridges across the St. Johns
River were closed after a police car flipped over on one of them.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA Director James Lee Witt expected the unprecedented
evacuation to grow as the storm turns inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot think of another evacuation that's on the scale of
this one, and as it moves up the coast there's going to be more
people displaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's early strength had raised fears of a repeat of Hurricane
Andrew, which smashed into South Florida with 145 mph winds,
killing 26 people and causing an estimated $25 billion in damage.

SERENA WILLIAMS HAS TIE TO A LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL AMDUR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before she won the U.S. Open on Sunday, Serena Williams had
a connection to former tennis great Althea Gibson, the only other
African-American woman ever to win a Grand Slam singles title.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the 17-year-old Williams faxed Gibson a
letter with a list of questions for a school project.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very curious about Althea,'' said Fran Gray, Gibson's
spokeswoman, on Wednesday, as she fielded calls to discuss Gibson's
reaction to Williams' accomplishment. ``Serena has been kind of
curious and sought out common links with Althea. That gave us a
good feeling about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Venus Williams, Serena's older sister, recalled that
Gibson had been the ``back cover'' of a newsletter the girls had
published in connection with ``Black History Month'' earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the Williams sisters at the U.S. Open and the
semifinal showing of Alexandra Stevenson at Wimbledon earlier in
the summer have rekindled interest in Gibson, who won five Grand
Slam titles during her career before turning professional.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of Gibson appeared with American Express ads during this
year's Open, a fund-raiser in August for the Althea Gibson
Foundation was a financial success, and the first recipient of a
scholarship from the foundation was awarded this fall to Timi
Solomon, a black member of the tennis team at Fairleigh Dickinson
University.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, who lives in East Orange, N.J., recently celebrated her
72nd birthday, is alert, listens to music, watches television, is a
voracious reader and is paying attention to the new wave of
American women, who will play Russia in the Federation Cup final
this weekend in Palo Alto, Calif. But after a stroke several years
ago, she has withdrawn publicly and prefers to communicate through
her foundation and her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``She followed what happened at the Open,'' Gray said of the
success of Venus and Serena Williams, who are now third and fourth,
respectively, in the tour rankings and pocketed $1.29 million from
the Open, including the women's doubles title. ``She's happy about
how well they did. It's kind of a relief, something we all wanted
to see, and we're hopeful that Serena will continue on.''
</P>
<P>
   The power-hitting style of the Williams sisters and Stevenson
was a trademark of Gibson when she became the first black to win
Wimbledon and U.S. singles titles (1957 and '58) after taking the
French championships in 1956. Gray said Jeanne Moutoussamy Ashe,
the widow of Arthur Ashe, phoned her and said that American Express
was interested in Gibson as part of an advertising campaign for the
Open that included past and present players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent me the original picture to approve,'' Gray said.
``The money from the ads was given to the Althea Gibson
Foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, a co-founder of the foundation, said American Express,
Coca Cola, Johnson and Johnson, Ethicon, Public Service Electric &AMP;
Gas, PNC Bank, Florida A&AMP;M University, Summit Bank and the U.S.
Tennis Association were major contributors to the Gibson
fund-raiser, which grossed $83,000.
</P>
<P>
   Besides scholarships, the foundation is involved with urban
tennis and golf programs and is developing a mentoring program for
former athletes to link up with urban youth. &QL;

TRINIDADS, FATHER AND SON, PREPARE FOR DE LA HOYA BOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Felix Trinidad Jr. has been here for almost two
weeks, training for his welterweight showdown against Oscar De La
Hoya on Saturday night. He has not been seduced by neon lights or
tempted by casinos. Don Felix Trinidad, his father and trainer, has
made sure there are no distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad spends his time either in the gym, working out in
private, or in his hotel suite, which has a pool table,
video-arcade games and two large-screen televisions. The elder
Trinidad says his son's priority is training, not giving
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's scared,'' said Trinidad's promoter, Don King, of Don
Felix. ``Tito is his whole life and future in boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere here has the electric charge of a heavyweight
championship bout. With TVKO projecting close to a million buys,
and the Mandalay Bay Casino's 12,000-seat arena sold out (a $14
million gate), it could be the richest nonheavyweight championship
bout in history. Each fighter is guaranteed to draw the largest
paycheck of his career. Trinidad (35-0), the IBF champion, will
earn $8.5 million and De La Hoya (31-0), the WBC champion, $15
million.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, at the final news conference before the bout,
Trinidad appeared loose and confident. He plans to knock De La Hoya
out. ``We feel he is over-popularized,'' Trinidad said. ``I'm going
to put him at the level we feel he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Felix does not share his son's bravado, though he predicts a
sixth- round knockout over De La Hoya. He is wary of those not in
his inner circle. As Trinidad faced reporters, Don Felix sat
nearby, along with an interpreter. Occasionally, when questions
were asked of Trinidad his father would whisper answers that his
son would repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the bout nears, De La Hoya paranoia has creeped into the
Trinidad camp. Concerned about the possibility of De La Hoya spies,
Don Felix has closed all of Trinidad's workouts. Trinidad's
training center is in a resort 45 miles from here. His workouts
took place in an open tent. But it was several yards from public
view.
</P>
<P>
   The media-savvy De La Hoya, who fights here so often that it
could be considered a hometown fight, is accustomed to the madness.
Trinidad, who loves nothing more than spending time with his family
and raising horses at his home in Cupey Alto, Puerto Rico, is not
used to the crush. And Don Felix doesn't want to use this occasion
to learn whether Trinidad will like it.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest fight of Trinidad's career, the elder Trinidad is
merely doing what he thinks is best for his son. But as a trainer
and manager, is he doing what is best for his fighter? No one will
know until fight night. Typically, father and son relationships in
boxing are full of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday afternoon, De La Hoya talked about his
strained relationship with his father, Joel. De La Hoya said he had
always sought the approval of his father in the ring, but his
father had never given it to him. During his three months of
training at Big Bear, De La Hoya was visited three times by his
father and each time Joel showed up, De La Hoya cringed.
</P>
<P>
   Joel De La Hoya did praise his son's workouts, telling the
trainer Robert Alcazar that it is the best shape he has ever seen
his son in. ``I read it in the newspaper,'' De La Hoya said. ``I
want to hear it from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad says he doesn't have problems getting approval from his
father and that their personal and working relationship is fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is the first one to teach me to throw my first
punch, and the second and the third and every punch that I am
throwing today,'' Trinidad said. ``As my father, my manager and my
trainer, he has to be with me. After Sept. 18 we will celebrate
together.''
</P>
<P>
   While De La Hoya will carry the weight of expectations from his
promoter, Bob Arum, and his many sponsors, Trinidad will be
carrying the weight of all of Puerto Rico. Parishioners have been
asked to light candles at their churches for him on fight night. In
four of Puerto Rico's 32 prisons, 1,600 inmates will watch the
fight on pay-per-view television as a reward for good behavior.
Baseball games in a season-ending tournament have been postponed
because they conflict with fight night.
</P>
<P>
   A victory over De La Hoya could catapult Trinidad into the
position of being more popular than other former Puerto Rican
champions like Wilfredo Gomez and Wilfredo Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pressure,'' Trinidad said of the weight he bears heading
into the ring on Saturday night. ``It makes me more happy to be
representing all of Puerto Rico.''

BASEBALL CENTRALIZES UNDER COMMISSIONER AT EXPENSE OF LEAGUE
PRESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ From Morgan Bulkeley in 1876 to Leonard
Coleman in 1999, from Ban Johnson in 1901 to Gene Budig in 1999,
the National and American Leagues have had presidents who operated
offices separate and apart from one another. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   Major league club owners voted unanimously Wednesday to abandon
the traditional arrangement and consolidate all operating functions
in the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an historic moment that many have felt was long
overdue,'' said commissioner Bud Selig, who spearheaded the move to
consolidate administrative matters such as umpiring, scheduling and
discipline. At the same time, Selig stressed that the leagues would
remain separate _ and competitive _ on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which apparently generated little or no opposition
among owners but drew a negative vote in the executive council from
Coleman, was the primary piece of business that the owners
conducted, but also among the least controversial.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, meeting near the Hall of Fame at the Otesaga Hotel,
declined to approve the sale of the Oakland Athletics and the
Kansas City Royals, causing concern about the future of both
franchises. They took no vote on the sale of the Montreal Expos,
who asked for a delay, but they approved the $67 million transfer
of the controlling ownership shares of the Cincinnati Reds from the
controversial Marge Schott to Carl Lindner, a billionaire
Cincinnati businessman (Chiquita bananas), who has been a limited
partner.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the act of centralization, Selig said that Budig
has been offered the role of senior vice president for educational
and government affairs in baseball and confirmed that Coleman was
resigning as the National League president after the season. But,
Selig added, Coleman will serve as senior adviser to the
commissioner and president of Major League Baseball charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want to serve in a ceremonial post or be a
figurehead,'' Coleman said. Earning a $650,000 salary in his sixth
year as National League president, Coleman, who is black, has been
the most outspoken advocate within baseball for the hiring of
members of minorities in decision-making positions. ``I intend to
continue to trumpet that cause,'' said Coleman, who could wind up
in Washington if George W. Bush becomes president.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of the functions that heretofore have been handled
by the league presidents will have to be negotiated with baseball's
players and umpires unions. Placing the umpires under the
supervision of the commissioner's office is expected to be an issue
in the upcoming negotiations for a new labor agreement to replace
the current one, which expires Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires' lawyer, Richie Phillips, maintains the move
constitutes a change in terms and working conditions.
Centralization was one of the issues that triggered the recent
dispute that led to the loss of jobs for 22 umpires.
</P>
<P>
   The players' labor representatives have said a change in meting
out disciplinary measures for players also must be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about eliminating redundancy and being more
efficient in the league office,'' Jerry Colangelo, managing partner
of the Arizona Diamondbacks, said. ``Baseball's unique with two
leagues. I know there's tradition involved, but I don't think this
takes anything away from it. You maintain the integrity of two
leagues. What we're talking about is how everything is operated in
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, executive vice president for baseball operations
in the commissioner's office, is expected to oversee much of the
consolidation. He most likely will have umpiring supervisors
working under him, and baseball very likely will name someone to be
the official who determines discipline for on-field personnel, as
other leagues have.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, at a news conference following the 2 1-2 hour meeting,
ticked off ways in which the leagues will remain separate and
retain their identities: the All-Star Game, the World Series,
league records, the debate among fans over which league is better.
The American League's designated hitter will not be affected by
Wednesday's change.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, Selig said, ``has had to re-evaluate how it operates
its business off the field.'' Separate functions, he added, have
``become an encumbrance that inhibits sound and timely decisions.''

POLICY ON PRESCRIPTION ORDERS AT WAL-MART DRAWS PRAISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that was praised by a family planning organization,
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. recently instructed its pharmacists to fill
all prescriptions or refer customers to another store if they had
an objection about dispensing a drug.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores, one of the nation's leading sellers of
prescription drugs, was criticized by Planned Parenthood in May for
not carrying Preven, a high-dose birth control medication to
prevent pregnancy up to 72 hours after unprotected sex. It was
approved for sale in the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Wal-Mart still refuses to sell Preven, Planned
Parenthood was encouraged by the company's missive to its
pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this, the pharmacists won't unload his or her religious
beliefs on their customers,'' said Alexander Sanger, president of
Planned Parenthood of New York City. ``When customers come in to
get emergency contraceptives, either the pharmacy must fill it or
refer them to another store, even if it's to a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wal-Mart stressing compliance from its pharmacists,
proponents of emergency contraception hope that the company will
reconsider its decision not to carry Preven and will eventually
carry a recently approved similar product called Plan B.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that Wal-Mart will stock Preven and Plan B,'' said
Sanger. ``We hope this policy may make them re-evaluate their
business decision. Hopefully, we won't have to fight this battle
every time a contraceptive comes on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Planned Parenthood was encouraged by Wal-Mart's
pharmacy policy, the company expressed confusion about the
attention it was getting. Jessica Moser, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman,
said Wednesday that the company's pharmacists had operated under
that policy for several years and that it was reaffirmed as part of
a routine employee meeting in August. Wal-Mart's pharmacy business
trails only CVS, Walgreen, Eckerd and Rite Aid, according to Drug
Store News.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moser also noted that doctors sometimes prescribed birth
control pills at higher doses that may work as emergency
contraceptives and that Wal-Mart pharmacists had always filled
those prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to figure out what the news is here,'' Ms.
Moser said. ``As far as we're concerned, there wasn't any.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has yet to make a decision on whether to carry Plan B,
Ms. Moser said.

FEARS OF PROFIT SLOWDOWN STIR MAYTAG TO REVAMPING
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Iowa)  (nk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just days after its shares plummeted on fears of a profit
slowdown, the Maytag Corp. said it would realign its divisions,
sharply cut costs and try to shore up flagging sales of its
discount appliances.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of spectacular growth, Maytag executives say
the company is now grappling with eroding market share for its
discount products, such as the Magic Chef refrigerator, and a
slowdown in the sales of its new Gemini ovens, despite evidence
that the economy remains healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd D. Ward, the chairman and chief executive of Maytag, said
in a conference call Wednesday with Wall Street analysts that the
company would cut more than $100 million in costs over the next two
years, develop an electronic commerce strategy, and expand into
international markets, where it has just a small presence now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The realignment will make us faster, smarter and better at
innovation,'' Ward said, referring to a plan to create four
divisions in the hopes of strengthening the company's marketing and
brand strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Maytag rose 43.75 cents, to $38.375, on the New York
Stock Exchange after dropping more than 40 percent in the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said that although the company seemed to be
addressing its problems, company executives offered few specifics
and did not fully explain how they planned to turn around a
business whose growth is slowing at a time when competitors like
Whirlpool are gaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are confused. There's a lot of uncertainty out
there,'' said Justin Maurer, an analyst at McDonald Investments.
``I think we all have to get a sense of what this redesigned end of
the strategy is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives come just days after Maytag, which is based in
Newton, Iowa, surprised Wall Street by warning that third- and
fourth-quarter profits would be flat from a year ago, disappointing
analysts who had expected another season of double digit profits.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn was largely attributed to eroding market share in
the company's sale of low-end or discount ovens, washing machines
and refrigerators, an area Maytag had once all but ignored in favor
of upgrading its more sophisticated, higher-priced products. Now,
the company says it needs to recapture market share in the low-end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing an erosion of the value brands and quite frankly
at a slightly increased pace,'' Ward said. ``But we will not
concede value brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Maytag made the announcement last Friday, its stock
had plunged in heavy trading, suggesting that some large investors
had received advance notice of the company's downturn, though the
company strongly denies that anyone was tipped off. Few insiders at
Maytag have sold stock in recent months, though Leonard A. Hadley,
the former chief executive who recently stepped down, sold about
20,000 shares, or about 10 percent of his holdings, worth $1.7
million in April, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Wall
Street analysts, who had been assured on Sept. 9 that everything
was fine, were shocked to learn early Friday of the company's
turnabout. Several analysts said that the company failed to give
them adequate or timely notice, but Ward said Wednesday that his
first obligation was to the company.
</P>
<P>
   When an analyst asked Ward about the timing of the announcement,
he replied: ``Our job is not to report, but to try and mitigate
that _ not to give guidance to analysts.''
</P>
<P>
   Maytag has also come under fire from some analysts who have
questioned its recent accounting practices. Nicholas P. Heymann, an
analyst at Prudential and a former auditor, issued a report this
week that said that Maytag executives appear to have overstated
their sales projections and understated overhead costs in the first
half of the year. The result was that earnings in the first half of
the year appeared more robust, while second half of the year
adjustments appear to have hurt profits.
</P>
<P>
   Ward did not fully address accounting issues Wednesday, but said
the company's financial practices were sound. ``I am confident with
our internal controls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To regain its footing, Ward said that Maytag would become a
leaner operation, cutting about $100 million in costs, and then
re-investing much of that money in ``innovative'' products and
strategies. He said the company would also create a more flexible
system so that inventory doesn't build up the way it has recently.

REPLAY NETWORKS TO APPOINT EX-CBS PROGRAMMER AS CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials at Replay Networks Inc., a company offering a new
video recording device that some analysts believe will
revolutionize the way viewers watch television, said it would name
Kim LeMasters, a former chief programmer for CBS, as its chairman
and chief executive Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Replay, of Palo Alto, Calif., is one of two companies offering
the device; the other is Tivo Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif. The
appointment of LeMasters, perhaps best known for scheduling
``Murphy Brown'' on CBS, underscores how closely the two new
companies are associating themselves with long-established entities
in the TV industry.
</P>
<P>
   Replay executive vice president Layne Britton said, ``The hiring
of Kim reflects our continuing evolution into becoming a
broadcasting company that will support existing broadcasters and
media companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Replay and Tivo have created electronic recorders not unlike
videocassette recorders except that they use digital compression
and videodiscs to create much greater capacity and flexibility in
recording and watching television shows.
</P>
<P>
   With these devices, called personal video recorders, viewers can
store many hours of programs, delivered overnight to programming
guides on the machines, making it possible to create personal menus
of shows _ for example, mysteries, ``Seinfeld'' reruns, old war
movies.
</P>
<P>
   The machines also make it possible to pause and rewind programs
that are being broadcast live, and to replay part of a show while
the rest of it is still being recorded.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several months, Replay and Tivo have secured
partnerships with companies that own networks and production
studios. Tivo has made deals with CBS, NBC, Discovery Networks and
News Corp.; last week, it said that Sony Corp. of America will
manufacture its machines. Sony also made clear its intention to use
the Tivo platform to promote its movies and television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Replay has made partnership deals with Time Warner, Walt Disney,
NBC, Showtime Networks and Liberty Media, among others. Kevin
Bohren, a member of Replay's board, said, ``As we have added these
organizations as investors, we have come to realize we need a
different set of skills, more than just hardware skills. We have to
be able to serve the entertainment community. The bottom line is
we're in the entertainment business.''
</P>
<P>
   Replay and Tivo have assured partners like the networks that
they do not intend to steal advertisers or make it easy to
eliminate commercials from recordings, though both devices can
accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior television executives who have used the machines
have said that if they achieve significant penetration in
households, they could drastically alter the way TV is watched
because of the increased freedom to watch favored shows whenever a
viewer wants to instead of merely when a network broadcasts them.
</P>
<P>
   Replay turned to LeMasters, Bohren said, because of his
programming background, his relationships with many entertainment
companies, and what Bohren called ``his vision for what we might be
able to do in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   LeMasters said he would work closely with Replay's
entertainment-industry investors to devise schedule formats for
Replay that ``best serve the needs of our partners.''
</P>
<P>
   LeMasters said his first priority would be ``getting the machine
into the hands of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that Replay had selected him based on his
experience in TV programming. ``Down the line there are some
exciting possibilities from programming formats that we maybe could
do without displacing any of our partners.''
</P>
<P>
   LeMasters worked as CBS' chief programmer at a low point for
that network, taking the job just as many hit shows began to
collapse. The network was third in the ratings when he was forced
out in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling those days, LeMasters said, ``One other thing I think
I bring to this job: After the gunfire I was under at CBS, it'll be
real hard to panic me.''
</P>
<P>
   After he left CBS, LeMasters formed his own production company.
In 1992, he took a job as president of Stephen J. Cannell
Productions, a TV production company. After that company was sold
in 1995 to New World Television, he pursued a goal of becoming a
writer himself, taking charge of the USA Network cable drama series
``Silk Stalkings,'' on which he served as both executive producer
and head writer.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long before there ever was a television show called
``Sex and the City,'' Nicole Miller seemed to exist for the woman
who had written the script for it in her head.
</P>
<P>
   Such a woman may never have come into contact with an
heirloom-tomato salad or a man who owned half of Anguilla, but she
dreamed of the life. In a glaring I-won't-let-you-forget-me Miller
print, perhaps she would have a shot at attaining it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller showed her spring collection on Tuesday, hours before
Cynthia Rowley, whose clothes have always been intended for a far
less manipulative approach to love and mating. At the end of the
day, though, there seemed to be little difference in the kind of
life styles both women were now serving up.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s-inspired silk print and ruffled dresses, the white
daisy organza blouses, the knee-length beaded skirts _ nearly
everything that Ms. Miller sent down her runway would not have
seemed out of place later, in the ballroom of the New Yorker Hotel,
where Ms. Rowley unveiled her line.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller's clothes now seem to be meant for dates that end
long before breakfast. They are clothes without a big agenda, just
a stitch or two short of being mundane.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rowley, on the other hand, generally seems incapable of the
mundane. She trotted out a pair of white-haired ballroom dancers
before she got down to the business of sending out models in floral
embroidered snakeskin dresses, printed cashmere sweaters, pajama
pants and for the finale, little dresses that appeared to be
lighted from the inside by Christmas lights. In fact, they were
model-train lights, and Ms. Rowley intends to sell these garments
despite the problem of overheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I was thinking,'' she joked after the show.
Nothing ever seems to shake Ms. Rowley's love of romance. It's
almost disorienting to attend one of her shows knowing that outside
there are movies with titles like ``Love Stinks'' playing.
</P>
<P>
   An appreciation for things innocent would certainly have been
welcome at the Girls Rule show, which featured the work of five
different labels, all aimed at teen-agers. One outfit consisted of
a tiger-print miniskirt over tight crocheted pants with a
midriff-bearing top.
</P>
<P>
   It was called Heavenly Harlot, presumably not something one
would put on for a Vassar interview. More significantly, it's
unlike anything that would even be seen on ``Dawson's Creek,'' the
mirror of teen-age life.
</P>
<P>
   The collection had a fair number of actual teen-agers attending,
and one didn't know what to make of the fact that in the front row
a small child, years away from getting into ``Cruel Intentions,''
kept whispering ``I like it'' every time something in parachute
cloth went by. Shouldn't she have been wondering why nothing had a
Furby on it?
</P>
<P>
   The Jeffrey Lee show seemed absent of such style mavens. Held in
a small room at St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue, it didn't
attract the fashion editors' sorority. Not a pony-skin handbag or
Jimmy Cho shoe was in sight. In a sense those who missed, missed
out.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is not a New Yorker; he lives in Dallas, so perhaps he
hasn't mastered the art of getting plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   He's mastered other things though. He turned out rough,
full-length wool skirts, all in white and beige. He used belts and
armbands of blond wood. At times the models looked as though they
were standing inside a sake box, but Lee did manage to present a
collection that didn't resemble anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   There was a stark beauty to his clothes that transcended the use
of rather unusual accessories. Would a woman, even an artist, ever
go to dinner in a strapless dress with a corset and wooden side
pockets? Probably not, but she'd be memorable.

VOLS' LEWIS IS BACK AND READY FOR GATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Tee Martin doesn't remember his teammate
Jamal Lewis' standing on the Fiesta Bowl sideline last January as
the pink skies of Arizona turned black. He doesn't remember
uttering a word to him in the bowels of Sun Devil Stadium in the
jubilant hours after his team captured a national title.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the Tennessee quarterback, is embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled and confessed the other day that he never gave a
thought to Lewis on the night the Volunteers beat Florida State,
23-16, to cap a perfect 13-0 season. ``Now I think about him all
the time,'' Martin said sheepishly. ``I hear him in the huddle. I
watch him blow through holes. It's real comfortable having him back
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, Tennessee's 6-foot, 225-pound running back, shrugs off
the Fiesta Bowl oversight. Yes, he was there _ in street clothes,
because he had torn the lateral collateral ligament in his right
knee in the fourth game of the Vols' championship season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long, boring, tiresome,'' is how Lewis remembers his spring
and summer of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty good start,'' he said recently, referring to
his freshman season in 1997, in which he gained 1,364 yards and
averaged 5.9 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Martin remembers and appreciates him, Lewis gets a
chance to reintroduce himself to the nation and to the Florida
Gators (2-0) on Saturday, when Tennessee (1-0) travels to
Gainesville and a raucous stadium known as the Swamp, where they
haven't won since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunshine State has sent more than Hurricane Floyd to other
regions in the South, as some Gators, befitting a bitter rivalry,
have unleashed high winds of insults through the newspapers. Most
have been of the weak tropical storm variety.
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach Steve Spurrier, of course, made the most stinging
dig at the Vols by pointing out that his No. 4-ranked Gators were
favored over the No. 2-ranked defending national champions.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis isn't biting after hearing all the insults. He prefers the
dramatic gesture over words. In the preseason, he asked coach
Phillip Fulmer to list him third on the depth chart behind Travis
Henry and Travis Stephens, who combined for 1,447 yards last year
in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to come in and take something,'' Lewis explained.
``I want to earn it. They played great last year and helped get us
a championship. I wanted to keep it in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Tennessee opened the season two weeks ago with a
42-17 victory over Wyoming, however, Lewis was the lead tailback.
He had 159 yards and three touchdowns, reaching 2,000 yards in his
17th game _ faster than any Volunteer in school history.
</P>
<P>
   His return has emboldened the already confident Martin to try to
out-Gator the Gators and predict a victory. With the Tennessee
legend of Peyton Manning all but buried by Martin's undefeated
record (14-0) as a starter, Martin has turned into a steady
metronome that keeps a better beat than Tennessee's unofficial
anthem, ``Rocky Top.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Wyoming here, Martin was 14 of 21 for 264 yards, threw
two touchdowns and ran for 36 yards to account for nearly 60
percent of Tennessee's 522 yards. In his last 200 pass attempts, he
has thrown only two interceptions and has become the Tony Robbins
of his team's success-breeds-success mantra, which they vow will
carry them to another championship.
</P>
<P>
   Martin led the Volunteers through informal summer workouts. He
reminded his teammates that he was a better quarterback and that
they were a better team than last year. In the weight room, or on
the track for sprints, he kept reminding them that last season was
a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miles; I've come miles,'' Martin said. ``Last year, I felt
like I was the caboose, and the rest of the offense was the train
in front of me. And believe it or not, we are hungrier than we were
last year. We weren't supposed to win the title. We were replacing
12 guys and this was supposed to be our year. I'm telling you we
haven't skipped a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers were supposed to have a weak receiving corps with
the departure of Peerless Price to the National Football League.
But in the opener, Cedrick Wilson caught seven passes for 183 yards
and two touchdowns. Their defense was supposed to be leaderless
with the departure of linebacker Al Wilson, yet they held Wyoming
to just 203 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful motivation Martin has ticked off for his team
is the one most familiar to each and every Volunteer: they get no
respect. The national championship has been conceded to Florida
State. He and Lewis are merely long shot Heisman Trophy candidates.
No preseason poll gave the Vols a shot to join Nebraska and become
the second team in 19 years to repeat as national champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're flukes,'' Martin said, repeating what the naysayers have
said about his team. ``Last year was a fluke. We've heard it every
way. But the thing I know and my teammates know is that once the
game starts, everything said in interviews and all the trash talk
is forgotten. The final score counts. And I like our record
there.''
</P>
<P>
   If it holds, Martin will have something to say to Lewis this
January at the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. His running back would
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then people should know that I'm back,'' he said.

GRETZKY'S NEW BURDEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Wayne Gretzky always said his hero growing up was a ``a man
with constant headaches, ulcers and ringing in his ears.'' The
newly retired hockey superstar was speaking of his father, Walter,
whose decades of service with Bell Canada took a toll on his
health.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his telephone pole-climbing dad, the only thing remotely
blue collar about the younger Gretzky's job were the turtlenecks he
wore under his Edmonton Oilers, St. Louis Blues and New York
Rangers jerseys. And yet for all the NHL player accomplished in his
superlative 20-year career, his professional success, like that of
his father, came at some cost to his health.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Paulina, 8-year-old Ty and 6-year-old Trevor _ the
Gretzky children _ look up to a man with constant aches,
inflammation and stiffness in his joints.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out carrying hockey on his back as Gretzky has for more
than half his life apparently was a terrible strain on his
shoulders. The cartilage that covers the ends of the bones in his
joints there has deteriorated, resulting in pain and diminished
range of motion.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sobering thought _ the man who raised four Stanley Cups
being unable to lift his youngest child.
</P>
<P>
   After everything Gretzky has done for hockey, that's how hockey
chooses to repay him, with a gift-wrapped case of rheumatism?
</P>
<P>
   The one-time King revolutionized the game, and all he's asking
in return, he said, is ``to be able to play golf with my friends,
pick-up hockey with my boys, things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope Gretzky isn't asking too much. Those 1,016 NHL goals
he scored in the regular season and playoffs brought him fame and
fortune, but if he's physically unable to enjoy such simple
pleasures, life's hat trick will have eluded him.
</P>
<P>
   It should be obvious by now, what with Maurice ``Rocket''
Richard fighting cancer and Mario Lemieux having conquered
Hodgkin's disease, that immortality is not to be confused with
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   There is a price for everything and the cost of success can get
steep.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Gretzky had everybody convinced he was too crafty
to take a hit. He has taken a couple since his retirement in April;
his wife Janet recently miscarried and now he finds himself in the
early stages of osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky gets arthritis and we feel as if our own illusions have
been worn from the bone, just like his cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Silly us. We should have known not even a body as marvelously
equipped as Gretzky's could withstand years of body checks, wrist
shots and cramped airline seats. It simply never occurred to us
that somebody who brought so much pleasure to so many could be in
any pain.
</P>
<P>
   The Agoura Hills resident, who hung up his skates after a fond
farewell in April, has signed on as a point man for the education
of North Americans on the degenerative joint disease more often
associated with people twice his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think people my age had arthritis,'' Gretzky said
during a Canadian television interview earlier in the week. ``Now I
want to help others realize arthritis pain is not restricted to the
elderly and that effective treatment is available.''
</P>
<P>
   In this new arena, Gretzky is not a singular sensation.
Osteoarthritis is the leading cause of disability in the U.S.,
striking more than 21 million Americans. One in three Americans
over 60 are afflicted with the disease. But like sweet-talking con
men on the telephone, the disease can prey on younger people, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of exercise and excessive weight can be contributing
factors. Neither one conjures up images of Gretzky, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Other contributing factors, we can't so easily dismiss. Strain
from one's occupation? Poor posture? Joint injuries that never heal
properly? Check. Check. Check.
</P>
<P>
   An image starts to form like a Polaroid shot when we picture how
Gretzky attracted so much attention every shift, the ice seemed to
tilt in his direction. Off the ice, we remember how he couldn't
sigh without people holding up fingers to gauge how much air he
exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the way he skated, all hunched over as if he had
a red licorice rope for a spine. Any finishing-school matron would
have taken one look at Gretzky and ordered him to skate while
balancing books on his head.
</P>
<P>
   As for injuries, well, Gretzky, had a few. Remember the
career-threatening back injury in 1992? Los Angeles Kings fans
surely do.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Californians will forever see Gretsky in
black-and-white, his colors as a King. No matter what the future
holds, we'll remember him with his arms raised in celebration of
another goal, an image etched in time. &QL;

GAP ON THE FIELD? PHELAN STEPS IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Senior Matt Phelan is the Mr. Fix-it of UCLA's
offensive line. Suspension at left guard? No problem. Fatigue at
center? Got it covered. Injury at right guard? He's there.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan, a senior from Leona Valley, has played every offensive
line position but left tackle, and Saturday he'll make his third
start of the season at his second position.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always been my role,'' he said. ``I pride myself on
being a renaissance lineman. I like knowing what everyone's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelan played sparingly for three years and doesn't foresee an
NFL career, but his talent (i.e., versatility) has been critical
this season. He started two games at left guard for the suspended
Oscar Cabrera and now he's sliding to right guard for the injured
Mike Saffer. In previous seasons, he also played right tackle and
center.
</P>
<P>
   Although Phelan's favorite position is center _ ``It appeals to
the intelligent side,'' he said _ he isn't complaining about his
current role. With nine (or 10) games left in his career, he's
happy to be on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' he said. ``It's the first time I've been in
the rotation legitimately. I come to practice and I know I'm going
to start or play a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   __ How they stand: The Bruins lost one lineman and gained two
this week with Saffer's sprained ankle _ he's out 2-4 weeks _ and
the return of Cabrera and Jim Ghezzi. The shuffle leaves them with
10 healthy linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Polak and Blake Worley are the starting tackles, with
Micah Webb and true freshman Bryce Bohlander in reserve. Cabrera
and Phelan are the starting guards, with Ghezzi and Ed Anderson off
the bench. (Saffer will start for Phelan when he returns.) Troy
Danoff and reserve Tony Ippolito are the centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tackles are all right,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``We're
struggling at guard.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Defensive tackle Pete Holland might not play
Saturday because of lower-back pain. Anthony Fletcher will start in
his place.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Danny Farmer tweaked his sprained left ankle making a
cut _ his cleat got caught in the dirt _ and is questionable for
the Fresno State game. There's growing concern at Spaulding Field
that Farmer won't be at full strength all season. Such is the
nature of high (above the ankle bone) sprains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to go on forever,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Clamping down: The Bruins were more concerned with Ohio
State's running game than its passing attack. As a result, they
committed eight defenders to the line of scrimmage and had their
cornerbacks play a few yards off the receivers. The Buckeyes
responded with a slew of short sideline passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think their quarterbacks were good enough to beat
us,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins won't give Fresno State's receivers the same cushion
this week. Freshman cornerbacks Ricky Manning Jr. and Joe Hunter
will play tight man-to-man against Rodney Wright and Charles Smith
in what should be the best matchup of the game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Taken aback: Safety Ryan Roques said his father, Burnell,
received a piece of hate mail after Roques was charged in the
disabled-parking scam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `What is this?' I wasn't expecting anything like
that,'' Roques said. ``Whoever sent it, I guess their kids have
never sinned.''

LOAIZA EXCELS FOR RANGERS IN VICTORY OVER TWINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The only berths guaranteed in the Rangers'
rotation if they reach the playoffs belong to Rick Helling and
Aaron Sele, manager Johnny Oates has said.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be long before Oates guarantees a third.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers won for the eighth time in Esteban Loaiza's past 11
starts, and the pitcher's doghouse-to-penthouse season continued
with yesterday's 8-3 victory against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza held the Twins to three runs (two earned) 6 1/3 innings,
and Roberto Kelly and Rafael Palmeiro supplied the offensive
firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly drove in four runs with the fifth two-homer game of his
career, and Palmeiro ensured the victory with his three-run,
opposite-field homer off Brad Radke (12-14) in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Rangers a 12-game, season sweep of the
Twins and reduced their magic number to 10. The Rangers would
capture their third American League West title in four years with
any combination of their victories and/or losses by second-place
Oakland that total 10.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Rangers can begin to discuss their postseason plans
without disclaimers such as ``if we make the make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza (8-4) continued to make a case for his inclusion in the
postseason rotation by allowing only six hits and one walk, and
only a two-run, seventh-inning homer by Terry Steinbach marred his
latest performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the ball very well,'' Oates said. ``He threw some
fastballs by people. He had a little giddy-up out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza is 7-3 with a 3.62 earned-run average in 11 starts since
joining the rotation July 24, but thoughts of starting in the
postseason remain the furthest thing from his mind, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to finish the season strong and keep
winning,'' he said. ``I'm not really thinking about anything else.
I just want to keep performing the way I'm performing and continue
to throw the ball the way I'm throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's seventh-inning home run gave the Rangers a 6-1 lead
and gave Palmeiro a personal-best 44th home run. Oates
congratulated Palmeiro after the home run, and the left-handed
power hitter responded in typical fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not finished yet,'' Palmeiro told Oates. ``We've still
got work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's afternoon kept him in contention for a Triple Crown
season. Palmeiro entered yesterday's games ranked no worse than
fourth in batting average, home runs and runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wins the Triple Crown, we've got a pretty good chance of
winning this division,'' Oates said. ``I'd love for him to win the
Triple Crown. Raffy has had a very special year.''

HOW TO HELP HANDLE THE AFTERMATH OF VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KRISTIN N. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As survivors of Wednesday's Fort Worth
church shooting gathered and grieved, a cadre of counselors,
psychologists and ministers prepared to guide witnesses through the
stress of witnessing violence firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Experts who have counseled survivors of shootings from
Jonesboro, Ark., to Littleton, Colo., have said those victims may
suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, an affliction more commonly
associated with shell-shocked soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Stress disorder symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares and
intrusive images of the event that may flood back. Survivors also
may feel anxiety. Victims can become alternately withdrawn and
aggressive in the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Adults may react to traumatic events by becoming overprotective
of their children and fearful. People may also feel intense anger,
fear that they have lost control, hurt and guilt, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists and counselors have recommended these strategies
to help young people deal with the trauma that follows violence.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to their fears. Encourage them to talk openly about them,
mental health professionals said Wednesday. Kids respond better
when they're heard first. Family therapists recommend starting by
asking children, ``What do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Reassure children who are afraid and let them know that their
feelings are normal. Counselors say that it is common for children
to react to such a situation by becoming worried that they could be
harmed at a place they once considered safe. Parents should stay
calm and let children talk through their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, parents should shield their children from traumatic
news, because it is frightening. But if children do hear about it
from friends or on television, do not try to sweep the subject
under the rug. Parents should encourage the children to talk about
what frightens them by asking questions such as, ``What do you
think about that?'' or telling them, ``That scares me; tell me what
you think?''

COWBOYS COACH HOLDING FIRM WHEN BUMPING EGOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chan Gailey did it first with Emmitt Smith, and he did it next
with Michael Irvin. Frankly, I wondered with each case if Gailey
hadn't bumped up against something that would either bump him back
or even knock him down.
</P>
<P>
   That ``something'' would be defined in many ways, including
massive egos, Hall-of-Fame credentials, Lombardi trophies,
worldwide household sports names and local legends. Gailey had
bumped up against all that.
</P>
<P>
   An Emmitt or an Irvin represents all of the above. Better yet,
those two ``earned'' the right to have their names represent all of
the above.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the reputations of Emmitt and Michael, not to
mention Troy and Deion, and yes, Mr. Jerry Jones himself, it was 19
months ago when Gailey came to Valley Ranch as Coach Nobody.
</P>
<P>
   Chan was Jones' handpicked man. So, of course, was Gunsmoke
Switzer, meaning there was ample room for error in Jerry's judgment
of what was best for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   There is no tougher coaching/managerial job in America at any
sport at any level. That includes managing the Yankees for George
Steinbrenner, which is a close second. This is the toughest because
of Jones, because of recent world championships, because of the
aging core of high profile players remaining from the title teams,
because of the absolute mess Gunsmoke left behind, because of the
poor drafts in the mid-90s, because most of the fandom is waiting
on the next Jimmy Johnson, and mainly because the Cowboys ain't
even close to what they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, as we've learned, is not the next Jimmy Johnson, nor
does he strive to be, except for the part about being the architect
of a Super Bowl team.
</P>
<P>
   But like Jimmy, Gailey is tough. A totally different kind of
tough, but still ...
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Gailey tells Emmitt there will be a change in the
way he had been used. The very last thing Emmitt wanted was to be
used less. Enter Chris Warren. There would be less carries for
Emmitt.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who says today they didn't believe Emmitt was a running
back in total decline, well, he or she is lying. But Emmitt bounced
back with a huge season in 1998, even though Warren ended up
injured. Whatever, that was a renewed Emmitt last season, and there
is no sign thus far of that changing.
</P>
<P>
   For this season, it was Irvin, a true football warrior, who got
the Gailey ``treatment.'' Fewer snaps for Michael will equal more
production, believed the coach. And such was the case last week
against Washington _ fewer snaps, more production from Irvin, who
yapped-yapped-yapped about it, but did-did-did it.
</P>
<P>
   And Gailey will be doing it again this week, and next week, and
every week. But without even a hint of ``I am the coach''
chest-pounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough? What is a tough coach? Define that for me,'' Gailey
said yesterday at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   OK, how about Lombardi, how about the Jimster, how about
Parcells?
</P>
<P>
   ``You still haven't defined tough for me,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   And then Gailey explained that bumping up against all that
``something'' was not what he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only about me making decisions I consider best for the
team,'' Gailey said. ``But when it involves individual careers,
then I want those players personally involved in the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if there's a total disagreement by players with the
stature of Emmitt or Irvin?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we will continue to have discussions until there is a
common ground. It becomes my fault if there can't be a common
ground because I didn't do a good enough job selling the player on
what is best for the team,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The answer from my man The Jimster would have been a smile and a
wink, signifying the tough-coach code of ``My way or the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not Gailey's style, obviously. But once he charts a
course, and once the ship sets sail, then it becomes Gailey's boat.
</P>
<P>
   About his off-season conversation with Gailey: ``I didn't agree
or disagree at the time,'' Irvin said yesterday. ``I didn't know
what to think.''
</P>
<P>
   At times in the Washington game, when his butt was on the bench,
Irvin knew what he was thinking, and it's not printable. But an
amazing comeback victory in which Irvin was a late fourth-quarter
star, meant Michael was a happy soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Lose a game under the same circumstances, or lose under any
other circumstances and, well, we'll see.
</P>
<P>
   But by now, we also know enough about Gailey to know he isn't
changing. He is the boss on a team in desperate need of a boss
because of Jerry's previous choice of human Jello to lead the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I found here are players willing to put the team at the
forefront,'' Gailey said. ``I found people willing to buy into the
team philosophy, and I don't mean 100 percent of the time _ no team
has that. But for the most part, it's true. And that's what will
eventually make it all work.''
</P>
<P>
   But everything has to start with a strong team leader on a team
of strong individuals. Until further notice, consider that the
strength of Chan Gailey.

BRUINS REUNION: MANY HAPPY RETURNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Suspended together, they suffered apart. UCLA
fullback Durell Price watched the Ohio State game with friends.
Linebacker Ryan Nece was with his family in San Bernardino. Guard
Oscar Cabrera barbequed with relatives at his home near the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Their emotions paralleled UCLA's performance _ first-quarter
thrills giving way to fourth-quarter reality, as the outmanned
Bruins wilted in Ohio Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurting inside,'' Price said. ``Those guys did a great
job, but depth was a problem. We were so thin in numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. The reinforcements have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's second season begins this week with a new quarterback
(Cory Paus) and the return of 10 players who served two-game
suspensions for the disabled-parking scam. Among them are six
starters and six seniors who will provide desperately needed
leadership. Together, they account for 13 percent of UCLA's roster
and a chunk of its spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're starting the season over,'' guard Matt Phelan
said. ``This is how it's supposed to be. It's how we imagined it
would be. A lot of our best players finally have a chance to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Assimilating the suspended players before Saturday's game
against Fresno State should not be difficult, either
psychologically or strategically. During a series of summer
meetings, the guilty players apologized to their teammates and
coaching staff. Captains Danny Farmer and Pete Holland accepted and
the matter was dropped. Incensed coach Bob Toledo also accepted the
apologies, but he banned the suspended players from contact with
the team during games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest moment for me was during the Boise State game,''
Nece said. ``I was in the stands, and at kickoff I felt separated
for the first time. It was the first time I felt divided from the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Although punished severely _ $1,485 fines, 200 hours of
community service, two-game suspensions and additional penalties by
the dean of students _ the guilty players were, in the end, allowed
to practice. They stayed in shape physically, they attended
meetings, learned new plays and refined fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   Once game preparation began, they were relegated to the dreaded
scout team, which mimics the opponent's offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it actually didn't suck,'' Price said. ``I just put
it in my mind that we were contributing to the team winning games.
When you're young, the scout team sucks. When you're older, you
realize you can help the young guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Had they been banned from practice, the suspended players would
have been a month behind their teammates. They'd have needed time
to get in shape and find their rhythm, time to adjust to contact
and familiarize themselves with the system. Instead, they were
ready for action Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say, `Welcome back,' I want to say, `I never
left,' '' safety Ryan Roques said. ``I've been here the whole time.
I've been practicing with the team, doing everything I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Their impact will be greatest on defense. Roques, a senior,
takes over at the troublesome strong-safety position, where
sophomore Jason Stephens struggled. Nece, Robert Thomas and Tony
White replace an inexperienced group of linebackers. Safety Eric
Whitfield and linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz will bolster the depth.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, junior Oscar Cabrera returns to his starting spot at
left guard, and senior lineman Jim Ghezzi becomes the top reserve.
Price is the No. 1 fullback _ a move based on leadership as much as
talent _ and reserve tailback Keith Brown's return should give
weary starter DeShaun Foster some rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll make an immediate impact, whether it's because
the talent is back or the leadership and experience we're
gaining,'' Roques said. ``There will be an impact one way or
another.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence has energized the Bruins, who blamed fatigue and
a depleted roster, not talent, for the loss at Ohio State. The
numbers agree: The Bruins scored the first 14 points of the game
and scored the first points of the second half but were outscored
by a combined 42-3 in the remainder of the two halves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a full roster, an influx of senior leadership and a
starting quarterback, their spirits are soaring. It's a new season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a lot of the guys and they're still excited
despite that loss,'' Nece said. ``We're confident we can be a big
force in the Pac-10.''

 (SUBS to change figure in lede to `more than 8,600' and figure in

   NEW YORK _ As school officials revised the number of students
mistakenly assigned to summer school upward to more than 8,600,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Board of Education officials argued
Wednesday that parents of those children should be grateful for the
mixup because the faltering children were given a chance at more
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a parent of one of the children, I would say, `Thank
you for having the child in summer school' because the child got
more education,'' the mayor said at a City Hall news conference.
``You've got to understand, the alleged error is an error with the
children at the lowest end of the score.'' He added, ``They are
children who, next year, when the standards are just a little bit
higher, would not be promoted. So, these are children very much in
need of additional educational help.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who had strongly pushed the summer school program as
a way of getting tough with failing students, spoke in response to
questions about the revelations by Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew
that thousands of students in the third and sixth grades were
erroneously required to attend summer school because of a scoring
mistake by CTB/McGraw-Hill, the Monterey, Calif., standardized
testing company. As a result of that error, hundreds of students
were forced to change vacation plans or compelled to sit in often
sweltering classrooms. The board on Wednesday raised the figure of
mistakenly assigned students to 8,668 _ far more than the 2,000 to
3,000 first indicated by school officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the board tried Wednesday to find a silver lining in the
situation. Recalculating reading scores to compensate for the
scoring error showed that test scores last spring for the school
system had sharply improved, not remained flat as was first
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The board said that 48.5 percent of students _ not 44.6 percent,
as previously reported _ scored at or above the national average.
With the statistical adjustment the board uses to allow for
comparisons with previous years _ the 1999 test was much different
from previous years _ scores improved by 4.9 percent over 1998, the
board said.
</P>
<P>
   The flawed test results, announced last June, were one of the
grimmest chapters in Crew's tenure, creating the impression that
Crew himself, who had put a high focus on literacy, was
ineffective. At the time, Crew said he was determined ``not to make
excuses'' and vowed to take strong action to overhaul the system.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, many of those actions _ from removing
superintendents to sending children to summer school _ turned out
to be based to a considerable extent on a fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see no reason even amidst the turbulence to abandon the
standards,'' Crew said before a meeting Wednesday of the Board of
Education at its Brooklyn headquarters, in which he and the board
members expressed both anger at the testing company mistakes and
pride in the new results. ``I don't think we made a mistake here at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   David Taggart, the president of CTB/McGraw-Hill, his voice
shaking, told Crew and the board that the company believed the new
test results to be valid. ``Maybe the word apology isn't enough,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crew, who agreed with the mayor's assessment, said he would
advance all students who passed the spring exam, regardless of
their summer school performance, though he would encourage the
parents of borderline students to allow their children to be
retained.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants parents to think that ```I know my kid was
wrongly placed in summer school but, heck, I just know he or she is
not doing well enough yet to handle the fourth grade.' I want that
conversation to be had. But I also believe they are eligible for
promotion under the rules. Fair is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, just one week into the new school year, he predicted
confusion if many kids are moved around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it will be very disruptive and and I don't like to
do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The testing mistake elicited a range of emotion among school
officials, parents and students.
</P>
<P>
   Indira Baptise, whose son, Colin Bunbury, was promoted to the
fourth grade at Public School 41 in Brooklyn after attending summer
school there, said summer school got him so interested in reading
that he goes to the library after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not mind him doing the extra work because he needed it,''
Ms. Baptise said. ``But I am upset that I sent him to school all
year long and he could not pass all the things he had to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, outside a Bronx elementary school, Guillermo Rosado
offered a different view as he picked up his stepson, David, who
passed summer school and is now in the fourth grade at Public
School 69.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he didn't have to go to summer school we could have gone to
Florida as we planned,'' Rosado said. ``This definitely affected
our summer. We were going to go visit my mother and do all the
tourist things in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   David, for his part, did not seem to mind. ``I liked summer
school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was confusion Wednesday among schools administrators and
parents about what the revised scores may mean.
</P>
<P>
   The board began to focus in on the actual number affected by the
McGraw Hill miscalculation and found it was far larger than at
first believed. Board officials said that of the students
mistakenly assigned to summer school, more than 5,000 went and
passed a second test. But almost 3,500, the board said, either
never showed up for summer school or failed the second test by
scoring below the 15th percentile on a national curve.
</P>
<P>
   Those students will be promoted unless their parents request
they not be, Crew said.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake occurred through a miscalculation of the percentile
score that showed how the students compared to a national sample of
children across the country.

REPORT'S CRITICISM OF POLICE IS FLAWED, GIULIANI SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Wednesday dismissed a
report by the city's public advocate, Mark Green, on lapses in the
Police Department's disciplinary process, calling it an unfounded
attack by a politician primarily interested in advancing his own
mayoral ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another one of those guffaws by Mark Green,'' said
Giuliani, who accused Green of selectively using statistics
unfairly to portray police officials as too lenient in their
handling of misconduct by officers. ``I guess he wants to position
himself as the anti-police, anti-law-enforcement candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's report, which was based on a review of 420 police
disciplinary files, said that hundreds of officers found by an
independent review board to have engaged in misconduct were never
disciplined because their cases were dismissed by police officials
without further investigation. Green said his review showed that
officers against whom citizen complaints had been upheld by the
Civilian Complaint Review Board between 1994 and 1997 escaped
punishment, in large measure because the department was unwilling
to police itself aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani accused Green, a liberal Democrat who as public
advocate is first in the line of succession for the mayoralty, of
focusing on old cases as a means of ignoring recent increases in
the number of officers disciplined. ``Mark Green cuts off his
analysis of the numbers in 1997, leaves out 1998 and half of 1999,
so he can come to a different kind of political conclusion,'' the
mayor said during a news conference at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he intended to review all the cases decided in 1998,
but that he had not yet been provided with all of those records.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Giuliani took office, 40 percent of the civilian
complaints substantiated by the review board resulted in
discipline. During the six months that ended in July 1999, the
proportion rose to 53 percent, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the review board investigates civilian complaints of
abuse and brutality, the decision to penalize officers is left to
police officials, to whom the board forwards cases it has
substantiated. Only a small proportion, 6 percent, of the 5,000
civilian complaints received each year are substantiated, which is
why critics of the disciplinary process have found the dismissal of
substantiated cases by police officials so troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Green said the Giuliani administration was attacking the
messenger because it did not like the message. He said it was
particularly disingenuous for Giuliani to complain that the study
data was stale, since the administration had blocked his access to
the disciplinary files for two years. Green won the right to review
the files in a court decision earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Green's report ignored
recent improvements in the disciplinary process that came with the
expansion of its investigative staff.

<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Sept. 16: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in Washington has ruled against undue
secrecy, and for the public's right to know, in a case arising from
the investigation by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, of
President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The court
ruled that Starr's office did not violate the confidentiality of
grand jury proceedings by speaking to reporters about its own
internal deliberations over whether to indict Clinton. The decision
overturned an order by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, the federal
trial judge who oversaw the grand jury that heard evidence about
the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was an article that appeared in The New York Times last
January, at the tail end of the impeachment trial in the Senate. It
reported that Starr had concluded that he had the constitutional
authority to seek a grand jury indictment of Clinton before he
leaves office in January 2001. The appellate panel did not say it
approved of any leaks of information or the timing of the article.
What the panel did say _ quite valuably _ is that grand jury
secrecy covers only those statements by prosecutors that
``directly'' reveal grand jury matters. The court's previous
decisions on grand jury secrecy, the panel said, were not meant to
require that a ``veil of secrecy be drawn over all matters
occurring in the world that happens to be investigated by a grand
jury.''
</P>
<P>
   This expansive approach to what prosecutors may discuss publicly
with reporters shows due respect for the tradition of openness in
American law and the strong public interest in having grand jury
rules that allow for informed debate of public issues. It is a
refreshing departure from the devotion to secrecy that saw the same
appeals court uphold press lockouts when Starr and the White House
sparred over executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall, has indicated he plans
to appeal the latest ruling. But at this point it is hard to see
what Clinton stands to gain by seeking to overturn a sound decision
on grand jury secrecy _ except to add to his pile of unpaid legal
fees.

<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Sept. 16: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one of its finest moments, the House of Representatives
listened to its collective conscience Tuesday night and passed the
Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill. Rep. Christopher Shays
reflected both the historic importance of the vote and the
tremendous challenge ahead with an apt comparison to the great
civil rights debates of the 1960s. As they did a generation ago,
proponents of progress will now have to force an obstructionist
minority in the Senate to face vote after vote to expose their
motives. It may, therefore, be the moment to consider tactical
changes in the legislation if there is a possibility of winning
more Republicans on the next vote.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of attention now turns to John McCain _ presidential
candidate, Vietnam War hero and anti-establishment senator from
Arizona. With Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, McCain has pushed for a
ban on unregulated ``soft money'' to political parties since
President Clinton's out-of-control 1996 re-election campaign.
Unlike most Republicans, McCain was not content to deplore
Clinton's excesses. The McCain-Feingold bill would ban soft money
to parties and extend federal regulations to money raised by
independent groups for campaign ads two months before an election.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday McCain and Feingold are planning to introduce a
stripped-down version of that bill, eliminating the curbs on
fund-raising for so-called ``issue ads'' by independent groups. In
effect, they are calling the bluff of Trent Lott, the majority
leader, and his fund-raiser in chief, Mitch McConnell, who have
obsessively focused on the issue-ad curbs as a violation of free
speech. This is a risky change. Banning unlimited money for
political parties might lead to the money going to bogus groups for
use in even more destructive campaigns. The Democrats and
Republicans in the House who bravely stood by the issue-ad controls
against relentless attacks by special interests will no doubt be
upset over such a concession.
</P>
<P>
   But with the issue-ad curbs out of the bill, there will at least
be no excuse for other Republicans not to sign on to reform.
However distrustful and upset they may be, Democrats should be
prepared to go along. Reform, like any other large cause, is never
something that gets achieved overnight. The battle to rid American
politics of corruption has been fought since the late 19th century.
Allowing independent groups to raise unlimited money for phony
issue ads is far from ideal. But a ban on soft money for the
parties would be a significant step in the long, grinding effort to
drive corrupt money out of the process.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from the 252-to-177 vote in the House that a strong
consensus in both parties favors reform. More than a quarter of the
Republican Party's members in the House defied their leadership and
supported the bill, sending a strong message to the Senate, where
campaign reform is supported by all 45 Democrats and 7 Republicans.
That adds up to 52 votes, a majority that can only be thwarted by
the determination of Lott to engineer a filibuster to kill the
bill. To get the McCain-Feingold bill passed, 60 votes are needed
to cut off the filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Republican holdouts say they oppose campaign reform,
especially the curbs on independent groups, as an infringement of
free speech. But the ban on corporations contributing to candidates
has been in effect since 1907. The ban on donations by unions was
enacted in 1947, and the Watergate-era ceiling on contributions to
candidates by individuals and political action groups has been in
effect for 25 years. Extending these curbs to political parties is
not a radical change.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also making a novel argument to these Republicans that
campaign reform might even make tax cuts for the average citizen
more achievable. The $792 billion tax cut bill passed this summer
was loaded with so many favors for individual businesses, stuffed
into the bill because of campaign donations, that hardly any money
was left over for taxpayers of modest means.
</P>
<P>
   If these senators are not willing to listen to voters demanding
reform, then they should listen to a growing chorus of business
leaders who are also demanding a ban on soft money. The committee
for economic development began by enlisting executives from General
Electric, Merck, Xerox and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. Its ranks are
growing with executives from Hasbro, Prudential, International
Paper and State Farm Insurance. Businessmen use words like
legalized bribery to describe the current fund-raising system.
</P>
<P>
   McCain should direct his lobbying to Republicans with a record
of some independence or those who have complained eloquently about
being forced to become fund-raising automatons. Now is the time for
Republicans like Richard Lugar of Indiana, William Roth of
Delaware, John Warner of Virginia, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and
George Voinovich and Mike DeWine of Ohio to show some of the
gumption their constituents have come to appreciate. As for
Democrats unhappy about dropping the regulation of independent
``issue ads,'' we understand the difficulty of dropping a vital
measure long supported by this page. But it makes sense to win what
is achievable now and then move on to greater battles to come.

BUSH, OTHER OFFICIALS SHOCKED AT MULTIPLE SLAYINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER and JOHN MORITZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Calling it a tragic event in a ``house of
hope and love,'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush, along with other
officials expressed shock and dismay at the multiple slayings in a
Fort Worth Baptist church Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr, in Toluca, Mexico, for a Sister
Cities event, said, ``We are prayerful for the individuals who have
been shot and their families, and mournful for the families of the
deceased.''
</P>
<P>
   But, added Barr, who was planning a hasty return to the city,
``this is Fort Worth, and we'll be united as a city in our strength
to see clear through the fog of this tragic criminal act.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in Detroit Wednesday campaigning for president, said
through a spokeswoman: ``This is a terrible tragedy, made worse by
the fact that it took place in a house of hope and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families
and the congregation,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Some elected officials and gun control advocates called for a
review of the need for legislation to limit access to weapons and
possibly make it more difficult for such shootings to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the shooting must have been done by some ``deranged
person,'' state Rep. Glenn Lewis, D-Fort Worth, said something must
be done about the proliferation of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The details are a little sketchy right now as to who did what
or why,'' Lewis said. ``Obviously, we need to curb the
proliferation of weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Texas Legislature convened earlier this year, Lewis
pre-filed a bill making it mandatory for any gun owner to have a
trigger lock when purchasing a gun. A similar bill is being
considered in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas lawmakers, who earlier in the decade passed
legislation allowing residents to carry concealed weapons if they
obtained qualification, did not look favorably on Lewis' proposal.
The Legislature did pass a bill this year protecting gun
manufacturers from lawsuits filed by local governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even get a hearing in committee,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   He challenged the notion put forward by advocates of a concealed
weapons law that allowing more people to carry weapons would reduce
crime. ``Obviously, that's not true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Elfant, a Travis County constable and head of Austin-based
Texans Against Gun Violence, called the carnage the latest in what
has become ``a terrible year for high-profile shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know a lot more about this, like where he got the
gun and what his mental condition was,'' Elfant said. ``But one
thing we do know is that one of the things the Legislature did this
year was to take away the prohibition of guns in churches. Churches
are no place for guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of questions that need answers. Some of these
shootings by deranged people are never going to be prevented. But
we have to make sure that only law-abiding citizens have access to
guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barr urged caution, saying, ``I think we need to dedicate
ourselves to understanding the tragedy, and then to figuring out
how to make the changes to keep this from happeining again. It's
not unique to Fort Worth, but we can start in Fort Worth, and we
will.''

POLAMALU KEEPS MOVING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If it's Wednesday, Troy Polamalu must be at a new
position.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in three weeks, Polamalu has been switched,
and it's even getting difficult for the freshman to figure out
where he is playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's very confusing,'' Polamalu said. ``I can't get
comfortable anywhere at the moment. I might be nose guard next.
They'll probably move me to offense after that.''
</P>
<P>
   One week before USC played Hawaii, Polamalu changed from free
safety to weakside linebacker. He had four tackles, a sack and a
forced fumble against the Rainbow Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   But this week Polamalu has pulled another switch, going to
strongside linebacker, where he is backing up Sultan Abdul-Malik.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a normal progression for top-notch players,'' USC coach
Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Polamalu, who is 5-foot-10, 200 pounds, might be one of the
smallest strongside linebackers in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the toughest too,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Polamalu: ``I'm in there with bigger guys. I just want
what's best for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   With Polamalu's move, Darryl Knight, who last month was fighting
for a starting spot at weakside linebacker, has dropped to No. 3
strongside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   __ Strong hurt: Tailback Frank Strong aggravated his bruised
knee and did not practice, leaving his status for the game in
doubt. Strong was supposed to share the No. 2 tailback position
with Sultan McCullough, because sophomore Malaefou MacKenzie is out
with a sore hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid it's something that might be nagging,'' Hackett
said. ``His knee was banged hard in practice. But they say he will
be ready for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Stevenson nicked: Freshman wide receiver Steve Stevenson
strained his arch in practice and was limping badly but said he
hoped to be ready for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing real bad, I should be able to play,'' Stevenson
said. ``I know my body. Hopefully by Friday, the pain won't be too
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rideaux rests: Cornerback Darrell Rideaux took Wednesday off
but will return to practice today. Rideaux has a stress fracture in
his back, but the injury is currently not considered serious.
</P>
<P>
   It's similar to the injury tailback Chad Morton suffered against
Florida State last year, which nagged him for several games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bring on a game: After a bye week, and nearly two weeks of
practicing against each other, the Trojans are antsy to play a
game, Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief scuffle that drew Hackett's ire during
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bye, I don't want to say it backfired on us, but we're
banging into each other more than necessary,'' Hackett said.
``We've only played one game and some teams have played three.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Kicking makes grade: Hackett is finally happy with USC's
kicking game, having David Newbury handle field goals and David
Bell on kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going good is this kicking thing,'' Hackett said.
``It's going pretty well. . . . We have a chance to be a pretty
respectable special-teams group.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell is also handling the backup punting duties behind Mike
MacGillivray.
