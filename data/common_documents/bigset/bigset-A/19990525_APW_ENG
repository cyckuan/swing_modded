<HEADLINE> Wrestler's Family Criticizes WWF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The family of Owen Hart lashed out at pro  
wrestling officials, saying they took too many chances by devising 
stunts like the one that killed him. ``My poor brother Owen was a 
sacrifice for the ratings,'' his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, a member of a prominent Canadian wrestling family,  
plummeted 70 feet or more to his death Sunday at Kemper Arena in 
Kansas City as he was being lowered into the ring from the arena's 
ceiling. At the World Wrestling Federation's event the next night, 
held in St. Louis, some wrestlers wept openly, as did some of the 
19,000 fans at the sold-out Kiel Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Kansas City said today they were still trying to  
determine what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's brother Bret, also a wrestling star, told ABC's ``Good  
Morning America'' today that his brother had been worried about the 
stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This idea was taken to him,'' Bret Hart said. ``There was a  
bit of discomfort about the danger in it. But somehow over the 
weekend he got talked into doing it again. He was very uneasy about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said there should have been ``some kind of a safety cable.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We're professional wrestlers; we take our falls on the mat,  
inside the ring,'' Hart said. ``I was never a stuntman, and my 
brother Owen was never a stuntman. He never should have been put in 
a situation where he was up on the top of a ceiling of an arena to 
go into the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bret Hart, known as ``The Hitman,'' is a star on the World  
Championship Wrestling circuit, rival to his brother's 
organization, the World Wrestling Federation. They are sons of Stu 
Hart, a member of Canada's Olympic wrestling team in the 1940s. All 
seven of his sons went into wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellie Hart, a sister, said both organizations were trying more  
and more tricky stunts to attract fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, wrestling was getting so far out and my poor brother  
Owen was a sacrifice for the ratings, that's how I look at it,'' 
she said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kept on getting more and more far out with the gimmicks  
and angles. ... We figured sooner or later somebody was going to 
end up with a tragedy because of the direction wrestling was taking 
with both WWF and WCW.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's death was all the more shocking to fans because the  
performers aren't supposed to get hurt -- no matter how painful the 
pounding seems. Even after Hart hit the canvas, many of the 16,200 
Kansas City fans thought the stunt was part of the scripted 
theatrics that have helped fuel the explosion of popularity in 
wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	More improvisational theater than sport, pro wrestling has been  
likened to soap opera for men, complete with storylines, subplots 
and love triangles. The eternal themes are respect, revenge and 
redemption. 
</P>
<P>
	In popular weekly broadcasts on cable television, wrestling has  
the flash and thunder of a rock concert, the costume and color of a 
Broadway production. 
</P>
<P>
	In that vein, Hart was about to make another of his dramatic  
entrances Sunday night. He had been attached to wires near the top 
of Kemper Arena, whose ceiling is 90 feet above the floor. The plan 
was for him to descend into the ring in ``superhero-type fashion,'' 
WWF President Vince McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the wrestler plunged into the ring. His head hit a  
padded turnbuckle, a metal coupling that holds the ring's ropes 
together, and snapped backward. Hart struggled to lift his head and 
his arms rose slowly, about a foot off the mat, then collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics rushed into the ring, unraveling Hart's trademark  
``Blue Blazer'' mask and unsuccessfully trying to resuscitate him. 
He was pronounced dead at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Keller, editor of the Pro Wrestling Torch newsletter, said  
it was the first fatal accident he knew of in U.S. wrestling since 
1969, when Mike DiBiase died of a heart attack during a match in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Floyd Mitchell said homicide detectives were  
inspecting Hart's rigging and talking to the stagehands to 
determine what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said the cable did not break, and detectives believe  
Hart's harness may have been hitched incorrectly. McMahon said he 
believes Hart may have accidentally pulled a release mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon said WWF wrestlers will stop performing the aerial move,  
but other stunts will continue. The WWF has scrapped plans to 
replay Sunday's event on pay-per-view TV and called off live events 
in Peoria, Ill.; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Hamilton, Ontario; Montreal 
and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Kansas City event resumed after about 15 minutes, and  
the show in St. Louis went on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of respect for Owen, knowing the consummate performer he  
was, I'm sure members of the Hart family would concur with me that 
he would want the show to go on,'' McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellie Hart agreed that her brother, ``being the kind of person  
he was, would have wanted Vince to continue. That's the nature of 
wrestling.'' But she said she thought Sunday's event should have 
been halted.

<HEADLINE> Reds Call Up Boone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Third baseman Aaron Boone rejoined the  
Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday, while pitcher Denny Neagle received 
reassurances that he won't need shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds called up Boone from Triple-A Indianapolis to fill  
Neagle's spot on the roster. Neagle went on the disabled list 
Monday with weakness in his shoulder and has an appointment 
Wednesday with Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jim Bowden told reporters during a game against  
Los Angeles that four doctors had recommended putting Neagle on a 
strengthening program. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who have either examined Neagle or looked at his test  
results concurred that there's no need for surgery, Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the information we've received today, it's very clear  
that surgery is not even an alternative to solve the problem,'' 
Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	The information changed Bowden's mind. Before the game, he  
thought that Neagle should have exploratory surgery to find out 
what's wrong with his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great news. I'm glad I'm wrong,'' Bowden said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Reds got Neagle from Atlanta last November as part of a  
five-player deal that included second baseman Bret Boone. Neagle 
was supposed to become the cornerstone of the rotation, but he 
pulled thigh muscles and had weakness in the shoulder in spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	After opening the season on the disabled list, he was activated  
and hit hard in six starts. He's 0-3 with an 8.17 ERA and batters 
are hitting .340 off him. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle is willing to do whatever Andrews suggests, even if it  
means arthroscopic surgery to examine the rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my mind, I've already prepared myself for whatever he might  
say,'' Neagle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle has base salaries of $4.75 million this year and next. He  
could demand a trade after the season, but has said he'll wait to 
make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said the four doctors recommended putting him back on a  
program to strengthen the shoulder. That could take four to six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Boone was optioned to Indianapolis on May 12 to open a  
spot for reliever Ron Villone. The Reds considered calling up 
either Boone, Carlos Baerga or Jeff Branson to fill Neagle's spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said Boone was the choice because he was hitting the best  
of the three -- .341 in 11 games -- and was playing well overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor was that Baerga would not allow himself to be  
sent back to the minors if he were called up and his roster spot 
was needed later on, Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga is hitting .294 in 44 games at Indianapolis. He agreed to  
a minor league deal during spring training that allows him to 
become a free agent if another team wants him for its major league 
roster.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Death Row Inmate Wins Retrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILKESBORO, N.C. (AP) -- A man sentenced to death for beating a  
woman to death with a shotgun has won a new trial after a judge 
ruled authorities wrongly withheld another man's confession. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Munsey, who on May 14 was granted a new trial, was  
ordered held Tuesday on $250,000 bond while he awaits retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been credible evidence to show that after six years in  
custody, three on death row, Mr. Munsey is innocent of these 
crimes,'' defense attorney Ben Sendor said in arguing for Munsey's 
release. ``Mr. Munsey ought to be free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Tom Horner said he would not appeal the  
ruling, and will seek an indictment against the man who confessed, 
Mike Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Munsey, 51, was convicted in 1996 of the murder of Shirley  
Weaver, who was bludgeoned with a shotgun stock at her boyfriend's 
trailer three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Munsey had known the victim and her boyfriend,  
investigators found no fingerprints, hair or blood connecting him 
to the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness, Tim Hall, testified that Munsey confessed to him, but  
after Munsey was sentenced to death, Hawkins came forward and told 
police that he killed Weaver and gave the pistol he stole to 
Munsey. 
</P>
<P>
	The confession was never disclosed, and it was later disclosed  
that Hall claimed he lied on the stand under pressure from the case 
prosecutor, who threatened to revoke Hall's parole if he recanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, District Attorney Randy Lyon, committed suicide  
in January 1998 just days after a judge ordered case records 
reopened. It was not know if the two events were related. 
</P>
<P>
	Munsey still faces charges in another, unrelated slaying.

<HEADLINE>  Tyson Released From Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After spending 3 1/2 months behind bars, Mike  
Tyson is free to fight again. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion was released Monday from a  
suburban Maryland jail where he was serving time for assaulting two 
motorists over a fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
	Smiling and waving, Tyson walked out of the Rockville, Md.,  
facility wearing a T-shirt, gray sweat pants and prison-issued 
sandals. He said nothing to reporters as he and a friend walked to 
a nearby car where his wife, Monica, waited to take him home to 
change clothes before meeting with his probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson spokesman Peter Seligman promised: ``We will be announcing  
very shortly plans on Mike's return to the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final obstacle to Tyson's release was cleared with an  
announcement Monday that an Indiana judge had ended Tyson's 
probation for a 1992 rape conviction. On Friday, the Maryland 
Parole Commission voted 5-1 to grant the fighter's release, but 
Indiana authorities needed to approve the decision before he could 
go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will be on parole until February, said Leonard A. Sipes, a  
spokesman for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and 
Correctional Services. He also must meet certain probation 
conditions -- including 200 hours of community service -- in the next 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sipes said Tyson will be subject to urine testing for illicit  
drugs for at least twice a week and unannounced home visits by 
state authorities. He must also receive permission before leaving 
Maryland, complete a psychiatric evaluation and undergo anger 
management treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizefighter pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault  
charges that stemmed from a minor traffic accident in suburban 
Gaithersburg, Md. He was sentenced on Feb. 5 to one year in a 
Montgomery County jail, but 60 days were added as punishment for 
violating probation on his rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	In her ruling in Indiana, Marion County Superior Court Judge  
Patricia Gifford said the jail time Tyson served in Maryland 
satisfied the penalty he incurred for violating terms of his 
Indiana probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley Finkel, Tyson's manager, said he plans to ``sit down and  
talk with Mike about his boxing plans,'' but he sees no reason why 
Tyson cannot resume his career. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Kemp, the boxer's attorney, said Tyson's first priority  
is to ``try and relax and be with his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all that he's been looking forward to for the past 3 1/2  
months,'' he said. ``Careerwise, there's talk about trying to 
resume his career; that is to think about tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has three fights remaining on a deal with the MGM Grand in  
Las Vegas and at least three more fights with Showtime, the cable 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old boxer last fought Jan. 16 and was behind on all  
three cards before he knocked out Francois Botha in the fifth round 
at Las Vegas. That fight was Tyson's first after getting back his 
boxing license, which Nevada boxing authorities had revoked the 
previous October because Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's 
ear on June 28, 1997.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The weather is looking better for  
Thursday's launch of space shuttle Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA issued a forecast today calling for 80 percent acceptable  
conditions for the 6:48 a.m. liftoff. Previous forecasts indicated 
a greater chance of fog.

</P>
<P>
	Discovery is loaded with 1 1/2 tons of equipment for the new

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gore Staffer Wins in Kentucky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Jonathan Miller, who returned to Kentucky  
intent on winning a political race and outspent a series of 
opponents to do it, won one Tuesday with the Democratic nomination 
for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a member of a wealthy Lexington family and former  
staffer to Vice President Al Gore, defeated state Rep. Susan Johns, 
who was making her first run for statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, publicist and farmer Peppy Martin held a slim lead  
over David L. Williams in the Republican gubernatorial primary. 
Williams was a Democrat a year ago when he ran for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin spent only $10,000 on her campaign, and Williams spent  
next to nothing. Williams, who lives in a trailer with his 
running-mate wife, Joanna, a candidate for lieutenant governor, had 
declined interviews and had his telephone disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	Registered Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans in Kentucky,  
and the incumbent, Gov. Paul Patton, is favored to win re-election 
in the first gubernatorial race in which an incumbent has been 
allowed to succeed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	A state constitutional change in 1992 allowed succession in  
constitutional offices, an event which has been banned in Kentucky 
for nearly 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who returned to Kentucky in 1997, started out by running  
for the Democratic nomination for Congress in the 6th District. 
Despite outspending all his opponents, he finished sixth out of 
seven candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Miller was expected to have spent nearly $500,000 as  
opposed to about $50,000 for Johns.

<HEADLINE> Reform Jews Debate New Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The governing body of Reform Judaism, the  
biggest and most liberal branch of American Jewry, debated a new 
set of principles Tuesday that would represent a return to 
traditional practices such as keeping kosher and praying in Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Conference of American Rabbis was expected to  
approve a major revision in the Principles of Reform Judaism, which 
are not enforceable regulations but more like suggestions or 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new platform, ancient rituals scoffed at or ignored in  
Reform communities and usually associated with Conservative or 
Orthodox Jewry would once again be embraced, such as the wearing of 
yarmulkes and prayer shawls, the observance of Jewish dietary laws 
and the use of Hebrew during prayer services. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform leaders said many of the 1.5 million Reform Jews in the  
United States already have been returning to traditional practices, 
and the new principles would only reinforce that. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the eve of a new century, when so many individuals are  
striving for religious meaning, moral purpose and a sense of 
community, it is important that we have a modern set of principles 
that clearly define Reform Judaism,'' said Rabbi Paul J. Menitoff, 
executive vice president of the 1,700-member rabbis' group. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis Rivkin, professor emeritus of Jewish history at Reform  
Judaism's Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, said he has seen a 
strong shift toward tradition among students since he joined the 
faculty in 1949. In the past four to five years, he said, the trend 
has become more noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a kind of security that (tradition) brings when the  
external world is in an insecure state, and when Jews are 
threatened by the assimilation process and the high rate of 
intermarriage. They fear there might be a dissolution of Judaism 
because of its openness to the world at large,'' Rivkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	A leader of Orthodox Judaism, President Norman Lamm of Yeshiva  
University, was skeptical about how much Reform has really changed, 
since the statement allows every rabbi to be ``a law unto 
himself.'' But he said: ``They have come a long way, and that 
journey is to be applauded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's meeting was only the fourth time since Reform Judaism  
was established in North America in the mid-19th century that the 
rabbis' group set forth comprehensive principles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1885, 15 Reform rabbis met and issued the Pittsburgh  
Platform, which rejected traditional Jewish practices as ``entirely 
foreign'' for modern American times. 
</P>
<P>
	A platform adopted in 1937 encouraged rabbis to incorporate  
science into their views of sacred literature. And a conference in 
1976 produced a call for diversity, individuality and change. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest platform was not reached without controversy and  
several rewordings. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier draft was dubbed ``Conservative lite'' by Rabbi  
Robert M. Seltzer, professor of Jewish history at the City 
University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform leaders said the final draft maintains the traditional  
Reform ethos that sets their branch apart from Conservative Judaism 
-- the idea that Jews should choose traditions that help them and 
bypass those that do not.

<HEADLINE> Finalists Picked for 'Maglev' Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Projects in seven states are in the running to  
build the nation's first magnetic levitation train, a high-speed 
rail system that promises to relieve congested highways and 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven ``maglev'' finalists in California, Florida, Georgia,  
Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada and Pennsylvania were announced Monday. 
Four others -- one each in Colorado and Virginia and two in Alabama 
-- were rejected for unspecified reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven selected projects will get $12 million combined in  
grants for further studies on their feasibility, and one will be 
chosen next year for development and construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must get people out of the autos, off the highways,'' said  
Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening. ``The only way we can do that is 
to have an acceptable alternative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His state was designated a finalist for a Baltimore-Washington  
route expected to take 16 minutes, down from the current 35 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Cioletti, manager of systems engineering with Maglev Inc.,  
which is proposing a Pittsburgh-to-Philadelphia route, said maglev 
would offer advantages over airports by directly serving the city's 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The trains, using electromagnetic forces to lift the train above  
ground and free it of speed-reducing friction, could run about 
three times the speed of conventional trains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every great accomplishment was first and for a period of time  
a dream,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said at the B &AMP; O 
Railroad Museum, with vintage locomotives and boxcars serving as a 
backdrop. ``I'm delighted to give fire to this dream, this 
thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maglev systems are already being tested in Germany and Japan,  
but no such system is in commercial service anywhere in the world. 
Critics say that while the technology works in test settings, many 
questions remain over full-scale operations and costs. 
</P>
<P>
	A transportation law last year authorized $1 billion to build  
one maglev system, but Congress still needs to appropriate most of 
that money. A U.S. maglev is not expected in full service for at 
least a decade, Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maglev operates on basic magnetic principles: When two magnets  
are put together, opposite poles attract, similar ones repel. 
Either magnetic attraction or repulsion can be used to lift or push 
the car above the guideway. In both cases, the train moves as the 
magnetic field travels along the guideway. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify for construction funding, sponsors must be able to  
show that trains will reach speeds of at least 240 mph, about three 
times the top speeds on most Amtrak routes. Researchers believe the 
trains can hit 310 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak is expected to reach about half of maglev's theoretical  
speed when the 150-mph Acela trains are introduced between 
Washington and Boston later this year. Trains already run at 125 
mph along the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amtrak's approach is the incremental approach where we invest  
in existing rights of way,'' said Amtrak's Clifford Black. ``It 
remains to be seen whether (maglev) technology will justify its 
costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he said Amtrak was open to embracing the  
technology later once it is proven. For now, the projects are being 
pushed by state, regional and business leaders, who would have to 
come up with one-third of any costs.

<HEADLINE>  Tyson Released From Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After spending 3 1/2 months behind bars, Mike  
Tyson is free to fight again. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion was released Monday from a  
suburban Maryland jail where he was serving time for assaulting two 
motorists over a fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
	Smiling and waving, Tyson walked out of the Rockville, Md.,  
facility wearing a T-shirt, gray sweat pants and prison-issued 
sandals. He said nothing to reporters as he and a friend walked to 
a nearby car where his wife, Monica, waited to take him home to 
change clothes before meeting with his probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson spokesman Peter Seligman promised: ``We will be announcing  
very shortly plans on Mike's return to the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final obstacle to Tyson's release was cleared with an  
announcement Monday that an Indiana judge had ended Tyson's 
probation for a 1992 rape conviction. On Friday, the Maryland 
Parole Commission voted 5-1 to grant the fighter's release, but 
Indiana authorities needed to approve the decision before he could 
go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will be on parole until February, said Leonard A. Sipes, a  
spokesman for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and 
Correctional Services. He also must meet certain probation 
conditions -- including 200 hours of community service -- in the next 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sipes said Tyson will be subject to urine testing for illicit  
drugs for at least twice a week and unannounced home visits by 
state authorities. He must also receive permission before leaving 
Maryland, complete a psychiatric evaluation and undergo anger 
management treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizefighter pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault  
charges that stemmed from a minor traffic accident in suburban 
Gaithersburg, Md. He was sentenced on Feb. 5 to one year in a 
Montgomery County jail, but 60 days were added as punishment for 
violating probation on his rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	In her ruling in Indiana, Marion County Superior Court Judge  
Patricia Gifford said the jail time Tyson served in Maryland 
satisfied the penalty he incurred for violating terms of his 
Indiana probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley Finkel, Tyson's manager, said he plans to ``sit down and  
talk with Mike about his boxing plans,'' but he sees no reason why 
Tyson cannot resume his career. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Kemp, the boxer's attorney, said Tyson's first priority  
is to ``try and relax and be with his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all that he's been looking forward to for the past 3 1/2  
months,'' he said. ``Careerwise, there's talk about trying to 
resume his career; that is to think about tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has three fights remaining on a deal with the MGM Grand in  
Las Vegas and at least three more fights with Showtime, the cable 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old boxer last fought Jan. 16 and was behind on all  
three cards before he knocked out Francois Botha in the fifth round 
at Las Vegas. That fight was Tyson's first after getting back his 
boxing license, which Nevada boxing authorities had revoked the 
previous October because Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's 
ear on June 28, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday  
on the back of a sharp fall overnight on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 176.26  
points, or 1.08 percent, to finish at 16,214.23. On Monday, the 
average rose 97.51 points, or 0.60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors were worried that Japanese banks might  
have another difficult fiscal year. The fears were sparked by news 
reports Tuesday that 16 of Japan's largest banks held a total of 
20.9 trillion yen ($171.3 billion) in bad loans as of March 31, the 
end of the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time that banks have reported the loans under  
new standards which more accurately illustrate the true scale of 
the problem, according to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Also dampening sentiment was an overnight fall on Wall Street,  
where the Dow Jones industrial average shed 174.61 points -- or 1.6 
percent -- to stand at 10,654.67 at Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar was quoted at 122.72 yen in late trading, down  
1.32 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 123.21 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai share prices slumped, with the key index falling 4 percent  
in a late selling spree. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand, or SET, Index fell 18.93 points  
to 451.05. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the key Hang Seng Index fell 89.95 points, or 0.7  
percent, closing at 12,346.91. On Monday, the index had gained 
164.72 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said prices fell in reaction to the overnight tumble on  
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also cautious because of uncertainty over whether  
interest rates will rise, but ``quite a number of them'' were 
waiting for buying opportunities when the index falls a bit lower, 
said Josephine Hui, director at Celestial Asia Securities Holdings 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand share prices closed sharply lower as weaker global  
share markets sent the key index plummeting into negative 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 62.47 points, or 2.9  
percent, to 2,094.50. It was the index's lowest close since Dec. 
31, 1998 when it finished at 2065.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed sharply lower as investors dumped  
stocks on fear of more corporate failures following reports that 
Shin Yen Industrial Co. was in financial trouble. The Weighted 
Stock Price Index fell 171.20 points, or 2.3 percent, to 7,417.03. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed sharply higher, raising  
hopes that the market's recent bull run would remain intact even 
after its current consolidation, dealers said. The benchmark 
Composite Index rose 2 percent, or 14.76 points, to 758.10. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower as investors cashed in on  
gains following Wall Street's loss Monday, traders said. The 
30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index, the PSE Index, fell 
35.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,370.37. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower in reaction to the  
fall on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries Index closed at 2911.5, 
down 1.3 percent, or 37.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed slightly higher. The Korea Composite  
Stock Price Index rose 3.09 points, or 0.4 percent, to 698.69. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed higher on speculative buying  
in telecommunication blue chips and second-line stocks. The

<HEADLINE>  NY Cop Pleads Guilty in Louima Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For three weeks, it was Officer Justin Volpe's  
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A parade of witnesses took turns implicating Volpe in the  
torture of a Haitian immigrant in a brutality case that shocked the 
city and shattered the ``blue wall of silence'' -- the solidarity 
that keeps police officers from testifying against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said the burly, stone-faced officer bragged about the  
attack. Others said he waved a piece of a broom stick used to 
sodomize his prisoner. The names of the other four police officers 
at the defense table rarely came up. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the jury returns to Brooklyn federal court today, the  
lead defendant will be conspicuously absent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday -- with his mid-trial bid for a plea bargain rejected  
and chances of an acquittal obliterated -- Volpe pleaded guilty to 
violating the civil rights of the prisoner, Abner Louima. 
</P>
<P>
	``There came a point in time where the evidence became  
overwhelming,'' said Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe's dramatic decision could land him in prison for the rest  
of his life. What it meant for his codefendants was much less 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney John Patten said he intended to ask for a  
mistrial. Volpe's departure creates ``a prejudice that adheres to 
everyone else at the defense table,'' said Patten, who represents 
Sgt. Michael Bellomo. 
</P>
<P>
	Other defense attorneys said it was more likely Judge Eugene  
Nickerson would resume the trial after briefly informing the 12 
jurors that Volpe had pleaded guilty -- and say no more. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, admitted ramming a stick into the handcuffed victim's  
rectum, pulling it out and putting it up to his face. He said he 
mistakenly believed Louima had punched him while police tried to 
quell a disturbance outside a nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickerson asked Volpe: ``You intended to humiliate him, did you?  
You thought you were mad at him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe relied: ``I was mad at the time, yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Without Volpe, the spotlight could shift to Officer Charles  
Schwarz, who is accused of holding down Louima, 32, during the 
assault in the bathroom of the stationhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Volpe, Schwarz and Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder  
also are charged with beating Louima in a patrol car en route to 
the 70th police precinct after his arrest on false charges he 
punched Volpe. Bellomo, their supervisor, is charged with covering 
up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima has identified Schwarz as the second bathroom assailant.  
Two police officers also testified that they saw the officer 
searching Louima at the front desk of the station hours before 
marching him in the general direction of the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	During Tuesday's hearing, Volpe said another officer was present  
during the attack in the bathroom. When pressed by the judge, he 
said the other officer did not hit Louima but ``saw what was going 
on and did nothing to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was understood from the circumstances that the police  
officer would do nothing to stop me or report it to anyone,'' Volpe 
said. Volpe did not name the officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz has denied ever being in the bathroom.

<HEADLINE> Court Justices Took 100 Free Trips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When they weren't hearing oral arguments or  
working on decisions, the nine members of the Supreme Court 
collectively were a busy band of travelers in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial disclosure forms released Monday show they took 100  
trips paid for by others last year, mostly for speaking 
engagements, short-term teaching stints or programs with legal 
officials in other countries. The exact costs weren't listed. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading traveler was Justice Antonin Scalia, who took 24  
trips paid for by a variety of state bar associations, 
universities, nonprofit associations and the New York Stock 
Exchange. Scalia visits included Venice, Italy and Dublin, Ireland 
as well as the Bronx and Macon, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Justice David Souter took only one paid trip: a  
moot court competition financed by Harvard Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	Some forays were unusual. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, for  
instance, got a free ride to dedicate the new Sandra Day O'Connor 
High School last September in San Antonio, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I delivered a speech and met with students and faculty,''  
O'Connor reported on her form. ``The school paid for my round-trip 
air transportation and overnight lodging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor also received a carved limestone piece worth $175 from  
the school and listed two other such gifts: a $1,500 crystal cameo 
for a lecture at Scripps College and an $875 Steuben glass 
sculpture from the Junior Leagues International. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalia had to attach a separate letter to his form because he  
originally forgot to list four prints and one tempura painting 
worth a combined $350 he was given by artist Giacinto Orfanello. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg received a combined $14,000 in  
honoraria for speaking engagements at three college law schools, 
but she didn't accept any of it. Instead, Ginsburg designated the 
money for Georgetown University's women's law school program, a 
children's foundation and for the Columbia Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer listed eight trips, including the  
annual Dec. 29-31 get-together known as ``Renaissance Weekend'' in 
Hilton Head, S.C., also a yearly trek for President Clinton. 
``Participated in panels,'' Breyer noted dryly about the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the justices reported outside income for teaching law  
courses or delivering university lectures. Two reached the $20,000 
legal limit: Scalia, who listed seven teaching jobs, and Justice 
Anthony M. Kennedy, who had four. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William Rehnquist listed income from two teaching  
positions, $12,500 from St. Mary's University and $6,282 from the 
University of Arizona School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist's annual salary is $175,400; the court's other eight  
members are paid $167,900 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	As in years past, the wealthiest justice was Ginsburg, who with  
her husband, attorney Martin D. Ginsburg, listed assets ranging 
between $5.9 million and $24.1 million. Next in wealth is Breyer, 
who reported between $4.4 million and $11 million in assets -- 
compared to last year's $4.3 million to $15.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the income scale is Justice Clarence Thomas,  
who listed assets of between $30,002 and $175,000, composed mainly 
of part ownership of rental properties in Savannah, Ga., and Omaha, 
Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are 1998 assets reported by the other justices:  
</P>
<P>
	--Kennedy, $30,002 to $265,000, virtually the same as 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	--O'Connor, $2.5 million to $5.7 million, about the same as 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	--Rehnquist, $360,008 to $960,000, up from $210,000 to $590,000.  
</P>
<P>
	--Scalia, $645,006 to $1.5 million, virtually unchanged.  
</P>
<P>
	--Souter, $1.1 million to $5.3 million, the same.  
</P>
<P>
	--Justice John Paul Stevens, $1.4 million to $2.9 million, up  
from $1.2 million to $2.74 million.

<HEADLINE> Panel Hears Testimony on JFK Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Is Abraham Zapruder's home movie of the  
assassination of President Kennedy just a thin strip of celluloid 
wrapped on a reel or more like Vincent van Gogh's ``Sunflowers,'' 
which sold for $40 million in 1987? 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member arbitration panel began hearing testimony Tuesday  
to decide how much the government must pay the Zapruder family for 
the half-minute of history captured on 8mm film. The government 
must compensate the family because the Assassination Records Review 
Board in 1997 declared the film the permanent possession of the 
people of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is how much. The Zapruder family, represented by  
LMH Co., is asking $30 million. The government is offering $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Government appraiser C.C.M. Associates says that without  
projection, the 8mm Zapruder film is a ``tiny strip of celluloid 
tightly wound on a plastic reel.'' Moreover, the government argues 
that Kennedy memorabilia sells for thousands, not millions, of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the Sotheby's auction house in New York sold 1,200  
items from the estate of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy. The 
most expensive piece -- an antique French desk where President 
Kennedy signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty -- sold for $1.4 million. 
The entire collection took in about $34 million, government 
appraisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When compared to those results, LMH's demand of $30 million  
for the Zapruder film, an item President Kennedy never touched, is 
staggering,'' the government wrote in a brief. 
</P>
<P>
	Appraisers for the Zapruder family argue, however, the film is a  
piece of history or artwork that should be valued like the works of 
van Gogh or pop artist Andy Warhol's ``Orange Marilyn'' silkscreen 
of Marilyn Monroe, which sold for $17.3 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a cultural icon, a historic document and a unique object  
that has itself become the embodiment of one of the most 
significant and well-remembered events of the 20th century,'' 
appraiser Beth Gates Warren wrote in a brief to bolster the 
Zapruders' case. ``Additionally, the film is inextricable bound to 
the powerful Kennedy mystique and the controversy surrounding 
President Kennedy's murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sylvia Leonard Wolf, who appraised the Zapruder film for $40  
million, says the film is an example of vernacular photography -- 
``photography with no artistic intent'' -- that's been moving onto 
the art scene. ``Modern art museums often show videos that lack 
narrative and simply record aspects of everyday life,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years ago, the Museum of Modern Art displayed pictures of  
bank robberies taken by automatic bank cameras, according to Ms. 
Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the Zapruder film, which captures a profound moment of the  
20th century in a deeply moving and visually compelling way, any 
less artistic than a picture developed from film taken of burglars 
by a bank surveillance camera?'' she asks. ``I would say that the 
Zapruder film as a work of art far surpasses these pictures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides initially tried to negotiate a price for the film.  
In October, with negotiations going nowhere, they summoned 
arbitrators and agreed on a $30 million ceiling price. The deal 
does not include the copyright on the film, which the Zapruder 
family will retain. 
</P>
<P>
	After the hearing at the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, the  
arbitrators have 30 days to determine how much the government must 
pay for the film, preserved in 25-degree temperature in a room at 
the National Archives in College Park, Md.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Threatens To Fire Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- The dispute between Cathay Pacific Airways and  
its senior pilots worsened Tuesday after the company threatened to 
fire pilots who refuse a revised pay package and the pilots 
responded with threats of industrial action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will use all means at our disposal to resist Cathay  
Pacific's tactics,'' said John Findlay, general secretary of the 
Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the pilots would strike if Cathay refused to return to  
the table, he said: ``We will rule out nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After nine weeks of unsuccessful talks with the association, the  
Hong Kong carrier decided Tuesday to bypass the union and sent 
letters directly to its pilots, offering them a sweetened deal.

<P>
	But the letter also said they risk losing their jobs if they do  
not accept the deal or choose a resignation package. The airline 
extended its deadline for acceptance to June 11; it had been next 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots' union issued a statement calling Cathay's demands  
``totally unreasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our members will not sign a non-negotiated contract,'' the  
statement said. It added that the union believed ``agreement can 
still be reached by negotiation, and we remain ready to talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay Pacific, which plunged into the red for the first time in  
35 years because of Asia's financial crisis, asked its senior 
pilots in March to take pay cuts averaging 8 percent in exchange 
for stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pilots accuse Cathay of using a short-term economic  
problem to slash pay permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	They rejected the original package, asking instead that the  
company promise the senior pilots pay increases of 3 percent after 
two years of pay cuts and one year of a pay freeze. They also asked 
Cathay for guarantees of annual pay increases for junior pilots and 
higher provident fund contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the revised offer, Cathay is asking its pilots to accept a 7  
percent pay cut phased in over two years. It is also giving the 
pilots 10 years to exercise their stock options, instead of eight 
as proposed previously. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay also is offering junior pilots, who joined after 1993 and  
are subject to different pay scales and conditions, a 7 percent to 
10 percent pay rise over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots' pay dispute follows Cathay's recent battle with its  
flight attendants, who eventually conceded to management demands 
that they work more hours in exchange for a pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay lost 542 million Hong Kong dollars ($69 million) last  
year.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 1.47 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in the first half-hour of  
trading today as technology stocks continued to languish. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 1.47 at 10,653.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 2.42 at 1,304.23, and the Nasdaq 
composite index, dominated by technology issues, was down 22.30 at 
2,431.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, the Dow fell 174.61 points to close at 10,654.67 as  
high-flying Internet stocks tumbled. Analysts say that as hints of 
inflation have prompted the Federal Reserve to consider raising 
interest rates, investors are moving away from high-priced stocks 
that earn little or no profits. The sector failed to rebound in 
early trading today, as Yahoo shed another 4 3/8 to trade at 133 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking stocks also dropped Monday after an investment analyst  
downgraded several major banks, citing concerns about the Year 2000 
computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, First Union Corp. offered a more old-fashioned warning.  
The bank said it expects its second-quarter earnings to fall far 
short of analysts' estimates as it continues paying for its 1998 
acquisition of CoreStates Financial Corp. Its shares plunged 5 
15/16 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical stocks, which tend to mirror the trends of the broader  
economy, were mostly higher today. 3M rose 1 3/8 to 91 3/16, the 
strongest gainer among the Dow components. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 94.1 million 
shares, ahead of Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 0.73 at 625.32, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.51 at 785.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.60 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.04 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.49 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.54 percent.

<HEADLINE> Militia Leader Given 40 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) -- A militia member convicted of plotting  
to blow up government buildings and threatening to murder federal 
officers was sentenced Tuesday to 40 years in prison without the 
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford Metcalf, 48, was convicted in November of weapons and  
conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	During a 90-minute rambling speech before being sentenced,  
Metcalf accused the judge, the jury and prosecutors of conspiring 
against him. He represented himself at the trial and sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of three North American Militia members arrested last  
year as part of what the government said was a plot to blow up TV 
and radio stations, electric transformers and federal buildings, 
including the Internal Revenue Service office. 
</P>
<P>
	During Metcalf's trial, prosecutor Lloyd Meyer used weapons  
seized at his home to portray Metcalf as a danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors saw two dozen semiautomatic firearms, including a sniper  
rifle, as well as machine guns, grenades and thousands of rounds of 
ammunition the government claimed was proof that Metcalf was 
helping train militia members for a violent uprising. 
</P>
<P>
	Metcalf contended all the weapons seized from his home,  
including those the government said were machine guns, were all 
legal to own. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Carter, 48, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and was  
sentenced to five years in prison last week. Randy Graham, 42, was 
convicted earlier this year of conspiracy and drug charges. He will 
be sentenced next month.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today, with a  
bipartisan House report that Chinese spying has obtained top-secret 
information about every U.S. nuclear weapon he will enact more than 
two dozen recommendations to safeguard America's nuclear secrets. 
During an appearance in Texas, Clinton said his administration was 
moving aggressively to tighten security at nuclear laboratories and 
would work with Congress to follow the recommendations of the 
special committee. But he also said the administration would keep 
on dealing with China on a range of matters because that, too, was

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone had 23 points and Bryon  
Russell added 22 as the Utah Jazz avoided elimination by beating 
the Portland Trail Blazers 88-71 Tuesday night at the Delta Center. 
The victory cut Portland's second-round series lead to 3-2 and 
forced Game 6 Thursday at the Rose Garden. The game featured the 
ejection of Portland coach Mike Dunleavy, an elbow from Karl Malone 
that bloodied Brian Grant and numerous testy exchanges between 
players from both teams. The Jazz are hoping to become the seventh 
team in NBA history to recover from a 3-1 deficit to win a series, 
the most recent being the Miami Heat, who beat the Knicks in seven 
games in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Mir To Stay Up Until 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Russia's Mir space station will stay  
up until next year and possibly longer if the program manages to 
land private funding, a top space official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got more than 10 tons of scientific hardware on board  
the Mir station,'' said Boris Ostroumov, deputy director general of 
the Russian Space Agency. ``I thought Americans are very practical 
people. It simply does not make too much sense to get rid of such a 
treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Russia's keen desire to keep Mir flying as long as  
possible, Ostroumov said the 13-year-old outpost will not siphon 
money or cargo ships away from the new international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	The international space station is Russia's top priority no  
matter how long Mir remains in orbit, he stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	In town for Discovery's launch to the international space  
station on Thursday with 4,300 pounds of supplies, Ostroumov said 
his agency has enough money to keep Mir flying through August. But 
Mir's present orbit of more than 200 miles is such that it would be 
safe through February, even if it's unstaffed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Russian space officials had assured NASA that Mir  
would come down in August unless private investors could be found. 
Ostroumov declined to give any details on how the search was going. 
But he did acknowledge there was no way any Mir artifacts could be 
returned to Earth for auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, we've thought almost of any possible outcome or  
any possible way out of this situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just about everyone agrees Russia cannot afford more than one  
space station given the country's economic crisis. A crucial 
control module is 1 1/2 years behind schedule, for instance, and has 
stalled the entire assembly of the international space station as 
Russian engineers try to complete and test it with what little 
money they have. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why NASA is so anxious for Mir to come down -- so the  
Russians can devote all their time, energy and resources to the 
new, 16-nation space station. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Russian space program cannot find private investors to  
keep Mir going, the current three-man crew likely will be the last, 
Ostroumov said. The station would be dragged down through the 
atmosphere by an attached cargo ship sometime after February and 
burn up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The details of Mir's fiery plunge -- as well as the decision to  
do so -- would be worked out by space station designers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all understand that we cannot support two programs at the  
same time,'' Ostroumov said. ``No matter how badly we feel about 
that, we would have to say goodbye to the Mir station. The question 
is: When and how?''

<HEADLINE> Court Mulls TV-Police Partnerships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The scene is repeated every day across  
America: Police officers armed with warrants burst into a house in 
search of a quarry. 
</P>
<P>
	When a camera crew is invited to follow, the images often make  
powerful television, appearing on ``COPS,'' ``LAPD: Life on the 
Beat'' and the Spanish-language program ``Placas'' (``Shields''), 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	But such reality TV shows may find police less welcoming  
following two Supreme Court decisions Monday allowing police to be 
sued financially over the filming of arrests or searches on private 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court ruled that so-called ``media ride-alongs'' may  
violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable 
searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this may dampen officers' desire to take media with  
them. This is one more thing on the side of `is it worth it?''' 
said Penny Parrish, spokeswoman for the Minneapolis Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Other departments said the ruling reinforces a trend.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Police Department decided several years ago to bar  
camera crews from accompanying its officers because of privacy 
concerns, spokeswoman Marilyn Mode said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the Los Angeles Police Department reaffirmed  
guidelines barring TV crews from entering private property without 
an owner's permission. When it comes to weighing ride-along 
requests, a news program would get priority over a reality show, a 
police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're satisfied with the court's ruling,'' police Lt. Anthony  
Alba said. ``We're already engaged in a media ride-along policy 
that mirrors their ruling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Langley, the executive producer of ``COPS,'' said he  
expects his camera crews to conduct ``business as usual'' since the 
show already tries to respect privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
	```COPS' routinely obtains permission when filming on private  
property and also obtains releases from everyone involved in the 
program,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Nelson, a reality TV producer for Termite Art Productions,  
also said the court ruling won't affect his operations. His company 
makes sure people sign release agreements and that victims' faces 
are blurred and their names omitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``There already are restrictions applied due to common sense and  
common decency,'' Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rulings still will allow media to accompany police officers  
as long as journalists stay outside when officers enter private 
homes, said attorney Richard Cordray, who represented police 
officers in the two cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling also only concerns people's homes and does not  
restrict reporters' right to join police officers at work, or 
photographers' right to shoot pictures in public places. 
</P>
<P>
	News organizations including The Washington Post, CNN and The  
Associated Press argued the ruling may discourage police from 
allowing the media to accompany them even for permissible purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The rulings involved cases in Maryland and Montana.  
</P>
<P>
	In the Maryland case, Montgomery County sheriff's deputies and  
deputy U.S. marshals took along a Washington Post reporter and 
photographer when they entered Charles and Geraldine Wilson's home 
in Rockville. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers wanted to arrest the Wilsons' fugitive adult son,  
who was not at their home but turned himself in later. Photographs, 
one showing Wilson wearing only his undershorts with a police 
officer's gun at his head, were not published. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montana case was filed by Paul and Erma Berger against  
federal agents and a prosecutor who let a CNN reporter and camera 
crew accompany them to the couple's ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Government agents were seeking evidence of eagle poisoning, but  
Paul Berger was convicted only of improper use of a pesticide, a 
minor offense. CNN later aired footage of the raid.

</P>
<P>
	Guru Hanuman spent his life on the banks of Yamuna River in New

	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Entrepreneur John Burton Tigrett, who  
amassed a fortune as a toy maker and bus company executive and was 
an adviser to politicians, businessmen and musicians, died May 18. 
He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, a family friend, recalled his excitement  
as a child when his mother took him to Tigrett's toy factory. It 
was ``the closest thing you could get to Willie Wonka.'' He said 
Tigrett later became an adviser to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigrett amassed a fortune through an array of ventures -- as a  
book salesman, an executive with American Burlington Bus Lines and 
an investor in patents. 
</P>
<P>
	His most famous patent was probably for the ``drinking duck''  
novelty toy known as the Glub-Glub, a whimsical bird that appears 
to drink water from a glass as it bobs back and forth. He paid $800 
for the patent in the 1950s and sold 22 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He also invented children's mesh playpens after his baby son  
John cut himself on a wooden one. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigrett wrote the 1998 book ``Fair &AMP; Square,'' a collection of  
reminiscences on his life and career.

<HEADLINE> Study: Older People Falling More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Older people are falling and getting hurt at an  
alarmingly increasing rate, probably because the number of elderly 
is rising and many are taking medications that can cause them to 
lose their balance, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	A 25-year study from Finland found a startling increase in both  
the number and rate of falls among people over 50, and a U.S. 
expert said the trend is probably the same in other developed 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, led by Dr. Pekka Kannus of UKK Institute for Health  
Promotion and Research in Tampere, Finland, was published in 
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 10 percent of older people who fall are hospitalized for  
an injury, and about half of those involve broken bones, said Dr. 
Mary E. Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at Yale University School of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	For many older people, a fall that breaks a bone -- especially a  
hip -- causes them to lose their mobility and their independence and 
is the beginning of a downward spiral that ends in death. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that the number of falls among Finns over 50  
nearly quadrupled, from 5,622 in 1970 to 21,574 in 1995. The rate 
of falls practically tripled, from 494 per 100,000 people to 1,398. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when the researchers took into account the greater  
proportion of Finns who were old in 1995 compared with 1970, the 
incidence of falls was found to have more than doubled among both 
men and women. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not explore why the Finns were falling more, but  
the researchers noted previous research suggesting that thinning 
bones and dwindling muscular strength as people age are culprits. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, old people have other medical problems, their mobility  
deteriorates and they use a greater number of medications, which 
can increase the risk of falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Tinetti said the good news is that fall-prevention measures  
clearly work and are simple. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had to pick two, it would be exercise for strength and  
balance, and medication reduction -- those are the most effective,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For a healthy older person, good exercise might be tai chi or  
dance, she said. A frailer person might need physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tinetti said research shows that older people taking four or  
more medicines are at higher risk. These people should work with a 
doctor to minimize the number and doses to the lowest levels 
required, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has a  
fall-prevention program that calls for these and other measures, 
including eliminating hazards in the home and installing hand rails 
and grab bars. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

envelope to Don't Let a Fall Be Your Last Trip, American Academy of

<HEADLINE> Springer Distributor Halts Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jerry Springer's bodyguards may be looking for  
new work. 
</P>
<P>
	The television distributor for ``The Jerry Springer Show''  
issued an order forbidding fights and has replaced some scheduled 
episodes with tamer shows. The actions are apparently another 
fallout from the recent school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will produce and distribute a program that we feel is  
responsible -- no violence, physical confrontation or profanity,'' 
Springer syndicator Studios USA said in a statement on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	All three ingredients helped rocket Springer's talk show to the  
top of the ratings, with episodes often degenerating into 
hair-pulling, fists-flying donnybrooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer had no comment on the order, a spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
	New programs will have to meet the no-violence standard and  
reruns will be edited to take out any fights, Studios USA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will inform stations that we are not providing any Jerry  
Springer program if these standards cannot be met,'' the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Studios USA pulled scheduled Springer episodes titled ``Guess  
What? I'm Bisexual'' and ``I'm Proud to be a Prostitute'' this 
week. They were replaced with shows about tall people and street 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think you're seeing the reaction to Littleton, to last  
week's school shooting and the reaction to Jenny Jones,'' said 
Richard Kurlander, an expert on syndication for Petry TV. ``Those 
three are coming together to move a lot of people toward the 
center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a Michigan jury issued a $25 million verdict  
against ``The Jenny Jones Show'' for negligence in the shooting 
death of a homosexual guest who admitted a crush on another man. 
</P>
<P>
	Several prime-time shows depicting violence have been yanked  
from the air by networks since the Littleton school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer's studio, while reaping the benefits of his high  
ratings, has tried to rein him in before. A year ago, the studio 
ordered Springer to have security guards move faster to defuse 
explosive situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio blamed its own staff, however, for doing a poor job  
of policing the show.

<HEADLINE> O'Donnell's Gun Crusade Off Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell hasn't exactly had an  
unobstructed shot in her advocacy for gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk television's ``Queen of Nice'' has argued on the air about  
guns with actor Tom Selleck, become a target for Howard Stern and 
was accused -- in a report heatedly denied -- of trying to alter a 
Broadway show lyric because it conflicted with her views. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advocacy has at least given the National Rifle Association  
and gun control advocates something new to argue about. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell reportedly asked the cast of Broadway's ``Annie Get  
Your Gun'' to change a song lyric in ``Anything You Can Do'' before 
taping her show. She supposedly wanted the line ``I can shoot a 
partridge with a single cartridge'' removed, but the show's stars 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell's spokeswoman, Laura Mandel, and a representative of  
the musical both denied the talk show host asked for the line to be 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	After initially considering singing ``Anything You Can Do'' on  
O'Donnell's show, producers of the Broadway revival decided to 
perform the song ``My Defenses Are Down,'' which doesn't mention 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The producers wanted a song that featured more of the cast,  
spokesman Pete Sanders said. If O'Donnell was so sensitive about 
guns, he said, she wouldn't have booked a Broadway show with guns 
in the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Tempers had only begun to cool since the O'Donnell-Selleck  
donnybrook last week. Since the Columbine High School massacre, 
O'Donnell has called for legislation that would make it harder for 
minors to get guns. Selleck was asked to talk about the issue 
because he participated in an NRA ad. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't a congenial chat.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's entitled to her views,'' said NRA spokesman Bill Powers.  
``She certainly didn't treat Mr. Selleck with the same sort of 
respect or courtesy that my mother taught me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell apologized to Selleck, saying she didn't intend to  
embarrass him. She said she assumed he would be better prepared to 
debate the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell soon found herself with another potential debate  
partner. Stern publicly questioned whether O'Donnell was being 
hypocritical by fighting for gun control and being a commercial 
spokeswoman for Kmart, which sells guns. 
</P>
<P>
	On her show Friday, O'Donnell said Kmart was a responsible  
seller of hunting rifles, which are legal to own. She said she's 
interested in gun control efforts for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Naomi Paiss, spokeswoman for the lobbying group Handgun Control,  
said her office was flooded with more than 1,000 calls, mostly from 
people who wanted to help, after the number was flashed on the 
screen during O'Donnell's show. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's spoken to an audience that wouldn't be caught dead  
watching `The McLaughlin Group,''' Paiss said. ``She's been very 
brave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Countered the NRA's Powers: ``I don't think anybody who treats  
people with that much of a lack of respect has much of a platform. 
When you're shrill and rude, your platform diminishes.''

<HEADLINE> Air Force Sees No Conflict in Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force said Monday it found no conflict  
of interest with a general who led the investigation into the crash 
of a Lockheed-Martin plane and then took a job with the plane's 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 crash of the Lockheed HC-130P Hercules cargo plane,  
known as ``King 56,'' killed 10 Portland, Ore.-based Air Force 
Reserve crewmen. One man survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Bobby O. Floyd ordered tests on the last major issue  
of the crash investigation in August 1998, five months before his 
Lockheed Martin job interviews began, the Air Force said. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd also recused himself from actions involving  
Lockheed-Martin more than two months before his first job interview 
with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our review establishes there was no conflict of interest,''  
said a letter from Lt. Gen. David Vesely, the Air Force's assistant 
vice chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vesely acknowledged that Floyd did not recuse himself from  
the crash investigation until March -- more than a month after his 
first job interviews with Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	That finding prompted a sharply worded statement from Sen. Ron  
Wyden, D-Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it astonishing that the Air Force does not deny General  
Floyd's continued involvement in the King 56 investigation well 
after he sought employment with Lockheed-Martin, yet concludes 
there is nothing wrong with this,'' Wyden said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been critical of the Air Force investigation and had  
asked the service to look into the timing of Floyd's 
Lockheed-Martin job and whether it presented a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving Vesely's letter, Wyden said the Air Force still  
seems more interested in protecting itself and its contractors that 
in conducting an unbiased investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for a ``truly independent'' inquiry.  
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's 21-man investigation team, which included an  
investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board, could 
find no fatal flaws with Hercules aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The final report on the crash found that the crew ran a fuel  
tank dry, causing all four engines to fail and the plane to 
tailspin into the Pacific off Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	But family members of some of the dead airmen dispute those  
findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Several claim a drop in electrical voltage crippled fuel flow to  
the plane's engines, and they filed a 1997 federal lawsuit accusing 
Lockheed and the Allison Engine Co. of building an aircraft with 
defective parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd retired April 1. He and Lockheed Martin Aircraft &AMP;  
Logistics Centers said earlier this month that his employment with 
the South Carolina company presented no conflict of interest.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Concern about the future of Japan's debt ridden  
banks coupled with an overnight drop on Wall Street pushed Tokyo 
stocks lower today. The dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 176.26 points,  
or 1.08 percent, to finish at 16,214.23. On Monday, the average 
rose 97.51 points, or 0.60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.72 yen in late trading, down 1.32 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
123.21 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices slipped amid concerns about  
the health of Japan's banking sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors are worried that Japanese banks may have  
another difficult fiscal year. The fears were sparked by news 
reports today that 16 of Japan's largest banks held a total of 20.9 
trillion yen ($171.3 billion) in bad loans as of March 31, the end 
of the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time that banks have reported the loans under  
new standards which more accurately illustrate the true scale of 
the problem, according to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Also dampening sentiment was an overnight fall on Wall Street,  
where the Dow Jones industrial average shed 174.61 points or 1.6 
percent to stand at 10,654.67 at Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, trading was thin in Tokyo as many investors kept to the  
sidelines to monitor corporate earnings results, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With little macroeconomic or policy news to absorb, trading is  
focused on individual stocks,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general 
manager at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 445.06 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 410.78 million shares 
Monday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 795 to 380, while 138 
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was down 8.83 points, or 0.67 percent, to 
1,308.68. The TOPIX was up 7.84 points, or 0.60 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar remained under selling pressure  
from overseas players taking profits on recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the dollar climbed to a seven month high against the  
yen, rising above 124 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall in the Dow also worked against the dollar in Tokyo on  
today, analysts said. In addition, some dealers cited jitters about 
Argentina abandoning its currency board, although others downplayed 
such concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.35 yen, down  
from 131.22 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.3150 percent from Monday's finish of 
1.3500 percent, pushing its price up to 101.64 yen from 101.32 yen.

<HEADLINE> WB Shelves Violent 'Buffy' Episode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Her fictional rivals may not get her, but a  
growing skittishness among some TV executives about violence has 
taken ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer'' off the air for a second time 
in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB network has shelved tonight's episode that depicts  
students attacking a monstrous mayor, even though it's the season 
finale and the second of a two-part series that began last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will be explained to viewers on the air. A  
``Buffy'' rerun will run instead, and the shelved episode will air 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks are clearly becoming more concerned about violent  
content following the April 20 shooting at Colorado's Columbine 
High School that left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, CBS's president said he decided not to put a violent  
drama series about the mob on his fall schedule because of 
Columbine. Fox executives also said they would carefully monitor 
the content of two new dramas, one about a teen-aged police officer 
and the other about a violent ``virtual reality'' game. 
</P>
<P>
	With programs that heavily appeal to a teen-aged audience, the  
WB has a younger viewership than any other broadcast network. 
``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, is 
about a teen-aged vampire hunter and is one of the WB's most 
popular shows, critically and commercially. 
</P>
<P>
	The week following the Columbine shooting, the WB pulled a  
``Buffy'' episode where there was a fantasy sequence about high 
school carnage. That episode will be shown later this year, the 
network said. 
</P>
<P>
	In tonight's episode of ``Buffy,'' a solar eclipse occurs during  
a high school graduation ceremony and the town's mayor turns into a 
serpent. He attacks the students, who defend themselves with 
stakes, bows, arrows and other implements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the current climate, depicting acts of violence at a  
high school graduation ceremony, even fantasy acts against 60-foot 
serpents and vampires, we believe, is inappropriate to broadcast 
around the actual dates of these time-honored ceremonies,'' said 
Jamie Kellner, the network's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellner said the decision was made ``out of sympathy and  
compassion'' for families and communities affected by school 
violence and out of responsibility for the WB's young audience.

<HEADLINE> McKesson To Restate Earnings Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- For the second time in two months, medical  
supplies distributor McKesson HBOC Inc. is revising its fiscal 1999 
earnings downward after discovering more accounting problems in its 
recently acquired health information company HBO. The news sent its 
stock down more than 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson did not offer specific revisions, other than to say the  
restatement may also affect previous years' earnings reports, 
McKesson disclosed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize that this is creating uncertainties for investors,  
but we thought it proper that we should disclose this at this 
time,'' said McKesson spokesman Larry Kurtz. ``The previous release 
had identified there could be additional downward revisions, and we 
now know that for a fact, so we thought it proper to disclose 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson shares closed down $4.68 3/4 a share, at $33.50 on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson's shares plummeted nearly 50 percent, to $34.50, after  
it first acknowledged the first problem on April 28. The stock's 
52-week high had been $89.75. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed ``improper revenue recognition matters''  
involving software sales at HBO, which provides computer solutions 
to help health care providers manage their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson said it's still to early to project another revision of  
its earnings figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an ongoing process. When we have the final answer, we'll  
communicate fully,'' said Kurtz, adding that the review could take 
as long as July to complete. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four law firms have been retained by investors to  
consider a class-action suit alleging that false statements 
artificially inflated the profits of McKesson HBOC. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson is the nation's largest pharmaceutical supply  
management and health care information technology company. It 
bought HBOC in January. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 28, McKesson restated its fourth-quarter operating  
income to 56 cents a share, down from 62 cents, and its full-year 
operating income to $1.97 a share, down from $2.06. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-quarter net loss was revised to 27 cents a share from  
22 cents, and the full-year net income was revised to 75 cents a 
share from 84 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 22, McKesson reported a net loss of $60.4 million for  
the fourth quarter ended March 31, and net income of $237.1 million 
for the full year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it also reduced its earnings goal for its  
fiscal year ending March 2000, because it expects its software 
revenue to fall.

<HEADLINE> No Murder Charges for Florida Mom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A mother who shot and paralyzed her  
daughter will not be charged with murder even though her daughter 
died after winning the right to be taken off life support, a state 
official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Egan, 68, who has emphysema and is blind in one eye, is  
accused of shooting her 42-year-old daughter in March after 
overhearing her discuss putting her in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	She was charged with attempted murder, but after her daughter,  
Georgette Smith, died May 19 when taken off life support at her own 
request, prosecutors were left to decide whether to upgrade the 
charge against Ms. Egan to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ms. Egan's ``deteriorating health and her relationship  
to the victim, do not ... provide an appropriate circumstance for 
me to exercise my discretion by charging murder in this case,'' 
State Attorney Lawson Lamar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan, who is in jail, was relieved at the decision. Her  
lawyer said the daughter never wanted her mother prosecuted for 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had been confident all along that if prosecutors followed  
the wishes of Georgette Smith, this is the decision they would 
make,'' Bob Wesley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith, paralyzed from the neck down and barely able to  
speak, had to go to court to get permission to be taken off a 
ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullet that struck Ms. Smith in the neck tore through her  
spinal cord, leaving her unable to speak without effort, incapable 
of swallowing and unable to control her bladder. She was fed 
through a tube and ran a high risk of pneumonia, infections, ulcers 
and bedsores. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arbitrators To Decide on JFK Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The two sides wrangling over the value of  
Abraham Zapruder's historic home movie of the assassination of 
President John F. Kennedy are $29 million apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is offering $1 million while the Zapruder family,  
which compares the 26-second film to artwork by Dutch painter 
Vincent van Gogh or pop artist Andy Warhol, is asking $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Government appraiser C.C.M. Associates says that without  
projection, the Zapruder film is a ``tiny strip of celluloid 
tightly wound on a plastic reel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Steve Johnson, an appraiser for the Zapruders  
who thinks the film is worth more than $33.8 million, says its 
colors are akin to art. 
</P>
<P>
	``The colors are beautiful,'' Johnson writes in his appraisal.  
``The ever-familiar hues of the tragedy -- the pink of the first 
lady's outfit, the red of the wounds, the green of the grass, the 
bluish-black of the presidential limousine -- would not have been 
better if selected by Warhol or (French artist Henri) Matisse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Assassination Records Review Board declared the  
Zapruder film the permanent possession of the people of the United 
States, requiring the government to compensate the Zapruders for 
taking possession of the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiating a price, however, proved elusive.  
</P>
<P>
	In October, the two parties summoned arbitrators and agreed on a  
$30 million ceiling price. Since then, attorneys for the Justice 
Department and LMH Co., which represents the Zapruder family, have 
filed a thick stack of briefs. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member arbitration panel is to begin hearing testimony  
from both sides today. It's expected to take up to three days. The 
arbitrators have 30 days after the hearing concludes to decide how 
much the government must pay the Zapruder family for the 
half-minute of history captured on 8mm film. 
</P>
<P>
	Since July, copies of the film have been on sale for $20 at  
video stores nationwide. So far, 130,000 videos and digital video 
discs have been sold, said Natalie Olinger, a spokeswoman for MPI 
Home Video, a video production company in Orland Park, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zapruder family will retain the film's copyright. This  
dispute is over the original Zapruder film stored in a 25-degree 
room at the National Archives in College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Government appraisers say Kennedy memorabilia sells for  
thousands of dollars, not the millions that LMH Co. is demanding 
from the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the Sotheby's auction house in New York sold 1,200  
items from the estate of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy. The 
most expensive piece -- an antique French desk where President 
Kennedy signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty -- sold for $1.4 million. 
The entire collection garnered about $34 million, the government 
appraisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When compared to those results, LMH's demand of $30 million  
for the Zapruder film, an item President Kennedy never touched, is 
staggering,'' the government wrote in a brief. 
</P>
<P>
	Many historically significant films exist, including the 1934  
assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia as well as 
assassination attempts on Presidents Reagan and Ford. Yet the 
government argues that no appraiser documented a sale of the 
original film of any of these images. 
</P>
<P>
	``Films are desirable for their content, not as relics or  
icons,'' the government says. 
</P>
<P>
	Appraisers for the Zapruder family, however, see the film as a  
historic document or artwork that should be valued with the likes 
of van Gogh's ``Sunflowers,'' which sold for nearly $40 million in 
1987, or Warhol's ``Orange Marilyn'' silkscreen of Marilyn Monroe, 
which sold for $17.3 million last year.

<HEADLINE> Kmart Could Get Stuck With Leases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Kmart Corp. unloaded its Builders Square home  
improvement stores two years ago, but could be burdened with $761 
million in store leases if the new owners fail to keep up with its 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger Co. is struggling with widening losses and a cutback  
in credit from some of its vendors. In addition, the Largo, 
Md.-based company recently missed a large payment on its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Such problems may cause Hechinger to miss its lease payments.  
That would leave Troy, Mich.-based Kmart with the brunt of the 
financial obligation. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders Square was one of four subsidiaries that Kmart sold or  
spun off in recent years as it moved to focus on its discount 
stores. Under the deals, Kmart guaranteed leases now worth $1.2 
billion, of which $761 million is for Builders Square, according to 
a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company returned calls for comment placed Monday by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	After closely held Hechinger bought Builders Square in 1997, it  
merged its stores with two other chains to create the third-largest 
home-improvement retailer behind Home Depot and Lowe's. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Home Depot and Lowe's have added stores and boosted  
profits, while Hechinger has struggled. The company has been 
remodeling stores and shedding others, ending April with 206 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	In filings with the SEC earlier this month, Hechinger said it  
lost $208 million before one-time expenses on $509 million in 
revenue in the three months ending in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's outlook worsened Friday, when Standard &AMP; Poor's  
downgraded much of Hechinger's debt after it put off a $4.7 million 
interest payment. Standard &AMP; Poor's said in a news release that it 
thought Hechinger would miss other debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart, in an April SEC filing, said it had helped finance a new  
$50 million credit line for Hechinger. The company, however, said 
it had not set aside any money for lease guarantees, but would do 
so ``at the time the obligation was determined to be probable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the problem has the potential to hurt Kmart's bottom line,  
analysts said it was not an immediate threat to the company. If 
Kmart did have to cover the lease payments, it could threaten the 
retailer's recent turnaround, with its profits and sales steadily 
rising over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors need to be aware there would be a chain of events or  
several circumstances before there would be an ultimate liability 
at Kmart,'' said Roney &AMP; Co. analyst Scott Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said if Hechinger failed, Kmart could take several  
steps to cover its costs, such as subleasing. Meanwhile, he said, 
the outlook for Hechinger was dim. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look to Home Depot and Lowe's. They're thought to be the  
two consolidators going forward,'' Campbell said. ``They're just 
dominating the segment.''

<HEADLINE> Studio Execs Discuss Youth Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Hollywood studio executives huddled  
with Motion Picture Association of America president Jack Valenti 
to talk about Washington efforts to hold the entertainment industry 
accountable for schoolyard violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenti said Monday's closed-door meeting was called ``to talk  
about what's going on in the country -- the perceptions and the 
realisms -- and mainly how we can do something positive to be part 
of any national crusade, if one is mounted, to lessen youth 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a perception of rabid violence in the country that is  
contradicted by the numbers, which show that youth violence is 
going down. However, perception is what really counts in the 
world,'' Valenti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting, arranged by Valenti in the wake of a juvenile crime  
bill passed last week by the Senate that seeks to curb movie and TV 
violence, included executives from seven major studios. Valenti 
wouldn't say who attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more meetings are planned in coming weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	The high-level debate was a constructive ``give and take'' about  
how best to proceed as the Senate bill goes to the House of 
Representatives, unidentified sources who attended the breakfast 
told the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	But no specific strategies were agreed upon, Valenti said.  
</P>
<P>
	Times sources said Valenti's 30 or so guests included Paramount  
Pictures chiefs Jonathan Dolgen and Sherry Lansing; 20th Century 
Fox chief Bill Mechanic and Tom Sherak, chairman of Fox Domestic 
Film Group; Terry Semel and Bob Daly, co-studio chiefs at Warner 
Bros.; Bob Wynne, co-president of Sony Pictures Entertainment; 
Universal President Ron Meyer; Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney 
Studios; and two representatives from MGM, Chairman Alex 
Yemenidjian and Vice Chairman Chris McGurk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill includes several provisions aimed at reining in  
film and TV violence. It would launch an investigation by the 
Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to determine 
whether the entertainment industry targets children in marketing 
violent products. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenti has always been an advocate of self-restraint. Thirty  
years ago, he invented the MPAA ratings system, which the major 
studios submit their films to voluntarily, in part to lessen the 
possibility of state legislatures adopting their own regulations to 
govern film content.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Reagan, Thatcher Praise McCain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two grande dames of the conservative movement,  
Nancy Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, are giving Sen. John McCain's 
presidential campaign a boost. 
</P>
<P>
	In a note beginning ``My dear senator,'' the former British  
prime minister praised McCain's speeches and writings on the 
conflict in Kosovo. ``I wanted to write and tell you how much I 
admired and agreed with their contents,'' read the note released by 
McCain's GOP presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator has criticized President Clinton for ruling  
out the use of ground troops in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Though she has not endorsed McCain, Thatcher wrote, ``I very  
much hope that the wise and courageous leadership you are offering 
on this vital issue impresses others in Washington as much as it 
impresses me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Reagan also has not endorsed McCain, though she did ask  
that the senator accept an award Wednesday night on behalf of her 
husband. The American Conservative Union will honor Reagan as the 
conservative of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am honored and very grateful to have been asked to accept an  
award for that most eloquent, visionary, and steadfast apostle of 
freedom, President Reagan, and to have been encouraged by his 
staunch ally, Lady Margaret Thatcher, in my defense in the Balkans 
of the ideals they so ably advanced throughout the world,'' McCain 
said.

<HEADLINE>  NY Cop Pleads Guilty in Louima Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- His eyes red and voice cracking, a white police  
officer accused of torturing a Haitian immigrant with a wooden 
stick in a stationhouse bathroom pleaded guilty Tuesday after the 
``blue wall of silence'' came tumbling down around him. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Volpe, the central figure in an explosive brutality case  
that shocked the city and heightened racial tensions, pleaded 
guilty to civil rights charges three weeks into his trial. Four 
other white officers remain on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, could be sent to prison for life. No sentencing date  
was set. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer told U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson that he  
rammed a stick into the rectum of a handcuffed Abner Louima. He 
also pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for threatening 
Louima if he ever told anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe said he acted in a fit of rage because he mistakenly  
believed Louima had punched him while police tried to quell a brawl 
outside a nightclub in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe reluctantly admitted his role only after four fellow  
officers testified that he had borrowed gloves he later returned 
covered with blood and that he showed off the stick and boasted, 
``I took a man down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After showing little or no emotion throughout the trial, Volpe  
appeared to wipe away tears Tuesday in the packed courtroom. His 
voice barely rose above a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your honor, if I could just let the record reflect I'm sorry  
for hurting my family,'' he said before being taken away by 
marshals. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours later, he was dismissed from the force.  
</P>
<P>
	The top charge against Volpe -- that he deprived Louima of his  
civil rights by sexually assaulting him -- carries a maximum 
sentence of life in prison without parole, although the judge can 
impose a lesser term. Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, said he 
expects Volpe to get 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea threatened to complicate the case against the remaining  
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Charles Schwarz is accused of holding down Louima, a  
32-year-old security guard, in the bathroom assault. Schwarz and 
Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder also are charged with 
beating Louima on the way to the police station after his arrest on 
charges he punched Volpe. Sgt. Michael Bellomo, their supervisor, 
is charged with covering up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe said another officer was present during the attack in the  
bathroom. When pressed by the judge, he said the other officer did 
not hit Louima but ``saw what was going on and did nothing to stop 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was understood from the circumstances that the police  
officer would do nothing to stop me or report it to anyone,'' Volpe 
said. Volpe did not name the officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Wednesday. The judge is expected to read a  
statement to the jury noting Volpe's absence, but it was unclear 
whether he would reveal Volpe had pleaded guilty. The jury is not 
sequestered. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellomo's lawyer, John Patten, said he will ask for a mistrial  
because Volpe's absence could heighten jurors' suspicions about 
remaining defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements, Kornberg suggested that Louima's injuries  
had come from homosexual intercourse before he was arrested, and 
that Louima, who moved to the United States eight years ago, lied 
about the assault so he could win a $150 million lawsuit against 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, the son of a retired detective, decided to plead guilty  
as charged after hearing the damning testimony of the other 
officers. Prosecutors refused a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	``There came a point in time where the evidence became  
overwhelming,'' Kornberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case touched off demonstrations against police brutality and  
raised tensions between the Police Department and the black 
community. But the trial saw the shattering of the ``blue wall of 
silence'' -- the solidarity that keeps police officers from 
testifying against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The first officer to breach the wall was Detective Eric  
Turetzky, who testified about seeing a disheveled and sullen Volpe 
``swinging the stick around like a sword and hitting it against the 
wall'' around the time of the bathroom assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Next came Officer Mark Schofield, who testified that Volpe  
borrowed a pair of black leather gloves and returned them covered 
with blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, one of two surprise witnesses, Sgt. Kenneth Wernick,  
testified Volpe bragged about brutalizing Louima with the stick. 
</P>
<P>
	And Officer Michael Schoer testified Volpe put the end of an  
excrement-soiled stick -- believed to be a broken broom handle -- in 
his face.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Give Customs More Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Customs Service would get more money  
to fight drug trafficking and online child pornography under 
legislation passed by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed Tuesday on a 410-2 vote, would allow Customs an  
additional 1,745 officers to work along the borders and at major 
drug and money-laundering locations. It provides $10 million, up 
from the current $2.4 million, for the Child Pornography/Child 
Sexual Exploitation Program, which tracks international Internet 
sex predators and traffic in child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	The program also coordinates with the FBI to expose domestic  
child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	``As more kids go online every day we need to ensure their  
safety, and it's time to let online pedophiles know that they can 
no longer hide behind their computer screens,'' said Rep. Nancy 
Johnson, R-Conn., chief sponsor of the provision. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill authorizes $2.4 billion for the Customs Service in  
fiscal 2000 and 2001, $400 million more than the administration 
requested. It includes $150 million each year to help the agency 
replace its 16-year-old computer system, which has had difficulty 
processing trade quickly and efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats supported the basic bill but criticized the Republican  
majority for inserting language that changes Customs employee 
overtime and night differential pay systems. They also complained 
that they were not allowed to offer an amendment to remove the 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., said Democrats would urge the Senate  
to remove the labor provisions when it takes up the legislation. 
Last year the House approved the Customs bill by a large margin but 
the Senate never voted on it. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------

<HEADLINE> Clintons Begin Florida Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- His dog Buddy scampering nearby, President  
Clinton strode up to greet a few people awaiting his arrival at the 
White Oak Plantation. Then he disappeared onto the grounds for a 
secluded vacation far from Washington's glare. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton arrived in Florida's backwoods late Tuesday with few  
plans beyond rest and relaxation -- except maybe playing golf on 
White Oak's nine-hole course or catching a glimpse of a rare white 
rhino that is nesting with a cub near the cottage where he is 
staying with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got a better (golf) game than the rhino,'' joked  
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the Clintons needed this vacation, five months  
into a year in which Clinton was acquitted in an impeachment trial 
and the first lady is entertaining thoughts of launching a campaign 
for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
D-N.Y. They are vacationing without daughter Chelsea, who still has 
classes at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes at the right time,'' Lockhart said. ``They've both  
been going nonstop since the beginning of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons were spending the vacation in seclusion at White  
Oak, a 7,500-acre conservation area inhabited by giraffes, cheetah 
and other rare animals. As soon as Clinton turned in for the night, 
reporters traveling with him were told he would not venture off the 
grounds today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton had already arrived by the time Clinton flew in  
from Edinburg, Texas, where he spent the day with Vice President Al 
Gore at Gore's annual empowerment zone conference. 
</P>
<P>
	On the way in to White Oak, Clinton -- still in his business suit  
-- halted his bronze Suburban to greet a dozen local residents in 
shorts and T-shirts waiting in front of a small house. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned to leave and discovered an important member of his  
party was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, where's Buddy?'' Clinton asked. Buddy was off meeting a  
bulldog that was among the well-wishers. Buddy pursued the bulldog 
briefly, but scampered back to Clinton's side when the president 
called him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons planned to stay in Yulee until late Sunday so they  
can participate in a conference at White Oak by the Democratic 
Leadership Council and its think tank, the Progressive Policy 
Institute. Conference participants are due to begin arriving 
Friday, Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	White Oak is located off an unmarked dirt road about 20 miles  
north of Jacksonville. The Clintons were staying at Roseland, a 
two-story, cedar paneled, five-bedroom house.

<HEADLINE> Nets Interested in Hiring Thompson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- While former Georgetown coach John Thompson  
is interested in the prospect of coaching in the NBA, the New 
Jersey Nets' interest in him caught him off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	During his daily radio program on Tuesday morning, Thompson said  
he has not spoken with the Nets about the job now being held by Don 
Casey on an interim basis nor does he have knowledge that his 
agent, David Falk, talked to the team about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Record of Hackensack reported in its Tuesday editions that  
the Nets have talked with Thompson about coaching, and principal 
owner Lewis Katz is ready to confer with the former Georgetown 
coach's agent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the newspaper said the Nets' No. 1 choice is Phil  
Jackson and they have offered the former Chicago Bulls coach what 
is described as one of the richest contracts in the history of 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was not turned off by the Nets' interest.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I have found very interesting is that David Falk is  
talking to the New Jersey Nets for John Thompson. Well, I hope they 
send me a telegram and let me know of it. I'll take the job,'' he 
told listeners to his ``Time Out with Thompson'' show on WTEM. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz was to meet with Falk on Tuesday to discuss the kind of  
deal it would take to hire Thompson, the Record reported, using a 
source it described as close to the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets spokesman John Mertz said the team would neither confirm  
nor deny that a meeting took place. ``We are not going to discuss 
the names of any potential candidates,'' Mertz said. ``Don Casey 
was announced as a candidate at the start of the search and he is 
the only candidate we will confirm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Falk did not address the Nets' coaching  
situation on Tuesday but said the agent has periodic discussions 
with team owners. Falk represents three of the Nets' best players -- 
Stephon Marbury, Keith Van Horn and Kerry Kittles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has had discussions with the Nets, and those discussions  
can and will remain private,'' said Alyson Sadofsky, Falk's 
director of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, who fired John Calipari in March after losing 17 of 20  
games in this lockout-shortened season, are reportedly moving to 
the next level in their discussions with Thompson because ownership 
believes Jackson ultimately will end up with the New York Knicks or 
Los Angeles Lakers 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 57, resigned from Georgetown on Jan. 8 after leading  
the Hoyas' program for 26 seasons. He cited personal reasons for 
leaving but added he was not retiring from coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to drawing the interest of the Nets, Thompson is  
considered a candidate for the Washington Wizards' coaching job.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Reserves Ready for Next Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Jaren Jackson, Malik Rose and their buddies  
on the Spurs bench have played a quiet but important role in San 
Antonio's success all season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the playoffs, the reserves are shining almost as brightly as  
the Spurs' big stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all coming off the bench trying to help this team get as  
many wins as possible,'' Rose said. ``We really take pride in 
coming in and changing the flow of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Spurs waited Tuesday to find out whether they'll face  
Portland or Utah in the Western Conference finals, several Spurs 
reserves took part in an optional workout at the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just keep a sweat going every day, try to stay loose and fit  
and be ready to focus on the next game, whenever it comes,'' said 
Jackson who scored a career playoff-high 22 points on Saturday in 
the Spurs' Game 3 victory over the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson followed with 20 points on Sunday as the Spurs swept the  
best-of-7 series 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, a guard who began the season as a starter, was replaced  
in that role by Mario Elie several games into the season. Jackson's 
performance as a reserve blossomed as the playoffs arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he'd been a little stiff early in the Lakers series,  
Jackson said he got some rest and felt good entering the final two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just let my game come to me. I was a little bit more  
aggressive,'' he said. ``I just wanted to make sure I did my share 
coming off the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was one of several San Antonio players assigned to guard  
Shaquille O'Neal during the series. Rose also scored 13 points and 
had five rebounds in Game 2 and scored eight points in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys are just noticing it,'' Rose told reporters. ``But  
for the entire season the bench has been playing well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On any given night, Rose said, he, Jackson, Jerome Kersey or  
another reserve comes through with a strong game. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs center David Robinson has said that with some teams, bench  
players can only be expected to hold their own until the starters 
return. With the San Antonio reserves on the court, a run can get 
going and the defensive intensity remains high. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first game of the Lakers series, the San Antonio reserves  
outscored the Los Angeles reserves 17-2. Will Perdue came off the 
bench to grab nine rebounds, more than any other Spurs player. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3, Spurs reserves outrebounded Lakers reserves 19-8.  
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's fourth game, Kersey scored five points and Jackson  
hit a 3-pointer in a 13-0 Spurs run to start the final quarter. 
Jackson hit six 3-pointers in the game, and Kersey scored all nine 
of his points in the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose has a nickname for the bench guys.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're all collectively the 'bum rush,' '' he said. ``There's  
no one bigger than the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson plans to continue trying to improve the reputation of  
the Spurs' guards, both starters and reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just so happens that we all collectively have done a pretty  
good job,'' he said. ``We just do what it takes to help the team 
win.''

<HEADLINE> California Cities Suing Gun Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Several California cities, led by Los Angeles  
and San Francisco, plan to sue gun manufacturers and argue that the 
industry's sloppy marketing puts weapons in the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits were expected to contend that gun makers fail to  
put safety devices on guns to prevent shootings. The plaintiffs 
could seek fines and a share of industry profits that could total 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the goal of the lawsuits ``is not so much money but  
reform of the industry,'' said Louise Renne, San Francisco's city 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits were expected to be filed as early as today.  
</P>
<P>
	California has broad laws against unfair and deceptive business  
practices -- laws cited in several 1996 lawsuits by California 
cities against the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, Chicago, New Orleans and six other cities, along with  
Wayne County in Michigan, have sued gun manufacturers since 
November. Those suits were based on product liability laws and 
demand damages for police and medical costs associated with gun 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento, Oakland and Berkeley were expected to join San  
Francisco's suit while Compton, Inglewood and Los Angeles County 
also were considering suits. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 13,000 crimes were committed with guns last year in  
Los Angeles alone. The Los Angeles suit was expected to name more 
than 40 gun manufacturers along with dealers and firearms trade 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, the gun makers supply the illegal underground  
market by flooding the legal market with far more guns than it can 
absorb,'' city attorney James Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said manufacturers don't want to know that their weapons are  
winding up in the hands of shady dealers, a claim denied by an 
industry official. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way for a manufacturer to know a specific firearm  
is going to be used in crime,'' said Robert Delfay, president of 
the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute. ``If 
there was, I'm certain all manufacturers would sacrifice that sale 
in a New York minute.''

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines, Mechanics Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATAC, Wash. (AP) -- Less than a week after Alaska Airlines  
chairman John F. Kelly assured stockholders that labor peace was 
his top priority, a potentially critical settlement was reached 
with leaders of the mechanics union. 
</P>
<P>
	Following weeks of flight cancellations, six firings and the  
filing of a federal court lawsuit, tentative agreement was reached 
Monday on a 42-month contract for more than 1,000 members of the 
Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Louie Key, a vice president of AMFA Local 14, said the local  
leadership would recommend approval in voting that should be 
completed in about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited and very proud to be taking this contract out  
to our members,'' Key said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's national director, O.V. Delle-Femine, would not give  
specific terms but said the pact ranked in the middle of the 
industry and included gains in pay, benefits, health care and 
retirement provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not looking for any takebacks whatsoever,'' company  
chairman John F. Kelly said. ``We've always said we want to pay 
market wages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the deal could improve the chance of resolving three  
other contract disputes dogging the West Coast regional carrier for 
as long as 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly cited a provision for binding arbitration of unresolved  
issues after 120 days of negotiations once the contract comes up 
for renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Railway Labor Act, airline contracts do not expire but  
are subject to periodic renegotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly and Delle-Femine said government mediation under the law  
took too long to arrange, an obstacle that will be avoided by 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly a model. We also have that model in existence  
with our pilot contract. We have a similar approach (in talks) with 
the Association of Flight Attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was announced at Alaska Airlines offices near  
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport five days after questions 
about stalled contract talks dominated the annual meeting of 
corporate parent Alaska Air Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Airlines has been in talks with unions representing all  
of the company's hourly workers except pilots and dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 650 flights have been canceled since April 26, roughly  
twice the typical number, because of what company officials 
described as a slowdown by mechanics and a sickout by passenger 
service agents and baggage handlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Six accused sickout instigators were fired, and Alaska Airlines  
sued the mechanics' union and sought a federal court injunction 
over the slowdown claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit will be withdrawn Tuesday, Kelly said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've never condoned any of these slowdowns or alleged  
slowdowns,'' Delle-Femine said. ``I think we've been falsely 
accused... . 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said contract talks covering 3,400 clerks, ticket agents  
and other passenger service employees represented by the 
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and 
about 1,750 flight attendants are going well. 
</P>
<P>
	The company and the Machinists union remain at loggerheads in  
talks covering about 1,060 ramp agents and stock clerks. Kelly said 
the Machinists won't discuss anything except union security and 
subcontracting.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Dunston Suspended for Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shawon Dunston of the St. Louis Cardinals on  
Tuesday was suspended for three games for charging the mound in a 
game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He has appealed the action by 
National League president Leonard S. Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the appeal of the suspension, which was to begin  
Wednesday, Dunston can play pending a hearing. Dunston said Tuesday 
in St. Louis that he didn't know when an appeal would be heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa said he was hoping the suspension would be  
reduced after Dunston, who was batting .344 with three homers and 
18 RBIs in 90 at-bats, can tell his side of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston, 36, said this wasn't the first time he charged the  
mound, but he said this was his first suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fun and it's not something to brag about,'' he said.  
``But some things you have to do to protect yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension stemmed from Dunston charging the mound Sunday  
after being hit in the back by a fastball from Dodgers rookie Jamie 
Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston was the third Cardinal to be hit by a pitch in the game  
and the second in that inning.

<HEADLINE> CBS Is Season's Ratings Champ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS is back as television's top network, but not  
everybody is impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The home of ``Touched By an Angel'' and ``Everybody Loves  
Raymond'' has claimed the season's ratings crown for the first time 
in five years. The television season is considered over after 
today, when summer reruns begin. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's accomplishment, climbing from a distant third three years  
ago, was minimized by some rivals and advertisers who deride it as 
an old folk's network. And it occurred within the broader context 
of continued slipping viewership among broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS will earn a narrow victory over NBC, which won the last  
three seasons. ABC will be third and Fox fourth, according to 
Nielsen Media Research estimates. CBS President Leslie Moonves 
called the win ``greatly gratifying'' on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should be applauded for that, mildly -- clap, clap,  
clap,'' said Gene DeWitt, head of the advertising firm DeWitt 
Media. ``It's nice, but the CBS thing is not going to get them a 
single penny from advertisers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because among adults aged 18 to 49, the demographic group  
most prized by advertisers, CBS is in fourth place behind NBC, Fox 
and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the Nielsen derby for top network is fourth on NBC's  
list of priorities, said Scott Sassa, NBC West Coast president. NBC 
concentrates on the 18-49 age group, upscale demographics and 
making sure it provides strong programming leading in to its 
affiliates' nighttime news programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, NBC easily saw the most precipitous decline in viewership  
among the major networks. It was hurt by the loss of ``Seinfeld'' 
and the ratings deterioration of its strong Thursday lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa estimated that NBC earns an average of $160,000 per  
30-second prime-time advertisement, and CBS gets half that. Moonves 
said NBC's estimated earnings were inflated. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we try to do is get the audience that will provide us  
with the best opportunity to get ad revenue,'' Sassa said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS considers those arguments the sour grapes of losers. CBS  
said it is effectively the top choice for everyone over aged 35, 
and that the ability to reach the largest possible audience is 
increasingly valuable at a time television viewership is 
splintering. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's ability to reach a broader audience is even more important  
as its rivals all seek younger viewers next fall. Moonves said 
there are 11 dramas dealing with teen-aged angst on the upcoming 
fall schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to chase what everyone else is chasing,'' he  
said. ``Our strategy is to be different and it's working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, NBC and ABC each will set all-time ratings lows this  
season. Fox will be lower than at any time since its inaugural 
season. The rating that CBS is projecting for its final average 
would have put the network in fourth place just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss in viewership share is inevitable given the increasing  
number of alternatives on the cable dial, Sassa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the fledgling WB is the only network to see its  
ratings go up from last year. It has done well with the popular 
family show ``7th Heaven'' and a series of dramas appealing 
primarily to teen-aged girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a victor this season, it's the WB,'' DeWitt said.  
``They have grown a relatively young audience from a small base.''

<HEADLINE> Nevada Won't Block Tyson's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The news just keeps getting better for Mike  
Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Tyson's early release from a Maryland jail, Nevada  
boxing officials indicated Tuesday they won't do anything to stand 
in the way of his return to the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	That could come as early as Aug. 21, with a possible fight in  
Las Vegas against the likes of Axel Schulz or Brian Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aug. 21 is certainly a date we're looking at,'' said Jay  
Larkin, who runs boxing for the Showtime network. ``Hopefully in 
the next couple of days we'll have something concrete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's advisers and handlers, caught off-guard by his sudden  
release from jail Monday, were scrambling to make arrangements to 
get the fighter back in the ring as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Those plans may have been made easier by indications that Nevada  
boxing officials won't use Tyson's no-contest plea that landed him 
in a Maryland jail against him or hold another hearing on his 
suitability to box in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson won a license in October after extensive hearings to  
replace the one taken from him for biting Evander Holyfield's ears. 
It does not expire until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is that he has a license,'' said Dr. James Nave,  
vice chairman of the Nevada Athletic Commission. ``I don't see the 
need for a hearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, whose last fight was a fifth round knockout of Francois  
Botha on Jan. 16, had his comeback interrupted when he was jailed 
in Maryland for assaulting two motorists following a traffic 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	He served 3 1/2 months of a year-long sentence before being  
released on parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all agreed that while Mike Tyson was in jail, we wouldn't  
make any plans for his fights,'' Larkin said. ``Now, he's been out 
only 24 hours and we just haven't gotten to that point yet. But 
we're going to start right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the sense of urgency to get Tyson back into the ring  
is the fact that his advisers want him to fight twice this year. 
And, because prime pay-per-view dates in September and November are 
already blocked out because of two big fights, the options for 
fight dates are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad are expected to fight on  
pay-per-view on Sept. 18, while Holyfield and Lennox Lewis meet on 
Nov. 13 in their rematch on pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Tyson with the option of fighting in August and  
again in December. An alternative, though, could be for Tyson's 
fight to be a network show and not a pay-per-view, something his 
handlers are also reportedly considering. 
</P>
<P>
	The thinking behind putting a Tyson fight on Showtime itself or  
even selling it to a major network is that it would be tough to 
sell Tyson again in a fight against someone similar to Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Tyson looked rusty and confused in the ring  
against Botha in what was his first fight in 19 months since the 
Holyfield biting incident. Plans before he was sent to jail were 
for him to fight at least four times this year, and there is 
concern about what kind of boxing shape and condition he will be 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, whose network has a contract with Tyson and televises  
his pay-per-view fights, said discussions about an opponent will 
likely wait until Tyson gets in a gym and has a few workouts so his 
trainers can see what he looks like. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson remains one of the biggest pay-per-view attractions,  
although the number of homes that bought his fight with Botha 
slipped to about 750,000 from more than 1 million for several of 
his other fights.

<HEADLINE> Nets May Want Thompson As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Nets have talked with  
John Thompson about coaching the NBA club, and principal owner 
Lewis Katz is ready to confer with the former Georgetown coach's 
agent, The Record reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	However, according to the newspaper, the Nets' No. 1 choice is  
Phil Jackson and they have offered the former Chicago Bulls coach 
what is described as one of the richest contracts in the history of 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz was to meet today with Thompson's agent, David Falk,  
according to a source described by The Record as close to the 
situation. The meeting would focus on determining the kind of a 
deal it would take to hire Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on his Washington, D.C., radio show this morning,  
Thompson said he was surprised by the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I have found very interesting is that David Falk is  
talking to the New Jersey Nets for John Thompson. Well, I hope they 
send me a telegram and let me know of it. I'll take the job,'' he 
told listeners to his ``Time Out with Thompson'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk's office said he was not available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nets are moving to the next level in their discussions with  
Thompson because team's ownership believes Jackson ultimately will 
end up with the New York Knicks or Los Angeles Lakers 
</P>
<P>
	Nets officials apparently are not unanimous about the  
possibility of hiring Thompson. Some are pictured as reluctant to 
hire another college coach following the failure of John Calipari, 
the former University of Massachusetts coach who was fired after 
the club won only three of its first 20 games in the recently 
completed strike-shortened season 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets were 13-17 under interim coach Don Casey to end the  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 57, has indirect ties to the Nets and to New Jersey.  
His agent Falk also represents Nets stars Stephon Marbury, Kerry 
Kittles and Keith Van Horn. Thompson's son, John Thompson III, is 
an assistant coach at Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, citing personal reasons, resigned from Georgetown on  
Jan. 8 after leading the Hoyas' program for 26 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to drawing the interest of the Nets, Thompson is  
considered a candidate to become the Washington Wizards' new coach.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Push Finance Privacy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic lawmakers are pushing legislation  
that would give consumers the right to stop affiliated banks, 
brokerage firms and insurance companies from sharing personal 
financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and most of the financial services industry oppose the  
bill by Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., which would allow consumers to 
``opt out'' of personal data-sharing among affiliated financial 
companies by notifying the firms in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill embodies a proposal made earlier this month by  
President Clinton, who urged Congress to bolster consumers' rights 
when banks and other financial companies seek to share information 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress crafts sweeping legislation to remove Depression-era  
barriers between banks, brokerages and insurers and allow them to 
merge, there is growing concern about the privacy of consumers who 
will use the new consolidated financial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer is naked and helpless in (his) inability to tell  
banks not to share that information,'' Inslee said Tuesday at a 
news conference. ``This is going to allow consumers the right to 
decide their own fate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inslee also maintained that for online commerce to flourish,  
consumers must have confidence their privacy will be protected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate recently passed a financial overhaul bill, attaching  
to it a provision that would make it a federal crime for anyone to 
misrepresent himself to obtain someone's private financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation to rewrite the financial services laws now is before  
a House Commerce subcommittee, which has scheduled a drafting 
session for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., plans to propose an amendment which  
includes Inslee's ``opt out'' but goes farther by prohibiting 
financial companies from selling personal data to outside firms 
without the consumer's express written consent. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Banking Committee in March adopted a version of  
financial overhaul legislation that would restrict sharing of 
customers' health information among affiliated companies. However, 
the bill still would allow customers' transaction data, such as 
checking account history, to be shared even if they made an opt-out 
request. Under current law, opt-out requests apply to a consumer's 
credit history but not to his or her transaction data. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists such as Ralph Nader have maintained that  
rewriting the financial services laws would create serious privacy 
risks for Americans as banks, brokerages and insurers compiled 
profiles of customers' buying habits, hobbies and health data. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, lobbyists for the banking, securities and  
insurance industries have warned that adoption of tough privacy 
measures could kill their support for the overhaul legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, one of the key reasons the industries have been pushing  
financial overhaul legislation is that it would open numerous 
opportunities for them to market their services by using shared 
customer data. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Cinelli, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers  
Association, said the group was ``deeply concerned about any 
legislation'' such as Inslee's that would allow consumer opt-outs. 
Consumers could deprive themselves of useful financial services by 
doing so, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry believes that disclosure of companies' privacy  
policies is the best way to protect consumers, Ms. Cinelli said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Imagine a bank and a brokerage firm merge.  
Will bank employees tip off stock brokers every time bank customers 
have sudden increases in their account balances that could be 
invested? 
</P>
<P>
	Now the bank and brokerage merge with an insurance company. Will  
the bank scour customers' account records for signs of risky 
behavior and pass the data to insurance agents, who can raise rates 
on the risk-prone customers' policies?

<HEADLINE> FDA Said To OK Diabetes Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drugmaker SmithKline Beecham said Tuesday it  
has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to 
market a treatment for Type 2 diabetes that could prove safer than 
a competing drug which has been linked to liver failure. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA spokesman Brad Stone said he could not confirm the agency  
action and another FDA official did not return calls seeking 
comment. The company said the approval came late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline Beecham's Avandia promises to treat diabetes in the  
same manner as Rezulin. But in studies of more than 4,000 patients 
Avandia showed no sign of liver damage, the company said. It said 
it planned to make the oral drug -- which helps in lowering blood 
sugar levels -- available commercially within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers to the FDA last month recommended approval of the drug  
but warned that no one can say for certain that Avandia never will 
damage diabetics' livers. They said Avandia patients should have 
intensive liver testing similar to the kind now required for 
patients who take Rezulin. 
</P>
<P>
	In clinical trials, common side effects of using Avandia  
included upper respiratory tract infections and headaches. Some 
patients also reported weight gain. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes, which afflicts  
millions of Americans whose bodies lose the ability to properly use 
insulin, the hormone that processes blood sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin, known chemically as troglitazone, was cheered widely  
when it hit the market in 1997 because it is the only drug sold 
that resensitizes the body to insulin. Many doctors contend it is 
invaluable for patients who have failed other diabetes therapies. 
Some 750,000 Americans now use the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Rezulin hit the market, however, it began causing  
liver failure. FDA officials list 43 Rezulin patients who suffered 
acute liver failure. Of those, 28 died and seven needed liver 
transplants to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA warned that those cases may represent only 10 percent of  
all Rezulin-related liver damage. Last month, the agency's advisers 
called for imposing new restrictions be put on Rezulin's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA is also considering Takeda Pharmaceuticals' Actos,  
another drug that could offer Rezulin's benefit with fewer liver 
risks.

<HEADLINE> Man Guilty in Photographer Beating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A man was convicted of attempted  
murder Monday in an attack on a newspaper photographer who was 
beaten by as many as 12 people after he stopped by a playground to 
take pictures of children. 
</P>
<P>
	Terauchi Kenkiuchi Golston, a 26-year-old reputed gang member,  
could get 21 years to life in prison at sentencing June 23 in the 
1997 attack on Sacramento Bee photographer John Trotter. 
</P>
<P>
	Four juveniles are already serving sentences for their roles.  
</P>
<P>
	Trotter was beaten unconscious. He suffered memory trouble,  
numbness and psychological trauma and has been unable to return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Golston saw Trotter as an intruder in the  
neighborhood and assaulted him after Trotter refused to hand over 
his film. 
</P>
<P>
	Golston's lawyers said a mother had initially confronted  
Trotter, fearing he was a pedophile. Trotter was carrying two 
cameras and wearing a Sacramento Bee cap at the time.

<HEADLINE> Gore Courts Female Voters for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Al Gore is making a special appeal to  
female voters, building a list of thousands of women for a mass 
endorsement the vice president plans to announce next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitch came in the form of a letter sent to women across the  
country in recent days that was signed by Democratic Reps. Juanita 
Millender-McDonald of California and Carolyn Maloney of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women will play a pivotal role in the upcoming elections,''  
they write. ``Together, we will elect a president who will place 
the concerns of women at the top of our national agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In outlining what they say are Gore's accomplishments on women's  
issues, the congresswomen cite his support for abortion rights, 
equal pay for women, child care credits for the poor and the Family 
and Medical Leave Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Recipients, who included Democratic Party activists and members  
of abortion rights groups, also got a sheet on which they could log 
their names as supporters of Gore for the Democratic presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The pledge sheet and a similar appeal are also posted on the  
Gore 2000 Web site, next to a photograph of Gore greeting a woman 
holding a child. 
</P>
<P>
	``On issues of importance to American women,'' the Web site  
declares, ``Al Gore has been and continues to be a leader -- a 
champion for women's issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore plans to announce a ``national women's endorsement'' June 1  
in Washington, D.C., said campaign spokesman Roger Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really going to be a broad range of names, from officials  
to grassroots supporters to regular people,'' he said. ``What we're 
hoping to do is have a show of support from women across the 
country for his candidacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effort has also given rise to a new group within the  
campaign, Women for Al Gore, to be headed by former Democratic 
National Committee Treasurer Carol Pensky. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will tailor appeals to female voters by highlighting  
Gore's accomplishments on women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Moore, president of the Southern California Political  
Scientists' Association, said Gore is seeking to repeat the support 
President Clinton has enjoyed among women voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who campaigned on a range of family issues, won the  
women's vote in a landslide -- 54 percent to 38 percent -- in 1996. 
Gore's letter does not mention Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore faces a primary challenge from former Sen. Bill Bradley,  
but Moore said it appeared Gore was trying to shore up the women's 
vote ``for the longer haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The women's vote may be the critical constituency of the  
Democratic Party,'' Moore said. ``If Gore can get as much as 
Clinton got, it certainly gives him a tremendous boost toward the 
presidency.''

<HEADLINE> Man Killed While Installing Sewer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) -- A construction worker installing a  
sewer line along with two of his adult sons was killed when a 
trench wall caved in, engulfing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency workers late Monday pulled Robert Whiteye's body from  
a 16-foot-deep trench about six hours after co-workers frantically 
tried to free him, only to see him slip deeper into the clay, sand 
and dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiteye, 50, of Thamesville, Ontario, was working with a private  
crew that included his two sons to install sewer lines in a 
residential area when the trench's wet, sandy side fell in on him 
about 4:30 p.m. Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was trying to bring the last pipe to the manhole. It just  
collapsed,'' said Ron Demaagd, a Detroit city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-workers were able to grip Whiteye after the collapse began  
but were unable to free him as it continued, burying him deeper. 
</P>
<P>
	Three city inspectors had visited the site hours before the wall  
collapsed, Demaagd said.

<HEADLINE> Money Withdrawn From Okla. Bomb Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The state Legislature has voted to withdraw  
money set aside for the trial of Oklahoma bombing conspirator Terry 
Nichols and spend it instead on helping victims of this month's 
deadly tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers said the action reflected misgivings about putting  
Nichols on trial again, the state's tight budget and the need to 
help victims of the May 3 twisters that killed 44 people and 
damaged or destroyed nearly 7,000 homes in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the measure on Tuesday, a day after the  
Senate passed it. It is unclear whether Gov. Frank Keating will 
sign the bill. He has 15 days to review it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels it puts him in a difficult position,'' Keating  
spokesman John Cox said. He said the governor knows the state's 
emergency fund needs to be replenished but also believes that if 
prosecutors want to try Nichols in state court they should be able 
to. 
</P>
<P>
	Many have said a trial would be too expensive -- some senators  
say as much as $20 million -- and redundant because Nichols has 
already been convicted in the bombing in federal court and because 
the trial may not produce a death sentence. Nichols is serving a 
life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly support the death penalty,'' said state Sen. Mike  
Fair. ``I'm not sure we can get the death penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure reallocates $1.2 million set aside for Nichols'  
state trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would have gone to both the prosecution and the  
defense at Nichols' trial. Nichols is represented by a lawyer at 
taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
	The state agency that represents indigent defendants said the  
withdrawal of the money would jeopardize efforts to defend Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be no way we can defend Terry Nichols,'' Jim  
Bednar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building killed  
168 people. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Bob Macy filed 160 murder charges against  
Nichols -- one count for each victim whose death was not part of 
Nichols' federal prosecution. Macy did not file charges against 
Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted in federal court and sentenced 
to death for the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Macy said prosecutors plan to move forward with  
a state bombing trial with or without the Legislature's help. 
</P>
<P>
	``The office is committed to the prosecution. We'll see how this  
affects that, if at all,'' First Assistant District Attorney Robert 
Mitchell said.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Southern Baseball Coach Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATESBORO, Ga. (AP) -- Georgia Southern baseball coach Jack  
Stallings retired Monday after 39 seasons and 1,258 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been the winningest active coach in Division I, and ranks  
fourth overall in career coaching victories. His record of 
1,258-796-5 includes an 858-581-5 record in 24 seasons at Georgia 
Southern. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the decision is in the best interest for me, my wife,  
and the program,'' Stallings said. ``I feel the program needs a 
change in direction. Although, no one at the age of 68 should ever 
have to explain a retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles concluded play last weekend with a loss in the  
Southern Conference tournament. Stallings took them to five NCAA 
tournaments, including the College World Series in 1990, and won 
seven conference titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallings also coached at Wake Forest and Florida State. A  
player at Wake Forest, Stallings' minor league career in the Boston 
Red Sox organization was cut short by a bout with polio and he 
returned to Wake Forest to complete his studies in 1955 while 
serving as a student coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of  
Fame six years ago, Stallings has been active globally for decades 
in baseball instruction. He has coached or advised U.S. teams in 
several international series, including acting as a hitting coach 
for the 1984 U.S. Olympic team.

<HEADLINE> MLS Season Tickets Up 12 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major League Soccer's season-ticket sales are up  
12 percent this year, but that has only slightly helped its 
attendance numbers so far. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS commissioner Doug Logan said Tuesday the number of season  
tickets for the 12 teams in the 4-year-old American league 
increased from 38,860 to 43,423. The Columbus Crew was responsible 
for the majority -- a record 9,083 tickets, or a 60 percent jump, 
for its new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	However, through 56 games, average attendance has only climbed  
half a percent to 14,456, which also is ahead of last season's 
final average of 14,312. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Columbus, the teams showing the biggest increase in  
season ticket sales have been D.C. United (up 31 percent), Colorado 
(up 30 percent) and Miami (up 42 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	``These numbers are very important to us,'' Logan said during  
his weekly conference call. ``Our ultimate success will be 
predicated on how well we do. ... The year 2000 season ticket drive 
starts this week, since it is the way we treat our customers and 
the way we treat our patrons is how we will be remembered when it 
comes time to renew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Logan said 70 percent of last year's season-ticket holders  
renewed this season. 
</P>
<P>
	This season's attendance leaders are Columbus, Chicago and D.C.  
United, all of which have drawn more than 21,900 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest reasons for the league average not increasing  
more has been the drop of the Los Angeles Galaxy. Last year's 
league leader has seen an average of 7,500 fewer fans through its 
first six games, and is drawing only 14,144 to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've lost in Los Angeles is not season tickets,'' said  
Logan, who noted the team was 1 percent ahead of last year. ``But 
what their attendance problems accent is the importance of season 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A major market like L.A. with only 2,000 season tickets is not  
enough. ... If you are going to let your business be determined by 
the spontaneous decision-making of your fan on Friday night through 
Sunday morning, then you run the risk of having groups decide not 
to patronize you on a given Sunday evening.''

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Sweetens Deal for Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux said Tuesday night he has a new  
plan to rescue the financially troubled Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	The former star center for the Penguins and NHL Hall of Famer  
said he will file a revised plan before Friday to reorganize the 
team and accept a bigger ownership stake and less cash for what he 
is owed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said his deal will convert $20 million of the salary he  
is owed into a larger ownership stake in the team. He said he will 
forgive the remaining $7.5 million he is owed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Mario's way of saying, `You want a body-and-soul  
commitment -- here it is,''' said his agent, Tom Reich. ``Those of 
us in the service of Mario Lemieux are planning to play this hand 
until the last breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Counting debt and equity, Lemieux's package is worth $100  
million and should be attractive to Penguins' creditors, Reich 
said. The amount of ``fresh money,'' new investment in the team, 
will be $50 million to $60 million, Reich said. The previous 
commitment was $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He said talks continue with potential partner Mark Cuban, a  
native of suburban Pittsburgh and founder of the Dallas-based 
Broadcast.com Internet company. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux had previously offered to convert $10 million of what he  
is owed into a stake in the team and take annual payments for the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also said Tuesday night that he offered to buy out the  
remaining $15 million of the Penguins' $24 million lease with SMG, 
which was described in bankruptcy court as the worst in the NHL. 
Steve Halvonik, a spokesman for SMG, did not return a telephone 
call about Lemieux's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan is competing with two others.  
</P>
<P>
	SMG and broadcaster Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh want to own the  
team, make Lemieux chairman of the management committee, pay him $3 
million for a 5 percent stake in the team and give him the the 
possibility of another 5 percent in three years. Fox has a stake in 
the New York Rangers and would have to give that up, NHL attorney 
Jeffrey Levitan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL, which has stated its public endorsement of Lemieux's  
bid, nonetheless has filed a plan that calls for selling the team 
for $85 million to someone the league would not name who would move 
the franchise. Published reports have said the buyer is Seattle 
billionaire Paul Allen, who wants to move the team to Portland, 
Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox spokesman Larry Eldridge said the Fox-SMG group will take a  
look at what Lemieux has offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been meeting to try and come up with a workable plan.  
We're evaluating what we've seen today,'' Eldridge said.

<HEADLINE> Boxers' Medical Info May Be Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- A bill that ensures confidentiality of  
medical information provided by boxers to the Nevada Athletic 
Commission has been signed into law by Gov. Kenny Guinn. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was sought by the commission after former heavyweight  
champion Mike Tyson's medical records were posted on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The records had been turned over to the commission and were  
public documents under current law. Panel members said they are 
concerned boxers seeking Nevada licenses and aware of the Tyson 
case might withhold information fearing similar publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic Commissioner Lorenzo Fertitta added that Tyson may not  
have been completely honest during his psychological evaluation 
because of the commission's open records policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson underwent psychological testing last year before  
regulators would agree to hear his request for a license to restore 
the one revoked for biting Evander Holyfield's ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, any information deemed to be relevant to granting  
or denying a license will be public. The rest of the applicant's 
records will remain confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also can offer a conditional license for boxers.  
Fertitta said this would result in more control over a licensee, 
such as requiring random drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	That provision also stems from Tyson's licensing. The commission  
had wanted to impose conditions but found Nevada law didn't permit 
it.

<HEADLINE> Senate Takes on Base Closing Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's request to close  
more military bases as a cost-saving measure is headed for a 
crucial Senate test. But the plan remains unpopular in the 
Republican-led Senate, even among some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to close more bases was being led by Sens. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., and Carl Levin, D-Mich., both senior members of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appeal to the better angels of our nature,'' said McCain.  
``Every expert inside government and without says we need to close 
more bases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen contends that closing antiquated  
bases -- many of them Cold War relics -- could save the Pentagon 
nearly $4 billion a year that would be better spent on aircraft 
carriers, jet fighters and other crucial hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress has always been reluctant to close bases.  
Republicans contend that President Clinton meddled in the process 
to save jobs at bases in vote-rich California and Texas during his 
1996 re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's proposal for two new rounds of base  
closings -- one in 2001 and another in 2005 -- was rejected earlier 
this month by the Armed Services panel. McCain and Levin are 
seeking to win approval for just one round, in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., contended  
it was impossible to create a truly nonpartisan process for 
base-closings, particularly while Clinton remains in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a new president you want, there will be a new  
president,'' said McCain, a GOP 2000 presidential hopeful himself. 
He noted that, under his and Levin's proposal, an impartial 
commission for deciding which bases to close would not even be 
named until May 2001, well after the 2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate occurred as the Senate worked on a $288.8 billion  
defense spending bill for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Senate voted 52-47 to exonerate two American  
military commanders accused of dereliction of duty in the bombing 
of Pearl Harbor. That vote approved an effort by Sen. William Roth, 
R-Del., to restore the reputations of Adm. Husband Kimmel and Gen. 
Walter Short, the two senior commanders of U.S. military forces in 
the Pacific at the time of the December 1941 attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The move would also give them posthumous promotions.  
</P>
<P>
	Roth said Kimmel and Short became the Pentagon's scapegoats for  
the surprise attack. ``They were held responsible for what happened 
in Pearl Harbor. And that is not fair. And that is not just,'' Roth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Warner, Navy secretary during the Nixon administration,  
strongly opposed the move, suggesting ``both commanders made errors 
in judgment'' and the reprimands should stand. 
</P>
<P>
	On another measure, the Senate rejected, 52-48, an amendment by  
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., to require the president to obtain 
congressional consent before expanding the conflict in Kosovo with 
ground forces. ``We have seen the erosion of congressional 
authority,'' Specter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other members of  
Clinton's national security team assured senators during a private 
briefing Tuesday that Clinton would not commit to any NATO ground 
offensive without first seeking congressional approval, 
participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the administration officials told the  
gathering that any attempt by Congress to force him to obtain such 
consent was a likely veto candidate, said Warner. A defense bill to 
be taken up later this week by the House does contain such a 
provision, similar to the Specter proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	On base closings, the existing process calls for Congress to  
authorize a round of closings, then for the independent Base 
Realignment and Closure Commission to select the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans contend Clinton poisoned the process to save  
jobs at McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento, Calif., and Kelly 
Air Force Base in San Antonio, both targets of a 1995 round. The 
administration denies doing anything illegal as it tried to find 
private-sector jobs for base workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three rounds -- in 1991, 1993 and 1995 -- closed 70 bases and  
depots, causing economic losses to local communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader  
Tom Daschle, D-S.D., oppose the administration's request for new 
base-closing authority 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1059.

<HEADLINE> Portland Shrugs Off Loss to Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- After beating the Utah Jazz in Games 2, 3  
and 4, the Portland Trail Blazers said they expected the two-time 
conference champions to play Game 5 with emotion and determination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz did, and the Blazers didn't answer.  
</P>
<P>
	Utah took a big lead in the first quarter and never relinquished  
it, closing the series gap to 3-2 with a 88-71 win Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone thought Utah wasn't going to come out the way they  
did, they're crazy,'' said Jim Jackson, who was held to six points 
on 2-of-5 shooting. ``They've been to the finals the last two 
years. They weren't going to lay down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to beat a Utah team one time, two times, three  
times, let alone four,'' Jackson said. ``I think Game 6 is a 
defining moment for this team. We'll see how we handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not since Game 1, when the Jazz beat the Blazers 93-83 in the  
Delta Center, have Portland players focused their frustrations at 
the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might have gotten a little emotional,'' said Portland point  
guard Damon Stoudamire, referring to coach Mike Dunleavy's ejection 
for angrily protesting a call and hounding the referees to midcourt 
before being held back by coaches and players. That followed a foul 
on Brian Grant for swinging his elbows and a technical foul on 
Grant for ``taunting'' by faking a pass at Karl Malone's head. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took us out of our game,'' Stoudamire said. ``They played  
harder. They wanted it more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in the series, Utah was able to shoot 50  
percent from the field. The Blazers held the normally 
steady-shooting Jazz to 38, 38 and 41 percent the last three games. 
The Jazz were second in the league in shooting this season at 46.5 
percent and had led the league in that category for four seasons 
prior to this one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a drastically different team tonight, but that had a  
lot to do with the way they played,'' Greg Anthony said. ``Karl 
Malone made some shots, Bryon Russell had a good game. We give them 
credit. They had a lot more easy shots tonight. And we didn't meet 
their energy level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 6 will have the same type of do-or-die quality from both  
teams, Stoudamire said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand it's going to be a tough game,'' said  
Stoudamire, whose only other playoff experience was last year when 
the Blazers were ousted in the opening round. ``Their backs are 
against the wall. But some would say our backs are against the 
wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said winning the series has crucial implications for the  
Portland franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team (Utah) was picked by everyone to beat us,'' he said.  
``In order for us to take that next step, to go to the next level 
in this league, we've got to win, and we need to take care of it on 
Thursday.''

<HEADLINE> Monica Seles Faces More Anguish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Off-court anguish seems to follow Monica Seles at  
the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, she fought her way to the final just three weeks  
after the death of her father. Now, she comes off court anxious for 
news of the bombing of her birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles is reluctant to discuss events in Yugoslavia.  
</P>
<P>
	But she can't hide her distress at the 3-month old NATO air  
bombardment, in particular the destruction of Novi Sad, her 
birthplace and the country's second-biggest city. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my hometown, where I was born. The last three months  
have been very difficult,'' Seles said Tuesday after advancing to 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can do is keep playing tennis and worry about  
the other stuff when I get off court. I watch the news. I watch CNN 
and try to read a lot. Different stories from different sources, 
different sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seles, now an American citizen, moved to Germany in 1984 before  
settling in the United States two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	She doesn't have family or friends in Yugoslavia, though her  
parents still have homes there. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict, she said, ``is too tough for me to talk about.  
It's just too personal. I don't want to share stories like that 
with the whole world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to leave that to politicians because it is a very  
complicated issue. You just want peace. You don't want people dying 
on either side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seles, 25, was a three-time French Open winner in the early  
1990s before a horrific on-court stabbing in Germany put her out of 
tennis for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, she won her first-round match against China's Fang  
Li, 6-2, 6-4, in her quest for a 10th Grand Slam title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really anxious to go out and play the match because it  
is my first match on clay this year,'' she said. ``I was nervous 
having not played much, but I was pretty pleased with the way I 
played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Seles hopes for another long run at Roland Garros.  
</P>
<P>
	``The ideal would be to play well in the first week and get some  
matches and peak in the second,'' she said. ``But it's a long 
two-week event. I haven't had too many matches under my belt so I 
just want to focus on my next opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seles had respectable performances last year -- reaching the  
quarterfinals at Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and the Chase 
Championships, as well as losing to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the 
French Open final. 
</P>
<P>
	But she hasn't been happy with her Grand Slam form since winning  
the Australian Open in 1993, even though she was crowned champion 
in Melbourne three years later as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have played a couple of great matches but not a whole  
tournament,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, Seles isn't having much luck with her  
health, having contracted bronchitis a month ago in the sweltering 
heat of her Florida home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first set of antibiotics didn't work at all,'' Seles said.  
``I had to take antibiotics for four weeks and am sure that takes a 
toll on the body.''

<HEADLINE> Allen, Arnault Invest in Datek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and  
French businessman Bernard Arnault are investing $300 million in 
the privately held Internet brokerage firm Datek Online Holdings 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Datek Online said Tuesday that Allen's Bellevue-based Vulcan  
Ventures will lead the cash investment, with participation by 
Arnault's private holding company, Group Arnault, and TA 
Associates, a Boston-based venture capital company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited about working closely with Vulcan and having  
access to some of the best and brightest minds in the world,'' said 
Edward Nicoll, president and chief operating officer of Datek 
Online. ``The fact that they have made such a large investment in 
us speaks for itself in terms of our business model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicoll said Vulcan, Group Arnault and TA Associates would  
together hold a minority stake in his company, but other terms of 
the investment were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1996, Datek Online is one of the fastest-growing  
online brokers. Customer accounts grew 35 percent in the first 
quarter to 205,109. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recently ran into trouble with the Securities and  
Exchange Commission, which fined Datek $50,000 for falsifying 
financial documents and using customer money to cover corporate 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, a multibillionaire from his Microsoft holdings, has  
invested in dozens of high-tech and Internet companies. Group 
Arnault controls LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, a luxury 
products company whose brands include Dom Perignon champagne, 
Hennessy cognac, Louis Vuitton luggage and Christian Dior, Givenchy

<HEADLINE> Clintons Hit Texas En Route to Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINBURG, Texas (AP) -- Escorting Al Gore onto George W. Bush's  
turf, President Clinton today praised the vice president as an 
advocate for poor communities and credited him with helping spark 
an economic rebirth in urban America. ``I am profoundly grateful to 
him,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president joined Gore here for an empowerment-zones  
conference at the University of Texas-Pan American. Afterward, 
Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton departed for Yulee, 
Fla., for a few days of vacation at the White Oak Plantation, where 
reticulated giraffes, cheetahs and rhinos roam. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Gore toured the Rio Grande Valley empowerment zone  
and listened to anecdotes about how such zones, launched during 
Clinton's first term, are bringing new jobs and investment to 
neglected urban and rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	They also launched the Southwest Border Economic Development  
Initiative, which will pump federal resources into poor, rapidly 
expanding border communities. Clinton announced a task force to 
coordinate economic development along the border. The panel will 
report to the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said Gore has worked tirelessly to cultivate the  
empowerment zones, and his labor has helped turn blighted, 
abandoned areas into hopeful communities ``now flowing with the 
lifeblood of commerce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a challenge he embraced passionately,'' Clinton said.  
``I am profoundly grateful to him for proving that this is an idea 
whose time had come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He then yielded the stage to Gore, who Gore announced $32  
million in grants to help 70 communities redevelop brownfields, or 
abandoned, urban industrial sites contaminated by waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference is an annual event held by the vice president,  
who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. This year's 
gathering allows Gore to test the political temperature in Texas, a 
Republican stronghold where Bush is the popular governor, and he 
wasted no time in cozying up to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may be from Tennessee, but I feel right at home here  
today,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons are going to Florida as guests of the Howard Gilman  
Foundation, which lets groups and individuals use its facilities 
for free, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. He said the 
Clintons were invited to the facility, but he did not say why. 
</P>
<P>
	White Oak, located just across the St. Mary's River from the  
Georgia border, sits on a 7,500-acre conservation area. In addition 
to the giraffes, cheetahs and rhinos, it is home to Big Guy, an 
endangered Florida panther injured in an auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Those animals stand a better chance of seeing the Clintons than  
any of the reporters tagging along with them. Lockhart said Monday 
that the president and first lady -- traveling without daughter 
Chelsea, who is still in school at Stanford University -- have no 
plans to venture off White Oak's grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons plan to linger in Yulee until late Sunday, so they  
can participate in a conference being held at White Oak by the 
Democratic Leadership Council and its think tank, the Progressive 
Policy Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart would not say whether that conference -- or for that  
matter, the entire vacation -- would allow the Clintons to discuss 
the first lady's possible Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll have to ask the first couple that,'' Lockhart said  
Monday, prompting one frustrated reporter to reply, ``When will we 
have that opportunity?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said the first lady  
plans to rest and relax and that's all. As for whether she would 
cull issues from the Democratic conference for her potential Senate 
campaign, Berry said, ``She did say that she planned to spend some 
time thinking about this. I think she's thinking about that stuff 
all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons were to stay at Roseland, a two-story,  
cedar-paneled, five-bedroom house near the St. Mary's River. There, 
they'd have a view of a white rhino who nests nearby with her 
4-month-old calf. And Clinton can either relax beside the pool with 
a good book or play a few rounds on the nine-hole golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	White Oak was created by the late Howard Gilman, chairman and  
chief executive officer of Gilman Paper Co. in nearby St. Mary's, 
Ga., the largest privately held paper and building products company 
in the country. Gilman's father, Charles Gilman, established the 
plantation in 1938 as a family residence. 
</P>
<P>
	now flowing with the lifeblood of commerce. ... the return on  
this investment is more than financial ... we restored the ameican 
dream for many who thot it was out of reach.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Board Quits After Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- The board of Telecom Italia SpA resigned Tuesday as  
had been expected in the wake of Olivetti SpA's successful hostile 
acquisition of control of Italy's biggest telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear whether Telecom's chief executive,  
Franco Bernabe, had also stepped down. Bernabe was a board member. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti prevailed Saturday in its uninvited takeover of the  
huge telecommunications company. Olivetti, which is a fifth the 
size of Telecom, won a 52 percent stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani said he would meet  
with Roberto Colaninno, Olivetti's chief executive, to ``exchange 
opinions'' on how to proceed. Colaninno also plans to meet with 
union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The new management is already under pressure to produce fast  
results in terms of development and job creation. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti is still waiting for word from the Italian government  
that it will stick to its pledge not to use its so-called golden 
share -- a 3.4 percent stake in Telecom -- to veto the takeover.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Study Needs Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists are seeking 22,000 post-menopausal  
women at high risk of developing breast cancer for a study 
comparing the potential of two drugs to prevent the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers announced Tuesday the enrollment of women at 400  
medical centers in the United States and Canada for the 
long-awaited study comparing the drugs tamoxifen and raloxifene. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamoxifen has long been considered a potent breast cancer  
treatment. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved 
tamoxifen as a way to reduce the odds that women at particularly 
high risk of breast cancer will get the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	But tamoxifen causes serious side effects: It doubled women's  
risk of uterine cancer, tripled the risk of potentially fatal blood 
clots and increased chances of developing cataracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Raloxifene treats bone-thinning osteoporosis, but studies  
suggest it could have a similar breast cancer-protecting effect. 
It, too, has side effects, but doesn't appear to increase the 
uterine cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study, by a research group called the National Surgical  
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project and supported by the National 
Cancer Institute, will attempt to determine which drug is best.

<HEADLINE> Gates Gives $20M to Johns Hopkins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates has given  
Johns Hopkins University $20 million to create a public-health 
institute under his and his wife's name, the university said today. 
</P>
<P>
	No formal inauguration date has been scheduled yet for the Bill  
and Melinda Gates Institute for Population and Reproductive Health, 
said university spokesman Dennis O'Shea. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Hopkins program in those two areas is already operating  
thanks to the Gateses' $2.25 million donation in 1997 to train 
family planning and reproductive health experts from developing 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response from the developing world to family and  
reproductive health initiatives launched with the original Gates 
Foundations gift has been dramatic,'' said William Brody, Hopkins' 
president. ``This exciting new level of support from the 
foundations allow our faculty to begin to meet the really 
overwhelming demand in these nations for home-grown expertise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next five years, the Gates institute will bring  
scholars from Latin America, Asia and Africa to Hopkins to earn 
advanced degrees, and will fund their training in Baltimore or 
their home countries. The institute will also help form research 
collaborations with institutes and universities in the developing 
world and offer other advanced training. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates is reportedly the world's richest man. His Microsoft  
holdings earlier this year were valued at $82.53 billion.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Dairy Recalls Cheese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A small Missouri dairy is recalling 135 pounds  
of specialty cheese that may be contaminated with dangerous 
listeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Morningland Dairy Farms Inc., based in Mountain View, Mo., said  
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has temporarily closed its 
cheese-making operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Raleigh, N.C., state officials reported a recall of a  
quantity of imported cheese after tests found evidence of the same 
bacteria in it. Routine testing at a grocery store revealed the 
Listeria monocytogenes pathogen in Pinna Ricotta Salata Cheese, 
made with 100% sheep's milk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Missouri recall involved Morningland Dairy Chives Colby  
Cheese, which authorities said should be returned for refunds to 
retailers who sold it. The cheese is made from raw milk, and 
contamination showed up in tests by federal health officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the company went unanswered Tuesday. A recorded message  
said: ``The FDA has temporarily shut down the cheese-making 
facility. We will not be shipping for a couple weeks for sure. Call 
us back after that to find out how we are doing. Sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria can cause serious, potentially fatal, infections in  
young children, the elderly and people with weak immune systems. It 
also can cause miscarriages. Healthy people, however, usually 
suffer short-term symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal 
pain and fever. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled Colby cheese, sold in vacuum-packed plastic bags,  
carries the code A259 on the label. It was sold by mail and in 
retail stores in Missouri, Colorado, Utah, Illinois, Arizona, 
Tennessee, New York, California, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania 
and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	No illnesses have been reported from the cheese recalled in  
North Carolina, which was imported from Italy distributed by Anco 
Foods of Fairfield, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Protection Division of the North Carolina  
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services advised consumers 
not to use the product in packaging bearing the code ``Sell by Sep 
18, 99.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cheese also may have been distributed in South Carolina,  
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> Key Points To China Espionage Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Key points from the House select committee's report on Chinese  
espionage aimed at U.S. nuclear secrets and satellite technology: 
</P>
<P>
	--China has stolen information on the United States' most  
advanced thermonuclear weapons, including the W-88 warhead, one of 
the most modern and sophisticated, and the neutron bomb. In all, 
information was obtained about seven U.S. warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	--U.S. nuclear secrets obtained by China over 20 years of  
espionage have given China nuclear weapons design information ``on 
par with'' what's available to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	--While most of the nuclear secrets, including information about  
the most sophisticated warheads, is believed to have been obtained 
in the 1980s, some technology thefts occurred into the late 1990s 
and thefts ``almost certainly continue to the present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--China's next generation of thermonuclear weapons, currently  
under development, will exploit elements of stolen U.S. design 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	--The primary focus of China's long-term, ongoing intelligence  
collection effort has been on the Energy Department's national 
weapons laboratories of Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and Sandia. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two U.S. satellite manufacturers, trying to correct satellite  
launch problems, provided China with ``design information and 
know-how'' that allowed them to improve the reliability of both its 
civilian and military rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tighter restrictions are needed on commercial export licenses  
to China, especially for the sale of high-power computers and in 
helping China's satellite launches.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 123.58 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Tuesday, extending the Dow  
industrials' worst losing streak since late March, as continued 
concerns about interest rates and Internet stocks outweighed a sign 
of continued optimism about the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.2 percent, dropping  
123.58 points to close at 10,531.09. The Dow has now finished lower 
in four consecutive sessions, including a 174.61-point tumble 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also surrendered early gains to finish  
lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 22.25 to 1,284.40, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 72.76 to 2,380.90. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq is now 10 percent below its all-time record of  
2,652.05, set April 26, the S&AMP;P 500 is down 6 percent from its May 
13 record of 1,367.56 and the Dow is off more than 5 percent from 
its record of 11,107.19, also set May 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, stocks appeared poised for a rally Tuesday. The  
Conference Board reported that consumer confidence, a key indicator 
of future economic activity, rose in May for a record-setting 
seventh consecutive month. 
</P>
<P>
	The report boosted the Dow nearly 100 points in early trading,  
as the market welcomed the latest sign of the economy's strength. 
Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because 
consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's 
overall economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the upbeat evidence was a separate report by a  
manufacturing group forecasting stronger growth in the second half 
of this year with few inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	But by midafternoon, much of the market's enthusiasm had  
evaporated. Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime 
Charter Ltd., said the selloff was a long time in the making. 
</P>
<P>
	``This market is suffering the slings and arrows of two weeks'  
worth of news,'' he said, citing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's 
resignation and the Federal Reserve's warning that it may raise 
interest rates in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those factors didn't immediately hurt the market, but they  
have now come to bear,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rate concerns provided a backdrop for the stock market  
throughout last week, as stocks shifted in a narrow range with 
light volume. The threat of higher rates prompted a subtle shift 
from high-priced technology and growth stocks to more conservative 
issues like utilities and cyclical stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	That trend continued Tuesday, as investors punished the  
high-flying Internet stocks most sharply. Those companies, few of 
which earn profits, are perceived as a riskier bet if higher 
interest rates start cutting into corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The sector continued to slide Tuesday, led by well-known stocks  
like Yahoo, down 10 15/16 to 126 15/16, and Amazon.com, down 5 
15/16 to 111 9/16. Even Lycos, which rose after Credit Suisse First 
Boston gave the stock a ``buy'' recommendation, ended 1 1/4 lower at 
96 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	A lukewarm debut -- by Internet standards -- from  
barnesandnoble.com illustrated the nervousness. The online 
bookseller, which was priced Monday at 18 per share, ended its 
first day on the Nasdaq Stock Market at 22 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are becoming more selective in their Internet  
holdings,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock 
&AMP; Co. ``They want to hold a handful of selective stocks rather than 
a plethora that ran up just because they have 'dot com' in their 
name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banking stocks languished for a second consecutive session.  
Monday, the sector fell after an investment analyst downgraded 
several major banks, citing concerns about the Year 2000 computer 
bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, First Union Corp. offered a more old-fashioned warning.  
The bank said it expects its second-quarter earnings to fall far 
short of analysts' estimates as it continues paying for its 1998 
acquisition of CoreStates Financial Corp. Shares of First Union 
fell 4 5/16 to 45 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors, which rose 1 1/2 to 84 5/8, was the strongest gainer  
among the Dow components. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 992.98 
million shares, compared with 910.81 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 8.71 to 617.34, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 6.57 to 778.84. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.94 to 434.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.1 percent.  
Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.2 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX closed 
1.7 percent lower, and France's CAC 40 fell 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us Settles Antitrust Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Toys R Us Inc. and two toy manufacturers  
will pay $50 million in toys and cash to settle state claims that 
the nation's No. 2 toy retailer kept toy makers from selling Barbie 
dolls, Mr. Potato Head and other popular toys to discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us will pay $40.5 million, while Mattel Inc. and Little  
Tikes Co. -- who were accused of acceding to the demands of the 
Paramus, N.J.-based retailer -- will pay $9.5 million to settle a 
lawsuit joined by attorneys general in 44 states, the District of 
Columbia and Puerto Rico. All 50 states will share in the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	A third toy maker, Hasbro, agreed to pay $5.9 million to settle  
the same lawsuit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed by New York state in 1997 and joined by the  
others later that year, followed a 1996 complaint by the Federal 
Trade Commission charging that Toys R Us illegally used its size 
and clout to get the toy makers to stop selling to discount chains, 
cutting out its competition and artificially raising prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The discount chains include the Price Club and Wal-Mart Stores  
Inc. subsidiary Sam's Club. Wal-Mart this year dethroned Toys R Us 
as the nation's largest toy retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The states' lawsuit accused Mattel and the other toy makers of  
restricting the supply of toys like Barbie Dream House, Firehouse 
Blocks and Fisher Price nursery monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us has admitted the practice, but said it did nothing  
wrong and is still appealing the FTC complaint. But the company 
said it decided to settle the lawsuits with states to avoid a 
lengthy, costly legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that this settlement is in the best interests of  
the company and our customers, and we are happy to have this matter 
settled with children as the beneficiary,'' spokeswoman Rebecca 
Caruso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us has been struggling to compete with discount and  
warehouse chains, cutting 3,000 jobs last year and beginning to 
reorganize its stores to turn around a string of bad earnings 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although toy makers and sellers like to view themselves as  
Santa's helpers, in this case these companies were nothing more 
than modern-day Scrooges,'' New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer 
said Tuesday at a news conference in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy companies admitted no wrongdoing under the settlement.  
El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel, the world's largest toy maker, 
agreed to pay $8.2 million in cash and toys, while Hudson, 
Ohio-based Little Tikes Co. agreed to pay $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased that children will benefit from the  
settlement,'' said Mattel spokesman Glenn Bozarth. Mattel will pay 
$3.3 million in cash and $4.9 million in toys. 
</P>
<P>
	A Little Tikes official did not immediately return a call  
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us agreed to donate $9 million in toys a year for the  
next three years in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and 
Puerto Rico through the U.S. Marine Corps' ``Toys for Tots'' 
program. Pending court approval, the first toys could arrive this 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us also agreed to pay $13.5 million in cash to the  
states, which will divide the toys and cash among the states by 
population, Spitzer said. The settlement covers all the states, 
although six did not join in. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC charged Toys R Us in May 1996 with reducing competition  
by illegally persuading major toy makers to stop selling certain 
toys to low-priced warehouse club stores. Toys R Us threatened 
manufacturers that it would not buy from them if they sold to the 
other stores, the FTC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is seeking an order that would prohibit the  
company from such restrictive agreements. An administrative judge 
ruled in the FTC's favor in 1997, and Toys R Us appealed. It argued 
against the FTC before the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last 
week.

<HEADLINE> GAO: Forest Serv. Lobbied Illegally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Forest Service lobbied illegally to try to  
boost road funds and change the way it distributes county aid, 
according to congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	A regional forester in Michigan told interest groups last year  
to ``let Congress know'' of the need to boost funds for roads in 
national forests, the General Accounting Office said in a report 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service also asked regional foresters to contact  
Congress, state officials, interest groups and the news media last 
year to build support for a proposal to freeze payments to counties 
and no longer link the payments to timber harvests, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions violated the 1998 Interior Appropriations Act, which  
bars federal officials from using taxpayer dollars to lobby for or 
against legislation, according to the GAO, Congress' investigative 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
	The lobbying prohibition has been included in every interior  
appropriations bill since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	But the GAO found ``no evidence that Forest Service employees  
were aware that they were violating the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO recommended that Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who  
oversees the Forest Service, develop guidelines on lobbying and 
educate agency employees about the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman said in a statement Monday his agency is developing  
guidelines that ``will provide employees with better information 
about prohibited activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska's two Republican senators, Frank Murkowski and Don Young,  
requested the GAO investigation. They said the report raises 
serious concerns, but praised Glickman's response. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has our support for making the changes necessary,'' the  
lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  
Committee and Young chairs the House Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers requested and received about 1,500 Forest Service  
documents after some Republicans complained that a leaked 
communication plan suggested the agency was mixing politics with 
professional duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski and Young, in contacting the GAO last November, said  
the documents contained evidence of lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest Service officials initially predicted the Republican  
investigation would turn into ``quite an expensive fishing 
expedition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capitol Hill Republicans and Forest Service officials have  
clashed before. Republicans have faulted the agency's for a 
troubled accounting system, a lack of detailed legislative 
proposals and sharp cutbacks in logging on federal land.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Federated Department Stores Inc. is linking  
its bridal registries with online wedding planner 
WeddingChannel.com. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal announced Tuesday, Federated also will buy a 20  
percent stake in WeddingChannel.com, a Los Angeles-based company. 
Terms were not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement will link bridal registries from Federated's 403  
department stores and online sites with WeddingChannel.com's 
offerings, which include personalized Web pages, travel planning, 
local business directories and a database of bridal fashions. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples will be able to register with Federated stores and  
guests will be able to purchase gifts through WeddingChannel.com. 
Federated will continue to offer bridal registries in its stores. 
</P>
<P>
	WeddingChannel.com has also formed a sales and marketing  
partnership with Conde Nast's Bride's Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated, based in Cincinnati, has annual sales of more than  
$17.3 billion. The company operates stores in 33 states under the 
names of Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche, Burdines, Goldsmith's, 
Lazarus, Macy's, Rich's and Stern's. Federated also operates the 
Fingerhut, Bloomingdale's By Mail, Macy's By Mail and Macys.com 
catalog and electronic commerce subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Competitors are also after more of the bridal registry business.  
Last month, an online business called theknot.com announced that it 
was receiving a $15 million investment from the television retailer 
QVC. 
</P>
<P>
	While thousands of couples use the Internet for wedding  
research, the online market is still only a fraction of the $35 
billion spent on weddings each year in the United States. But 
analysts expect sales to jump sharply in the next few years, with 
much of the gain expected from guests buying wedding gifts online.

	The People's Republic of China (PRC) has stolen classified  
design information on the United States' most advanced 
thermonuclear weapons. These thefts of nuclear secrets from our 
national weapons laboratories enabled the PRC to design, develop, 
and successfully test modern strategic nuclear weapons sooner than 
would otherwise have been possible. The stolen U.S. nuclear secrets 
give the PRC design information on thermonuclear weapons on a par 
with our own. 
</P>
<P>
	The PRC thefts from our national laboratories began at least as  
early as the late 1970s, and significant secrets are known to have 
been stolen as recently as the mid-1990s. Such thefts almost 
certainly continue to the present. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The People's Republic of China (PRC) has stolen classified  
information on all of the United States' most advanced 
thermonuclear warheads, and several of the associated re-entry 
vehicles. These thefts are the result of an intelligence collection 
program spanning two decades, and continuing to the present. The 
PRC intelligence collection program included espionage, review of 
unclassified publications and extensive interactions with 
scientists from the Department of Energy's national weapons 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The stolen U.S. secrets have helped the PRC fabricate and  
successfully test modern strategic thermonuclear weapons. The 
stolen information includes classified information on seven U.S. 
thermonuclear warheads, including every currently deployed 
thermonuclear warhead in the U.S. intercontinental ballistic 
missile arsenal. Together, these include the W-88 Trident D-5 
thermonuclear warhead, and the W-56 Minuteman II, the W-62 
Minuteman III, the W-70 Lance, the W-76 Trident C-4, the W-78 
Minuteman III Mark 12A, and the W-87 Peacekeeper thermonuclear 
warheads. The stolen information also includes classified design 
information for an enhanced radiation weapon (commonly known as the 
neutron bomb), which neither the United States, nor any other 
nation, has ever deployed. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, in the mid-1990s the PRC stole from a U.S. national  
weapons laboratory classified U.S. thermonuclear weapons 
information that cannot be identified in this unclassified report. 
Because this recent espionage case is currently under investigation 
and involves sensitive intelligence sources and methods, the 
Clinton administration has determined that further information 
cannot be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Although the United States has been the victim of systematic  
espionage successfully targeted against our most advanced nuclear 
weapons designs -- and although the select committee judges that the 
PRC will exploit elements of those designs for its new generation 
of ICBMs -- the United States retains an overwhelming qualitative 
and quantitative advantage in deployed strategic nuclear forces. 
Nonetheless, in a crisis in which the United States confronts the 
PRC's conventional and nuclear forces at the regional level, a 
modernized PRC strategic nuclear ballistic missile force would pose 
a credible direct threat against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Our national weapons laboratories are responsible for, among  
other things, the design of thermonuclear warheads for our 
ballistic missiles. The information at our national weapons 
laboratories about our thermonuclear warheads is supposed to be 
among our nations most closely guarded secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Counterintelligence programs at the national weapons  
laboratories today fail to meet even minimal standards. Repeated 
efforts since the early 1980s have failed to solve the 
counterintelligence deficiencies at the national laboratories. 
While one of the laboratories has adopted better 
counterintelligence practices than the others, all remain 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Given the great significance of the PRC thefts, the select  
committee is concerned that the appropriate committees of the 
Congress were not adequately briefed on the extent of the PRC's 
espionage efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The select committee recommends that the president report to the  
speaker and minority leader of the House and the majority leader 
and minority leader of the Senate, no less frequently than every 
six months on the steps, including preventive action, being taken 
by the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency and all 
other relevant executive departments and agencies to respond to 
espionage by the People's Republic of China as typified by the 
theft of sophisticated U.S. nuclear weapons design information and 
the targeting by the PRC of U.S. nuclear weapons codes and other 
national security information of strategic concern. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In light of the PRC's aggressive military technology acquisition  
campaign and its record as a proliferator, the United States should 
work to reduce the transfers of weapons systems and other 
militarily significant technologies from Russia and other nations 
to the PRC. These actions should include strengthening 
international measures, including economic incentives, to encourage 
Russia to become a full partner in stemming the proliferation of 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	To protect the national interest in foreign commerce, the  
Department of State must ensure, consistent with national security, 
that satellite export licenses and notices to Congress are acted on 
in a timely fashion and that exporters are informed about the 
progress of their applications and have access to appropriate 
dispute resolution procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	It is extremely difficult to meet the challenge of the PRC's  
technology acquisition efforts in the United States with 
traditional counterintelligence techniques that were applied to the 
Soviet Union. Whereas Russians were severely restricted in their 
ability to enter the United States or to travel within it, visiting 
PRC nationals, most of whom come to pursue lawful objectives, are 
not so restricted. Yet the PRC employs all types of people, 
organizations, and collection operations to acquire sensitive 
technology: threats to national security can come from PRC 
scientists, students, business people or bureaucrats in addition to 
professional civilian and military intelligence operations. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Select Committee judges that the PRC will exploit elements  
of the stolen U.S. design information for the development of the 
PRC's new-generation strategic thermonuclear warheads. Current PRC 
silo-based missiles were designed for large, multi-megaton 
thermonuclear warheads roughly equivalent to U.S. warheads of the 
late 1950s. The PRC plans to supplement these silo-based missiles 
with smaller, modern mobile missiles that require smaller warheads. 
The PRC has three mobile ICBM programs currently under way -- two 
road-mobile and one submarine launched program -- all of which will 
be able to strike the United States.

<HEADLINE> FAA Orders Wiring Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Operators of Boeing 727s must inspect the  
electrical wiring found in the fuel tanks of the aircraft and wrap 
all the wires with an extra layer of Teflon under a directive 
issued by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA, which formally ordered the inspections on Monday, had  
promised such a directive over the weekend. At the end of last 
week, the agency had required emergency tests on the tubes that 
carry the electric wires. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Monday's order, 727 operators must remove wire bundles  
from the fuel tanks, inspect them for any chafing and replace them 
as needed. All the wires must also be wrapped with an additional 
protective layer of Teflon. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA provided a timeline requiring planes with more than  
30,000 flight hours to complete the inspections and Teflon wrapping 
within 30 days. Planes under that mark have until they reach 30,000 
flight hours to perform the inspection and wrap the wires. 
</P>
<P>
	The order affects 1,051 Boeing 727s in the United States, and  
the FAA anticipated that the cost of the inspection and Teflon 
wrapping would be about $757,000 for the entire fleet. Each 
aircraft will require about 12 employee hours to conduct the 
inspections and wrap the wiring, the FAA predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried that a mixture of fuel, air and electricity could spark  
an explosion, the FAA issued its directive after workers found 
severe wear on wires and holes in the tubing on two of the jets. 
Mechanics also discovered wear on wiring used to power in-tank fuel 
pumps and signs of electric arcing. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA ordered inspections last May of a similar area of the  
727's cousin, the Boeing 737.

	ADVICE FOR THE JOB SEEKER: People just graduating from college  
are often so anxious to get that first job that they may make some 
big mistakes and land in the wrong one. Some advice from Peter 
Pfister, an executive with Adecco, an employment service: Don't 
take a job only for what it pays. Pfister says new jobs should also 
give recent grads new skills and help them build careers. Pfister 
also suggests not taking the first job that comes along. And when 
they get the jobs they want, they should remember that like anyone 
else, they need to ``pay some dues'' -- and that means working hard 
in order to move up.

	ELDER CARE: Caring for elderly parents is increasingly becoming  
an issue in the workplace, reports the employment consulting firm 
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas. Quoting from a survey of more than 
1,400 senior citizens who averaged 82 years old, Challenger Gray 
reported that 40 percent rely on a working-age daughter or son for 
caregiving. That means employees have to change their work 
schedules -- sometimes arriving later or leaving early, or taking 
time off -- to care for their parents. Challenger Gray says 
employers who offer financial or other assistance to these workers 
will find that the extra costs will be offset by more productive 
workers.

<HEADLINE> Senate Hits Criminals' Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With little notice, the Senate took action  
recently designed to make it impossible for violent criminals to 
benefit financially from their misdeeds by writing books or 
undertaking other activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``Son of Sam'' provision was authored by Sen.  
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and designed to overcome objections the 
Supreme Court raised to a similar law passed by New York state in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorgan issued a statement saying the provision would prevent  
anyone convicted of a violent state or federal felony from 
profiting from written accounts of their crime, and from the sale 
of other property. ``Violent crime should not pay,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By broadening the prohibition beyond written or spoken material,  
Dorgan said he hopes to avoid having the measure thrown out as 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1991 law enacted in New York provided for the seizure of  
profits criminals made from describing their misdeeds. By an 8-0 
vote, the Supreme Court invalidated that law, saying it improperly 
singled out proceeds from books, movies and other published works. 
</P>
<P>
	The statute gets its name from the New York Legislature's  
outraged response to reports that publishers were offering large 
sums to ``Son of Sam'' serial killer David Berkowitz for the rights 
to his story. While the law never was applied to Berkowitz, it has 
been used to limit the book and movie profits in other cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision was part of an amendment approved by voice vote  
and attached to a broader juvenile justice measure that also 
contains several gun control provisions. The House is expected to 
consider its own version of the juvenile justice bill next month. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Decision time is fast approaching for House Republicans who  
favor overhauling the nation's campaign finance laws. Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has said he won't bring the measure to the 
floor as early as they want, meaning they have to decide whether to 
accept his verdict or join Democrats in trying to force his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The most prominent GOP lawmaker advocating passage of the law,  
Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut, is expected to announce at a news 
conference Wednesday that he will buck his party's leadership and 
sign a Democratic-drafted petition to force the issue to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	But senior Republican aides, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, expressed confidence that supporters would not get the 
218 signatures they need. Currently, 194 Democrats have signed the 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays and any other Republican who signs can expect the  
displeasure of fellow GOP lawmakers. It's the majority party's 
prerogative to decide on the schedule for legislation on the floor, 
and anyone who sides with the minority is likely to be harshly 
criticized inside the GOP caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	The political stakes are large, but the number of days involved  
is not. Advocates of campaign finance overhaul want the measure on 
the floor by July, and say any delay beyond that will make it 
impossible to get the bill through the Senate. Hastert has offered 
a date of mid-September, after an August vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to capitalize on a potent political issue, House  
Democrats are moving quickly to press their demand for immediate 
debate on gun control legislation. At a private meeting Monday, 
party leaders decided to stage a series of parliamentary maneuvers 
throughout the week to draw attention to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the effort will be the unveiling of a petition -- similar  
to the one concerning campaign finance -- to force the issue to the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	There's virtually no chance Democrats will succeed in getting a  
direct vote on gun control this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Republicans have already said they'll bring the issue  
to the floor the week of June 14.

<HEADLINE> DEA Chief Constantine Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration's most outspoken critic of  
Mexican drug corruption, Thomas Constantine, is resigning as Drug 
Enforcement Administration chief after five years in which he 
increased the agent force by more than a third. 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine, 60, who once said there was no civilian law  
enforcement agency in Mexico he would trust with confidential 
information, informed Attorney General Janet Reno on Monday that he 
intends to leave July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got 39 years in law enforcement, including eight years as  
superintendent of the New York State Police and five years here,'' 
Constantine told The Associated Press in an interview. ``It's time 
to start thinking about other things I want to do in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert said he was disappointed at  
Constantine's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom's support for congressional initiatives to deter the  
demand for these illegal poisons inside our country and stopping 
the supply at our borders and beyond will be sorely missed,'' 
Hastert, R-Ill., said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine, who moved up the ranks from state trooper in New  
York, said he would ``probably end up teaching at one of the 
universities in New York and consulting in law enforcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five years is as long as any of the agency's previous  
administrators have served. Both Constantine and his aides said he 
was not leaving over any disputes or grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	His most controversial statements came two years ago in a  
congressional hearing on drug-financed corruption in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Just after Mexico's drug czar, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was  
himself charged with protecting a drug cartel, Constantine said, 
``At this time, there is no civilian law enforcement agency in 
Mexico with which we can share confidential information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he said that since then, DEA and the Justice  
Department have been trying to develop such units. ``Some are 
beginning to work,'' Constantine said, ``but the traffickers have 
become infinitely more powerful in the last five years and they are 
a major threat to citizens of the United States and the 
institutions of Mexico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I say what I think, and the policy-makers can take my advice  
or leave it,'' Constantine said. ``I would like to be proved wrong 
and see all leading organized crime figures in Mexico arrested this 
year, but that looks to be a very, very difficult objective to 
reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Constantine took over DEA in March 1994, the agency has  
added 1,200 agents for a total now of 4,550. He also revamped and 
computerized its intelligence operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Several weeks ago, Constantine achieved a longstanding agency  
goal when he opened a $29 million, separate training academy for 
its agents and the foreign, state and local police they also train. 
The new facility, which can house 250 trainees, is adjacent to the 
FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., where DEA trainees used to have to 
share space with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	He also revised the drug agency's standards for hiring, training  
and internal integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll miss the excitement of law enforcement, but I'm proud to  
have been part of a great profession of people who are 
underestimated in this country,'' Constantine said. ``If I didn't 
have a wife, six children and 11 grandchildren, I'd be willing to 
stay here until the ambulance came for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the nationwide drop in violent crime over the past six  
years, and pointed out that in New York City alone, murders 
declined from 2,252 in 1990 to 629 last year. Constantine, who 
stepped up DEA's work in joint task forces with local police, 
credited law enforcement for ``targeting violent drug gangs in New 
York and removing them.''

<HEADLINE> More Than 136,000 Saturns Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) -- Saturn Corp. is recalling 136,300 cars  
because their seat backs can recline or collapse suddenly, which 
has caused at least one driver to crash, spokesman Bill Betts said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was killed, but at least two people reported injuries  
because of the faulty seat backs, said Betts, who had no further 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	The gear teeth on the reclining mechanisms of driver and front  
passenger seats in 1994 and 1995 models are to blame, according to 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this happens while the vehicle is being driven it could  
cause a loss of control, increasing the risk of a crash,'' 
according to a NHTSA report. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 123 Saturn customers said the seat reclined or collapsed  
after the car was rear-ended by another vehicle, according to 
NHTSA, which spent a year investigating the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	An NHTSA spokesman said he knew nothing more than what was in  
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Betts said the company discovered the problem by examining  
computer data on warranty work for customers, and that it was the 
seat supplier's fault. 
</P>
<P>
	The seats were provided by Hyperion Corp. of Lawrenceburg, which  
fixed the problem in later models and has supplied all of Saturn's 
seats since the Spring Hill plant began operating in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyperion officials did not immediately return phone calls.  
</P>
<P>
	Betts said Saturn began notifying owners of the recall in March,  
but they haven't all brought their cars to dealerships to be fixed, 
a process that takes about two hours.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Won't Block Summers Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senator who wants the Clinton administration  
to do more to protect the U.S. steel industry won't try to block 
the nomination of Lawrence Summers to be treasury secretary, a 
spokesman for the senator said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, ``has no plans to do this and has  
ruled out this option,'' said his spokesman, Charlie Boesel. 
</P>
<P>
	Boesel said he had misstated his boss' position earlier in the  
day when he told The Associated Press and other news organizations 
that DeWine was considering putting a ``hold'' on the nomination, 
which would have blocked the Senate from voting on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers' nomination to replace outgoing Secretary Robert Rubin  
is subject Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWine and other senators want the administration to do more to  
help U.S. steel companies, which contend that they've had to close 
plants and cut jobs because of a flood of steel imports coming into 
the United States from Russia, Japan, South Korea and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	A Treasury Department spokeswoman declined to comment on  
Summers' nomination and issues related to it. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWine and other steel-state senators, including John  
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., have offered legislation that would use 
different approaches to address the matter, their aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which  
will consider Summers' nomination, ``intends to ask Summers very 
tough questions about steel in confirmation hearings,'' said 
Rockefeller's spokesman, Don Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rockefeller has no plans to try to hold up or block Summers'  
nomination, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said he saw no  
problems with the nomination. And, the Finance Committee chairman, 
Sen. William Roth, R-Del., has said his panel had had a ``good 
working relationship'' with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Committee has not yet scheduled hearings on the  
nomination, since President Clinton has not formally submitted it 
to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, 44, joined Treasury in 1993 as undersecretary for  
international affairs. He has served since 1995 as deputy to Rubin, 
who announced his resignation earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Complaints Against Customs Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While allegations of wrongdoing against U.S.  
Customs Service employees were increasing threefold since 1996, the 
agency wasn't even tracking the outcome of the cases, a Senate 
analysis says. 
</P>
<P>
	And, at the same time the number of cases was zooming, the  
percentage referred to prosecutors dropped significantly, according 
to the study by the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	William A. Keefer, assistant commissioner in charge of internal  
affairs, told the committee that while instances of corruption in 
customs are few, ``We may not have always done a good job in 
responding to allegations of misconduct. That has changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony prepared for the hearing, Keefer said that under a  
prior system, offices within Customs reported misconduct in ways 
that were ``diverse and often confusing.'' He said the agency now 
has a uniform system for reporting alleged wrongdoing and a new 
computerized operation to track cases moving through the 
disciplinary process. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the word has gone out to all Customs investigators  
that ``failure to exhaust viable leads or to interview 
knowledgeable witnesses is inexcusable'' in misconduct cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis was obtained by The Associated Press on Monday,  
prior to today's committee hearing on the agency's internal affairs 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Only last week, the Treasury Department inspector general  
released a stinging audit of the Customs internal affairs unit, 
contending the agents mismanaged investigations and created a fear 
of reprisal among employees filing complaints. The Customs Service 
is a Treasury Department agency. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the hearing, leaders of two groups claiming to  
represent 2,000 customs employees announced plans to pursue a class 
action lawsuit alleging retaliation against workers who complained 
of sexual harassment, racial discrimination and other wrongdoing. 
At a news conference in Riverside, Calif., Customs agent Sandy Nunn 
said internal investigations and job transfers are used to punish 
employees who complain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate committee found that bribery was the most frequent  
allegation to the internal affairs unit and that Miami employees 
were the subjects of the most complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly contended Monday that ``no  
systemic corruption'' exists within the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his six-page letter to the Senate Finance Committee  
chairman, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., Kelly also said he has 
initiated ``greatly strengthened internal affairs procedures ... 
which demand accountability and provide us with the tools to 
monitor all cases from their inception to final disposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly's spokesman, Dennis Murphy, added, ``He appointed a career  
Justice Department official to run the (internal affairs) 
organization and a nationwide disciplinary review board to ensure 
fairness and protection for people to come forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on information provided by the 19,500-employee Customs  
Service, the committee analysis showed that from fiscal 1996 
through fiscal 1998: 
</P>
<P>
	--Allegations of criminal wrongdoing and serious, noncriminal  
misconduct against Customs employees increased from 209 to 677, or 
223 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Of 696 cases of potential wrongdoing referred by internal  
affairs investigators to agency management, 69 percent had no 
information on the disposition of the cases. Of those that had such 
information, the highest percentage category was ``no action'' (29 
percent) followed by suspensions (22 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	--The percentage of allegations referred for prosecution declined  
from 78 percent to 17 percent for the most serious category of 
accusations, including potentially major crimes; and from 29 
percent to 8 percent for less serious actions. 
</P>
<P>
	--The most common allegation was bribery (114 cases) followed by  
various forms of harassment (95 cases) and disclosure of 
confidential information (77). 
</P>
<P>
	--Allegations most frequently involved inspectors (29 percent of  
the total), criminal investigators (12 percent) and supervisory 
criminal investigators (7 percent). One percent, or 18 allegations, 
involved assistant commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	--Miami had the most allegations, (11 percent of the total),  
followed by El Paso and McAllen, Texas, (9 percent each), Tucson, 
Ariz., (6 percent), Los Angeles and San Francisco (5 percent each) 
and San Diego (4 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the inspector general's report said the Customs  
Service created ``a fear of reprisal'' among employees who reported 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The internal affairs unit mishandled investigations so that  
wayward agents were neither disciplined nor prosecuted, the 
Treasury inspector general said.

<HEADLINE> Groups Continue LA Expansion Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Al Davis, who moved his Raiders back to Oakland  
in 1995 after 13 seasons in Los Angeles, is an onlooker during the 
NFL's discussions on bringing a team back to the nation's second 
largest market. 
</P>
<P>
	But the league's maverick seemed to catch the essence of the  
latest debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``They spent four years, and all their talking about is  
garages,'' Davis said Tuesday after two groups competing for the 
expansion franchise that will begin play in 2002 presented their 
plans to the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, garages are at the heart of how the NFL will refurbish  
the Los Angeles Coliseum to bring an expansion team there by 2002. 
And the one that seems to be preferred by the NFL leadership could 
cost more than $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The group headed by Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz presented a  
plan for a parking garage with a park on top. The project features 
a garage covered with trees, grass in front of luxury suites and a 
cooling system that would spray mist on sweltering fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exactly the kind of vision necessary to transform the  
venue in the interests of the city of Los Angeles,'' commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other major action Tuesday was the unanimous approval of the  
sale of the Washington Redskins to 34-year-old Daniel Snyder for 
$800 million, the highest for a franchise in sports history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow!'' exulted Snyder, a lifelong Redskins fan. ``It's been an  
unbelievable journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was a junior partner to Howard Milstein in a previous bid  
to buy the team from the trustees of the late Jack Kent Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
	When Milstein pulled out after it became clear he couldn't win  
support from other owners, Snyder went his own way. He brought in 
Fred Drasner and Mort Zuckerman, co-owners of the Daily News in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's bid was the same as Milstein's. But he backed it with a  
$300 million down payment that sold the rest of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous high price for a franchise was the $550 million Al  
Lerner paid for the new Cleveland Browns, who will begin playing in 
September as the NFL's 31st team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins sale has been a long-running soap opera since the  
team was put up for sale by the trustees of the estate of Jack Kent 
Cooke, who died in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke's son, John, was one of the bidders when Milstein got the  
franchise. When Milstein dropped out, he sued John Cooke and 
general manager Charley Casserly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a long goodbye,'' Cooke said. ``As disappointing  
as it has been, it has also been very gratifying to hear how much 
my family has meant to the National Football League and Redskins 
fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder has said that for this season he will retain Casserly and  
coach Norv Turner. He also expects to hire a team president soon, 
but not necessarily someone from football, although one of those 
mentioned is former Miami coach Don Shula. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's agenda includes a demonstration of instant replay,  
further discussion of the Los Angeles situation and stadium 
situations in New England, Philadelphia and Denver.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Supports Gun-Control Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Republican leadership announced  
today its support for gun control measures included in a juvenile 
crime bill passed by the Senate last week. Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Henry Hyde said he hoped to get the bill to the House 
floor by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said the final product  
would require gun sellers to provide safety devices, background 
checks at gun shows and other gun control measures. Hastert's 
office said the details of those provisions were being worked out, 
and they might differ in some respects from those passed by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support commonsense legislation that keeps guns out of the  
hands of unsupervised children,'' Hastert said in a floor speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But both Hastert and Hyde said they will not be rushed into a  
vote by Democrats demanding immediate action on the Senate-passed 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to be stampeded. We want this to be a good  
bill,'' Hyde, R-Ill., said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., chairman of the Judiciary crime  
subcommittee, said the bill would require states to punish juvenile 
offenders as a condition for receiving federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the measure would ensure that the most dangerous  
juveniles are prosecuted as adults and require mandatory prison 
sentences for juveniles who discharge a gun on school property. It 
also would encourage states to make juvenile records available for 
gun background checks, ban the importation of large-capacity 
ammunition clips, require safety locks on handguns and require the 
Justice Department to vigorously enforce existing gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	McCollum said the bill would also contain anti-gang provisions,  
including the death penalty for killing witnesses in retaliation 
for testimony, and require background checks for purchasers of 
explosives. He said no decision was made on how long the government 
would have to complete the background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Provisions to confront the ``culture of violence'' that many  
have linked to incidents including the recent school shootings in 
Colorado and Georgia are still being worked out, McCollum said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In debating the pros and cons of gun control, we cannot avoid  
our responsibility by ignoring the deeper, cultural and spiritual 
problems evidenced by the violent conduct of the accused juveniles 
in Littleton and Conyers,'' Hyde said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says EU Tax May Hurt Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Britain fought a rearguard action  
Tuesday against plans for European Union nations to impose a 20 
percent tax on savings and investments which London claims could 
harm international bond dealing worth billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting of EU finance ministers Britain's Chancellor of the  
Exchequer Gordon Brown restated his opposition to the plan, which 
could jeopardize the lucrative ``Eurobond'' market, which is 
primarily based in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he would present proposals next month to exempt  
Eurobonds from the new tax, and said he was confident the other 14 
EU nations would agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that we are making progress,'' Brown told reporters.  
``People are beginning to understand what Britain has been saying 
all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EU has been trying for years to plug tax loopholes that  
enable investors to skip national taxes by moving money around the 
bloc to centers offering low tax incentives to foreign investors -- 
particularly London and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany in particular says Luxembourg's refusal to introduce  
taxes on interest earned from savings costs it billions of marks in 
lost revenue every year. 
</P>
<P>
	German Finance Minister Hans Eichel, who chaired Monday's  
meeting, was cautiously optimistic a deal could be wrapped up by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most EU nations support the call for a common 20  
percent tax, all tax issues need unanimous agreement from the 15 
nations and Britain and Luxembourg are resisting the move, fearing 
it will simply lead to a flight to low-tax centers outside the EU, 
such as Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Luxembourg is also seeking exemptions from the tax for  
investment funds and similar instruments.

<HEADLINE> CBS Is Season's Ratings Champ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS is the new No. 1 television network -- but  
with an asterisk. 
</P>
<P>
	The home of ``Touched By an Angel'' and ``Everybody Loves  
Raymond'' has climbed to the season's top spot in the ratings for 
the first time in five years. The television season is considered 
over on Wednesday, when summer reruns begin. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's accomplishment, climbing from a distant third three years  
ago, was minimized by some rivals and advertisers who deride it as 
an old folk's network. And it occurred within the broader context 
of continued slipping viewership among broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS will earn a narrow victory over NBC, which won the last  
three seasons. ABC will be third and Fox fourth, according to 
Nielsen Media Research estimates. CBS President Leslie Moonves 
called the win ``greatly gratifying'' on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should be applauded for that, mildly -- clap, clap,  
clap,'' said Gene DeWitt, head of the advertising firm DeWitt 
Media. ``It's nice, but the CBS thing is not going to get them a 
single penny from advertisers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because among adults aged 18 to 49, the demographic group  
most prized by advertisers, CBS is in fourth place behind NBC, Fox 
and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the Nielsen derby for top network is fourth on NBC's  
list of priorities, said Scott Sassa, NBC West Coast president. NBC 
concentrates on the 18-49 age group, upscale demographics and 
making sure it provides strong programming leading in to its 
affiliates' nighttime news programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, NBC easily saw the most precipitous decline in viewership  
among the major networks. It was hurt by the loss of ``Seinfeld'' 
and the ratings deterioration of its strong Thursday lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Sassa estimated that NBC earns an average of $160,000 per  
30-second prime-time advertisement, and CBS gets half that. Moonves 
said NBC's estimated earnings were inflated. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we try to do is get the audience that will provide us  
with the best opportunity to get ad revenue,'' Sassa said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS considers those arguments the sour grapes of losers. CBS  
said it is effectively the top choice for everyone over aged 35, 
and that the ability to reach the largest possible audience is 
increasingly valuable at a time television viewership is 
splintering. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's ability to reach a broader audience is even more important  
as its rivals all seek younger viewers next fall. Moonves said 
there are 11 dramas dealing with teen-aged angst on the upcoming 
fall schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to chase what everyone else is chasing,'' he  
said. ``Our strategy is to be different and it's working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, NBC and ABC will all set all-time ratings lows this season.  
Fox will be lower than at any time since its inaugural season. The 
rating that CBS is projecting for its final average would have put 
the network in fourth place just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss in viewership share is inevitable given the increasing  
number of alternatives on the cable dial, Sassa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the fledgling WB is the only network to see its  
ratings go up from last year. It has done well with the popular 
family show ``7th Heaven'' and a series of dramas appealing 
primarily to teen-aged girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a victor this season, it's the WB,'' DeWitt said.  
``They have grown a relatively young audience from a small base.''

<HEADLINE> Locke, Warner Bros. Settle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Actress-director Sondra Locke has settled  
her long-running breach of contract lawsuit against Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
	Locke accused the studio of scheming with former boyfriend Clint  
Eastwood to offer her a three-film deal in exchange for her 
dropping a 1989 palimony suit against the actor. 
</P>
<P>
	Locke claimed she never got to direct any films under the deal.  
She said she proposed 30 projects and all were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection was beginning Monday in Los Angeles County  
Superior Court when the lawsuit was settled, said her attorney, 
Neil Papiano. 
</P>
<P>
	``After three years, she hadn't directed or produced anything  
and she found out that there was a side agreement that she didn't 
know about between Warner Bros. and Eastwood that prevented her 
from doing any movies,'' Papiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's settlement allows her to re-enter the business and to  
make a substantial contribution to her future life,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Papiano declined to disclose terms of the out-of-court  
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages for Warner Bros. attorney Robert Schwartz were not  
returned Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Stars' Desperate Play Evens Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Playing with desperation and a street-fighter  
mentality, the Dallas Stars delivered a message to the Colorado 
Avalanche: This will be a long, tough playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars squared the Western Conference final with Monday  
night's 4-2 victory in Dallas. The best-of-7 series shifts to 
Denver for Games 3 and 4 on Wednesday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a desperate team and they had to be,'' Avalanche  
forward Theo Fleury said, referring to the Stars losing Game 1 at 
home. ``They threw everything at us in the third period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, this is the semifinals,'' Dallas center  
Guy Carbonneau said Tuesday. ``You play each shift as if it were 
your last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nieuwendyk and Mike Modano scored in the Stars' dominating  
third period, when they outshot Colorado 15-1. For the game, Dallas 
outshot Colorado 45-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally found some seams and cracks through the defense to  
get to the net,'' Modano said. ``The second and third shots were 
finally there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said his team's more aggressive  
approach on Monday night was by design. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for us to play well, we have to press the pace,'' he  
said. ``It doesn't matter who we're playing. We've played two 
pretty good hockey games. Unfortunately, we lost the first one. I 
thought the difference was we played with desperation, knowing our 
status. We took some chances and we didn't get hurt by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're playing a team as good and as skilled as Colorado,  
you can take one of two attitudes -- either stand back and wait and 
hope that's going to work out, or press the issue. Obviously, by 
the way we played, we've made the decision to press the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a suffocating defensive game, Modano felt as if he  
had been turned loose Monday night. That observation drew a chuckle 
from Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might think he's been turned loose, but he's not,''  
Hitchcock said. ``This is just a different series. There just is no 
play in the neutral zone. It's in one end or the other. The games 
are very similar to the way we play against Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the series against St. Louis, there was a tremendous amount  
of counter-attacking and neutral zone play. In this series, there 
is none. So the feeling is that there's a lot of room because 
you're coming through that area between the two blue lines with a 
lot of speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain Colorado's somewhat lackluster play in Game 2,  
Hitchcock said, ``They got what they wanted. They got the split in 
our building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, we have to come in here and do that, too. And if our  
attitude is we're going to weather the storm, then that's the wrong 
attitude because we're going to be on our heels all night. We have 
to go and attack,'' he said. ``It's going to make for some 
high-risk hockey, and I think their team probably has the same 
attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas lost forward Benoit Hogue for the remainder of the  
playoffs after he tore knee ligaments in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche, meanwhile, were hopeful of getting back center  
Stephane Yelle, their best penalty-killer. Yelle has been sidelined 
since May 3 with a sprained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably going to be a game-time decision,'' Colorado  
coach Bob Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yelle, who skated for the fifth straight day on Tuesday, said  
his injury ``has been improving and I've been feeling more and more 
comfortable. I want to get back. It's been tough to sit and watch 
the guys play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides cutting down on the number of shots faced by goalie  
Patrick Roy, the Avalanche were eager to get more production from 
Fleury and Joe Sakic, normally two of their most prolific scorers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury's assist Monday night was his first point since Game 3 of  
the Detroit series. Sakic has just one goal and one assist in 
Colorado's last eight playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some great chances as a line,'' Fleury said. ``The  
puck is just not going in, for some reason. We're too good of 
players not to get on the scoreboard. We're doing all the right 
things. It's just a matter of time. But Milan is playing great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milan Hejduk, a rookie and Fleury's linemate, scored his sixth  
goal of the playoffs Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Demand End to Army Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav army today banned  
anti-war demonstrations and threatened to court-martial deserters 
if they don't return immediately, local media reported. In Kosovo, 
fierce fighting was reported today between the army and ethnic 
Albanian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's bombing campaign entered its third month today with  
missiles striking the abandoned Serb police headquarters in 
Belgrade and other targets across Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	For days, citizens of several central Serbian cities have been  
demonstrating against the war and protesting the conscription of 
male relatives to fight in Kosovo. Several hundred reservists who 
deserted and returned home joined some of the protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The army was previously conciliatory, saying deserters would not  
be punished. But the comments today in the daily Vijesti were 
harsher, warning that those failing to return by noon today would 
be court-martialed by a war court. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also warned against illegal public gatherings,  
saying reaction will be ``robust and the violators will be 
punished.'' As many as 2,000 people rallied Monday in two central 
Serbian towns to protest the draft. Police also detained three 
leaders of an anti-war movement. 
</P>
<P>
	The English-language V.I.P. newsletter reported fierce fighting  
in much of Kosovo, especially in the west, where Yugoslav forces 
were trying to regain positions lost to the rebel Kosovo Liberation 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.  
The NATO bombing campaign aims to force President Slobodan 
Milosevic to accept a peace deal for the troubled province that 
would include withdrawing his forces and allowing NATO-led 
peacekeepers to police the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, water reserves dropped to  
the only 8 percent today because of damaged pumping stations and a 
power outage, Serbian media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor weather hampered NATO's military operation today, but jets  
still struck several artillery emplacements, military vehicles, a 
radar site and a logistics support base. 
</P>
<P>
	Many strikes focused on command and control facilities,  
including Milosevic's villa at Dobanovci, 12 miles west of 
Belgrade, NATO said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets also fired at Mount Cer, 60 miles west of Belgrade, where a  
key communication transmitter is located; at the Batajnica military 
airport northwest of Belgrade; and in the suburb of Rakovica, the 
site of a large underground military complex, state media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO troops also began relocating 30,000 Kosovo refugees today  
from Albania's northern border to safer camps deeper inside the 
country, fearing attacks from nearby Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of several recent incidents, U.N. spokesman Rupert  
Colville noted that two bullets fired from inside Kosovo struck the 
refugee reception center Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to empty these camps as soon as possible for a  
whole variety of reasons. The most important is danger,'' Colville 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 830,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have fled Kosovo to  
neighboring Albania and Macedonia -- with 20,000 arriving in 
Macedonia in the last four days alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav leaders have remained defiant, with the country's U.N.  
envoy rejecting a key NATO demand that NATO troops police any peace 
deal for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be really unthinkable for one sovereign country to  
allow its own destroyers to play the role of peacemakers or 
peacekeepers,'' envoy Vladislav Jovanovic said. 
</P>
<P>
	If NATO troops enter Yugoslavia, he warned that ``nobody could  
guarantee the safety of those people because of the outrage of the 
population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While British officials have recommended that NATO prepare to  
send ground troops into Kosovo -- whether a diplomatic solution has 
been reached or not -- NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said 
today the air campaign is working. But Solana did not dismiss the 
possibility of deploying ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``All options are open,'' Solana said in an interview with  
Europe 1 radio. And the option of ground troops is ``on the 
table,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. fact-finding mission returned from Kosovo and reported  
that conditions in the province were ``a lot worse than we 
feared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything indicates that there is an attempt to displace,  
ethnically cleanse Kosovo,'' said Sergio de Mello, head of the U.N. 
mission, calling the scale of the crisis ``gigantic.''

<HEADLINE> Report Accuses China of Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China conducted a two-decade effort to steal  
U.S. weapons technology, including thefts well into the Clinton 
administration, positioning Beijing to develop modern mobile 
nuclear warheads as good as America's, says a bipartisan 
congressional report. 
</P>
<P>
	An ``insatiable appetite'' for U.S. technology leaves China  
ready to leap from a 1950s nuclear weapons program to sophisticated 
designs ``on par with our own,'' concludes the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration called the committee document a  
``good solid report'' but challenged some its conclusions about the 
impact of the technology losses on China's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is not up to par with the United States on nuclear  
development. It is far behind us. There is no evidence that that is 
changing,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in an interview 
today. He said ``the conclusion of wholesale loss'' is not 
supported. 
</P>
<P>
	The 700-page report, being released today by a special House  
committee chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., said that 
while Chinese espionage can be traced back at least to the 1970s, 
``Thefts almost certainly continue to the present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It singled out as particularly damaging the loss of design  
material for one of America's most sophisticated warheads in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he has taken ``very dramatic steps'' to guard  
against theft of secrets by tightening computer security at weapons 
labs and that the report does not reflect counterintelligence and 
security improvements made this year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart said President  
Clinton received a classified version of the report Jan. 4. He said 
the administration doesn't agree with all of the report's analysis 
but ``found most of the recommendations constructive, and we are in 
the process of implementing them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report describes a breadth of Chinese espionage that is so  
threatening to U.S. interests that some members of Congress have 
compared it to the theft of atomic bomb secrets by the Soviet Union 
in the 1940s. The fallout could have a profound impact on the 
operation of U.S. weapons labs and on U.S.-Chinese relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate have called for in-depth hearings on  
Chinese espionage and U.S. nuclear security. Richardson within days 
is expected to announce disciplinary action against a number of 
Energy Department and lab employees in connection with 
anti-espionage lapses. 
</P>
<P>
	``These thefts of nuclear secrets from our national weapons  
laboratories enabled ... (China) to design, develop and 
successfully test modern strategic weapons sooner than would 
otherwise have been possible,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of stolen secrets and other technology gains,  
China ``has leaped, in a handful of years, from 1950s-era strategic 
nuclear capabilities to the more modern thermonuclear weapons 
designs'' that took the United States decades to achieve, says the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the report was obtained Monday by The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	China has all along denied conducting any espionage against the  
United States. China Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said in 
Beijing that the allegations were cooked up by people who want to 
slander China and declared that ``their despicable attempt is 
doomed to failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan select committee began investigating technology  
transfers to China nearly a year ago. Last fall it refocused much 
of its attention to espionage at U.S. weapons labs. The committee 
and Clinton administration have been negotiating for several months 
on how much of the document to make public. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee of five Republicans and four Democrats found that  
the primary focus of Chinese espionage was the weapons research 
labs of Los Alamos and Sandia in New Mexico and Lawrence Livermore 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Information on a total of seven U.S. warheads, including two of  
America's most modern, is believed to have been obtained through 
Chinese espionage in the 1980s, although the losses were not 
discovered until the mid-1990s. The report also referred to the 
apparent theft of neutron bomb technology in 1995, but said details 
remained classified because the matter is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that in the late 1990s, China obtained  
``electromagnetic weapons technology'' that could be used to attack 
satellites and missiles, improved detection techniques that could 
be used against submarines, and ``research technology that if taken 
to successful conclusion could be used to attack U.S. satellites 
and submarines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have questioned how much use any of  
those technologies are to the Chinese. And while the report was 
adopted unanimously, some of the four Democrats on the panel, have 
suggested the report often uses ``worst case'' assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This report raises serious security concerns,'' said Rep. John  
Spratt, D-S.C., a panel member. ``But some of the losses that are 
hypothesized in the report have yet to be established or proven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While China has focused intensely on the weapons labs, the  
report said its campaign to find technologies and secrets that may 
help to modernize its nuclear weapons program went far beyond 
traditional espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The PRC's appetite for information and technology appears to  
be insatiable and the energy devoted to the task enormous,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report described widespread use of the U.S. business  
community as well as academia in its pursuit of not only secrets 
but unclassified technology that might be of use militarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Two U.S. satellite manufacturers, Loral Corp. and Hughes  
Electronics, provided China with valuable information to improve 
the reliability of missiles used to launch communications 
satellites. However, the report said, the same know-how passed on 
by the U.S. companies could be used to make China's nuclear 
missiles more reliable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loral and Hughes showed the PRC how to improve the design and  
reliability of the guidance system used in the PRC's newest Long 
March rocket,'' the report said. It said these activities went 
beyond the license authority given the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of the report remains classified, including some  
details about the espionage investigation at the Los Alamos lab in 
New Mexico where a scientist was fired in March after being under 
suspicion of espionage for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has not been charged and he has  
denied providing any secrets to China, or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said that the U.S. sale of 600 high powered  
computers to China may help China in the future to develop its 
nuclear arsenal without actual nuclear testing. China has pledged 
to adhere to the nuclear test-ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the nuclear secrets stolen from the United States, it  
would have been virtually impossible for the PRC to fabricate and 
test successfully small nuclear warheads'' prior to its 1996 pledge 
to comply with the treaty, said the report.

<HEADLINE> La. Candidate's Grandson Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASCADE LOCKS, Ore. (AP) -- Just days before a tight runoff  
election for Congress, former Louisiana Gov. Dave Treen canceled 
all campaign appearances Tuesday to join a search in the Oregon 
wilderness for his grandson. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30 searchers and divers fanned out over the steep,  
wooded trails and waterfalls in the Columbia Gorge for 20-year-old 
Jason Neville, who failed to return Saturday from a two-day hiking 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campaign is not on my mind at this point,'' Treen, 70,  
said Tuesday afternoon, after arriving at the trailhead where his 
grandson began his trip. ``There's nothing I would not do or give 
up to find Jason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treen faces a runoff Saturday back in Louisiana against fellow  
Republican David Vitter to succeed former Rep. Bob Livingston. They 
were the top two vote-getters in a May 1 primary in which former Ku 
Klux Klan leader David Duke finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen arrived in Portland by private jet with his daughter,  
Jennifer Neville, the missing hiker's mother. They were driven to 
the search area accompanied by a state trooper and, after meeting 
with search and rescue officials, spoke to reporters arm in arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to stay here until we find him,'' said Treen,  
optimistic that his grandson would be found. ``Jason is not foolish 
in any way. That gives me the most confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The search was suspended Tuesday evening and was to resume  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neville is from Mandeville, La., but lives in Portland and works  
for AmeriCorps, the domestic equivalent of the Peace Corps. He had 
taken time off from college to teach poor children in Portland to 
read. 
</P>
<P>
	He set out alone Thursday evening on the Eagle Creek trail, one  
of Oregon's most popular hiking routes, near the river town of 
Cascade Locks, about 40 miles east of Portland. Officials said he 
wanted to be by himself in the wilderness when he turned 20 at 
midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	His friends were supposed to pick him up Saturday. When he  
didn't show up, they assumed he had decided to hike another day. 
Crews began searching for him on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The trails he planned to take have some steep sections with  
drops of hundreds of feet. Friends said he had food and a sleeping 
bag with him but authorities described Neville as a novice 
outdoorsman. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, searchers began focusing on off-trail areas after  
receiving two sighting reports of someone believed to be Neville. 
Earlier in the day, they brought in equipment to search pools below 
several waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst-case scenario is that he took a fall,'' said Stan  
Hinatsu, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. ``The best-case scenario 
is that he's sitting on a trail somewhere, disoriented and not sure 
which way to go.''

<HEADLINE> Blazers Gain From Utah's Poor Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers never expected  
to lead the Utah Jazz 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	On their way to a commanding series lead, the Blazers have  
played the worst fourth quarter in NBA playoff history, shot 34 
percent from the field in a game they won and received much less 
production from their reserves than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Portland's play has been solid, but not spectacular --  
and yet the Blazers are one win away from eliminating the two-time 
defending Western Conference champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 5 of the series is tonight at the Delta Center.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to do what we can to end it in Utah,'' Portland's  
Rasheed Wallace said. ``We know it's going to be a hard, physical 
game, but we'll stand up to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland has won three straight in the series, with two of the  
victories coming in the closing minute. In both instances, the Jazz 
made critical errors that allowed the Blazers to breathe a little 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 2, John Stockton missed a layup with two seconds to play  
that could have tied the score. In Game 4, Bryon Russell threw a 
terrible inbounds pass that was intercepted with 14 seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good to be up 3-1, but we're not satisfied with  
that,'' guard Damon Stoudamire said. ``We know that we've got to 
close the deal now. We've got to be finishers and get our game 
tight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those wins have made the already confident Blazers a bit cocky  
entering Game 5. The winner of the series advances to face San 
Antonio in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look back at the whole series, they should have been  
swept,'' Isaiah Rider said Sunday. ``We gave that first game away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think now, with our defense, we can win, even if we're not  
shooting well. We know eventually our shots will drop. We're 
hungry. We want to win. But we have business to take care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers worked out in Portland on Monday before flying to  
Salt Lake City, where Utah is 3-4 in its last seven home playoff 
games. If necessary, Game 6 will be Thursday at the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz have lost three games in a row for the first time since  
the 1998 NBA Finals. But in dropping three straight to the Trail 
Blazers in a four-day span, Utah didn't look much like a team that 
can return there. 
</P>
<P>
	Most observers thought this shortened season would be the last  
best chance for Karl Malone, John Stockton and Co. to win the title 
that has eluded them for over a decade. Now, it will take a 
three-game winning streak for the Jazz to climb out of the hole 
they have dug -- and even then, the Spurs await. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're up against it now,'' Jazz guard Jeff Hornacek said. ``We  
put ourselves in this situation, and now we have to see if we can 
get out of it. How? Well, we need everything, sort of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is consolation in the fact the Jazz often play well when  
cornered. They are 5-1 in their last six games in which they faced 
elimination, including their rally for a 3-2 series win over 
Sacramento in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	After three games in four days, the Jazz didn't practice Monday.  
Coach Jerry Sloan hoped a day off might give one more injection of 
rest for his aging, ailing team. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since their blowout of Sacramento in the first game of the  
first round, the Jazz have mostly played poorly during the 
playoffs, and there's no single reason why. Utah is 3-5 in its last 
eight games, and two of those wins came only when the Kings missed 
shots that could have won it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz's scoring is down, their defense has trouble keeping up  
with young legs, and their big men have done nothing. Even Stockton 
has missed two critical layups in the final minute of close games 
against the Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Uncharacteristic mental mistakes like Russell's throwaway have  
dogged Utah. Malone, who might win his second Most Valuable Player 
award this season, also has played poorly, shooting 42.6 percent 
and disappearing down the stretch in Games 2 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have counted us out before, and we've proved them  
wrong,'' Malone said. ``We're going to get it going, no matter what 
it takes.''

<HEADLINE> IBM Program To Be Sold With Linux </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A popular IBM program for network databases will  
be sold with a Linux operating system in a deal giving the upstart 
software added legitimacy in a market dominated by Microsoft's 
Windows NT. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement to bundle TurboLinux and IBM's best-selling DB2  
Universal Database program was announced today by Pacific HiTech, 
one of many small companies selling a version of Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also agreed to collaborate on making future  
editions of IBM server software, often referred to as 
``middleware,'' and TurboLinux work together more smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Linux poses only a marginal threat to Windows NT as the  
No. 1 software platform for the servers that run computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	But an affiliation with DB2, which recently eclipsed Oracle8 as  
the top database application for those machines, marks a new level 
of legitimacy for Linux, which is a fan favorite among software 
developers, but relatively new to the business world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes more than just an operating system to run a computing  
environment effectively,'' said John B. Jones Jr., an industry 
analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, noting surveys showing that data 
processing is a top priority among server operators. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Linux space, the No. 1 prerequisite is database  
software, and IBM has the No. 1 position in the database market,'' 
he said, referring to Tuesday's deal as ``one more incremental 
benefit to the people who are considering using Linux.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Linux code, developed by Linus Torvalds in the early 1990s  
when he was a student in Finland, is best known for being a system 
that rarely crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was relatively unknown until recently, when big names  
such as Intel, IBM, Netscape, and Oracle began investing in Red 
Hat, a leading vendor of Linux software, based in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the Linux server market grew by 212 percent with more  
than 500,000 copies shipped, according to International Data 
Corporation, an industry research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The basic code, continually updated in consultation with an  
enthusiastic community of programmers, is still given away for free 
over the Internet or can be bought at stores for as little as $30. 
</P>
<P>
	Enhanced versions such as TurboLinux can sell for about $200.  
</P>
<P>
	No pricing for the DB2-TurboLinux was disclosed. DB2 typically  
sells for about $8,000 per copy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have customers in every geography asking for Linux  
solutions,'' said Dick Sullivan, a vice president for IBM Software. 
``Collaborations like our agreement with Pacific HiTech will help 
IBM bring enterprise solutions to our customers faster and with the 
same high level of support for Linux as we provide for other 
operating systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific HiTech, based in san Francisco, shipped about 1 million  
units of TurboLinux last year, but mostly in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Up for 7th Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence rose in May for a  
record-setting seventh consecutive month, suggesting that the 
economy will remain robust, the Conference Board said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Low inflation and a strong job market are providing a durable  
foundation for historically high levels of consumer confidence,'' 
said Lynn Franco, associate director of the business group's 
Consumer Research Center. ``Consumers continue to project healthy 
economic growth, and their hefty batting average over the last 
three decades suggests it would be unwise to challenge them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report released Tuesday, an organization of  
industrial executives forecast the manufacturing economy will be 
even stronger in the second half of this year than in the first six 
months, with little significant pickup in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management said 55  
percent of the members polled in its semiannual survey said they 
believe business in the final half of 1999 will be better than in 
the first half, up from 46 percent in a survey six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two-thirds believe revenues will be higher this year than  
last, but they predict a net increase of just 4.3 percent -- the 
lowest forecast since May 1996, it said. The organization said 
there are minimal expectations for increased prices of supplies 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the National Association of Realtors released a  
report that showed the spring rise in mortgage rates took a toll on 
home sales, but that activity remained strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The real estate group said sales of existing single-family homes  
fell 3.3 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
5.24 million units from March's 5.42 million record level. Still, 
the April figure was 6.3 percent above the pace of April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest reports had a brief, calming effect on financial  
markets, which were buffeted by investor concerns over Internet 
stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average, at one point up almost 
100 points, not only surrendered all of its gains but closed down 
123.58, a drop of 1.2 percent, at 10,531.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because  
consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's 
overall economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, speaking Monday night  
to the National Retail Federation, said the strength in consumer 
spending, depends not just on the wealth effect generated by rising 
stock prices but from strong home sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the sale of a home, you tend to realize very large capital  
gains -- on average, that has been something in excess of $35,000,'' 
Greenspan said. ``When you are talking about 4 million (home) 
sales, that's a very large number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to  
135.8 in May from a revised 135.5 in April, reaching the highest 
level since July 1998 when it stood at 137.2. Most Wall Street 
analysts had expected the index to be unchanged in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the crisis in Kosovo and increases in gas prices,  
confidence rose for a seventh consecutive month, a performance that 
the business-financed study group said was ``the longest uptrend in 
the 32-year history of the survey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc.  
investment company in St. Louis, said ``consumers are feeling 
good'' and that was showing up in the index. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job situation is the primary factor,'' he said.  
``Unemployment is low, those who want to work can. Wages are rising 
faster than inflation, so consumers are getting ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not believe this was a sign of overheating that  
some fear could prompt the Fed to raise interest rates -- a move the 
Fed recently said it might consider to keep inflationary pressures 
in check. 
</P>
<P>
	``Productivity gains have been offsetting wage gains -- and  
that's the ultimate thing that the Fed is watching,'' Thayer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest report showed 44 percent of those surveyed in May say  
current business conditions are ``good,'' while only 8.4 percent 
characterized them as ``bad.'' That was slightly more optimistic 
than in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 12.8 percent of respondents in May said jobs would be hard  
to get, about the same as the 12.7 percent of the preceding month. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations for upcoming months continued to rise. A separate  
index designed to measure consumer expectations for the next six to 
nine months increased to 109.3 in May from a revised 108.8 in 
April, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled from  
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The 
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to 
buying plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The index compares results to its base year, 1985, when it stood  
at 100.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Contrary to what the tobacco industry says,  
smoking bans in restaurants do not hurt tourism and may even help, 
a study says. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will only further the trend to clean indoor air,'' said  
Elva Yanez, associate director of Americans for Non Smokers' 
Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Yanez called the study being published in Wednesday's Journal of  
the American Medical Association the first of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanton A. Glantz, a tobacco industry critic and professor of  
medicine at University of California, San Francisco, and Annemarie 
Charlesworth also of UC, studied hotel revenues as a measure of 
tourism in three states and six cities. 
</P>
<P>
	In each location, opponents of smoking bans claimed tourism  
would suffer once restaurants and bars went smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
	Glantz and Charlesworth looked at hotel revenues before and  
after the smoking bans took effect. They found the rate of revenue 
increased in four spots, stayed the same in four others and 
increased more slowly in one -- Flagstaff, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't stop these front groups from making the claims but  
people can now say there's actual data out there collected by a 
third party,'' Glantz said of his findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Humber, president of the Arlington, Va.-based group the  
National Smokers Alliance, called the study ``an advocacy piece 
masquerading as research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it used ``too broad an ax, too broad a methodology to  
understand what is going on in very specific circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humber cited San Francisco as an example. There, sidewalk and  
outdoor dining -- which is exempt from the nonsmoking law -- has 
flourished since the ban, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Glantz said the research ``is not a detailed study of the  
dynamics of the hotel or tourism industry. ... This is a paper 
designed to test the veracity of claims that if these things 
passed, the tourism industry would be negatively impacted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at California, Utah and Vermont; all three  
passed smoke-free ordinances in 1995. It also looked at New York 
City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Mesa and Flagstaff, Ariz., and 
Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles and Flagstaff passed smoking bans in 1983, while the  
other cities passed theirs in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel revenue rates stayed the same in California, Vermont,  
Boulder and San Francisco. They increased in Utah, Los Angeles, New 
York City and Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Harrington, who owns a third-generation restaurant and  
bar, said she saw her bottom line drop 10 percent after San 
Francisco's ban was passed in 1995. Since she opened an outdoor 
patio where people can smoke, she said her profits are back up. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington said bar and restaurant owners end up paying the  
price in the battle over smoking rights.

<HEADLINE> Study Compares Heart Beta Blockers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The latest drug for treating congestive heart  
failure is no more effective than a much older one that costs only 
one-third as much, researchers reported in today's issue of 
Circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs are called beta blockers, and they reduce the heart's  
workload. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest beta blocker, carvedilol, was approved by the Food  
and Drug Administration in 1997. But a direct comparison with 
metoprolol, a now-generic beta blocker that has been on the market 
since 1978, found that the two have equal benefits in treating 
heart failure patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Dr. Marrick Kukin, director of the heart  
failure program at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. It was 
paid for in part by SmithKline Beecham, which makes carvedilol, 
known by the brand name Coreg. 
</P>
<P>
	Beta blockers work by blocking the body's response to the high  
levels of stress-related hormones that pour into the bloodstream of 
heart failure patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukin said metoprolol blocks one the body's two types of beta  
receptors, while carvedilol blocks both and was also thought to be 
the only one to boost levels of antioxidants. Antioxidants help 
prevent the fatty buildups in the blood vessels that can trigger a 
heart attack or stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The study involved 46 men and 21 women, ages 29 to 97, who had  
congestive heart failure. After six months, researchers found the 
drugs had similar results in increasing stamina, improving the 
heart's pumping ability and boosting levels of antioxidants. 
</P>
<P>
	The dosages of metoprolol used in the study would cost patients  
about $23 per month. Carvedilol costs at least three times as much, 
Kukin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Neil Shusterman, a cardiologist at SmithKline Beecham, said  
previous research has shown carvedilol is more effective in 
improving heart and kidney function and reducing enlargement of the 
heart. The new study did not look at some of those factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Shusterman said he wants to see a longer-term study involving  
large numbers of patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Circulation is a journal of the American Heart Association.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Rises in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence, a key indicator of future  
economic activity, rose in May for a record-setting seventh 
consecutive month, the Conference Board reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither the crisis in Kosovo nor recent price surges at the  
gas pump have cooled consumer optimism,'' said Lynn Franco, 
associate director of the board's Consumer Research Center. ``Low 
inflation and a strong job market are providing a durable 
foundation for historically high levels of consumer confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The increase came despite recent reports that the Federal  
Reserve, concerned that rapid economic growth could reignite 
inflation, may consider raising interest rates in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the National Association of Realtors reported that  
sales of existing single-family homes fell 3.3 percent in April to 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.24 million units from 
March's 5.42 million record level. Still, the April figure was 6.3 
percent above the pace of April 1998, the Realtors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports helped calm financial markets, providing evidence  
the economy can continue to grow comfortably, analysts said. In 
early afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 
more than 50 points after tumbling 174.61 points on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index rose to 135.8 in May from a  
revised 135.5 in April, reaching the highest level since July 1998 
when it stood at 137.2, according to the Conference Board. Most 
Wall Street analysts had expected the index to be unchanged in May. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the seventh consecutive month of increase for the index,  
which the business-financed study group said was ``the longest 
uptrend in the 32-year history of the survey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because  
consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's 
overall economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc.  
investment company in St. Louis, said ``consumers are feeling 
good'' and that was showing up in the index. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job situation is the primary factor,'' he said.  
``Unemployment is low, those who want to work can. Wages are rising 
faster than inflation, so consumers are getting ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On housing sales, James F. Smith, chief economist for the  
National Association of Realtors, blamed the April drop to a rise 
in interest rates earlier in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect mortgage rates to decline in the near future and  
trend downward during the second half of the year,'' stimulating 
sales, he added. This year's total resales, he said, could be very 
close to last year's record. 
</P>
<P>
	The main consumer index has been strengthening since the rebound  
of the stock market from last fall's downturn and now stands 16.5 
points higher than in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest report showed 44 percent of those surveyed in May say  
current business conditions are ``good,'' while only 8.4 percent 
characterized them as ``bad.'' That was slightly more optimistic 
than in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 12.8 percent of respondents in May said jobs would be hard  
to get, about the same as the 12.7 percent of the preceding month. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations for upcoming months continued to rise.  
</P>
<P>
	A separate index designed to measure consumer expectations for  
the next six to nine months increased to 109.3 in May from a 
revised 108.8 in April, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the longer-term outlook, 16.9 percent said in May they  
expected business conditions to improve and 5.5 percent expected 
them to worsen. And 24.7 percent of respondents in May, nearly one 
in four, said they expected incomes to rise, up from 23.5 percent 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled from  
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The 
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to 
buying plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The index compares results to its base year, 1985, when it stood  
at 100.

<HEADLINE> House Work on Spending Bills Slowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative discontent with Republican  
leaders over spending legislation is slowing House debate over an 
agriculture bill, creating new uncertainty about how Congress will 
complete its spending work this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Things are less chaotic in the Senate, where subcommittees  
approved a $21.2 billion bill Tuesday covering energy and water 
programs, plus a $48.9 billion measure for transportation. But GOP 
leaders there are unsure how must-pass spending bills can be 
approved that, under budget limits, are supposed to be $24 billion 
below this year's levels for domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly nine hours Tuesday, the House debated a $61 billion  
measure financing farm and food programs for next fiscal year. 
Lawmakers barely made any headway. It was the first spending bill 
for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, to reach the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The main reason for the glacial pace: a parade of amendments by  
conservatives, who claimed the measure put lawmakers on a path 
toward breaking spending limits imposed by the budget that Congress 
approved just last month. Exceeding those limits would mean 
spending part of the Social Security surplus, which Republicans 
have pledged not to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of living up to our responsibility to secure a  
future for our children,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a leader 
of the dissident group. ``And quite frankly, I'm not sure this body 
is up to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on condition of anonymity, participants said  
conservatives want GOP leaders to explain quickly what their 
strategy is for approving all 13 spending bills for federal 
agencies for fiscal 2000 without letting President Clinton win 
billions of extra dollars for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, many lawmakers and aides say there is no such  
strategy. Even so, many of them privately concede that negotiations 
with the White House that result in additional spending are all but 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to find out how to do all this stuff, and we  
can't do it on their time frame,'' said House Majority Whip Tom 
DeLay, R-Texas, asked in a brief interview what conservatives 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Of six amendments the conservatives offered, only one was  
approved, cutting the Agriculture Department's chief information 
officer's budget by $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted 24-3 to  
divide $536 billion among its 13 spending bills. The only opponents 
were three Democrats: Sens. Richard Durbin of Illinois, Dianne 
Feinstein of California and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Like an outline approved last week by the House Appropriations  
Committee, the Senate plan would leave bills covering education, 
environment and other domestic programs $24 billion below this 
year's levels and more than $30 billion below what Clinton 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
	To begin bridging that gap, the Senate panel voted by voice to  
take $3.1 billion approved in earlier bills for defense programs 
and use it for domestic spending bills instead. Decisions on 
dividing that money will be made later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to go step by step by step across each little  
puddle,'' said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted 
Stevens, R-Alaska. But Stevens conceded his panel remained billions 
of dollars short of what it would need for its spending bills this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending restrictions in Congress' budget mirror spending  
reductions promised in the 1997 budget-balancing deal between 
Clinton and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The energy and water bill would spend $100 million less in the  
next fiscal year than this year and $400 million less than Clinton 
wanted. The transportation measure would spend $1.6 billion more 
than this year, but that's $1.3 billion less than Clinton proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak, the nation's passenger railroad, would get $571 million,  
$38 million less than this year. Construction on Army Corps of 
Engineers water projects would get $1.1 billion, a cut of $318 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The transportation measure also imposes new requirements on how  
airlines treat passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require an airline that knows a flight's arrival  
will be delayed to notify passengers before they board the plane. 
Airlines advertising bargain fares would have to specify the number 
of seats available at that rate. And passengers who don't use a 
portion of a ticket could not be penalized.

<HEADLINE> Starr Won't Retry McDougal, Steele </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After fighting legal battles all the way to  
the Supreme Court, Kenneth Starr is invoking pragmatism in 
declining to retry two witnesses he accused of hindering his 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr decided Tuesday he won't prosecute anew Whitewater figure  
Susan McDougal and Julie Hiatt Steele, a witness in the Monica 
Lewinsky investigation, after both their trials this spring ended 
with hung juries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retrials raise important questions of resource allocation....  
The jury's inability to reach a unanimous verdict is a reality that 
we have taken seriously,'' Starr said, signaling that his 
five-year, $40 million investigation may be one step closer to 
wrapping up. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Starr's key deputies left for the private sector this  
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel's decision came after juries handed him  
consecutive setbacks in his effort to punish witnesses he contended 
were uncooperative or gave false testimony that delayed his 
investigation. Mistrials were declared in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was welcomed by some of Starr's harshest  
critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe he would have gotten a conviction and he would  
only have put my family through the misery of a retrial,'' said 
William Henley, one of Mrs. McDougal's brothers. ``I think he did 
the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's decision ends five years of legal warfare with Mrs.  
McDougal, who along with her late ex-husband started the Whitewater 
land venture with President Clinton and his wife, Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was sent to prison after being convicted in the  
first Whitewater trial in 1996, was also jailed for refusing a 
judge's order to answer Starr's questions before a grand jury and 
then was tried this year for obstruction. From her jail cell to 
television interviews, she repeatedly attacked Starr's motives and 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyer, who also made Starr's tactics an issue in  
her client's trial, said the decision reflected an assessment that 
``this was a case that could not be won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever his motivation, we are pleased and relieved,'' said  
attorney Nancy Luque. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr still has two more trials involving another witness he has  
accused of being uncooperative, presidential friend and former 
Justice Department official Webster Hubbell. Hubbell, who has 
already served prison time on charges brought by Starr, faces 
separate indictments alleging tax evasion and false testimony. The 
first of those trials is set to begin in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr had accused Mrs. McDougal of obstructing his investigation  
and defying a federal judge's order by refusing to testify before 
the grand jury that investigated the Clintons' Arkansas business 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury in April acquitted Mrs. McDougal of the obstruction  
charge and deadlocked on the contempt of court charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal testified in her own defense. She said she refused  
to talk to the grand jury because she feared that Starr would 
punish her if she did not give testimony that matched his theory of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office charged Ms. Steele of Richmond, Va., with lying  
to federal investigators in testimony that undercut the claims of 
presidential accuser Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey alleged Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance  
toward her inside the White House in 1993 and that she told Ms. 
Steele immediately about the episode. Ms. Steele testified that 
Mrs. Willey had not told her about the alleged incident and later 
asked her to lie about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Starr provided testimony from friends that Ms. Steele had  
indeed told them about Mrs. Willey's allegation shortly after the 
alleged incident occurred, a jury in northern Virginia deadlocked 
and a mistrial was declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers surprised many by resting their case  
without calling any witnesses.

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Hasek Is Out for Game 2 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Dominik Hasek won't play in Game 2 of the NHL's  
Eastern Conference finals tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres' star goaltender has not been declared out for the  
series because of his strained groin. But coach Lindy Ruff said 
today Dwayne Roloson will get another start as Buffalo tries to 
extend its lead to 2-0 over the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was treated in the dressing room today and said he feels  
much better than he did Sunday. He did not practice but plans to 
skate Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty optimistic,'' he said. ``I feel much more  
strength in my leg and that's good. I hope I'll be back in the 
series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roloson, who won Game 1, will be backed up by Martin Biron.  
</P>
<P>
	Ruff said the team we'll see if treatment and medication can get  
him playing again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see how that makes him feel,'' Ruff said after the  
morning practice. ``We're going to try anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have another problem on the medical front, but nobody  
is predicting a return date for Miroslav Satan, the team's leading 
scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs don't care who's stopping pucks or who's  
shooting them for Buffalo. If the Leafs don't start playing better 
soon, they won't beat anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't prepare for what goaltender is in the net,'' Maple  
Leafs defenseman Bryan Berard said Monday after practice at the Air 
Canada Centre. ``Our game plan with Hasek or Dwayne Roloson is to 
get as many pucks at the net as possible and look for rebounds, 
screens or tips. We have to tighten up defensively. If we sharpen 
up defensively, we should be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs, in pursuit of their first Stanley Cup since 1967,  
will try to bounce back again after opening with a home loss for 
the third straight series. In both other cases, against 
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, they won the second game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're desperate now,'' Leafs center Steve Sullivan said. ``We  
have to win Game 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs were offered a gift when Hasek, the NHL's most  
valuable player the past two seasons, missed Game 1 Sunday. But 
turnovers and a shaky performance by goalie Curtis Joseph added up 
to a 5-4 loss for Toronto and home-ice advantage for Buffalo in the 
best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto now gets another chance to test Roloson, a journeyman  
goalie obtained last July as a free agent after spending parts of 
two seasons with the Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek returned to Buffalo on Sunday night for tests, including a  
bone scan that showed no serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph is ready for another chance to stifle a Buffalo team that  
is still without Satan, who hasn't played since the first round 
when a teammate's shot struck and bruised his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto led the league in scoring during the regular season and  
started out Sunday's game by luring the tight-checking Sabres into 
a shootout. The strategy backfired for the Leafs, whose costly 
turnovers led to three Buffalo goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We scored four goals, and that should be enough to win, but we  
didn't play well defensively,'' Berard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get back to our game where we're strong defensively and  
still a threat offensively, then they'll have to set up the trap, 
and that will work to our advantage,'' Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Joseph allowed five goals on just 21 shots, nobody  
blamed him for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five goals did go in, and we're not pleased with that,''  
Joseph said. ``I don't think there were any softies. They made some 
good plays, but I didn't steal any out of the net, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If he thinks he played a bad game, he knows in his heart what  
he has to do in the next game,'' Leafs wing Steve Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph goes into tonight's game with a 2.05 goals-against  
average, which ranks him third among the four starting playoff 
goalies left in the playoffs. But he's only as good as his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to adjust in the last two series and play a much  
stronger defensive game,'' Thomas said. ``When you play good 
defense, it creates a lot of opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mats Sundin, who scored twice in Game 1 and has six goals and  
six assists in the playoffs for the Leafs, also stressed defense as 
the key. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defense gave us success in the first two rounds,'' Sundin  
said. ``A lack of it cost the game the other night.''

<HEADLINE> Celtics' Bill Russell To Be Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Bill Russell's No. 6 jersey will be retired for a  
second time Wednesday night by the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he's agreed to let the public be part of it.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, Russell wanted no public ceremony because he was bitter  
at what he perceived as racial prejudice 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 center was Boston's first black sports star, but  
he felt that because of his color, he never received the 
recognition he deserved for helping the Celtics to 11 NBA 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why he refused to allow a retirement ceremony in front of  
fans on March 12, 1972. Only about a dozen players and friends were 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that day, Russell was cheered loudly as he took his  
courtside seat as a broadcaster, but he refused to acknowledge 
their applause. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, the team will finally honor him publicly  
when it rededicates his No. 6 alongside those 11 NBA championship 
banners Russell helped win. 
</P>
<P>
	Some attributed the distance between Russell and Celtics fans to  
the inability of predominantly white Boston to accept a black man 
as a central sports hero. Russell's refusal to sign autographs for 
fans certainly didn't help his popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	In the community where Russell lived, the racism was not always  
so subtle. 
</P>
<P>
	When Russell tried to move from his home in the Boston suburb of  
Reading to a new home across town, neighbors filed a petition 
trying to block the move. When that failed, other neighbors banded 
together to try to purchase the home that Russell wanted to buy, 
said Tom Heinsohn, a close friend of Russell's who played with him 
from 1956 to 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, vandals broke into Russell's home and defecated on his  
bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinsohn said two white sports writers from Boston told him they  
wouldn't vote Russell the league's most valuable player because he 
was black. Heinsohn declined to identify the writers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was very much a part of the non-appreciation of Bill  
Russell as a player here,'' Heinsohn said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell's achievements during his days in Boston, from 1956 to  
1969, drew national acclaim, but never won locals fans' hearts the 
way later Boston sports heroes did, from hockey player Bobby Orr to 
baseball player Carl Yastrzemski to basketball player Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell's shot-blocking, defense and rebounding enabled his  
Celtics teams to play a wide-open style that led to 11 
championships in 13 years. But the Boston Garden averaged 8,406 
fans during Russell's playing career, thousands short of a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always sold out on the road, but rarely when we played at  
home,'' said Satch Sanders, who played with the Celtics from 1960 
to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Celtics teams led by Larry Bird in the 1980s  
sold out the 14,890-seat Garden for 662 straight games, from 1980 
to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's event at the FleetCenter was expected to draw  
celebrities and former players, including Bill Cosby, Aretha 
Franklin, Muhammad Ali, Julius Erving and Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds will go to national and state mentoring programs.  
Russell serves on the board of The National Mentoring Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales to the event were initially slow, but picked up enough to  
allow the promoters to start selling tickets in the top tier of the 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope people turn out,'' Heinsohn said. ``(Russell and the  
Celtics) showed that people could get along. The Celtics just kept 
winning championships, and color didn't matter.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Includes Religion in Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- As part of a ``new partnership'' between church  
and state, a President Gore would ``dare to embrace'' faith-based 
programs with public funds and set policy with religious leaders at 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Such was the pledge Vice President Al Gore made Monday as he  
further fleshed out an agenda for Campaign 2000 that he hopes will 
both set him apart from President Clinton and bring him close 
enough to his opponents -- chiefly Republican George W. Bush and 
Democrat Bill Bradley -- to neutralize any ``values'' debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, he and Clinton appear together at an economic development  
conference in Texas before Gore resumes campaign fund raising. 
Three events Monday bagged him $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The moment has come for Washington to catch up to the rest of  
America,'' the congressman-turned-senator-turned-vice-president 
said in tones borrowed from a Washington outsider. 
</P>
<P>
	``And Americans profoundly, rightly believe that politics and  
morality are deeply interrelated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a Salvation Army drug rehabilitation center, Gore  
said places like that and Christ House and Christian Women's Job 
Corps have some of the most effective programs dealing with 
homelessness, addiction and mental illness precisely because of 
their religious bent. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the workers in these organizations, that client is not a  
number but a child of God,'' he said. ``We should explore carefully 
tailored partnerships with our faith community, so we can use the 
approaches that are working best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His plan essentially would expand conservative Republican Sen.  
John Ashcroft's ``charitable choice'' provision of the 1996 welfare 
overhaul that allowed government money to fund faith-based groups 
helping to move people from welfare to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was short on specifics -- communications director Laura  
Quinn called it a ``broad idea'' at this point -- but he insisted no 
government-funded program would ``promote a religious view or try 
to force anyone to receive religion'' and that secular alternatives 
would be available. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times he said he believes in the separation of church and  
state. 
</P>
<P>
	But Terri Schroeder, a First Amendment legal analyst at The  
American Civil Liberties Union, said Gore's plan raises troubling 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can a religious institution counsel without proselytizing?  
How can you provide juvenile services without some level of 
coercion? How can we have any accountability for how our money is 
spent given the traditional separation of church and state?'' 
Schroeder asked. 
</P>
<P>
	For Gore, the political benefit of religious talk is twofold: It  
sneaks some ground out from under Republicans who have long 
dominated the morals debate; and, less overtly, may serve to 
disassociate him from Clinton's personal scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's taken too long for candidate Gore to join Republicans in  
recognizing the rightful role of churches and religious 
organizations in solving society's most challenging and pressing 
problems,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National 
Committee. At the same time, he welcomed Gore's ``change of 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senior policy adviser to Gore, Elaine Kamarck, told The Boston  
Globe over the weekend, ``The Democratic Party is going to take 
back God this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aboard Air Force Two on Monday, vice presidential spokesman  
Chris Lehane shook his head at Kamarck's candor. He refused to 
speak to the politics of Gore's new emphasis on spirituality and 
rejected the notion that Republicans have cornered the market on 
religious voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think God is partisan,'' Lehane said.  
</P>
<P>
	Beyond current-day political expedience, Gore can lay claim to a  
religious and spiritual grounding. As a young man returning from 
Vietnam, he studied at Vanderbilt's divinity school. And in his 
1991 book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' Gore wrote of his ``deeply 
personal'' relationship with Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, said Lehane, the vice president has never been someone to  
``wear God on his sleeve'' and doesn't plan to now that he's 
running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	On other questions of church and state, the vice president  
opposes organized prayer in public schools during the school day, 
and he opposes using public dollars to send children to parochial 
schools, Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Gore offered a pledge to the clergy and community  
activists gathered at The Salvation Army: ``If you elect me 
president, the voices of faith-based organizations will be integral 
to the policies set forth in my administration.''

<HEADLINE>  Pacers Are Trying To Stay Sharp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- It's rust, not rest, that worries the  
Indiana Pacers, the only team without a loss through the first two 
rounds of the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-game sweep of Milwaukee in the first round and a  
four-game sweep of Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference 
semifinals took minimal toll on the Pacers physically. But it also 
meant a full week will have passed before they open the conference 
finals against New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it hurts or helps. All I know is that it is  
for all the marbles to go to the championship, to have the 
opportunity to go to the finals and win this whole thing,'' Mark 
Jackson said after a brief shoot-around Tuesday. ``There's no time 
for any excuses now. We're excited about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks wrapped up a four-game sweep of Atlanta on Monday  
night, so they'll have almost as much time between games as the 
Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get a little rusty,'' Indiana coach Larry Bird said. ``I  
had that happen to us in Boston before. We had eight or nine days 
and came out a little rusty. But New York's got a lot of time, too, 
so we'll get back to work tomorrow and try to practice as hard as 
we possibly can to prepare these guys and hopefully go into the 
first game on Sunday ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will be mental. I think it'll be physical,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers' last game was on Sunday, when they finished off the  
76ers in Philadelphia. They'll break up the practice routine this 
week with a scrimmage, open to the public, at Market Square Arena 
on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Miller called the week between games ``a double-edged  
sword.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes both ways,'' Miller said. ``It's great because we're  
going to be well prepared for New York, and vice versa, but on the 
other hand it's kind of good to be playing basketball games and 
getting banged and moved around. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want some of the rust to settle into your game at  
all, but I'm sure both teams will be ready come Sunday,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two games in the best-of-7 series will be at Indiana  
Sunday afternoon and Tuesday night. Games 3 and 4 will be in New 
York the following Saturday and Monday. If necessary, the remaining 
games will be in Indianapolis on June 9, in New York June 11 and 
back to Indy on June 13 for a Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers are working on a 12-game playoff winning streak at  
home, but in three previous trips to the conference finals -- 1994, 
1995 and 1998 -- they never had homecourt advantage and lost on the 
road each time in the seventh game. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Indiana earned the homecourt edge in the East after  
both Miami and Orlando lost in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't rely on homecourt advantage that much, but we feel  
very fortunate to have it so we want to take advantage of it,'' 
Bird said. ``We played a lot better at home, and we're playing 
awful well on the road. We lucked into homecourt advantage, and 
we're playing against a team that's played a lot better, but we've 
got to worry about ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks were seeded eighth in the East but took out Miami in  
five games and Atlanta in four. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing much better, with a lot more confidence thanks  
to an Atlanta team that looked like they could care less,'' Jackson 
said. ``But give the Knicks credit. They're playing better 
basketball, and it'll be a war of a series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana won two of three regular-season games against New York  
this year. The two teams have met in four previous playoff series, 
each winning twice.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Canada Reach Magazine Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Canada and the United States have reached a  
tentative agreement to end their eight-month dispute over Canada's 
proposed magazine legislation, sources close to the negotiations 
told Canadian Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A deal would avert the threat of American trade sanctions in  
areas such as lumber, steel and textiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakthrough came over the weekend, when negotiators managed  
to get through the impasse on access to Canadian advertising 
dollars, the heart of the dispute. A bill in the Canadian 
Parliament calls for fines on foreign publishers who carried 
Canadian advertising in special Canadian editions of their 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise would allow American publishers who produce  
Canadian magazines -- also known as split-runs -- to print up to 18 
percent of Canadian advertising per issue. The levels would be 
phased in over three years, with 12 percent in the first year and 
15 percent in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Magazines printing more than that would have to produce a  
majority of Canadian content or face the original system of fines 
proposed in the bill. Split-runs cost little to publish and 
therefore can afford to charge advertisers much less than Canadian 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Magazine Publishers Association has said that  
granting anything more than 10 percent would cause serious damage 
to the industry. Meanwhile, their U.S. counterparts steadfastly 
demanded 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the negotiations, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, told Canadian Press that some form of federal funding to 
the industry would be made available to ease the pressure that 
American publications would exert on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, conditions would be placed on American publishers  
that run more than the specified amount of Canadian ads to set up 
some sort of presence in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes days after the two countries teetered on the  
brink of a full-scale trade war when negotiators came to an 
impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal announcement of the tenative agreement is expected  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade Minister Sergio Marchi beamed as he addressed a Senate  
committee meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``While you will no doubt appreciate that I cannot go into the  
details ... I will say that we have made substantial progress and I 
expect that we will come to a meeting of the minds very soon,'' 
Marchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchi has tried to take a conciliatory tone to the magazine  
issue, supporting the need for cultural protection on one hand 
while expressing concern for the industries that were likely to be 
affected by a trade war.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Drops Plan To Visit to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen has dropped  
plans to visit China next month, his spokesman said Tuesday, 
because of the Kosovo crisis and heightened tensions with the 
Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably is not the easiest time to visit China,''  
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, alluding to allegations of extensive 
Chinese espionage at U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories and Chinese 
outrage over the mistaken NATO bombing May 7 of the Chinese Embassy 
in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second time this year Cohen has put off a trip to  
China. In April he cited the urgency of the NATO air campaign over 
Kosovo, then in an early stage. The trip was tentatively 
rescheduled for June, suggesting the Clinton administration had 
expected the air campaign to be over by then, or nearly so. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said Cohen hoped to reschedule a China trip but would be  
preoccupied with other matters in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the primary reason for that is that right now he feels  
that his place is here in Washington, devoting as much time as 
possible to running the U.S. participation in the air campaign in 
Kosovo, preparing for the peacekeeping force, et cetera,'' Bacon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions with China are a factor, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``China, as you know, has broken off military-to-military  
relations temporarily with the United States and he feels that it 
may be better to go later,'' Bacon said. ``He remains, of course, 
steadfastly committed to engagement with China as a long-term 
policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the Chinese Embassy bombing in Belgrade, Beijing  
informed the Clinton administration that it was suspending 
high-level military contacts at least through May. The first 
casualty was a planned visit to China in mid-May by Gen. Charles 
Krulak, the Marine Corps commandant. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week China refused to allow U.S. warships entry into Hong  
Kong harbor. It barred a scheduled May 21 port visit by an American 
submarine and ship, marking the first time since World War II that 
the U.S. Seventh Fleet was denied access to the former British 
colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said it was Cohen's decision, not Beijing's, to scrap his  
June trip. The trip was never officially announced, but Cohen told 
a congressional committee two weeks ago that he was planning to go.

<HEADLINE> MSN To Post CareerBuilder Listings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is taking a stake in the  
Web-based job listing service CareerBuilder Inc. in a move that 
will put listings from more than 650 companies on Microsoft's MSN 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft made an initial investment of $17.8 million in the  
Reston, Va.-based company with the right to acquire more shares, 
The Washington Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Microsoft can post CareerBuilder's job-search  
database on the Web under its own name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Users are really wanting to find as many of the things they  
are wanting online in one location with the same look and feel,'' 
Michael Goff, director of programming for the Microsoft Network, 
told The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	CareerBuilder already operates its own Web site and offers its  
services through 22 others, including sites owned by USA Today and 
Business Week. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., has made a push in recent  
months to add additional features to its MSN portal, including 
travel, financial and auto information, with content from outside 
companies. Last week, Microsoft announced an alliance with 
Homeseekers.com to boost its real estate listings.

<HEADLINE> Hasek Sidelined for Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek missed  
his second straight playoff game Tuesday night with a groin injury, 
and Dwayne Roloson started against the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	Roloson made 28 saves in Buffalo's 5-4 win in Sunday's opener in  
the best-of-7 Eastern Conference finals as Hasek was unable to play 
because of the injury that first bothered him back in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek said the injury probably wouldn't keep him out of the  
entire series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel much better than I did two days ago,'' Hasek said  
before Tuesday's game. ``I feel pretty optimistic. I feel much more 
strength in my leg and that's good. I hope I'll be back in the 
series. It's day-to-day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has been taking anti-inflammatory drugs to ease the pain.  
Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said the team was considering using 
cortisone injections. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try anything,'' Ruff said. ``We'll explore  
every avenue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek first injured the groin in a 3-2 overtime loss to Toronto  
in Buffalo on Feb. 17. The two-time defending league MVP, who led 
the NHL in save percentage (.937) for the sixth straight year, 
missed the next 12 games and did not return until March 19. He flew 
to Germany on March 24 for treatment after twisting his back in a 
game against the New Jersey Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	The groin injury flared in a Game 4 victory over Boston in the  
second round and continued hampering the acrobatic goaltender in a 
5-3 loss to the Bruins in Game 5. Hasek started and won Game 6 
against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has got to get to a level where he feels comfortable and  
can perform his acrobatics,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, whose butterfly style relies on mobility and quickness  
and a capacity to rebound from a prone position, said he didn't 
know when he would return. The teams play Thursday and Saturday in 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I'm thinking about Thursday,'' said Hasek, who added  
he would try to skate Wednesday. ``Who knows? I cannot answer 
because I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek said he would be cheating his teammates if he were to try  
to come back too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot go up and down, and if I cannot go up and down I  
cannot do my job,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI in Buffalo on Monday confirmed that Hasek had a strained  
groin, but a bone scan revealed no other damage, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff said the Sabres were still a good team without Hasek.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can beat anybody, and we don't need every star player in  
the lineup,'' said Ruff, also missing leading scorer Miroslav Satan 
since the first round when Satan sustained an ankle bruise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have recalled Martin Biron from Rochester, the team's  
AHL affiliate, to back up Roloson. Biron, named the AHL's 
outstanding goaltender this season, made three starts and was 1-2-1 
with the Sabres.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Executes Man by Injection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDDYVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A man who murdered his adoptive parents  
was executed by injection on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Lee Harper Jr., who said he preferred death to the slow  
torture of life in prison, was the first person in the state to be 
executed by injection. Previous executions used the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, 50, saved his last statement to his 27-year-old son.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love you and I'll be waiting for you on the other side. I'll  
be waiting for you, boy,'' Harper said. ``That's all I have to 
say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The execution previous to Harper's was the 1997 death of Harold  
McQueen. The last execution before that took place 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper's was the first execution in which the inmate could  
choose their method of execution: electrocution or injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper was sentenced to death for murdering his parents, Alice  
and Edward Lee Harper Sr., who had adopted him as an infant. After 
entering his parents' home in the early morning hours of Feb. 19, 
1982, he shot them both with a .38-caliber handgun while they were 
in bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, who had been laid off from his job as a machinist in  
December 1981, stood to inherit an $86,541 insurance policy on his 
father's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper said at his trial that his father had asked him to shoot  
him and his wife because she was mentally ill and the elder Harper 
couldn't bear to put her in an institution.

<HEADLINE> Sales of Existing Homes Off 3.3 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After hitting an all-time high in March, sales  
of existing homes slipped back a bit last month, with the setback 
blamed on rising mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing  
single-family homes dropped 3.3 percent in April to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 5.24 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the first decline after five consecutive monthly  
increases as the strong economy pushed sales of new and existing 
homes into record territory. 
</P>
<P>
	James Smith, chief economist for the Realtors, predicted that  
1999 still would be a good year for home sales, given the strong 
economy, high consumer confidence levels and unemployment rates 
that have dropped to the lowest levels in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rise in interest rates earlier this spring caused a  
temporary postponement of purchase decisions. We expect mortgage 
rates to decline in the near future and trend downward during the 
second half of the year,'' Smith said. ``Existing home sales in 
1999 should be very close to last year's record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A weekly national survey of rates by Freddie Mac, the mortgage  
company, showed that 30-year rates climbed last week to 7.10 
percent, the highest level in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in the housing sector has been a key factor  
supporting U.S. economic growth in the midst of severe recessions 
in many parts of the world stemming from the Asian currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, speaking Monday night  
to the National Retail Federation, said the strength in consumer 
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, 
depends not just on the wealth effect generated by rising stock 
prices but from strong home sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the sale of a home, you tend to realize very large capital  
gains -- on average, that has been something in excess of $35,000,'' 
Greenspan said. ``When you are talking about 4 million (home) 
sales, that's a very large number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists attribute the strong consumer spending to the  
wealth effect that occurs when people start spending more of their 
disposable income because their investment portfolios are rising. 
But Greenspan said ``by far the largest portion of the extent to 
which capital gains are being translated into purchases occurs in 
the process'' of selling a home. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer confidence has also helped to bolster strong spending,  
reflecting the fact that unemployment rates have fallen to the 
lowest level in three decades. The Conference Board reported today 
that consumer confidence rose for a record-setting seventh straight 
month, climbing in May to 135.8, compared to April's index number 
of 135.5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Realtors report on sales of existing homes showed the  
biggest drop in April occurred in the Northeast, where sales fell 
by 8.3 percent to an annual rate of 660,000 units. Sales were down 
4.2 percent in the Midwest and 3.8 percent in the South. The only 
region of the country that saw an increase last month was the West, 
where sales rose 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The median price of an existing home sold last month rose by 1.4  
percent to $131,400. The median price is the point where half the 
homes sold for more and half for less.

<HEADLINE> House Notes Tiananmen Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House marked the approaching 10th  
anniversary of China's Tiananmen Square crackdown by condemning 
``ongoing and egregious'' human rights abuses by the country's 
Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day that a House committee detailed alleged stealing of  
U.S. nuclear secrets by China, lawmakers voted 418-0 Tuesday for a 
nonbinding resolution urging China to investigate its use of force 
against pro-democracy demonstrators on June 4, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Undetermined numbers of Chinese were killed, injured or  
imprisoned without trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese government ought to know we're not going to forget  
about it,'' said Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-China relations have been strained in recent months over  
the spying allegations, NATO's mistaken bombing of the Chinese 
Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and disagreements over China's 
entry into the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the resolution tells ``the  
prisoners and their torturers and the Chinese people and the world 
that the American people remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also urges China to release all imprisoned democracy  
advocates, compensate families of those killed in 1989 and to end 
immediately harassment, detention and imprisonment of Chinese 
citizens exercising free speech and freedom of religion. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H. Res. 178.

<HEADLINE> Health of 49ers Line Couch in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- The health of San Francisco 49ers line  
coach Bobb McKittrick is in doubt after doctors canceled a liver 
transplant after discovering his cancer spread from his bile duct. 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick, 63, went to Stanford University Medical Center  
Monday to receive part of a liver from a donor in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	He was to have shared the organ with a 6-year-old girl in a  
procedure known as a split-liver transplant. The girl, too small to 
accept an adult liver, was scheduled to receive a lobe of the organ 
before the rest went to McKittrick. 
</P>
<P>
	But exploratory surgery Monday night revealed that the cancer,  
initially contained in the bile duct, has spread. The transplant 
procedure, to be performed by liver specialists Drs. Carlos 
Esquivel and Kenneth Drazlan, was canceled and McKittrick instead 
had a biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobb is an extremeley courageous man and we are encouraged  
that with his amazingly positive attitude, the love and support of 
his family and our thoughts and prayers that he will rebound from 
this setback,'' 49ers coach Steve Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick was in fair condition with stable vital signs on  
Tuesday, the team reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``They operated on him for about three hours and did a biopsy,''  
said Teckla McKittrick, the coach's wife. ``He'll probably be in 
the hospital for three or four days and they'll decide what to do. 
It's not good news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick told the San Francisco Examiner he learned Monday  
morning about the organ being found in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next thing I know, they say, ``We've got a liver for you.' The  
assistant surgeon was leaving (for Las Vegas) almost immediately 
after talking to me,'' McKittrick told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick was diagnosed with cancer of the bile duct in  
mid-January. He began chemotherapy and radiation in February and 
finished the regimen in mid-April. In the process, the 200-pound 
McKittrick lost 33 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty good until I do something, then I don't have any  
stamina,'' he said. ``I get tired easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because he has already had radiation in addition to  
chemotherapy, McKittrick's treatment options are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	``Radiation is out,'' his son, Ladd McKittrick, said. ``He's  
already had his maximum. Some sort of chemotherapy will be 
determined. That probably will be the most likely treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick's future with the 49ers, whom he joined in 1979, is  
uncertain. His illness made the team shift tight ends coach Pat 
Morris to the offensive line. In the last minicamp, Morris was 
assisted by former 49ers guard Guy McIntyre.

<HEADLINE>  Barak Picks Likud As Likely Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERZLIYA, Israel (AP) -- A week after beating it at the polls,  
Ehud Barak's Labor Party named the hard-line Likud as its preferred 
junior coalition partner on Tuesday, reinforcing the prime 
minister-elect's cautious approach to Mideast peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor seeks to work with Likud ``in the hope of finding national  
consensus in a period where important decisions will be made, both 
domestically and abroad,'' said David Libai, the head of Barak's 
coalition negotiation team. 
</P>
<P>
	Libai spoke after meeting Tuesday with Likud ministers at a  
luxury seaside hotel in the northern Tel Aviv suburb of Herzliya. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab leaders, frustrated with a stagnating peace process under  
outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, had welcomed Barak's 
victory. However, they expressed concern after he promised in his 
victory speech last week to keep Jerusalem united under Israeli 
rule and not to return Israel to its 1967 borders. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Labor Party members had favored the ultra-Orthodox Shas  
over Likud, which Labor has blamed for stalling the peace process. 
But negotiations with Shas did not go as well as they did for Likud 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the Likud meeting, party members -- devastated by  
Barak's landslide victory May 17 -- emerged confident and smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want us very much, they said so loud and clear,'' said  
outgoing Communications Minister Limor Livnat. The two teams were 
to meet again within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Likud lost 13 seats in the elections, it still emerged  
as the second-largest party in parliament, with 19 seats. Labor won 
26 seats in the 120-seat Knesset and Shas won 17, making it the 
third-largest party. 
</P>
<P>
	Livnat, among the most hawkish members of Netanyahu's  
government, said she was optimistic about entering a coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to have unity, but not at any price of course,'' she  
said. ``The gaps are wide. We want details on their policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yossi Beilin, a leading Labor Party member, said guidelines  
would be created jointly among the coalition partners and that the 
peace process would only move forward once the government was 
established. Barak has 45 days to present his coalition to 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian officials said Tuesday they hoped to see a  
government committed to advancing the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as we are concerned we want to see implementation of  
(peace) agreements and a cessation of Jewish settlement activities 
before engaging in final status talks,'' senior Palestinian 
negotiator Saeb Erekat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hopes to convene an Arab summit  
to coordinate a response to any peace proposals Barak puts forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has said he wants to build a consensus to proceed with  
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	With Likud inside his coalition, rather than fighting from the  
opposition, he could accelerate implementation of the U.S.-brokered 
peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
	However, such a partnership could inhibit the far-reaching  
decisions on final status with the Palestinians and the Syrians 
that Barak has pledged to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has indicated he would give up territory on the Golan  
Heights to achieve peace with Syria, a position Likud has rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has said expanding Jewish settlement in disputed parts of  
Jerusalem is ``unwise,'' while Likud is committed to a larger 
Jewish presence in the eastern half of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Barak's negotiators had indicated that  
Meretz, a dovish party to the left of Labor, was the preferred 
coalition partner and that Shas, without its leader, Arieh Deri, 
was also wanted in the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Meretz and Labor drew votes from secular Israelis who  
wanted to see an end to the powers of religious parties in 
government. Meretz has said it would not sit with Shas, but might 
be persuaded to if Deri -- appealing a bribery conviction and a 
four-year jail sentence -- resigned from political life and the 
party was striped of its hold over the powerful Interior Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shas negotiators said Tuesday they would rather sit in  
opposition than meet those demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``They showed interest in our joining the coalition, but we  
won't go crawling to any government,'' said outgoing Interior 
Minister Eli Suissa. ``Whoever wants us will get us as we are. We 
won't be performing any cosmetic surgery in order to get into a 
coalition,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dale Jr. Ready for Winston Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- History is about to repeat itself 24 years  
after a young driver named Dale Earnhardt made his Winston Cup 
debut at Charlotte Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Earnhardt Jr. is scheduled to race for the first time in  
NASCAR's top series at the Coca-Cola 600. First-round qualifying 
for Sunday's event, the longest on the circuit, is set for 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that we've got a lot of growing to do, a lot of  
changes, and this is a good way to find out where we are,'' said 
the 24-year-old Earnhardt, who plans to run five Winston Cup races 
this year before moving to the series full time in 2000. ``We're 
just trying to get our feet wet and see what we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The driver known as Little E is attracting a lot more attention  
than his father did in his first Winston Cup race. The elder 
Earnhardt was virtually unknown outside the region when he showed 
up on Charlotte's 1.5-mile, high-banked trioval in 1975, starting 
33rd and finishing 22nd in a car owned by Ed Negre. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt went on to win 72 races and seven Winston Cup  
championships, and his fame was one of the reasons his son became a 
star practically overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Earnhardt helped his cause last year by winning  
seven races and the driving title as a rookie on the Busch Grand 
National circuit. He's second in the points this year in his bid to 
win a second straight championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The abilities he's already demonstrated and his potential to be  
one of the sport's next superstars prompted Anheuser-Busch to sign 
on as his Winston Cup sponsor, committing more than $10 million a 
year through its Budweiser brand. And his handlers organized a 
``Countdown To E-Day'' campaign, complete with well-attended media 
events and fast-selling souvenirs to celebrate his introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The track, which was recently renamed Lowe's Motor Speedway,  
will create a whole new set of memories for someone who still 
vividly recalls his teen-age days in the garage area. Earnhardt 
remembers being 13 and 14, hanging out with the sons of other 
drivers, killing time and trying to stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to try to talk everybody into letting us wax their  
cars and stuff like that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His top priority this week will be to try to lock up one of the  
36 starting spots available in two rounds of time trials. Because 
his Dale Earnhardt Inc.-owned Chevrolet is a new entry, the younger 
Earnhardt has no owner points and therefore is ineligible for a 
provisional starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Early indications, however, were that he is more than capable of  
making the field on speed alone. When General Motors held an open 
test session at Charlotte for its teams earlier this month, 26 
showed up. Earnhardt had the fastest lap run by any driver in the 
two-day session. 
</P>
<P>
	He knows that not everyone at the test -- including Jeff Gordon,  
winner of the last five Coca-Cola 600 poles -- was concentrating 
solely on speed. Some teams focused more on their setups for the 
race, which starts in daylight but ends well after dusk. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt said he still drew plenty of confidence from the test,  
even if some teams were holding back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a little bit left, too,'' he said. ``We didn't even  
have a qualifying motor in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the kind of talk that can make a father proud, even when  
your father's The Intimidator. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a young one, but he's handling it all pretty good,'' the  
elder Earnhardt said. ``He's going wide open with all the guys and 
the team. He's handling things as they come. I sit down and talk 
with him and see where his head is every once in a while.''

<HEADLINE> Mike Veeck Leaves Devil Rays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Mike Veeck, who developed one of the  
most ambitious promotions schedules in baseball for the Tampa Bay 
Devil Rays, resigned Tuesday for personal reasons the team said 
were related to the health of his 7-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Veeck, son of Hall of Famer Bill Veeck, will continue to live in  
St. Petersburg and serve as a marketing consultant to the Devil 
Rays, who have experienced a sharp decline in attendance despite a 
zany advertising and giveaway campaign he dubbed ``Off The Wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through 22 home dates prior to Tuesday's night game against the  
Texas Rangers, the Devil Rays were averaging announced crowds of 
21,032 -- down from the 30,939 per game the team drew during its 
inaugural season in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Veeck's resignation will give him more time to be with his  
daughter, Rebecca, who is suffering from retinitis pigmentosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate the creative energy that Mike has brought to the  
organization and we are pleased that he will continue to contribute 
his ideas and represent the team in the community,'' Devil Rays 
managing general partner Vince Naimoli said. ``At the same time we 
admire his devotion to his family and wish the best for Rebecca.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veeck scheduled special events or giveaways on 70 of 81 home  
dates for the Devil Rays, including Lawyer Appreciation Night where 
attorneys will be charged double and billed by the third of an 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night, for example, was Christmas in May Night at  
Tropicana Field. Christmas music blared from stadium speakers 
before the game and between innings. 
</P>
<P>
	John Browne, the club's director of corporate sales since April  
1997, was promoted to vice president of sales and marketing and 
will take over Veeck's duties.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Cox Praised for China Spy Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Rep. Christopher Cox was directing the  
investigation of Chinese spying last fall, the House was in a 
partisan uproar over the impeachment case against President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, some Republicans were counting on Cox to find new  
potential impeachment charges that would connect Chinese money to 
fund raising for the Clinton-Gore campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, Cox was praised for doing the opposite: removing any  
trace of partisanship from the investigation and convincing four 
Republicans and four Democrats to join him in unanimously approving 
his select committee's report on Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of all I want to say to Chairman Cox, you did a  
first-rate job,'' said Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington state, the 
committee's ranking Democrat. Dicks said Cox conducted the 
investigation while ``the political environment ... was as partisan 
and as mean-spirited as I've seen it in 30 years here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, 46, often thinks for a minute before making a public  
comment, and his statements usually have a scholarly air befitting 
a man who finished his undergraduate studies in three years and 
earned business and law degrees from Harvard. He speaks Russian. 
For enjoyment, he reads books on mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
	But the six-term California Republican, a White House counsel in  
the Reagan administration, has his partisan streaks, too. 
</P>
<P>
	He serves as chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee,  
which helps set the conservative GOP congressional agenda. And he 
has unleashed his fury against Democratic fund-raisers during 
hearings of the highly partisan Committee on Government Reform, the 
panel investigating illegal donations to the 1996 Clinton-Gore 
campaign, possibly by China. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox told reporters Tuesday that he had a plan for the China  
committee to take the high ground, before producing its unanimous 
conclusion that Chinese espionage led to the theft of top-secret 
information about every U.S. nuclear weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to leave our disagreements on the cutting room floor  
and put into this report those things that we agreed upon, because 
of the importance of that message, and the importance that we do 
something about it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Notting Hill' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Notting Hill'' asks the question, ``Can the most famous film  
star in the world fall for the man on the street?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer is supposed to be yes. Try as they may, though, Julia  
Roberts and Hugh Grant can't convince us that their characters fall 
hopelessly in love with each other. Otherwise, ``Notting Hill'' is 
a harmless, well-intentioned romantic comedy with several solid 
laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts plays Anna Scott, the aforementioned most famous film  
star in the world. Really, Roberts plays herself. In the opening 
sequence we see her floating through a sea of flashbulbs, walking 
along a red carpet to a premiere dressed in a designer gown, 
flashing that trademark smile. 
</P>
<P>
	While in London promoting her latest sci-fi blockbuster (you  
have to suspend much disbelief), she wanders through the city's 
bustling, eclectic Notting Hill section and into a travel 
bookstore. (Why she's there is never really clear. Maybe she 
recognizes from outside the store how slow business is and thinks 
it'll be a sanctuary from the paparazzi.) For no apparent reason, 
she buys a book about Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	William Thacker (Grant), who owns the bookstore, is ``the man on  
the street.'' He's an ordinary, good-looking guy with a dry sense 
of humor whose wife recently divorced him. That's about all we 
learn of him, but we need not know more. William is the same 
bumbling but sweet Englishman Grant plays in pretty much 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Anna's enormous fame, William doesn't fawn over her.  
They have a witty exchange, she buys the Turkey book and leaves. 
Later that day, they bump into one another -- literally -- on a 
street corner and he spills orange juice all over her white 
T-shirt. This gives them an excuse to go back to his apartment, 
where nothing happens, but she changes clothes and they get to have 
alleged sexual tension. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of nowhere she kisses him, which comes as a complete shock  
because up to this point there have been no sparks whatsoever. Even 
their kiss is spark-free, but we are expected to believe there's 
some kind of magical attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	From here, the two spend a few days meeting his friends,  
avoiding photographers and supposedly falling in love. 
</P>
<P>
	The funniest parts come when their vastly different worlds  
collide, and the talented supporting cast brings those scenes to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	William takes Anna to an intimate dinner party for his goofy  
sister, Honey (Emma Chambers), who proclaims that Anna is her new 
best friend. 
</P>
<P>
	When Anna invites William to her suite at The Ritz, he is  
mistaken for a reporter for Horse and Hound magazine and fumbles 
his way through a press junket. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest scene-stealer of all is William's obnoxious yet  
lovable Welsh roommate, Spike, played by Rhys Ifans. Spike is 
skinny, smelly and unshaven. He chain-smokes and eats Cocoa Puffs 
while dressed in a wet suit because all his clothes are dirty. Anna 
panics when the paparazzi find her one morning at William's 
apartment, but Spike works the cameras in his underwear, flexing 
like a bodybuilder. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward the end, the film grows tedious, and Anna appears less  
desirable as she whines about the price of fame. Just as it's 
unclear why they got together, it's hard to understand why William 
stays loyal to Anna through her moody snits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notting Hill'' comes from the people who made ``Four Weddings  
and a Funeral,'' so there's a lot of well-written British humor 
and, of course, a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
	And even though their love scenes lack truth or fire, Grant and  
Roberts individually are a joy to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notting Hill,'' a Universal Pictures release, is rated PG-13  
and runs 125 minutes. It was produced by Duncan Kenworthy and 
written by Richard Curtis, who collaborated on ``Four Weddings and 
a Funeral,'' and directed by Roger Michell.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Staffer Accused in Prison Escape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JESSUP, Md. (AP) -- A former prison psychologist was arrested  
Tuesday on charges she helped two inmates in their prison getaway 
by driving them to a hotel and paying for their room. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth L. Feil, 43, was held on charges of being an accessory  
after the fact, harboring a prison escapee and obstructing and 
hindering. She posted a $5,225 bond and left without commenting to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	She allegedly helped convicted murderer Gregory Lawrence and  
armed robber Byron Smoot, with whom her husband said she had an 
affair, escape from the Maryland Correctional Institute on May 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feil denied the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that they're false and we plan on mounting a vigorous  
defense,'' her lawyer, Isaiah Dixon III, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Ms. Feil and Smoot planned the escape  
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison logs showed she had made numerous visits to see Smoot,  
and Ms. Feil's husband released letters that Smoot wrote to Ms. 
Feil in February, which alluded to escape plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be until spring, this is the real thing honey, there  
won't be any more delays,'' Smoot allegedly wrote. ``All I know is 
that if the nest is ready by then, the eagle will land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the escape, police said the two men dialed Ms. Feil's  
pager. She picked them up in her car, drove them to a hotel and 
paid for the room, then tried to bandage the cuts the men had 
suffered scaling a razor-wire fence. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the escape, they were recaptured two days later in  
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence, 39, was serving a life sentence for murder after  
shooting a man and stealing his shoes in 1978. Smoot, 38, was 
imprisoned for a rash of armed robberies and was sentenced to 29 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	State police also said that Ms. Feil was under investigation for  
allegedly cooking up mail-order schemes with Smoot. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feil was fired from the Patuxent Institution, a  
maximum-security prison, for setting up a post office box in May 
1998 to exchange intimate correspondence with prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticizes Clinton Over China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- In his sharpest criticism of President  
Clinton, Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Tuesday that the White 
House failed to take reports of Chinese espionage seriously and was 
slow to react. ``I'd do something about it immediately,'' he 
pledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential  
nomination, acknowledged that the problem has been going on for 
years, including the 12 years when his father was vice president 
and president. But he said he doesn't believe that gives Clinton an 
excuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that China has been stealing secrets during  
Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton. But there is only one 
administration that has been given the news; only one 
administration knew -- and that's the Clinton administration. The 
interesting question is when did they know?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A congressional panel chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,  
reported Tuesday that China had stolen classified information about 
every currently deployed nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal and 
said it is ``exceptionally likely'' that Chinese spying continues 
to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential campaigns were quick to respond.  
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, who has made China policy a cornerstone of his  
campaign, accused the administration of failing in ``its most basic 
duty to protect our nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time for new American leadership; it is time for a new  
foreign policy, and it is time for new congressional hearings to 
investigate who is directly responsible -- politically and 
commercially -- for endangering America's national security,'' he 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes said the administration had demonstrated  
``incompetence, ineptitude and insincerity on a scale never before 
witnessed in the history of U.S. defense,'' making a point to 
target not just Clinton but also Vice President Al Gore, who is 
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole also directed her criticism at the ``Clinton-Gore  
administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Previous administrations must share in the blame,'' she said,  
``but this administration knew more and still chose note to take 
action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long critical of Clinton's China policy, Sen. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., said, ``I find it troubling that too little action was 
taken too late by this administration, resulting in the fact that 
the Chinese may have been able to build nuclear weapons comparable 
to ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said, ``Questions will be asked why, in the face of  
overwhelming evidence that these operations were taking place, 
didn't the Justice Department and this administration do more to 
stop it. The public deserves a swift and honest response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamar Alexander has called for an independent, blue-ribbon  
commission to ``get to the bottom of the current China mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire is urging creation of a  
Senate Select Committee to investigate Chinese espionage. ``We will 
get to the bottom of this,'' he said. ``Nobody in this Senate worth 
his or her salt should have any objection to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush picked up the endorsement of Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,  
on Tuesday. The governor has stayed in Texas this spring, saying he 
is focused more on the final days of the state legislature than on 
presidential politics. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the revelations about Chinese spying were so severe,  
he felt the need to speak up. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Cox report was so serious in my judgment, and in that I'm  
going to be exploring (a presidential race), I thought it was 
important to make a clear statement of my views,'' the governor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for a congressional investigation into ``what went  
wrong and why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Presented with detailed information about China's espionage,  
the administration apparently did not take it seriously, did not 
react promptly and is still trying to minimize the scope and extent 
of the damage done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the balance of power is going to shift as a result of  
this,'' Bush said. ``I think it's going to accelerate China's 
emergence as a nuclear power. And the next president and presidents 
after that are going to have to deal with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that there are reports that the national security  
adviser knew bout the allegations as early as 1996. ``Should I run 
and should be the president, I can assure you that if my national 
security adviser knew that secrets were being stolen, I'd want to 
know about it and I'd do something about it immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who is scheduled to travel to Iowa, New Hampshire and  
other key presidential primary states next month, said Clinton's 
policy toward the world's most populous country has been off base. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Bush said he still believes China and the United  
States should be trading partners and that China should be admitted 
to the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes called for a halt to any U.S. efforts on behalf of China  
with the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	On another trade issue, Bauer asked Republicans in Congress to  
vote against most favored nation status for China.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules in Mass. Feminist Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A Boston College professor who barred  
male students from her classes on feminism remains out of a job 
following a judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in a Middlesex Superior Court hearing Monday was  
whether Mary Daly's classes should be listed in next semester's 
course roster. College officials had refused to include them -- 
citing a school policy of keeping all courses open to both men and 
women -- and the judge said the school was within its rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``A professor's defiance of that policy -- in this case, a  
vehement and very public defiance -- would give the school ample 
grounds for her termination,'' Judge Martha Sosman wrote in her 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, 70, known for works including ``Gyn/Ecology: The  
Metaethics of Radical Feminism'' and ``Outercourse,'' claims the 
Jesuit-run school pushed her out when threatened with a lawsuit by 
a male student. The school says she retired when she was ordered to 
teach men. 
</P>
<P>
	When she first arrived at Boston College in 1966, Daly taught  
only men. The school of arts and sciences didn't admit women until 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, Daly said, she found that men and women in feminist  
courses didn't mix. So she barred men from her seminars, although 
she said she has taught some two dozen men in one-on-one seminars. 
</P>
<P>
	When men are in a class with women, she said Monday before her  
court hearing began, ``the dynamic is totally interrupted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The litigation originated last fall, when senior Duane Naquin  
accused the school of discrimination after being kept out of Daly's 
course on introductory feminist ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials demanded that Daly admit Naquin to her spring  
course. Daly said she refused and took a leave of absence instead. 
The college insists that Daly agreed to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials say they can't allow her to continue teaching  
under ``separate but equal'' courses, which they argue violate 
federal anti-discrimination laws. They said they were pleased with 
Monday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to be the logical course of action to take, given  
that (Daly's) stated preference not to teach men is so clearly in 
violation of federal law,'' said Jack Dunn, a college spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said she believes she is not violating the law known as  
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The law was designed 
to improve the situation of women -- which, she said, is what she's 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretchen Van Ness, Daly's attorney, said the college has used  
``backdoor tactics'' to fire a tenured professor because she 
disagreed with them. She also warned that the case could have 
sweeping ramifications for academic freedom.

<HEADLINE> Army Scratches Antimissile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) -- The Army scratched  
today's test flight of an antimissile missile because of a problem 
with the one that was to serve as its target. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known what the problem was, said Jim  
Eckles, a White Sands Missile Range spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hera target missile -- a modified Minuteman 2 -- was fired  
from a site north of the range at 5:14 a.m. today. The Army had 
planned to launch a Theater High-Altitude Area Defense missile to 
knock the target missile out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	The THAAD missile had failed in six previous flights to hit  
flying targets. The system has cost at least $3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon charged Lockheed Martin Corp., the maker of the  
antimissile system, a $15 million penalty for not achieving a hit 
during a March 29 test as required by its $15 billion contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more it fails, the more money it seems Congress and the  
president are willing to throw at it,'' said Brian Hughes, director 
of Taxpayers for Common Sense's national security reform project. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a reliable weapon given the number of failures  
they've had so far; it's not going to be a reliable weapon anytime 
soon,'' said John Pike, director of space policy for the Federation 
of American Scientists in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tests are needed to learn about the system, and failure  
to intercept should not be equated with complete failure, said Tom 
Johnson, director of external affairs for the Ballistic Missile 
Defense Organization at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we allow (an enemy) to launch an attack against our troops  
overseas and not defend them, consider those costs,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another test will be conducted as early as within the next two  
weeks, Johnson said. A backup target exists but needs to be made 
ready, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the missile has repeatedly failed to hit its target,  
Congress revised its contract with Lockheed Martin last June, 
making the company financially liable for any misses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed will have to achieve two successful hit-to-kill missile  
tests by June 30 or be penalized an additional $20 million, 
according to the contract. In all, the company could face $75 
million in penalties by the end of 1999 if there are more failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Hunt, spokesman for the Army's air and missile defense  
program in Huntsville, Ala., said he did not immediately know 
whether Lockheed Martin would be granted an extension if it was 
determined that the Hera problem was not the company's fault. 
</P>
<P>
	The THAAD is designed to strike enemy missiles fired from at  
least 800 miles away -- the kinds of weapons nations such as Iran, 
North Korea and Pakistan are developing, raising the threat to U.S. 
troops and allies overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The antimissile missile has technology that is the most  
sophisticated military weaponry, and it would contribute to 
development of a system that could protect the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the test in March, there were four THAAD missile  
flight tests in 1995, two in 1996 and one each in 1997 and 1998. 
The first three of the nine tests were not designed to hit flying 
targets. They tested such things as the missile's navigation and 
control in flight and were considered successful, Hunt said.

<HEADLINE> American Buys Sudan Slaves' Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Charles Jacobs was working as a management  
consultant in 1993 when he read an article that changed the focus 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he helps to buy slaves.  
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs heads a group that purchases freedom for slaves sold in  
northern Africa for about $50 a person. The practice has been 
criticized by UNICEF and other groups as encouraging slavery by 
creating a market. But Jacobs scoffs at such suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many people have a chance to do something that's  
important?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights organizations say millions of slaves are sold  
around the world -- as prostitutes in Thailand, charcoal workers in 
Brazil, brick kiln operators in Pakistan and bonded farmers in 
India. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jacobs read about the practice, he was inspired to  
proselytize against slavery. He co-founded the American 
Anti-Slavery Group in Somerville, Mass., which raises awareness 
about the issue and funds for Christian Solidarity International, a 
relief organization in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Solidarity actually does the dangerous hands-on work  
of buying slaves from middlemen. The group says it has freed at 
least 800 since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the American Anti-Slavery Group has raised $35,000 to  
buy slaves in war-torn Sudan. Human rights activists say civil war 
has led Arab Muslim northerners there to capture and enslave black 
villagers who practice Christianity and traditional tribal 
religions. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Solidarity conducts clandestine bush flights to  
southern Sudan to redeem the slaves. Once they are free, the former 
slaves are usually given a medical check, then returned back home. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of Abuk Deng Akuei is typical of those recounted by  
American Anti-Slavery: A Christian girl in her early teens, Akuei 
was captured by an Arab militia that raided her Sudanese village in 
1997. She was sold to a man who beat her, raped her, forcibly 
circumcised her and made her work in the fields and sleep with his 
cows and goats. 
</P>
<P>
	She was returned by Christian Solidarity.  
</P>
<P>
	Although the goals of Christian Solidarity and American  
Anti-Slavery Group may be noble, their work has its critics. 
</P>
<P>
	UNICEF said the newly-freed slaves usually aren't monitored  
after their release, so there is no guarantee they won't be 
enslaved again. And the organization said paying for slaves doesn't 
address the underlying cause of slavery in the Sudan -- the ongoing 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said UNICEF's attacks on redeeming slaves for money are  
helping draw attention to his cause. 
</P>
<P>
	The consultant-turned-abolitionist, who is scheduled to testify  
Thursday before Congress on slavery in Northern Africa, said the 
movement is gathering the support of elected officials and black 
churches in America. American Anti-Slavery has chapters in New 
York, Washington, D.C., Miami, Kansas City, San Francisco, Los 
Angeles, Pomona, Calif., and Seattle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoolchildren are also raising money to buy slaves their  
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Barbara Vogel's fourth-grade class at the Highline  
Elementary School in Aurora, Colo., began a fund-raising campaign 
that has raised more than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 100 schools around the country have since joined the  
effort: a junior high in Deep River, Conn., held a dance; an 
eighth-grade class in Boothbay Harbor, Maine, auctioned off art; 
sixth-grade students in Miami, including many Haitian immigrants, 
sold candy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is both sweet and sad,'' said Jacobs. ``You have these  
white kids and black kids and they know slavery is bad -- after all, 
we're the nation that tore itself apart over it.''

<HEADLINE> Toy R Us Settles Antitrust Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Toys R Us Inc., Mattel and other toy makers  
are giving away free toys this Christmas to settle a lawsuit 
accusing the companies of illegally conspiring to keep popular toys 
like Barbie and Mr. Potato Head out of discount toy stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us said Tuesday it will pay $40.5 million in cash and  
toys for persuading toy makers Mattel Inc., Little Tikes Co. and 
Hasbro, among others, to not sell certain toys that the retailer 
wanted to discount store chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel and Little Tikes will pay $9.5 million to settle a  
federal lawsuit joined by attorneys general in 44 states, the 
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. All 50 states will share in 
the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro, agreed to pay $5.9 million to settle the same lawsuit  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	New York filed the lawsuit in 1997, following a 1996 antitrust  
complaint by the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC charged that 
Toys R Us illegally used its clout to get the toy makers to stop 
selling to discount chains, cutting out its competition and 
artificially inflating toy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The discount chains include the Price Club and Wal-Mart Stores  
Inc. subsidiary Sam's Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us has been struggling for years to compete with discount  
and warehouse chains like Wal-Mart, which dethroned it earlier this 
year as the nation's No. 1 toy retailer. The Paramus, N.J.-based 
retailer cut 3,000 jobs last year and began to reorganize its 
stores to turn around a string of bad earnings results. 
</P>
<P>
	The states' lawsuit accused Mattel and the other toy makers of  
restricting the supply of toys like Barbie Dream House, Firehouse 
Blocks and Fisher Price nursery monitors to the stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although toy makers and sellers like to view themselves as  
Santa's helpers, in this case these companies were nothing more 
than modern-day Scrooges,'' New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer 
said Tuesday at a news conference in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us has admitted the practice, said it did nothing wrong  
and is still appealing the FTC complaint. But it said it decided to 
settle the lawsuits with states to avoid a lengthy, costly legal 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that this settlement is in the best interests of  
the company and our customers, and we are happy to have this matter 
settled with children as the beneficiary,'' spokeswoman Rebecca 
Caruso said. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy companies admitted no wrongdoing under the settlement.  
El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel, the world's largest toy maker, 
agreed to pay $8.2 million in cash and toys, while Hudson, 
Ohio-based Little Tikes Co. agreed to pay $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us agreed to donate $9 million in toys a year for the  
next three years in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and 
Puerto Rico through the U.S. Marine Corps' ``Toys for Tots'' 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The first toys could arrive this Christmas, pending the  
settlement's approval by a New York federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us also agreed to pay $13.5 million in cash to the  
states, which will divide the toys and cash among the states by 
population, Spitzer said. The settlement covers all the states 
although six did not join in. 
</P>
<P>
	The states will use the money to buy books and educational  
materials for children, Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC charged Toys R Us in May 1996 with reducing competition  
by illegally persuading major toy makers to stop selling certain 
toys to low-priced warehouse club stores. Toys R Us threatened 
manufacturers that it would not buy from them if they sold to the 
other stores, the FTC said. 
</P>
<P>
	An administrative judge ruled in the FTC's favor in 1997, and  
Toys R Us appealed. It argued against the FTC before the 7th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals last week.

<HEADLINE> Truck Safety Measures Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said Tuesday it  
would aim to cut truck-related deaths in half, but critics said the 
proposals were unlikely to produce quick results. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said his department would  
ask for $56 million more from Congress this year to increase the 
number of inspectors for commercial vehicles -- which includes 
trucks and motorcoaches -- and to boost state and federal safety 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the federal Office of Motor Carriers, which  
regulates commercial vehicles, would increase the fines for 
violations, move more swiftly to shut down unfit motor carriers, 
limit negotiated settlements in enforcement cases and aggressively 
pursue criminal or civil penalties when someone is killed in a 
commercial vehicle crash. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the secretary said he would push to reduce driving  
time for operators and seek to monitor compliance with rules 
through the expanded use of technology similar to airline 
flight-data recorders. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, Slater said he hoped to reduce the number of  
truck-related deaths from about 5,000 annually to about 2,500 
annually. In 1997, 5,355 people were killed; preliminary figures 
show the number fell to about 5,200 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, six people are killed each year in bus accidents,  
although the figure has spiked in the past six months after a 
Christmas Eve crash that killed eight in New Jersey and a charter 
bus accident earlier this month in New Orleans that killed 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we face up to a time for action, and the plan that I  
have outlined deals with action,'' Slater declared at a news 
conference. He was flanked by Federal Highway Administrator Kenneth 
Wykle, who oversees the Office of Motor Carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals triggered swift and critical reaction from safety  
advocates and truckers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the things the secretary talked about are longterm.  
Most are proposals and actions they should have been taking,'' said 
Jacqueline Gillan, vice president of Advocates for Highway and Auto 
Safety, a group with insurance industry support. ``The safety 
community wants action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Claybrook, president of the advocacy group Public Citizen,  
said: ``While we welcome DOT's statement on improved enforcement, 
they're still talking about useless safety education programs and 
`collaborative' government-industry research, for which they have 
been harshly criticized by the inspector general of the DOT.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, truckers said they wished Slater had already reformed  
hour-of-service rules which regulate the amount of time truckers 
are on the road and created a separate agency to oversee motor 
carrier safety, much like the Federal Aviation Administration does 
with airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only in this format, with a Senate-confirmed presidential  
appointee reporting to the secretary of transportation, will truck 
safety get its proper respect,'' said Walter McCormick Jr., 
president of the American Trucking Associations. 
</P>
<P>
	In his announcement, Slater ducked one demand of safety  
advocates: moving the Office of Motor Carriers out of the Federal 
Highway Administration and into the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are under the Transportation Department, but the highway  
administration largely oversees the interstate system, while the 
safety administration deals with issues such as drunken driving, 
air bags and seat belt use. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater didn't rule out the change, but he said he would prefer  
to be accountable for results and ``not just rearranging boxes on 
an organizational chart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gillan, of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said there was  
merit to such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	``NHTSA is a regulatory agency with a safety culture,'' she  
said. ``OMC is like a really sick patient that is on life support. 
This proposal was the equivalent of `Take two aspirin and call me 
in the morning.' The real solution is to treat the problem.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Versace Family Halts Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The family of Gianni Versace has effectively  
stopped the publication of an unauthorized biography of the slain 
fashion designer, The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Undressed: The Life and Times of Gianni Versace,'' by  
Christopher Mason, was in galley form and set for publication July 
1 before its cancellation by Little, Brown, a division of Time 
Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported that the book would have depicted Versace as  
a colossal talent who was promiscuous, bullied employees and 
berated journalists who wrote unkind reviews of his collections. 
</P>
<P>
	The book also would have been unflattering to Versace's  
surviving siblings, Santo and Donatella, who assumed control of his 
$560 million fashion empire after his 1997 murder, The Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason says representatives for the Versaces, in their bid to  
stop the book, contacted people he had interviewed and tried to 
persuade them to recant their statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Little, Brown said it had received letters threatening legal  
action from the Versaces, had agreed with Mason that the book 
couldn't be published in its current form and was concerned that 
the biography, which was postponed last July, would be unable to 
sustain interest after another delay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Versaces, through their press agents, said they were  
satisfied with the decision to kill the book and denied there were 
any attempts to intimidate sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The family said their objections to the biography were based on  
Mason's shoddy reporting, not on unflattering depictions of the 
Versaces. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Undressed'' manuscript underwent legal reviews last winter  
and this spring. It largely passed the scrutiny of the publisher's 
lawyers, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt completely confident about my reporting, and I had  
substantial documentation,'' Mason said. ``The book isn't coming 
out. They won.''

<HEADLINE> Whitbread Buys Allied Domecq Pubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Whitbread PLC has agreed to buy the British pub  
operations of Allied Domecq PLC for about $3.7 billion in stock and 
will shed its own brewing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced Tuesday, Whitbread will acquire 3,500  
pubs and restaurants, Allied's 50 percent stake in the First Quench 
retail shops, in which Whitbread already had a 50 percent share, 
and Allied's 25 percent stake in Britannia soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied will receive 230 million new shares in Whitbread.  
</P>
<P>
	To comply with British competition law, Whitbread will dispose  
of its brewing operations, which command 15.7 percent of the 
British market. Whitbread said it had not decided how it will 
divest those operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitbread said it expects the acquisition to lead to annual cost  
savings of around $160 million by the third year after the deal is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitbread, founded as a brewery in 1742, has expanded  
aggressively in the retail field, owning 3,400 pubs, the Cafe Rouge 
restaurant chain and Marriott hotels and Travel Inns in Britain.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Commits to Move to NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton made three speeches  
during an evening in Manhattan without saying whether she will run 
for U.S. Senate -- but she has committed herself to living in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady said she will definitely make her home in New  
York after leaving the White House, whether or not she runs for the 
Senate here. She made the disclosure during a ``60 Minutes II'' 
interview after being asked which New York baseball team she would 
root for. 
</P>
<P>
	``The politic answer, since I do plan to live in New York no  
matter what I end up doing, is I'll root for both,'' she said in 
the interview, which was taped May 20 and will air Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spokesman Kevin Tedesco said there was no significance to  
her use of the word ``I'' rather than ``we'' since she used ``we,'' 
clearly including the president in her plans, in other parts of the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Berry, the first lady's spokeswoman, said Mrs. Clinton  
``and the president have discussed that they would like to live in 
New York, long before she was approached about this race.'' Berry 
said those discussions had been going on ``for over a year now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has not yet announced whether she will seek the  
Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. She 
appeared in New York City on Monday at a fund-raiser for Rep. Nita 
Lowey, D-N.Y., who will run for the Senate if the first lady does 
not. Mrs. Clinton made no reference to her impending decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lowey highlighted her solidarity with Mrs. Clinton,  
betraying no bitterness that her own political future might be hurt 
as she awaits the first lady's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let the governor and the mayor have their petty feuds,'' Mrs.  
Lowey said. ``While the Republicans in this state turn their backs 
on one another, I am proud to march forward shoulder-to-shoulder 
with my friend Hillary Rodham Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lowey's comments about the Republicans refer to New York  
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has formed an exploratory campaign 
committee for the Senate seat, and Gov. George Pataki. On Monday, 
Pataki said he had no intention of running for the Senate.

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 123.58  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended sharply lower today, wiping out  
early gains, after continued concerns about interest rates and 
Internet stocks outweighed a sign of continued optimism about the 
U.S. economy. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 123.58, or 
by 1.2 percent, at 10,531.09. The index of blue-chip stocks had 
surrendered a gain of nearly 100 points earlier in the session. 
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index fell 72.74 to 2,380.92. Stocks rose this 
morning after the Conference Board reported that consumer 
confidence, a key indicator of future economic activity, rose in 
May for a record-setting seventh consecutive month. But by 
midafternoon, much of the market's enthusiasm had evaporated.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence rose in May for a

economy will remain robust, the Conference Board said today. Low 
inflation and a strong job market are being given much of the 
credit. In a separate report released today, the National

percent above their offering price, they failed to triple or 
quadruple in value as many Internet peers have done in their first

said that Microsoft can develop and distribute ``independently 
developed'' tools that do not comply with a contract with Sun, so 
long as such products do not infringe any Sun copyright, patent or 
other intellectual property right. The three-part ruling will be 
finalized -- and possibly changed -- after oral arguments scheduled 
in June. Sun stock was down 3 7/8 at 35 1/16 today; Microsoft was down

whites in computer ownership, cyberaccess and Internet know-how. 
But the impact of ``the digital divide'' is a matter of dispute 
between some Internet experts and civil rights advocates. Keith 
Fulton of the National Urban League sees the gap as a sign that 
minorities might find themselves relegated to second-class 
citizenship in cyberspace due to a lack of computer aptitude. But 
E. David Ellington, a founder and president of one of the 
Internet's most popular black-directed sites, believes it's too 
early to fret over the paucity of blacks and Hispanics on the 
Internet.

previous year, according to a new report on charitable giving. The 
strong economy, low inflation, a growth in personal wealth and more 
sophisticated fund raising helped fuel the 10.7 percent increase 
and raise overall charitable giving to $174.52 billion, said Ann E. 
Kaplan, research director for the American Association of 
Fund-Raising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy. When adjusted for 
inflation, the increase was 9 percent, she said today.

<HEADLINE> NH House Votes To Add King Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The New Hampshire House voted Tuesday to  
create a permanent Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, all but ensuring 
the state will finally join the rest of the nation in honoring the 
slain civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past 20 years, repeated attempts to create such a  
holiday have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 212-148 to add King's name to the state's Civil  
Rights Day holiday, held the day every other state honors King. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill now goes to the Senate, where passage is all but  
assured. The Senate passed an identical bill earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also was expected to vote Tuesday on the Senate bill,  
which would go directly to Gov. Jeanne Shaheen if passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen, who like her predecessor added King's name to the  
holiday by proclamation each year, said she will sign either bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Rep. Jane Kelley urged lawmakers to support the bill  
so ``the ugly stain of racism and bigotry can be cleansed from the 
beautiful face of our state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argued that singling out King would detract from other  
American heroes such as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Rep. Donald White said he opposed the bill ``for the  
simple reason that the history of this great nation reflects the 
pride and energy of all our people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers created Civil Rights Day as a compromise in 1991 to  
honor ``the many people from a variety of cultural backgrounds who 
fought and died in the struggle to gain freedom and equality for 
all individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A King holiday bill first came before the Legislature in 1979  
and has been introduced nearly every two-year session since.

<HEADLINE> Wrestler's Costume Blamed for Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Professional wrestler Owen Hart's fatal  
fall while being lowered into the ring may have been caused by his 
elaborate, feathered costume catching on his release cord, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is believed at this point in time that the quick release  
was activated. Either it was snagged on his clothes or he pulled it 
too soon,'' police spokesman Floyd Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old wrestling bad boy known as the Blue Blazer fell  
70 feet to his death Sunday night while making his entrance for a 
match at Kemper Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart planned to descend 90 feet into the ring from the rafters  
in a stunt he had done before and had practiced at the arena hours 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Strapped into a harness, Hart was suspended from a rope as three  
rigging handlers above him waited for the cue to begin lowering 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	His harness was attached to the rope with a metal ring. He had a  
release mechanism similar to a parachute release. Hart was supposed 
to pull on it when he was just above the mat and drop into the 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the feathers of his costume may have become  
caught in the pull-string, or he may have yanked the string 
accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, that quick-release was activated early, and Hart fell,  
hitting his head on the turnbuckle, the padded metal coupling that 
holds the ring's ropes together. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart had done the stunt before, and his widow, Martha Hart, told  
NBC's ``Today'' show on Tuesday that she was never comfortable with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This particular one we did discuss,'' Mrs. Hart said. ``I had  
told him that I didn't think he should do it.''

<HEADLINE> Fires Burn at Both Ends of Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- One person was killed and 20 others  
injured when five tractor-trailers crashed into an overturned truck 
Tuesday on a smoke-shrouded highway where firefighters battled 
fast-spreading wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20,000 acres of flaming sawgrass, brush and muck in the  
Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area sent heavy smoke into South 
Florida skies for the fifth day. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the smoke likely contributed to the fatal crash  
on U.S. 27. Most lanes in a 30-mile stretch of the roadway were 
closed after visibility shrunk to zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Before then, a truck headed northbound hit the median and  
overturned when its driver became blinded by smoke. Five 
tractor-trailers crashed into the overturned truck, and two of them 
erupted in flames, said Lt. Pembrook Burrows of the Florida Highway 
Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few minutes later, a van with 13 farm workers plowed into  
the back of that,'' Burrows said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not know the extent of the 20 injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	In North Florida's Baker County, west of Jacksonville, fire  
crews battled a remote blaze that swelled to 11,000 acres in the 
Osceola National Forest. The fire grew nearly 20 times its size in 
two days since Sunday, jumping across Florida Highway 2 and into 
the 400,000-acre Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge that crosses 
into Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	No homes or businesses have been threatened by either fire, both  
of which were started by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Dry conditions have made the North Florida fire especially  
difficult, to fight said Steve Parsons, a U.S. Forestry Service 
spokesman. Also, the area is full of ``insects and snakes and 
things that make life kind of miserable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton were scheduled to  
arrive late Tuesday for vacation in Yulee, about 40 miles east of 
the North Florida fire. Residents said the area was clear of smoke 
at midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	In southwestern Palm Beach County, firefighters worked to ignite  
back fires to contain that blaze, which more than doubled in size 
overnight and has left up to 10,000 more acres of muck smoldering, 
said Sue Congelosi, a state Division of Forestry spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Heat Worry / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures moved higher Tuesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade as investors eyed the potential for heat 
damage to newly planted crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters were calling for a high-pressure ridge to begin  
forming in Midwest growing regions next week, which could choke off 
rainfall and provide heat stress to young crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also found support on ideas farmers in western growing  
regions remain far behind the normal planting pace and may not be 
able to catch up. That could reduce what is expected to be record 
acreage. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat's gains were limited as farmers found above-average yields  
in early harvesting of winter wheat crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.48 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn rose 3 cents to $2.14 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1 3/4 cents to 
$1.19 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans rose 4 3/4 cents to $4.59 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Lean hogs futures fell sharply a second day on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange amid expectations meatpacker supplies will be 
ample going into the busy summer period, reducing the need to 
slaughter fresh supplies. Pork bellies were mostly higher, while 
beef futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .65 cent to 62.70 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .75 cent to 74.57 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell 1.30 cents to 53.60 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 1.17 
cents to 53.37 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Arthur Frommer Gets Tired of Crowds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Arthur Frommer doesn't enjoy going to  
Europe during the summer anymore -- when the mobs of tourists and 
long lines into museums take away the charm that so enamored him on 
his first visit. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a funny observation from the travel writer who perhaps more  
than anyone opened up the Louvre and the Sistine Chapel to budget 
travelers four decades ago with his book, ``Europe on $5 a Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are literally places that have become gridlock with  
tourist traffic during high season periods. A lot of people would 
blame me for participating in doing that,'' said Frommer, who was 
recently in Orlando to check out Universal Studios' newest theme 
park, Islands of Adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake though, Paris is still Frommer's favorite  
destination, albeit when the crowds have thinned out. 
</P>
<P>
	Into his 43nd year in the travel advice business, Frommer, 69,  
has expanded well beyond his well-known travel guides. He is on the 
Internet, in newspapers and on magazine stands. 
</P>
<P>
	His quarterly magazine, Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel, just  
celebrated its first anniversary and will be published six times a 
year starting in September. With a circulation of 350,000, the 
magazine features stories such as ``The Spring's 40 Best Bargain 
Vacations'' and ``The Cheapest Places on Earth.'' Plans are in the 
works to launch the magazine in Europe and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	His Web site (www.frommers.com), which offers daily travel tips  
and deals, gets 1 million hits a week. His weekly syndicated column 
is published in almost 100 newspapers. He is planning to publish a 
1,200-page encyclopedia of travel next year. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there are the Frommer travel guides, which now stand at  
200 titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Frommer published his first guidebook, ``Europe on $5 a Day'' in  
1956, after writing a version for his fellow servicemen during a 
two-year stint with the U.S. Army Intelligence in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the service, the Yale law graduate practiced for  
six years in New York before moving full time into the travel 
business. Frommer sold his guidebooks to Simon &AMP; Schuster in 1979, 
but maintains an active editorial presence as a consultant to the 
publishing house. 
</P>
<P>
	Frommer is amazed at the growth of travel and travel publishing  
since he first began. ``Europe on $5 a Day'' is now ``Europe on $50 
a Day.'' (Adjusted for inflation, $5 in 1956 would be worth $30 
today) 
</P>
<P>
	``When I brought out my first guidebook, the amount of space  
that was devoted to travel guides was like 2 feet of single 
shelf,'' he said. ``Today, you go into a Barnes &AMP; Noble, there are 
as many travel guides as there are books in the average independent 
bookstore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been a democratization of travel since he began  
writing, Frommer said, with the wide-body jet making it easier and 
cheaper for the average American to travel abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a contraction of the world into one destination,''  
Frommer said. ``When you go to a party nowadays and people are 
discussing where they want to take a vacation, they say, 'Well I'm 
not sure whether we should go to Australia or we should go to New 
Orleans.''' 
</P>
<P>
	With bushy gray eyebrows and an impish grin, Frommer is courtly  
and genial in person. He talks about travel with the enthusiasm of 
a child in a rich baritone voice. 
</P>
<P>
	He isn't afraid to pick a fight, and there are places that would  
probably yank the welcome mat from under him. One such place is 
Branson, the southwest Missouri country music Mecca. ``Arthur 
Frommer's Branson,'' which was published in 1995, was highly 
critical of the tourist destination that is a cross between Las 
Vegas and Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went down there and I nearly collapsed when I heard the  
right-wing politics, the religion sold for profit,'' said Frommer, 
who grew up in nearby Jefferson City, Mo., before moving to New 
York with his family when he was 14. ``It is like Stalinist Russia, 
that whole city. It is so retrograde and intolerant and racist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Fiveash, president and chief executive of Branson's  
chamber of commerce, said he would love Frommer to visit Branson 
again and maybe change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those things simply aren't true,'' Fiveash said. ``Travel  
writers have their own bias and he's probably no different in that 
respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frommer's interest in travel has become a family affair. His  
daughter, Pauline, a travel writer and actress, contributed a story 
on cheap eating in Paris for the current issue of Frommer's 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Her budget-consciousness apparently was well learned at her  
father's knee. ``We had resolved to spend no more than $25 per 
person per day on all meals,'' she writes in her story. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Frommer has encouraged travelers to embrace the  
unexpected and immerse themselves in new experiences instead of 
merely going someplace to sight-see. That might include taking 
yoga, going on a safari, or staying in a grass hut with the locals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go to places that challenge your most cherished beliefs,'' he  
said. ``The purpose of travel is to shake you up.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees Call Up Tony Tarasco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees called up outfielder Tony  
Tarasco from Triple-A Columbus on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarasco, 28, has played parts of six seasons in the majors,  
starting with Atlanta in 1993. A New York City native, he batted 
.365 with eight homers and 33 RBIs in 41 games at Columbus this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Tarasco on the roster, the Yankees designated  
catcher Mike Figga for assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Figga, 28, saw his first action of the season for New York in  
Saturday's doubleheader against the Chicago White Sox. He was a 
defensive replacement in both games, and did not bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Figga, who is out of minor league options, must clear waivers  
before the Yankees can reassign him. Any team claiming Figga must 
assign him to their major league roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarasco has a famous connection with Yankee Stadium. He was the  
Baltimore right fielder who claimed that a fan interfered with 
Derek Jeter's home run in Game 1 of the 1996 AL championship 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	In 383 major league games, Tarasco has a .241 average with 28  
homers and 100 RBIs. His best season came with Montreal in 1995, 
when he batted .249 with 14 homers and 40 RBIs.

<HEADLINE>  Stars' Desperate Play Evens Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Playing with desperation and a street-fighter  
mentality, the Dallas Stars delivered a message to the Colorado 
Avalanche: This will be a long, tough playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars squared the Western Conference final with Monday  
night's 4-2 victory in Dallas. The best-of-7 series shifts to 
Denver for Games 3 and 4 on Wednesday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a desperate team and they had to be,'' Avalanche  
forward Theo Fleury said, referring to the Stars losing Game 1 at 
home. ``They threw everything at us in the third period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, this is the semifinals,'' Dallas center  
Guy Carbonneau said Tuesday. ``You play each shift as if it were 
your last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nieuwendyk and Mike Modano scored in the Stars' dominating  
third period, when they outshot Colorado 15-1. For the game, Dallas 
outshot Colorado 45-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally found some seams and cracks through the defense to  
get to the net,'' Modano said. ``The second and third shots were 
finally there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said his team's more aggressive  
approach on Monday night was by design. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for us to play well, we have to press the pace,'' he  
said. ``It doesn't matter who we're playing. We've played two 
pretty good hockey games. Unfortunately, we lost the first one. I 
thought the difference was we played with desperation, knowing our 
status. We took some chances and we didn't get hurt by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're playing a team as good and as skilled as Colorado,  
you can take one of two attitudes -- either stand back and wait and 
hope that's going to work out, or press the issue. Obviously, by 
the way we played, we've made the decision to press the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a suffocating defensive game, Modano felt as if he  
had been turned loose Monday night. That observation drew a chuckle 
from Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might think he's been turned loose, but he's not,''  
Hitchcock said. ``This is just a different series. There just is no 
play in the neutral zone. It's in one end or the other. The games 
are very similar to the way we play against Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the series against St. Louis, there was a tremendous amount  
of counter-attacking and neutral zone play. In this series, there 
is none. So the feeling is that there's a lot of room because 
you're coming through that area between the two blue lines with a 
lot of speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain Colorado's somewhat lackluster play in Game 2,  
Hitchcock said, ``They got what they wanted. They got the split in 
our building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, we have to come in here and do that, too. And if our  
attitude is we're going to weather the storm, then that's the wrong 
attitude because we're going to be on our heels all night. We have 
to go and attack,'' he said. ``It's going to make for some 
high-risk hockey, and I think their team probably has the same 
attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas lost forward Benoit Hogue for the remainder of the  
playoffs after he tore knee ligaments in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche, meanwhile, were hopeful of getting back center  
Stephane Yelle, their best penalty-killer. Yelle has been sidelined 
since May 3 with a sprained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably going to be a game-time decision,'' Colorado  
coach Bob Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yelle, who skated for the fifth straight day on Tuesday, said  
his injury ``has been improving and I've been feeling more and more 
comfortable. I want to get back. It's been tough to sit and watch 
the guys play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides cutting down on the number of shots faced by goalie  
Patrick Roy, the Avalanche were eager to get more production from 
Fleury and Joe Sakic, normally two of their most prolific scorers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury's assist Monday night was his first point since Game 3 of  
the Detroit series. Sakic has just one goal and one assist in 
Colorado's last eight playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some great chances as a line,'' Fleury said. ``The  
puck is just not going in, for some reason. We're too good of 
players not to get on the scoreboard. We're doing all the right 
things. It's just a matter of time. But Milan is playing great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milan Hejduk, a rookie and Fleury's linemate, scored his sixth  
goal of the playoffs Monday night.

puck is just not going in, for some reason. We're too good of 
players not to get on the scoreboard. We're doing all the right 
things. It's just a matter of time. But Milan is playing great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milan Hejduk, a rookie and Fleury's linemate, scored his sixth  
goal of the playoffs Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Martin Wins Kentucky GOP Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- A publicist edged a former Democrat to win  
the Republican gubernatorial nomination in a primary election that 
may rank as Kentucky's worst ever for voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	Peppy Martin won the GOP's nomination over David Williams on  
Tuesday, and will face heavily favored incumbent Gov. Paul Patton 
in the general election. Patton was not challenged in the 
Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first Kentucky gubernatorial race in which an  
incumbent has been allowed to succeed himself in nearly 200 years. 
The state constitution was changed in 1992 to allow succession. 
</P>
<P>
	With 98 percent of precincts reporting in the GOP race, Martin  
had 19,198 votes, or 51 percent, while Williams, who ran for the 
Senate as a Democrat a year ago, had 18,201 votes, or 49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with incomplete returns, barely 8 percent of registered  
Democrats cast ballots along with only 5 percent of Republicans. 
Secretary of State John Brown III said final results could show the 
lowest turnout in state history. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Martin has worked in various capacities, but has most  
recently been a publicist working on her farm in Hart County. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who at one time ran a utility construction company,  
has been disabled with throat cancer and speaks with the aid of a 
mechanical device. His wife, Joanna, was his running mate. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton is heavily favored to win re-election, largely because  
Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans on Kentucky voter 
registration rolls.

<HEADLINE> Khrushchev Son Seeks US Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The son of Nikita Khrushchev is becoming a U.S.  
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Khrushchev, 63, and his wife, Valentina Golenko, are  
scheduled to take the citizenship exam June 23 at the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service regional headquarters in St. Albans, 
Vt., said his Seattle-based immigration lawyer, Dan Danilov. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about this decision and I had the freedom to make  
this decision,'' Khrushchev said Monday from his home in 
Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Khrushchev is a rocket engineer and computer scientist who once  
headed the Soviet Missile Design Bureau. He is a senior research 
scholar and lecturer at Brown University's Center for Foreign 
Policy Development. 
</P>
<P>
	He had come to Brown in the fall of 1991 for a two-year exchange  
program. The following year, he and his wife applied for permanent 
residency in the United States. He said at that time that it wasn't 
a defection from his homeland because ``our countries are not 
enemies any longer. We are on the same side now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has published several books about his late father, who ruled  
the Soviet Union from 1953 until he was deposed in 1964 and once 
angrily told Americans: ``We will bury you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son has often had to explain his father's famous remark.  
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, he was referring to a socialist centralized  
economic system, which he believed would prevail and be more 
effective than a free market system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Khrushchev died in 1971.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A woman who vanished with her two  
young children may have killed them and herself by driving into the 
murky Sacramento River, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said a car with a female driver and possibly two small  
children inside veered off a road and into the water near the town 
of Hood on Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	One witness said ``there was a little boy who seemed terrified  
in the right front seat,'' California Highway Patrol Officer Kelly 
Baraga said. Witnesses saw no brake lights, and there were no skid 
marks on the road, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Divers found the car in the river Tuesday, although  
investigators did not immediately say whether it belonged to the 
missing 31-year-old woman or whether there were bodies inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not release the names of the missing people.  
</P>
<P>
	Baraga said a man went to the scene Monday to tell investigators  
that the driver may have been his wife, who he said was distraught. 
Relatives of the man told police that his wife had been in a deep 
depression and threatened to kill herself and her children, a boy 
and a girl.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Is Assertive but Softspoken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unhappy with the votes that three Republicans  
cast in midnight negotiations with the Senate, House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert invited the lawmakers to his office to discuss the 
legislation financing the air campaign in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't yell and scream. It's not my style,'' Hastert, a  
former wrestling coach, said afterward. Even so, two of the three 
swiftly agreed to reverse course, and a provision that the speaker 
feared would derail the entire measure was sidetracked. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of several instances recently in which the  
57-year-old Illinois Republican has asserted himself -- more quietly 
than his predecessor Newt Gingrich might have. And it came as he 
struggled to hold his narrow majority together as well as overcome 
the Democratic-fed perception that GOP Whip Tom DeLay is the real 
power in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is the speaker. I do what I have to do as speaker. He  
is the whip,'' Hastert said of DeLay in an interview in his office, 
with its broad sweeping view down Washington's Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, that perception was enhanced late last month when Hastert  
cast a vote on the floor in support of the ongoing bombing 
campaign. He had told fellow Republicans he viewed the issue as a 
``vote of conscience.'' But DeLay opposed it, visibly lobbied some 
lawmakers to do likewise, and the provision failed on a tie vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Dennis Hastert,'' Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt said  
the following day. ``He is a nice man and he's a good man and I 
like talking to him and working with him. But unfortunately ... the 
reality, I'm afraid (is) that the extreme right wing of the 
Republican Party remains in control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the days since, Hastert has become noticeably more assertive.  
For example: 
</P>
<P>
	-- He intervened to increase the amount of money for the Pentagon  
well beyond what the administration asked for. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Even before he called Reps. Ralph Regula, Joe Skeen and Sonny  
Callahan, into his office, his frustration with add-ons to the 
spending bill led him to talk about quitting the post he's held for 
less than six months. Several GOP sources, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity, said Hastert said in private meetings it wasn't worth 
holding the job if he had to watch while Democratic-crafted 
amendments that were extraneous to the war effort were attached to 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He also caused a stir last week when he signaled support for  
gun control legislation after the high school shootings in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And he angered some GOP moderates when he told them he didn't  
intend to bow to their demand to bring campaign finance legislation 
to a vote before September. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's not soon enough for them they have a right to do  
something else,'' he said. Some moderates later said they took that 
as a virtual dare to join Democrats in trying to force the measure 
to the floor in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In another part of the job, Hastert has raised roughly $5  
million for candidates and GOP causes since becoming speaker, aides 
say. With the House campaign committee facing a substantial debt, 
he asked GOP chairman Jim Nicholson for help. Nicholson agreed to 
swap $800,000 in ``hard money'' to help the House committee pay off 
the debt, for a larger amount of soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	The job, Hastert points out, is not something he sought.  
</P>
<P>
	But Gingrich abdicated after Republicans lost seats in last  
fall's elections. Rep. Bob Livingston, in line to replace him, quit 
after admitting to marital infidelities. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, Gingrich, DeLay and others turned to Hastert, the  
genial deputy whip. But it was his wife who cast the deciding vote. 
</P>
<P>
	He called her in Illinois, where she has taught elementary  
school for 33 years. ``And I thought she'd say no. She didn't. She 
undercut me,'' Hastert said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert found himself at the helm of a slender majority in a  
House where Republicans had just impeached a Democratic president 
in an atmosphere of distrust and partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
	He set a quieter tone. ``One of the things you try to do is keep  
the trains running on time and not have any train wrecks,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	He brought Republicans together around a budget plan, and it  
passed on time. He also helped position Republicans as the party 
committed to setting aside the entire Social Security surplus until 
a plan can be passed to overhaul the system. 
</P>
<P>
	He's pledged that the House will pass a tax cut before lawmakers  
go home for August. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's moved to defuse a census dispute that once, under  
Gingrich, delayed disaster aid to Midwestern farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``His not being fancy plays to what we need now, which is  
solid,'' says Don Fierce, a former top Republican National 
Committee official, now a lobbyist loyal to the GOP cause. 
</P>
<P>
	With Republicans eager to achieve legislative accomplishments,  
the challenges are coming faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the limits contained in the 1997 balanced budget deal,  
passage of some annual spending measures seems impossible. Among 
the options, according to several Republicans, is to seek a 
negotiation with the White House to overhaul Medicare, cut taxes, 
and provide more money for domestic spending. 
</P>
<P>
	A more immediate challenge is gun control. Hastert and Gephardt  
met last week and discussed bringing the issue to the floor in 
mid-June. A few hours later, after meeting with fellow Democrats, 
Gephardt rejected the offer as too late. 
</P>
<P>
	And even the issues that ultimately come off smoothly in public  
are filled with difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point last winter, according to some Republicans,  
hard-liners were tugging one way on the budget and members of the 
Appropriations Committee tugging in another. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert summed up his own predicament.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now I know why Newt left,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Katzenberg Estimate Ignores Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jeffrey Katzenberg's expert witness and a  
Disney lawyer clashed Tuesday over how rosy the future is for 
Disney products since the profits will be used to calculate 
Katzenberg's lucrative bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg, the former head of Disney's movie studio, is suing  
the company for at least $250 million, representing what he 
contends is his share of future profits of all films and 
merchandise generated during his 10 years there. 
</P>
<P>
	For the phase of the trial being held to calculate the size of  
the bonus, Katzenberg called Microsoft Corp. technology expert 
Nathan Myhrvold, who predicted a future full of high-tech 
opportunities for entertainment companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Myhrvold spoke of everything from homes that will be able to  
receive movies on demand over the Internet or satellite to ``smart 
toys'' that will dance along with children's television shows. 
</P>
<P>
	These and other advancements could occur in five to 10 years on  
a widespread basis, Myhrvold said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Disney's lawyers suggested the future was not as bright as  
the expert predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	George Caplan, in a brief opening statement, said Katzenberg's  
estimate of future video sales didn't take into account the 
widespread piracy in China and India that affects even first-run 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of piracy, it's virtually all on the streets of China  
today -- and India,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg calculated that $80 million of his bonus should come  
from more than $4 billion in business in China and India, but 
Disney collected less than $1 million in revenues last year, Caplan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Myhrvold countered that China was willing to help thwart piracy  
and technology would soon help with such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, which has allowed the high-profile row between  
Katzenberg and former boss, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner, to 
become public, is now focused on the question of how much money 
Disney can be expected to make for the rest of time off some of its 
best-known products, including ``The Lion King'' and ``Aladdin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg says his contract guaranteed him a lump-sum incentive  
bonus worth 2 percent of those future profits, payable two years 
after he left Disney in 1994. After Disney didn't pay the bonus, 
Katzenberg filed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first phase of the trial, both sides reached a partial  
settlement. Katzenberg, sources said, was paid more than $100 
million. The litigants also agreed to a second phase to decide 
which products would fall under the bonus and how much that bonus 
should be. The product issue was decided earlier, along with a 
finding that Katzenberg should get interest payments on his bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	As his first witness in the valuation part of the second phase,  
Katzenberg called Myhrvold, a friend who was instrumental in making 
Microsoft a financial partner in DreamWorks SKG, where Katzenberg 
is a partner and head of the animation division. 
</P>
<P>
	Myhrvold was quickly drawn into the bitter side of the lawsuit,  
as Disney attorney Sanford Litvack sought to show his opinions were 
shaded, in part, by his close ties to Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Litvack suggested Myhrvold even offered a way for Katzenberg to  
streamline the litigation by simply offering to buy all of the 
Disney products at issue, knowing that Disney would turn him down. 
</P>
<P>
	Myhrvold acknowledged he did make that suggestion, but only  
because Disney's own estimates of the value of its products were so 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a ploy by you,'' Litvack said in his questioning.  
</P>
<P>
	Myhrvold instead called it a ``wild idea.'' But he said that if  
Disney was ``going to sell 'Pretty Woman' for what (its economic 
expert) says it's worth, I said, 'What the hell?''' and passed on 
his recommendation to Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg replied that he considered the idea but decided not  
to pursue it, according to Myhrvold.

<HEADLINE> WWII Survivors Sue German Drug Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A half-century later, twin sisters who  
survived the Auschwitz concentration camp say they clearly remember 
Dr. Joseph Mengele scrutinizing their naked bodies that he had 
subjected to gruesome and unscientific medical ``experiments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They have only recently learned, however, that German  
pharmaceutical companies participated in the tests with the 
notorious ``Angel of Death'' and profited from their pain, 
according to two class-action lawsuits they and others filed this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits filed May 13 against Bayer AG, Hoechst AG and  
Schering AG are among the first in the nation linking German 
companies to Nazi medical experiments. The Associated Press learned 
of the lawsuits Tuesday. A similar class-action lawsuit against 
Bayer was filed in Indiana in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The three lawsuits are the latest filings in a recent wave of  
litigation by survivors of Nazi death camps or slave labor 
factories aimed at European banks, insurance companies and 
industrial firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the Newark suits, one is filed on behalf of U.S. citizens,  
the other for citizens of other nations. Each seeks unspecified 
damages for survivors it estimates number in the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	They accuse the companies of providing toxic chemicals to the  
Nazis for the ``experiments.'' Company personnel supervised the 
work and used information from those experiments to market products 
sold during and after the war, the lawsuits said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering also participated in these experiments, but also  
supported experimental sterilization procedures on camp inmates, 
the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations stem from ``various documents that have become  
available for researching that were not available before,'' said 
Joseph D. Ament, a Chicago lawyer representing plaintiffs in the 
Newark cases. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the survivor lawsuits, many filed in U.S. District Court  
here, have been made possible by a 1991 international agreement 
settling German reparations to other nations, and thus allowing 
individuals to sue, said Burt Neuborne, a professor at New York 
University Law School who is among the lawyers pressing the Newark 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoechst issued a statement that did not address the medical  
experimentation claims, but cited the company's support of 
``various organizations and projects dedicated to preserving the 
memory of the atrocities of the Nazi regime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer spokesman Thomas Reinert in Leverkusen, Germany, said the  
company would not comment on the lawsuits at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering spokesman Gert Wlasich said the company would examine  
the claims before commenting.

<HEADLINE> First Union Again Warns on Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- For the second time in five months, First  
Union Corp. on Tuesday was forced to scale back sharply its 
projected earnings for the quarter and year. Its stock fell nearly 
9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union chairman Ed Crutchfield remained cool to speculation  
about a merger with a comparable-size bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here 34 years, and we've missed this (earnings  
forecast) only once,'' he said during a 90-minute conference call 
with analysts who cover First Union's stock. ``Maybe it will happen 
again in another 34 years. We'll tighten up what we need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst David Berry of Keefe Bruyette &AMP; Woods was sharply  
critical of the bank's actions, however. ``This is a bank that 
seems to have trouble budgeting,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the result of some external event beyond their  
control. It's not like they made some loans to Russia and they 
defaulted,'' Berry said. ``The pattern of events shows they don't 
have a grip on the finances of this company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First Union shares fell $4.25 to $45.68 3/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte-based bank said its second-quarter earnings would  
be in the range of $770 million to $800 million, or 80 cents to 83 
cents a share. The results exclude a non-recurring 8-cent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts polled by the research firm First Call Corp. had  
expected the bank to earn about 97 cents per share in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's sixth-largest bank also said Tuesday it expects its  
1999 operating earnings to be between $3.3 billion and $3.4 
billion, or $3.40 to $3.50 a share, excluding a 20-cent 
non-recurring gain. 
</P>
<P>
	That's far short of the company's earnings goal of around $4 a  
share. In January, it had been revised downward to that figure from 
$4.29. First Call's estimate was $3.98 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the bank earned $3.7 billion, or $3.77 per share, which  
did not include merger-related and restructuring charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Crutchfield said one reason for the company's struggles has been  
its growth over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had a lot of acquisitions, as you know, over the last  
two or three years,'' he said. ``The company has roughly tripled in 
size.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First Union's largest acquisition, Philadelphia's CoreStates  
Financial Corp., turned out to be its most problematic, Crutchfield 
said. The 1998 merger partner has not produced the revenues that 
First Union had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	``CoreStates has not lived up to our expectations,'' he said,  
adding that neither has another acquisition, The Money Store. ``I'd 
still do it over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, First Union unveiled plans to trim its work force 7  
percent to cut annual costs by $400 million. The moves were 
prompted by forecasts that bank profits would be slowing after 
several years of strong growth.

<HEADLINE>  Petrie Named NBA Exec of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Geoff Petrie, Sacramento's vice  
president of basketball operations, was selected NBA Executive of 
the Year on Tuesday, capping a spectacular comeback year for him 
and the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	The award, announced in New York by The Sporting News,  
recognized Petrie's key role in rebuilding a team which had not had 
a winning season since moving from Kansas City to Sacramento in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting his fifth year with the Kings, Petrie made a series of  
trades and signings, some of them controversial, that resulted in 
four new starters playing for a new coach, Rick Adelman. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA lockout meant an abbreviated training camp and season  
for the young team, and the start was rocky. The Kings' 
inconsistency and lapses often made them look like the 27-55 team 
of the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sacramento closed the regular season with 10 wins in their  
final 11 games for a 27-23 record. Then they came within one missed 
shot on the final buzzer of upsetting the Utah Jazz, the defending 
two-time Western Conference champion, in the fifth and final game 
of the opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie received eight of a possible 33 votes from his fellow NBA  
executives and league representatives. Orlando's John Gabriel 
received seven votes, followed by Toronto's Glen Grunwald with five 
and Portland's Bob Whitsitt with four. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie said the award was especially gratifying ``coming with  
the type of year we had ... the way it came together under such 
great uncertainty and much doubt. I'm really proud of everybody 
associated with the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of that doubt and uncertainty involved Petrie's own job.  
Earlier this year, as Petrie faced a scheduled mid-year change in 
team ownership and the expiration of his contract. At one point he 
reportedly was just hours away from resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	But Petrie signed a multiyear contract extension in January, and  
his team of strangers -- nine new players on the 12-man roster -- won 
national attention with a sometimes erratic but always exciting 
style. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie's major accomplishments were trading for power forward  
Chris Webber, signing free agent center Vlade Divac and drafting 
point guard Jason Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as important were the free agent signings of guards  
Vernon Maxwell and Jon Barry and forward Scot Pollard and the 
recruitment and signing of guard Peja Stojakovic, a 1996 
first-round draft choice from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Only forwards Corliss Williamson and Lawrence Funderburke and  
guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad -- all draft choices during Petrie's 
five-year tenure -- returned from the 1997-98 squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Geoff has done a terrific job in rebuilding the Sacramento  
Kings. A lot of hard work has started to pay off for the 
organization,'' said Kings chief executive officer Jim Thomas, who 
hired Petrie in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Gavin Maloof, whose family will assume control of the franchise  
from Thomas on July 1, said the honor was well deserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say I was surprised,'' Maloof said from Las Vegas. ``I  
do know it's an honor for him individually and for the Kings 
organization to have a person of his quality. It's certainly a very 
prestigious award, and I'm happy for him because he works very hard 
and deserves it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie, 51, shared the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 1971,  
when he played for the Portland Trail Blazers. His latest award 
makes him the first person to win both the NBA's rookie and 
executive honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie played six years for the Trail Blazers. After his playing  
career was curtailed by injuries, he spent five years as a members 
of the Trail Blazers broadcast team and another four years in the 
team's front office before joining the Kings.

<HEADLINE>  Petrie Named NBA Exec of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Geoff Petrie, Sacramento's vice  
president of basketball operations, was selected NBA Executive of 
the Year on Tuesday, capping a spectacular comeback year for him 
and the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	The award, announced in New York by The Sporting News,  
recognized Petrie's key role in rebuilding a team which had not had 
a winning season since moving from Kansas City to Sacramento in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting his fifth year with the Kings, Petrie made a series of  
trades and signings, some of them controversial, that resulted in 
four new starters playing for a new coach, Rick Adelman. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA lockout meant an abbreviated training camp and season  
for the young team, and the start was rocky. The Kings' 
inconsistency and lapses often made them look like the 27-55 team 
of the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sacramento closed the regular season with 10 wins in their  
final 11 games for a 27-23 record. Then they came within one missed 
shot on the final buzzer of upsetting the Utah Jazz, the defending 
two-time Western Conference champion, in the fifth and final game 
of the opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie received eight of a possible 33 votes from his fellow NBA  
executives and league representatives. Orlando's John Gabriel 
received seven votes, followed by Toronto's Glen Grunwald with five 
and Portland's Bob Whitsitt with four. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie said the award was especially gratifying ``coming with  
the type of year we had ... the way it came together under such 
great uncertainty and much doubt. I'm really proud of everybody 
associated with the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of that doubt and uncertainty involved Petrie's own job.  
Earlier this year, as Petrie faced a scheduled mid-year change in 
team ownership and the expiration of his contract. At one point he 
reportedly was just hours away from resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	But Petrie signed a multiyear contract extension in January, and  
his team of strangers -- nine new players on the 12-man roster -- won 
national attention with a sometimes erratic but always exciting 
style. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie's major accomplishments were trading for power forward  
Chris Webber, signing free agent center Vlade Divac and drafting 
point guard Jason Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as important were the free agent signings of guards  
Vernon Maxwell and Jon Barry and forward Scot Pollard and the 
recruitment and signing of guard Peja Stojakovic, a 1996 
first-round draft choice from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Only forwards Corliss Williamson and Lawrence Funderburke and  
guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad -- all draft choices during Petrie's 
five-year tenure -- returned from the 1997-98 squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Geoff has done a terrific job in rebuilding the Sacramento  
Kings. A lot of hard work has started to pay off for the 
organization,'' said Kings chief executive officer Jim Thomas, who 
hired Petrie in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Gavin Maloof, whose family will assume control of the franchise  
from Thomas on July 1, said the honor was well deserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say I was surprised,'' Maloof said from Las Vegas. ``I  
do know it's an honor for him individually and for the Kings 
organization to have a person of his quality. It's certainly a very 
prestigious award, and I'm happy for him because he works very hard 
and deserves it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie, 51, shared the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 1971,  
when he played for the Portland Trail Blazers. His latest award 
makes him the first person to win both the NBA's rookie and 
executive honors.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Discusses Cultural 'Decay' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans shouldn't be gloomy about their  
prospects in the 2000 congressional elections just because the GOP 
lost seats in the House last time, former House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich says. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich said in a speech Monday night that Republicans can run  
on their successes since taking over Congress in 1994, such as 
welfare reform, tax cuts, a balanced federal budget and proposals 
to set up private savings accounts as an alternative to Social 
Security for younger people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an optimist. We are a majority,'' he said. ``We have, in  
fact, had an impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, who resigned from Congress after the GOP losses in the  
1998 elections, also touched on school violence and foreign policy 
in his speech to $10,000-level donors to GOPAC, a political action 
committee he once led. 
</P>
<P>
	On school violence, the Georgia Republican said incidents like  
the Colorado and Georgia school shootings will never be solved 
without changes such as voluntary school prayer, competency tests 
for teachers and lower taxes intended to reduce the need for two 
parents to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there is, in fact, a decay in the land,'' Gingrich  
said. ``The liberals yell, 'Gun control,' because it's the only 
thing they've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich also said students should be taught the Declaration of  
Independence closely, particularly its section about rights to 
``life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'' guaranteed by a 
``creator,'' so that they will look at each human life as valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've had it drilled into you that you are a child of God  
... you're creating a much greater sense of civility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich had harsh criticism for President Clinton's handling of  
the conflict in Yugoslavia, calling it the ``worst-managed American 
campaign since the Spanish-American War. It is a tragedy on every 
front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The war has exposed flaws in the U.S. intelligence system that  
shows the need for greater resources, he added. And he put in a 
pitch for a U.S. missile defense system, particularly if the 
Chinese and others gain ground in their nuclear capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	GOPAC officials said the speech is likely to become one of the  
thousands of audio tapes the group sends to Republican candidates 
nationwide to help them articulate the party agenda.

<HEADLINE> Harassment Ruling May Change Little </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruling that exposed schools to lawsuits for  
student-against-student sexual harassment is so narrowly defined 
that some legal experts say it may have limited impact in the 
courts, and even less effect on America's playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	School boards can be held liable, but only if officials  
deliberately ignored sexual harassment so severe and pervasive that 
it deprived a student of his or her right to an education, 
according to Monday's 5-4 high court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very high standard,'' said Catherine Fisk, a law  
professor at Loyola University in Los Angeles who has written 
extensively on sexual harassment. ``I don't think it is a big 
change in what most people thought the law was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``I suspect that the usual kids being mean to other  
kids, pulling up girls' dresses or whatever, isn't going to meet 
the standard of pervasive and severe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling follows a Supreme Court decision last June that said  
schools could be sued under the anti-bias federal law known as 
Title IX for a teacher's sexual harassment of a pupil. Monday's 
action extends that to harassment between students. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling stems from a Georgia case in which the mother of a  
fifth-grade girl named LaShonda Davis claimed that Monroe County 
school officials ignored her daughter's repeated complaints about a 
classmate who had allegedly groped and sexually threatened her. 
</P>
<P>
	In siding with Davis, however, the high court set a very high  
standard for holding school officials responsible, saying they had 
to have knowledge of the harassment and fail to act. 
</P>
<P>
	Some education officials said that is a narrower definition than  
Education Department guidelines issued in 1997. Under the 
guidelines, officials have a responsibility even if they had no 
knowledge of sexual harassment, but should have known. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court was quite clear that to be liable for damages it has  
to be pretty egregious. Basically, you knew about it and didn't do 
anything at all,'' said Stephen Yurek, general counsel for the 
National Association of Secondary School Principals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yurek said schools are already cracking down on sexually  
inappropriate behavior under the Education Department guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools, particularly in this day and age, have to err on the  
side of safety and protecting the kid,'' he said. ``The days of 
`boys will be boys, girls will be girls' are gone, and schools have 
a responsibility for educating kids on having respect for others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Houston, executive director of the American Association of  
School Administrators, which opposed the high court decision, said 
he worried the case could raise schools' legal costs and prompt 
officials to overreact to student misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid that people may come down overly hard on kids for  
things that aren't actually sexual harassment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said the case should prompt schools to adopt more  
counseling for students and training for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Stockdale, a psychology professor at Southern Illinois  
University in Carbondale and an expert on sexual harassment in the 
workplace, said the ruling puts school systems ``on notice that 
they should take this seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she said it will still be more difficult to sue a school  
than a company. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a difference. We are talking about kids, and teaching  
them lessons,'' Stockdale said. ``In the workplace people are 
adults and they should know better. But in school, it is a 
developmental process.''

<HEADLINE> Attorney: NYC Cop To Plead Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After watching officer after officer testify  
against him, a New York policeman has decided to end his trial by 
pleading guilty to brutally torturing a Haitian immigrant in a 
stationhouse bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Justin Volpe's decision in a case that shocked New York  
and led to tension between police and the city's minority community 
was revealed Monday after a private discussion between attorneys 
and U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, refused to  
comment. But according to a court transcript, Kornberg told the 
judge, ``... if your honor can see fit to give us some time 
tomorrow we would like to enter a plea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move is not part of a plea bargain, meaning Volpe is hoping  
for leniency from the judge. The 27-year-old officer could face a 
maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe is the central figure in a racially charged case that  
included the indictments of five white officers on charges of 
violating the civil rights of Abner Louima, who is black, by 
attacking him. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury trial began three weeks ago. The prosecution against  
the four other officers was expected to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, the son of a retired police detective, is accused of  
ramming a stick into Louima's rectum and mouth in a fit of rage. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Volpe mistakenly thought Louima, 32, punched him  
in a disturbance outside a Brooklyn nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997. 
Volpe also is charged with beating Louima en route to the 70th 
Precinct stationhouse, conspiracy, witness tampering and falsely 
arresting and beating another man. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Charles Schwarz is accused of holding down Louima during  
the bathroom assault. Schwarz and Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas 
Bruder also are charged with beating Louima; Sgt. Michael Bellomo 
is charged with covering up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Volpe's legal team had not yet begun its defense, the  
officer's case appeared to be damaged by testimony from fellow 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first officer to shatter the so-called ``blue wall of  
silence,'' Detective Eric Turetzky, testified seeing a disheveled 
and sullen Volpe ``swinging the stick around like a sword and 
hitting it against the wall'' around the time of the bathroom 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Next came Officer Mark Schofield, who testified that Volpe  
borrowed a pair of black leather gloves and returned them covered 
with blood and that he also had seen Volpe with a ``stick-like 
object.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Sgt. Kenneth Wernick testified Volpe bragged that he  
``took a stick and put it 5 or 6 inches up (Louima's rectum), took 
it out and put it up to his mouth and teeth area, kind of like 
showing it to him.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Michael Schoer testified Volpe had taunted him by  
putting the end of an excrement-soiled stick in his face.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Story Flops in the Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura's television story  
was pinned to the mat by Michael Landon, Cleopatra and Will Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, with the help of Landon and Susan Lucci's victory at the  
Daytime Emmy Awards on Friday, won last week's Nielsens prime-time 
ratings race over second-place NBC as the May ratings ``sweeps'' 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	For the broadcast networks, Sunday nights are often the most  
competitive sweeps month battlegrounds. Sunday is usually the most 
popular night for TV viewing and it's when the networks place 
high-profile movies and mini-series. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's Sunday movie, ``Michael Landon: The Father I Knew''  
narrowly beat ABC's critically-praised miniseries opener, 
``Cleopatra.'' Both were in the week's top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's showing of the Smith movie, ``Independence Day,'' came in  
third place Sunday night. But it was still the network's second 
most-watched program of the week behind ``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's TV movie on Ventura, the former pro wrestler and now  
Minnesota governor, was the big loser. It drew poor reviews and 
even worse ratings, a dismal 58th place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC can take some solace from the solid performance of its  
Thursday night lineup. The triumvirate of ``ER,'' ``Frasier'' and 
``Friends,'' in their season finales, was easily the week's three 
most-watched programs. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's telecast of the Daytime Emmy awards was Friday's most  
popular program. Soap star Lucci climaxed that broadcast by winning 
her first best actress award after 18 defeats. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 9.6 rating and 16 share, and NBC had a  
9.3 rating and 16 share. ABC was third at 7.3 and 12, while Fox had 
a 7.0 rating and 12 share. The WB had a 3.4 rating and 6 share, UPN 
had a 1.7 rating and 3 share and Pax TV was at 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
7.4 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second 
with a 7.1 rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had 
a 5.8 and 13. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Report: Thefts Let China Build Nuke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's two-decade effort to steal U.S.  
weapons technology continued well into the Clinton administration, 
positioning Beijing to develop modern mobile nuclear warheads as 
good as America's, says a bipartisan congressional report. 
</P>
<P>
	An ``insatiable appetite'' for U.S. technology leaves China  
ready to leap from a 1950s nuclear weapons program to sophisticated 
designs ``on par with our own,'' concludes the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The 700-page report, being released today by a special House  
committee chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., said that 
while Chinese espionage can be traced back at least to the 1970s, 
``thefts almost certainly continue to the present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It singled out as particularly damaging the loss of design  
material from one of America's most sophisticated warheads in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``China has never stolen any other countries' secrets, including  
from the United States,'' an official at Defense Ministry's office 
in Beijing said today. The official refused to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao, also in Beijing, said  
the allegations were cooked up by people who want to slander China 
and declared that ``their despicable attempt is doomed to 
failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report describes a breadth of Chinese espionage that is so  
threatening to U.S. interests that some members of Congress have 
compared it to the theft of atomic bomb secrets by Russia in the 
1940s. The fallout could have a profound impact on the operation of 
U.S. weapons labs and on U.S.-China relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate have called for in-depth hearings on  
Chinese espionage and U.S. nuclear security. And Energy Secretary 
Bill Richardson within days is expected to announce disciplinary 
action against a number of Energy Department and lab employees in 
connection with anti-espionage lapses. 
</P>
<P>
	``These thefts of nuclear secrets from our national weapons  
laboratories enabled (China) to design, develop and successfully 
test modern strategic weapons sooner than would otherwise have been 
possible,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of stolen secrets and other technology gains,  
China ``has leaped, in a handful of years, from 1950s-era strategic 
nuclear capabilities to the more modern thermonuclear weapons 
designs'' that took the United States decades to achieve, says the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the report was obtained late Monday by The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan select committee began investigating technology  
transfers to China nearly a year ago. Last fall it refocused much 
of its attention to espionage at U.S. weapons labs. The committee 
and Clinton administration have been negotiating for several months 
on how much of the document to make public. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee of five Republicans and four Democrats found that  
the primary focus of Chinese espionage was the weapons research 
labs of Los Alamos and Sandia in New Mexico and Lawrence Livermore 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Information on a total of seven U.S. warheads, including two of  
America's most modern, is believed to have been obtained through 
Chinese espionage in the 1980s, although the losses were not 
discovered until the mid-1990s. The report also referred to the 
apparent theft of neutron bomb technology in 1995, but said details 
remained classified because the matter is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that in the late 1990s, China obtained  
``electromagnetic weapons technology'' that could be used to attack 
satellites and missiles, improved detection techniques that could 
be used against submarines, and ``research technology that if taken 
to successful conclusion could be used to attack U.S. satellites 
and submarines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have questioned how much use any of  
those technologies are to the Chinese. And while the report was 
adopted unanimously, some of the four Democrats on the panel, have 
suggested the report often uses ``worst case'' assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This report raises serious security concerns,'' said Rep. John  
Spratt, D-S.C., a panel member. ``But some of the losses that are 
hypothesized in the report have yet to be established or proven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While China has focused intensely on the weapons labs, the  
report said its campaign to find technologies and secrets that may 
help to modernize its nuclear weapons program went far beyond 
traditional espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The PRC's appetite for information and technology appears to  
be insatiable and the energy devoted to the task enormous,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report described widespread use of the U.S. business  
community as well as academia in its pursuit of not only secrets 
but unclassified technology that might be of use militarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Two U.S. satellite manufacturers, Loral Corp. and Hughes  
Electronics, provided China with valuable information to improve 
the reliability of missiles used to launch communications 
satellites. However, the report said, the same know-how passed on 
by the U.S. companies could be used to make China's nuclear 
missiles more reliable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loral and Hughes showed the PRC how to improve the design and  
reliability of the guidance system used in the PRC's newest Long 
March rocket,'' the report said. It said these activities went 
beyond the license authority given the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of the report remains classified, including some  
details about the espionage investigation at the Los Alamos lab in 
New Mexico where a scientist was fired in March after being under 
suspicion of espionage for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has not been charged and he has  
denied providing any secrets to China, or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno made clear that she isn't resigning  
even though a Clinton administration loyalist, Sen. Robert 
Torricelli of New Jersey, suggested she consider stepping down over 
the handling of allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm right here, going strong,'' she told two reporters who  
encountered her in a Justice Department hallway. The Justice 
Department in 1997 declined to seek a warrant for electronic 
surveillance of Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said that the U.S. sale of 600 high powered  
computers to China may help China in the future to develop its 
nuclear arsenal without actual nuclear testing. China has pledged 
to adhere to the nuclear test-ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the nuclear secrets stolen from the United States, it  
would have been virtually impossible for the PRC to fabricate and 
test successfully small nuclear warheads'' prior to its 1996 pledge 
to comply with the treaty, said the report.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Bombings Enter Third Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO's bombing campaign entered its  
third month today with missiles striking the abandoned Serb police 
headquarters in Belgrade and a villa said to be one of the 
residences of President Slobodan Milosevic. A new wave of refugees 
were bound for Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO approved an updated operations plan with higher numbers for  
its Kosovo ground force today, a peacekeeping unit about 
50,000-strong that would be sent into the province from Macedonia 
as soon Serb troops depart. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States would probably furnish 7,000-8,000 troops as  
part of the plan, which now goes back to NATO generals to decide 
this month exactly how many troops with what specialties will be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The operations plan was drawn up last year, creating a NATO-led  
international force of about 28,000 to implement an eventual peace 
agreement between the Yugoslav government and the ethnic Albanians, 
but that accord never materialized as the Kosovo conflict broke 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of today's airstrikes focused on command and control  
facilities, including Milosevic's villa at Dobanovci, 12 miles west 
of Belgrade, NATO said. It was the third time the villa that NATO 
says also houses a major command center had been struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, was down to its last 8 percent  
of water reserves because of damaged pumping stations and a power 
outage, Serb media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The English-language V.I.P. newsletter reported fighting in much  
of Kosovo and said the most intense clashes were in the west, where 
Serbian forces were trying to regain positions lost to the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army in the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The allied campaign aims to force Milosevic to accept a peace  
deal for the southern Serb province that would include withdrawing 
Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, allowing NATO-led peacekeepers to 
police the accord and all refugees to return. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three days, 22,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have  
poured out of Kosovo and into Macedonia, the most U.N. workers had 
seen since the first week of May. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources inside Yugoslavia have alerted Macedonia that 150,000  
more refugees are on the way, a Macedonian Foreign Ministry 
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March, more than 830,000 ethnic Albanians have fled  
Kosovo, which had a prewar population of 2.1 million. A 13-month 
crackdown by Yugoslav forces that killed at least 2,000 people 
preceded the NATO air campaign that started March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for  
Refugees, speculated that Milosevic's forces had begun a final push 
to oust ethnic Albanians from Pristina and Urosevac -- deportation 
hubs where refugees from all over Kosovo gather to board buses and 
trains for the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the new arrivals Monday were from Pristina, Kosovo's  
capital. They described a broken city, where paramilitary police 
wearing black masks ruled streets emptied of the ethnic Albanian 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav army, meanwhile, banned anti-war demonstrations in  
a central Serbian town during air raid alerts and warned deserters 
to return to their units or face courts-martial, the daily Vijesti 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	For days, citizens of Krusevac and several central Serbian towns  
have been demonstrating against the war and protesting service of 
their male relatives in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Krusevac, several hundred reservists who deserted and  
returned home joined the protests. A local official who asked for 
anonymity said about 2,000 people demonstrated Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The army was previously conciliatory, urging deserters to return  
and even offering to treat their unauthorized leave of absence as 
formal leave. But the comments reported from Krusevac by Vijesti 
were harsher, saying those failing to return would be 
court-martialed by a ``war court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement, issued by the local army command, also warned  
against illegal public gatherings during air raid alerts, saying 
reaction will be ``robust and the violators will be punished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poor weather hampered NATO's military operation today, but jets  
still struck several artillery emplacements, military vehicles and 
a logistics support base. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets also fired at Mount Cer, 60 miles west of Belgrade, site of  
a key communication transmitter; at the Batajnica military airport 
northwest of Belgrade; and in the suburb of Rakovica, the site of a 
large underground military complex, state media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO troops also began relocating 30,000 Kosovo refugees today  
from Albania's northern border to safer camps deeper inside the 
country, fearing attacks from nearby Serb forces. Most of the 
refugees are in Albania and, increasingly, Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of several recent incidents, U.N. spokesman Rupert  
Colville noted that two bullets fired from inside Kosovo struck the 
refugee reception center Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's foreign minister, meanwhile, said no progress has been  
made so far on finding a political solution to the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Deputy of Secretary of State Strobe Talbott returned to  
Moscow today for another round of talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks between Talbott, Russia's special envoy on Kosovo, Viktor  
Chernomyrdin, and Finnish President President Martti Ahtisaari were 
to resume Wednesday. The three men are spearheading efforts to find 
a political solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin was to fly to Belgrade on Thursday with Ahtisaari  
to meet with Milosevic.

<HEADLINE> Nevada Won't Block Tyson's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson doesn't figure to waste any time  
getting back into the ring. And Nevada boxing officials apparently 
won't get in his way. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tyson out of jail once again, his advisers and handlers are  
looking for him to fight as early as Aug. 21, and possibly once 
more before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aug. 21 is certainly a date we're looking at,'' said Jay  
Larkin, who runs boxing for the Showtime network. ``Hopefully in 
the next couple of days, we'll have something concrete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A top Nevada boxing official, meanwhile, said Tuesday that  
Tyson's no contest plea that landed him in a Maryland jail will not 
be held against him. Dr. James Nave, vice chairman of the Nevada 
Athletic Commission, said Tyson likely won't face additional 
questions from state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson won a license in October after extensive hearings to  
replace the one taken from him for biting Evander Holyfield's ears. 
It does not expire until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is that he has a license,'' Nave said. ``I don't  
see the need for a hearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's advisers, caught off guard by his sudden release from  
jail Monday, were scrambling to make arrangements to get the 
fighter back in the ring as quickly as possible, possibly against 
Axel Schulz or Brian Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, whose last fight was a fifth round knockout of Francois  
Botha on Jan. 16, had his comeback interrupted when he was jailed 
in Maryland for assaulting two motorists following a traffic 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	He served 3 1/2 months of a year-long sentence before being  
released on parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all agreed that while Mike Tyson was in jail, we wouldn't  
make any plans for his fights,'' Larkin said. ``Now, he's been out 
only 24 hours and we just haven't gotten to that point yet. But 
we're going to start right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the sense of urgency to get Tyson back into the ring  
is the fact that his advisers want him to fight twice this year. 
And, because prime pay-per-view dates in September and November are 
already blocked out because of two big fights, the options for 
fight dates are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad are expected to fight on  
pay-per-view on Sept. 18, while Holyfield and Lennox Lewis meet on 
Nov. 13 in their rematch on pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Tyson with the option of fighting in August and  
again in December. An alternative, though, could be for Tyson's 
fight to be a network show and not a pay-per-view, something his 
handlers are also reportedly considering. 
</P>
<P>
	The thinking behind putting a Tyson fight on Showtime itself or  
even selling it to a major network is that it would be tough to 
sell Tyson again in a fight against someone similar to Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Tyson looked rusty and confused in the ring  
against Botha in what was his first fight in 19 months since the 
Holyfield biting incident. Plans before he was sent to jail were 
for him to fight at least four times this year, and there is 
concern about what kind of boxing shape and condition he will be 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, whose network has a contract with Tyson and televises  
his pay-per-view fights, said discussions about an opponent will 
likely wait until Tyson gets in a gym and has a few workouts so his 
trainers can see what he looks like. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson remains one of the biggest pay-per-view attractions,  
although the number of homes that bought his fight with Botha 
slipped to about 750,000 from more than 1 million for several of 
his other fights.

<HEADLINE> Senate Exonerates WW II Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted Tuesday to exonerate two  
American military commanders accused of dereliction of duty in the 
bombing of Pearl Harbor. The vote followed a heated debate that 
divided the chamber's small band of World War II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	By 52 to 47, the Senate approved an effort by Sen. William Roth,  
R-Del., to restore the reputations of Adm. Husband Kimmel and Gen. 
Walter Short, the two senior commanders of U.S. military forces in 
the Pacific at the time of the December 1941 attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The new debate on an old military controversy came as the Senate  
worked on a $288.8 billion defense spending bill for the fiscal 
year that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue was raised in a minor amendment to the defense bill.  
But it led to a two-day, emotional debate revisiting one of the 
nation's worst military disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth, 77, who served in the Army during World War II, said  
Kimmel and Short had become the Pentagon's scapegoats for the 
surprise attack. ``They were held responsible for what happened in 
Pearl Harbor. And that is not fair. And that is not just,'' Roth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining forces with Roth was Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., a  
retired general in the Army Reserve who took part in the D-Day 
invasion as part of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division and later 
served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never too late to correct an injustice,'' said Thurmond,  
96. He called Kimmel and Short ``the two final victims of Pearl 
Harbor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the present chairman of the Armed  
Services Committee and Navy secretary during the Nixon 
administration, strongly opposed the move, suggesting his fellow 
World War II veterans and members of the generation that followed 
were trying to rewrite history. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no new evidence before the Senate,'' said Warner,  
noting that the dispute had been the subject of nine separate 
inquiries over the past five decades, and that none of them had 
cleared the two officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should we now at this late date in history try to make a  
different finding?'' Warner asked. He expressed the view of the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, 72, who volunteered for the Navy in 1944 at age 17 and  
who fought with the Marines in Korea, asked Roth on what basis he 
was trying to change the record ``other than the palpitations of 
your heart?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said it was military tradition for officers to be held  
``directly accountable'' for the welfare of those under their 
command. 
</P>
<P>
	And, while many may have been to blame for America's lack of  
preparation for the surprise attack, Warner said there was clear 
evidence that ``both commanders made errors in judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner ridiculed the Senate action as ``tombstone promotions.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kimmel, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, and Short,  
commander of the Hawaiian Department of the U.S. Army, were accused 
by a panel appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt of 
dereliction of duty in not anticipating the Japanese attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Their wartime ranks of four-star admiral and lieutenant general  
were reduced and both officers retired under dark clouds. Both are 
deceased. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate move to restore these ranks will go to the House as  
part of the big defense bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimmel's son, Edward R. ``Ned'' Kimmel of Wilmington, Del., has  
been working with Roth and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., to clear his 
father's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not rewriting history. We're merely correcting the  
record,'' Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth said the two officers were ``denied vital intelligence that  
was available in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that many were to blame for America's lack of  
preparedness in the Pacific, including the military and 
intelligence apparatus in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment expresses the ``sense of Congress'' that both  
officers had performed their duties ``competently and 
professionally'' and that the Japanese attacks were ``not a result 
of dereliction of duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Roth and Thurmond in voting to clear the names of the  
two officers were four other World War II veterans: Jesse Helms, 
R-N.C.; Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.; Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., and 
Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting with Warner to leave their status unchanged were the  
remaining three Senate veterans from that conflict: John Chafee, 
R-R.I.; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Steel Producers Want More Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leading U.S. steel producers said Tuesday they  
remain hurt by imports despite recent reductions and will soon ask 
the Clinton administration to consider more tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government already has imposed punitive tariffs on some  
stainless steel, and a key ruling from the U.S. International Trade 
Commission in early June could lead to tariffs against Japan on 
hot-rolled carbon steel, the industry's most common product. 
</P>
<P>
	Tariffs would effectively make foreign steel too expensive to  
sell in U.S. markets, offering relief to a U.S. steel industry 
beleaguered by low-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's surge in imports, coming in the wake of the Asian  
economic crisis, which reduced demand for steel abroad, has been 
blamed for thousands of layoffs and bankruptcies at three U.S. 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethlehem Steel Corp., U.S. Steel Group and Steel Dynamics Inc.  
were among the companies planning to file trade complaints 
targeting cold-rolled steel, a thinner, stronger and more valuable 
product than the hot-rolled variety. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regretfully, imports are still too high,'' said Curtis H.  
Barnette, chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem Steel. ``While 
volume has been reduced, ... fair value in the marketplace has not 
been restored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call with reporters from the American Iron and  
Steel Institute's general meeting in New York, Barnette said the 
cold-rolled cases will be brought ``in the near future.'' He did 
not name the countries that will be targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Because trade cases take several months to resolve, the decision  
to file additional complaints is a sign the industry does not 
believe its woes will go away anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports have dropped by roughly 40 percent since November, and  
the industry credits past trade complaints for those reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry also has sought quotas from Congress. Unlike trade  
complaints, which target specific products and specific countries, 
quotas would restrict steel globally.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Against Most Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Tuesday as news  
surfaced about possible Senatorial opposition to Lawrence Summers' 
nomination to be Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	In listless, low-volume trading, the dollar's fall against the  
yen sparked the dollar's slide against other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell to 122.70 yen from 123.21 Monday. The euro was  
quoted at $1.0601, rising from $1.0594. The dollar also was quoted 
at 1.5038 Swiss francs, down from 1.5122; and 1.4657 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.4546. The British pound rose to $1.6028 from 
$1.5964. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders sent the dollar lower during Asian trading after a  
report that senators from steel states were thinking about blocking 
Summers' nomination to get the attention of the Clinton 
administration about protecting the U.S. steel industry. President 
Clinton nominated Summers to replace the well-respected Robert 
Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry suffered considerable job losses and plant closings  
last year as Japan and other nations allegedly dumped steel in the 
United States at lower than market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post said the bipartisan steel caucus is seeking  
passage of a bill that's before the Senate, and already approved by 
the House, that would roll back steel imports. The president has 
threatened to veto the bill as a violation of international trade 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite claims Tuesday by Sen. Mike DeWine, D-Ohio that his  
comments were misinterpreted and that he has no plans to do 
challenge Summers, the dollar was unable to recover in New York 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dollar/yen seems to be more of a political currency. The trade  
deficit against Japan is a lot bigger. It attracts a lot more 
attention than Europe's,'' said Jay Bryson, an international 
economist at First Union Capital Markets in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore, the yen ``took the hit last night,'' Bryson said. ``I  
think it's carried over today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries that have switched to the  
euro are no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a 
fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8450 German marks, down from 1.8460; 6.1881 French francs, down 
from 6.1920; and 1,828.15 Italian lire, unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Players in Anti-Smoking Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- New York Yankees outfielder Paul O'Neill  
says winning the World Series was his greatest accomplishment. 
Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra says his was hitting two 
grand slams in one game. New York Mets third baseman Robin Ventura 
is most proud of ``quitting tobacco.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three players star in a new public service campaign along  
with Travis Lee of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Eric Karros of the 
Los Angeles Dodgers to draw attention to World No Tobacco Day on 
May 31 as well as the global tobacco epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition behind the global event turned to the baseball  
players as role models for young people in an attempt to counter 
the glamorous image of smoking the tobacco industry has created. 
</P>
<P>
	``These ballplayers can do much to reach our nation's youth and  
convince them of the dangers of tobacco use,'' baseball announcer 
and former major league all-star Tim McCarver told a news 
conference Tuesday, launching the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The public service broadcast, which will air in several  
ballparks over the Memorial Day weekend and throughout the baseball 
season, delivers the following message from O'Neill: 
</P>
<P>
	``May 31, World No Tobacco Day, could be the day YOU quit.  
Wouldn't it be great to spend the baseball season tobacco free?'' 
</P>
<P>
	World No Tobacco Day, first observed in 1988 and backed by the  
Pan American Health Organization, is the only international event 
established to raise awareness of the global impact of tobacco. A 
coalition of non-profit organizations and corporate sponsors is 
launching widespread initiatives this year to promote the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Kessler, the coalition's co-chair and dean of the Yale  
University School of Medicine, said the baseball campaign is one of 
many aimed at getting the estimated 1.1 billion smokers in the 
world to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	With tobacco use and tobacco-related illness skyrocketing in the  
developing world, countering the tobacco industry isn't going to be 
easy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States tobacco industry is responsible for  
perpetuating the so-called glamorous appeal of tobacco use,'' 
Kessler said. ``It is up to U.S. health leaders and organizations 
like the coalition to tear down a century of brand and image 
building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Brandling-Bennett, deputy director of the Pan American  
Health Organization, said the coalition is hoping tobacco users 
will view May 31 as an opportunity to follow the day's theme -- 
``Leave The Pack Behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday in Geneva, the U.N. health chief said the start of work  
on a global tobacco-control treaty is an important first step 
toward tougher policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed treaty, designed to accelerate the work of member  
states with weaker tobacco control programs, won't be ``just 
another way of raising awareness,'' said Gro Harlem Brundtland, 
director-general of the World Health Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we are going to make it clear this product should  
not be advertised, subsidized or glamorized, but we are also going 
to'' help countries decide how to regulate or even make tobacco use 
illegal, Brundtland said.

<HEADLINE> Saturn Moves Ahead With SUV Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Saturn Corp. is moving ahead with plans  
to make a sport utility vehicle, but company president Cynthia 
Trudell won't give a sneak preview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not even a hint. Let me put it this way, we love the element  
of surprise,'' Trudell said Tuesday with a grin, shortly before 
speaking at a conference for automotive industry leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's board of directors approved funding this month to design  
the SUV, create its manufacturing process and develop a supplier 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, the program can stop any time. So unless that thing is  
coming down the assembly line I never believe it,'' Trudell said. 
``But yes, they gave concurrence to advance funding for us to 
continue developing the product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SUV is considered key to the future success of Saturn, which  
last year posted its first loss since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Trudell is focused on the new larger Saturns that go  
on sale this July. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn is struggling to regain the strong reputation it enjoyed  
for much of the 1990s, when its ad campaign touted Saturn as a 
``different kind of car company,'' a reference to its no-haggle 
sales approach and strong labor-management relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn's 8,000 workers are not covered by the United Auto  
Workers contract in place at every other U.S. automaker. Their 
contract rewards productivity and gives workers input on management 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	As sales -- and worker bonuses -- declined, some Saturn employees  
called for scrapping the contract. Last summer, they threatened to 
strike but backed off when Saturn officials said GM planned to 
build the SUV in Spring Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Trudell said Saturn has ``emerged stronger today as a result''  
of the unrest last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Trudell said that to succeed and grow, Saturn must continue to  
emphasize teamwork and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``This means we must continue to work toward a supportive  
environment in which everyone feels comfortable to contribute.''

	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Guru Hanuman, a pudgy wrestler who  
transformed thousands of men into top wrestlers, died Monday in a 
car crash in northern India, domestic news agencies reported. He 
was 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Guru Hanuman spent his life on the banks of Yamuna River in New  
Delhi, operating an Indian-style wrestling camp, or akhada, where 
he offered free training to anyone interested in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Guru Hanuman, as he was called -- his real name  
was not known -- established 1,200 wrestling centers in India. He 
reportedly borrowed the name of the Hindu monkey-god known for his 
physical strength. 
</P>
<P>
	A tire of the car in which he was traveling burst and the  
vehicle crashed into a tree in the village of Rithani, 35 miles 
north of New Delhi, Indian news agencies reported.

Hayward, who helped develop the atomic bomb dropped over Nagasaki, 
died Sunday of cancer. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward also developed systems for ground and air-launched

World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward joined the Manhattan Project at the China Lake Naval  
Ordinance Test Station in California in 1944. He helped develop the 
implosion components of the bomb dropped over Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 
1945. He was not involved in the development of the atomic bomb 
dropped on Hiroshima three days earlier. 
</P>
<P>

Wednesday of coronary artery disease. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell moved to Berlin in 1945 to serve as legal adviser to

<HEADLINE> Money Withdrawn From Okla. Bomb Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Local prosecutors plan to go ahead with the  
trial of Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry Nichols, despite a 
vote by the state Legislature to withdraw financial support for the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed that the Legislature is not going to help  
us,'' First Assistant District Attorney Robert Mitchell said 
Tuesday after the state House passed a bill to reallocate $1.2 
million for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The office is committed to the prosecution. We'll see how this  
affects that, if at all,'' Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols faces 160 murder charges for the April 19, 1995, bombing  
of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. He already is serving a 
life sentence after being convicted of federal charges in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would have gone to both the prosecution and the team  
retained to defend Nichols at taxpayer expense. The legislation 
would redistribute the money to help victims of the tornadoes that 
killed 44 people and damaged or destroyed nearly 7,000 homes 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate approved the measure, but a spokesman for  
Gov. Frank Keating said it is unclear whether the governor will 
sign it 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels it puts him in a difficult position,'' said John Cox.  
</P>
<P>
	Keating plans to meet with prosecutors and members of Nichols'  
defense team in the next week ``and find some middle ground on the 
issue,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers said their action reflected misgivings about the  
state's tight budget and the fact that Nichols is already serving a 
life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols would be subject to the death penalty if convicted of  
the state murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Bednar, executive director of the state Indigent Defense  
System, said the legislation ends any hope of providing an adequate 
defense for Nichols, 44. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building killed  
168 people and injured hundreds more. Prosecutors filed 160 murder 
charges against Nichols -- one count for each victim whose death was 
not part of Nichols' federal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	No state charges were filed against co-conspirator Timothy  
McVeigh, who was convicted in federal court and sentenced to death 
for the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have said a trial would be too expensive, with some  
estimating the cost at $20 million.

<HEADLINE> IRS Chief Testifies on Collections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a sizable drop in tax enforcement  
actions this year, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told Congress 
on Tuesday that new taxpayer rights won't jeopardize tax 
collections in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	It is taking time to implement dozens of provisions of the 1998  
Internal Revenue Service reform law and properly train the agency's 
100,000 employees under new mandates putting taxpayer service 
first, Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that only about 2 percent of the $1.7 trillion in  
taxes collected this year come from enforcement actions, making it 
imperative to stress improvement in service for the 98 percent of 
taxpayers who comply willingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe we have a choice to make between effective tax  
collection and fair treatment of taxpayers,'' Rossotti said. ``We 
do have to effectively target our enforcement where it's really 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti testified Tuesday before a joint House-Senate panel  
composed of members of committees with jurisdiction over the IRS 
and tax law. The 1998 law requires such a session each year to get 
an overall look at the agency's performance and needs. 
</P>
<P>
	After 18 months on the job, Rossotti has broad support among  
Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill as he tries to convert an 
entrenched bureaucracy into one more responsive to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize that the task of modernizing the IRS is not an  
easy one and may take some time,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, several lawmakers questioned the drop in enforcement  
actions in the first half of 1999. Garnishments of wages and levies 
on bank accounts, for example, are down to 458,000, from 1.8 
million during the same span two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti said the causes were threefold: gradual budget  
reductions that have shrunk the IRS staff, requirements that 
collections agents perform other duties such as answering taxpayer 
calls and worker fears of mandatory firing under new laws -- known 
by workers as the ``10 deadly sins'' -- covering willful misconduct 
and mistreatment of taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are issues that have certainly caused confusion and  
anxiety in our work force,'' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intensive training continues to ease those fears and it will  
take time for employees to become accustomed to the new 
service-oriented IRS, he added. But Congress must support spending 
on technology, new business practices and management to overcome a 
13.7 percent drop in employees since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing business the same way while the economy grows and  
resources decline will eventually undermine the whole tax system,'' 
Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS is putting much of its stock in electronic tax filing  
programs, but on Tuesday acknowledged a glitch in one of them. The 
company contracted to handle credit card payments made errors in 
13,700 transactions made April 15, mistakenly applying the payment 
to 1999 taxes instead of the 1998 return. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti said anyone who received an IRS notice for tax due  
after paying with a credit card that day should do nothing. The 
company, U.S. Audiotex, will contact taxpayers about the correction 
being made and no penalties will be assessed.

<HEADLINE> 49er Line Coach's Cancer Spreads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- A liver transplant for San Francisco  
49ers line coach Bobb McKittrick was canceled after doctors 
discovered his cancer has spread from his bile duct. 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick, 63, went to Stanford University Medical Center  
Monday to receive a partial liver from a donor in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	He was to have shared the organ with a 6-year-old girl in a  
procedure known as a split-liver transplant. The girl, too small to 
accept an adult liver, was scheduled to receive a lobe of the organ 
before the rest went to McKittrick. 
</P>
<P>
	But exploratory surgery Monday night revealed that the cancer,  
initially contained in the bile duct, had spread. The transplant 
procedure, to be performed by liver specialists Drs. Carlos 
Esquivel and Kenneth Drazlan, was canceled and McKittrick instead 
had a biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did an exploratory (procedure) and found some pinpoint  
spots. The cancer spread so they couldn't do the transplant,'' said 
Teckla McKittrick, the coach's wife. ``They operated on him for 
about three hours and did a biopsy. He'll probably be in the 
hospital for three or four days and they'll decide what to do. It's 
not good news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick told the San Francisco Examiner he learned Monday  
morning about the organ being found in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next thing I know, they say, ``We've got a liver for you.' The  
assistant surgeon was leaving (for Las Vegas) almost immediately 
after talking to me,'' McKittrick told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick was diagnosed with cancer of the bile duct in  
mid-January. He began chemotherapy and radiation in February and 
finished the regimen in mid-April. In the process, the 200-pound 
McKittrick lost 33 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty good until I do something, then I don't have any  
stamina,'' he said. ``I get tired easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because he has already had radiation in addition to  
chemotherapy, McKittrick's treatment options are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	``Radiation is out,'' his son, Ladd McKittrick, said. ``He's  
already had his maximum. Some sort of chemotherapy will be 
determined. That probably will be the most likely treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick's future with the 49ers, whom he joined in 1979, is  
uncertain. His illness made the team shift tight ends coach Pat 
Morris to the offensive line. In the last minicamp, Morris was 
assisted by former 49ers guard Guy McIntyre.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Dissidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A dissident who urged Chinese to light candles in  
memory of those killed in the assault on the 1989 Tiananmen Square 
democracy protests has been detained and may be sent to a labor 
camp without trial, a rights group reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Police took Jiang Qisheng from his home in Beijing on May 18 and  
have refused to tell his wife where he is being held, the New 
York-based Human Rights in China said. Authorities can send people 
to labor camps without trial for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, a Hong Kong-based human rights group said police in  
the central industrial city of Wuhan detained two law students who 
put up a poster at Huazhong Technology University calling on the 
government to overturn its assessment that the Tiananmen protests 
were an anti-government rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Xiaoming and Li Qun, students at Zhongnan Politics and Law  
Academy, put up the poster May 4, the 80th anniversary of another 
student movement, and were immediately detained, the Information 
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang was a doctoral candidate at People's University and helped  
lead the demonstrations at Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. He 
spent over a year in prison after the crackdown that ended the 
protests on June 4, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Jiang has been among China's most persistent  
activists for democracy and human rights, organizing petitions 
calling for civil rights and social justice. Last week, he wrote 
open letters to the government protesting the alleged police 
beating of fellow activist Cao Jiahe. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Jiang and 15 other dissidents called on Chinese to  
mark June 4 by wearing plain clothing, lighting candles and 
forgoing entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has increased its surveillance and harassment of  
dissidents and their families recently in what has become a 
seasonal crackdown to prevent commemorations of the Tiananmen 
movement and the hundreds if not thousands who were killed there. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders are especially concerned that dissidents will  
use the anniversary to unite with workers and farmers upset over 
rising unemployment and stagnating incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also is sensitive to external critics. The  
Foreign Ministry today criticized U.S. lawmakers who condemned 
Chinese human rights abuses in resolutions marking the 10th 
anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Zhu Bangzao accused lawmakers of ``willfully  
distorting the human rights situation in China and making 
unwarranted remarks on China's internal affairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A small group of senior intellectuals who have called for  
reforms released an open letter to President Jiang Zemin and 
Premier Zhu Rongji today calling for Jiang Qisheng's release. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, also sent to U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Mary  
Robinson, argued that Chinese have the right to commemorate the 
victims of the military assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those signing the letter were Xu Liangying, a scientist  
who has written articles urging democratic reform, and Ding Zilin 
and Jiang Peikun, professors whose 17-year-old son was killed in 
the Tiananmen Square attack.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Will Aid Iraqi Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States wants to see a new  
government established in Iraq and will help bring it about, 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Iraqi opposition 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, which has made toppling Iraqi  
President Saddam Hussein a major objective, will provide material 
and training for the Iraqi opposition but no military help for now, 
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said after Albright met 
with the leaders Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin told reporters the opposition groups were not ready for  
military help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not prepared to take action that is premature or that  
puts people's lives needlessly at risk,'' he said. ``There are a 
number of steps that have to be taken before we're in a position to 
provide lethal assistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the administration would assist in establishing  
offices to help the opposition groups work together. He said the 
groups also would get computers, training in civil administration 
and advice on distributing anti-Saddam information. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition leaders, newly united under the Iraqi National  
Congress, had said they planned to seek U.S. military protection 
for their efforts to overthrow Saddam. Six representatives of the 
INC, which had disintegrated in squabbling among opposition groups 
until it agreed to reunify in April, were joined at the meeting by 
members of Iraq's Kurdish minority and other Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	But senior administration officials said Hamid Bayati, a  
representative of the Iran-based Supreme Council for the Islamic 
Revolution in Iraq, a member of the INC, did not take part. The 
largest Shiite opposition group, it apparently did not want to be 
seen as cooperating with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition leaders plan to visit members of Congress on  
Wednesday and see President Clinton's national security adviser, 
Sandy Berger, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said aid would begin flowing after opposition leaders meet  
in northern Iraq in early July. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Congress endorsed a plan to provide $95 million to  
Iraqi opposition groups and $2 million for anti-Saddam radio 
broadcasts into Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Key China Spying Developments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Key events in the China spying developments:  
</P>
<P>
	Mid 1980s:  
</P>
<P>
	China is believed to have obtained critical design information  
about the W-88 nuclear warhead, one of the most sophisticated 
warheads in the U.S. arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	1988:   	
</P>
<P>
	China explodes a ``neutron'' bomb, based on U.S. secrets  
believed to have been stolen earlier in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	1995:   	
</P>
<P>
	U.S. intelligence officials learn of the W-88 theft and inform  
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Early 1996:  
</P>
<P>
	FBI begins an investigation at the Los Alamos National Weapons  
Laboratory in New Mexico and focuses on a scientist suspected of 
providing nuclear secrets to China. 
</P>
<P>
	April 1996:  
</P>
<P>
	Energy Department officials brief Sandy Berger, deputy national  
security adviser, on security lapses at weapons laboratory and 
espionage investigation at Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
	July 1997:  
</P>
<P>
	Berger is briefed again with more detailed information on the  
security problems. Berger says he briefed the president. 
</P>
<P>
	February 1998:  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issues a directive calling for tougher  
counterintelligence and security measures at the labs. 
</P>
<P>
	July 1998:  
</P>
<P>
	A special House committee begins investigating U.S. technology  
transfers to China, a probe that within months turns its focus on 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	November 1998:  
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department begins to make changes in security  
counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	March 8, 1999:  
</P>
<P>
	A Taiwan born scientist at Los Alamos, Wen Ho Lee, is fired for  
security violations. He had been under investigation since 1996 in 
connection with the 1980s theft of the W-88 warhead information. 
Lee has not been charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	March 19, 1999:  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton says he is unaware of ``any espionage which occurred by  
the Chinese against the labs during my presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	April 1999:  
</P>
<P>
	After learning that Lee had transferred top-secret nuclear  
computer codes to his unsecured computer, the Energy Department 
shuts down computer systems at all its weapons labs, because of 
possible espionage concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	May 11, 1999:  
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announces an overhaul of  
security and counterintelligence activities at the Energy 
Department, including creation of a ``security czar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	May 25, 1999:  
</P>
<P>
	The House select committee on Chinese technology transfers  
issues a 700-page report saying that China had obtained nuclear 
secrets about all U.S. warheads over a 20 year campaign of 
espionage.

<HEADLINE> Idaho Potato Farming Looking Better / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (AP) -- Potato farming is finally looking  
better in Idaho, partly because it's looking worse in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook for Idaho potato farmers and packers has improved  
dramatically since May 1, with prices reaching levels not seen 
since 1995, the last year before a devastating slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplies in other parts of the country, mainly Colorado and  
Wisconsin, have dwindled. Cool weather has delayed potato crops in 
California and the Pacific Northwest, which means better prices for 
Idaho farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've definitely seen a move,'' said Jalna Searle, marketing  
manager for GPOD, a Shelley potato-packing house. ``It's looking a 
lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For three years, prices to growers have failed to reach the  
break-even mark. To recover operating costs, farmers generally need 
between $4 and $5 for every 100 pounds of potatoes they sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the average price to growers was $5.18, said Bruce  
Huffaker of Idaho Falls, publisher of the North American Potato 
Market News. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has strengthened considerably over the past two or  
three weeks, and there is the potential for more,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Searle said she has heard of growers turning down offers of $7 a  
hundredweight. 
</P>
<P>
	A few factors have been driving prices up. Idaho's fall 1998  
crop had quality problems, which has made the large U.S. No. 1s 
harder to find. On May 1, 50-pound cartons containing 70 potatoes 
sold for $10. This week, cartons the same size were going for $3 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, frozen french fry processors have been coming to eastern  
Idaho because they cannot find enough potatoes in Washington state 
and western Idaho. Most years they ignore the upper Snake River 
area. But a cool, wet spring in Washington will delay the harvest 
there, and may affect quality as well. 
</P>
<P>
	California shippers near Bakersfield normally start harvesting  
russet potatoes at the end of May. But this year, because of the 
wet spring, it is more likely to be around June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reduces the competition in the marketplace,'' Huffaker  
said. Washington's harvest, which ordinarily starts around July 1, 
is likely to be two weeks later, and even then growers may have to 
sacrifice yield. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a danger in the long-awaited news of rising prices.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some people will just hang on too long,'' Huffaker said.  
``It's much easier to sell as the market is going up. There's going 
to be a downward swing. It will come, it's just a question of 
when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- The University of Arkansas is using  
its pull to help farmers get the most out of their crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the school are finding new ways to increase  
yields by investigating yield potential of new seeds. The 
university also is selecting wheat varieties that would avoid 
market discounts and diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, facing low wheat prices, the information comes just in  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were losing $30 an acre,'' said wheat producer Pat  
Sullivan. ``You need to make 50 to 60 bushels an acre to break 
even.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program is intended to teach wheat growers how to detect and  
fight against wheat diseases and low-yielding seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Disease-resistant varieties could control production costs by  
reducing the need for pesticides, said Robert Bacon, a university 
wheat breeder. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't need a fungicide, you save money,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Finding weaknesses in seeds will allow breeders throughout the  
state to develop wheat varieties that can resist diseases that are 
transmitted to wheat plants by a fungus that survives in the soil.

<HEADLINE> Will Clark Returns to O's Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles first baseman Will  
Clark, sidelined since fracturing his left thumb on April 18, was 
activated from the 15-day disabled list Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who played in 12 games before being injured, served as  
the Orioles' designated hitter Tuesday night in the opener of a 
three-game series against the Anaheim Angels. Jeff Conine played 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not 100 percent, but good enough to be back on the  
field,'' said Clark, who brought a .370 batting average with three 
homers and seven RBIs into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked when he thought he would be 100 percent, Clark  
replied, ``Probably by November, December, around there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who signed a two-year, free-agent contract with the  
Orioles last December after five years with the Texas Rangers, 
admitted spending over five weeks on the sidelines wasn't easy for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always tough when you're used to being an everyday  
player,'' he said. ``I've tried to keep myself busy by doing some 
stuff off the field and cheering on my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, 35, was injured in Toronto while fielding a sharp  
grounder hit by Willie Greene. Clark, who hit .305 with 23 homers 
and 102 RBIs for the Rangers last year, wore a protective brace on 
his left thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been swinging the bats real well, but anytime you can  
add a major league hitter who can hit right and left-handers, it 
makes a difference,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said. ``It makes 
your team better, it makes your bench better. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say he gets hurt a lot, he bounced off the bag when a  
guy hit a three-wood at him off the turf. That could happen to 
anybody. I'm surprised he got in front of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Clark on their roster, the Orioles designated  
infielder Willis Otanez for assignment. Otanez played in 29 games 
for Baltimore this year, hitting .213 with two homers and 11 RBIs.

<HEADLINE>  39 Miners Killed in E.Ukraine Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DONETSK, Ukraine (AP) -- Once again, Ukraine was in mourning  
Tuesday for victims of a coal mining disaster, a methane gas 
explosion that sent a fireball through an underground shaft, 
killing 39 workers and injuring dozens more. 
</P>
<P>
	The disaster was far from the worst in recent memory in Ukraine,  
location of the world's most dangerous coal mines. And President 
Leonid Kuchma noted Monday's blast occurred at a mine noted for its 
relatively high safety standards -- far better than most in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday, rescue teams had retrieved all the dead and injured  
from the shaft at the Zasiadko mine. They had to work quickly -- the 
Emergency Situations Ministry said the blast destroyed the mine's 
ventilation system and enough methane was trapped below that 
another explosion could occur at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	After emergency crews left, grim-faced workers remained,  
preparing small steel monuments at the mine's courtyard to decorate 
their comrades' graves. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 300 hryvna ($75) people have to die here,'' one worker  
said, referring to a mine worker's average monthly salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, doctors at special burn centers were treating some of  
the 48 injured. Some miners, with burns covering more than 50 
percent of their bodies, lay motionless, their blackened skin 
wrapped in bandages. 
</P>
<P>
	Volodymyr Gusak, the center's chief medic, said those  
hospitalized suffered from shock, burns of the upper respiratory 
tract and other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the blast unleashed a shock wave that was felt 1 1/2  
miles away, and temperatures at the site of the explosion, almost a 
mile underground, reached 2,190 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything burned. My hands burned when I covered my face with  
them,'' injured miner Semen Pavlenko said from his hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over a year ago, a methane blast at another mine in the  
Donetsk region killed 63 people. The methane blasts, along with 
frequent reports of miners dying alone or in pairs because of poor 
equipment or safety violations, have made Ukraine's coal industry 
the world's most dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zasiadko mine had been considered one of the country's  
safest and most profitable, said Kuchma, who will go to the blast 
site Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must be with the families and the workers of this mine,''  
Kuchma said, speaking in the capital, Kiev. ``Every death is 
painful for the family and the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ukrainian leader declared a day of national mourning  
Wednesday. Flags throughout Donetsk flew at half staff Tuesday, 
decorated with black ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine, once the pride of the Soviet Union for its huge coal  
mining industry, has 232 working mines. After the 1991 collapse of 
the Soviet Union, the government slashed subsidies to the coal 
industry and the death rate began to rise. The death toll was 283 
in 1997, 360 last year, and has reached 146 this year, according to 
industry figures.

	Clinton Vows To Block Spying  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, confronted by a bipartisan  
congressional conclusion that Chinese espionage has led to the 
theft of top-secret information about every U.S. nuclear weapon, 
said today he will put into place more than two dozen 
recommendations to safeguard America's nuclear secrets. A House 
committee catalogued 20 years of Chinese espionage and the panel's 
chairman, Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., said China's spying 
campaign is still going on. The report concluded that by stealing 
nuclear secrets, China's weapon designs soon will be on par with 
those of the United States.

	NYC Cop Guilty in Torture Case  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A white police officer accused of torturing a  
Haitian immigrant with a wooden stick in a stationhouse bathroom 
pleaded guilty today after the vaunted ``blue wall of silence'' 
came tumbling down around him. Justin Volpe, the central figure in 
an explosive brutality case that shocked the city and heightened 
racial tensions, pleaded guilty to civil rights charges three weeks 
into his trial. Volpe, 27, could be sent to prison for life.

	House GOP Supports Gun-Control Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Republican leadership announced  
today its support for gun control measures included in a juvenile 
crime bill passed by the Senate last week. Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Henry Hyde said he hoped to get the bill to the House 
floor by mid-June. House Speaker Dennis Hastert said the final 
product would require gun sellers to provide safety devices, 
background checks at gun shows and other gun control measures. Rep. 
Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said the bill would require states to punish 
juvenile offenders as a condition for receiving federal grants.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes attacked Slobodan  
Milosevic's villa and other targets across Yugoslavia today, and 
the military alliance approved a revised plan for an enlarged 
peacekeeping ground force of up to 50,000 in Kosovo as soon as Serb 
troops depart. A new wave of refugees -- as many as 150,000 -- were 
reported bound for Macedonia, and a U.N. report detailed in graphic 
fashion ``a significant upsurge'' in sexual violence against ethnic 
Albanian women in Kosovo since NATO airstrikes began two months 
ago.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth Starr won't retry Whitewater figure  
Susan McDougal or Julie Hiatt Steele, both of whom were accused of 
hindering his investigation of President Clinton, The Associated 
Press has learned. Both cases ended in mistrials this spring. The 
independent counsel's decision came after juries handed him 
consecutive setbacks in his effort to punish witnesses he contended 
were uncooperative or gave false testimony that delayed his 
investigation. Jurors deadlocked in both cases.

	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- One person was killed and 20 others  
injured when five tractor-trailers crashed into an overturned truck 
today on a smoke-shrouded highway where firefighters battled 
fast-spreading wildfires. About 20,000 acres of flaming sawgrass, 
brush and muck in the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area sent 
heavy smoke into South Florida skies for the fifth day. Authorities 
said the smoke likely contributed to the fatal crash on U.S. 27.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department approved Computer  
Associates International Inc.'s $3.5 billion purchase of smaller 
software rival, Platinum technology International, Inc., today 
after Computer Associates agreed to sell six Platinum products and 
related assets. Without the divestiture of the Platinum mainframe 
systems management software products, the government said, Computer 
Associates' dominance in a number of already concentrated software 
markets would have been significantly increased.

continued consumer optimism about the U.S. economy. At the close, 
the Dow industrials was down 123.58 at 10,531.09. Declining issues

	Baseball Fires Curve at ESPN  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The feud continues between ESPN and Major League  
Baseball, with MLB countersuing the cable network over three 
late-season games that conflict with NFL telecasts. ESPN sued MLB 
earlier this month after the sport terminated a regular-season 
contract with the cable network that was supposed to run through 
2002. MLB is claiming it should be paid damages because the cable 
television network broke its contract when it decided three 
football games would draw much higher ratings than three baseball 
games.

<HEADLINE> Miami Tops at College World Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- Miami was made the top-seeded team  
Monday and the Southeastern and Big 12 conferences each got six 
teams into the postseason as the NCAA expanded the playoff field 
leading to the College World Series to 64 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (41-13), which will play Bethune-Cookman in the first  
round of the double-elimination tournament, extended its record for 
postseason appearances to 27 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska, which got the Big 12's automatic bid Sunday by beating  
Baylor after upset conference tournament wins over Oklahoma State, 
Oklahoma and Texas A&AMP;M, is in the NCAA tournament for the first 
time since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cornhuskers (41-16) are on a nine-game winning streak.  
</P>
<P>
	No one has an easy ride to Omaha and the College World Series,  
Division I Baseball Committee Chairman Dick Rockwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pick your poison,'' Rockwell said of the committee's work  
over the weekend to pick the field. ``I guess we tried to get 
parity in the brackets. We tried not to sacrifice the integrity of 
the brackets geographically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each bracket could be tough, Rockwell said, though the most  
competitive could be at Baylor as it also includes Arizona and 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Controversial decisions by the committee included taking UCLA  
and its 30-29 record, North Carolina State over fellow ACC school 
Georgia Tech, and leaving out Missouri and Coastal Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spent more time with Coastal Carolina today than any school  
in my four years of being on the committee,'' Rockwell said. 
``Coastal Carolina would have been the 65th team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee put the most weight in its decision-making on the  
strength of non-conference schedules and play in conference 
tournaments, Rockwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas A&AMP;M, ranked second in the latest Baseball America poll,  
was seeded seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, top-ranked in the Baseball America poll, was seeded  
eighth. The Owls (52-11) beat TCU for their third straight WAC 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	The other seeded teams were No. 2 Florida State (48-12), No. 3  
Cal State-Fullerton (44-11), No. 4 Baylor (46-12), No. 5 Alabama 
(46-14) and No. 6 Stanford (43-13). 
</P>
<P>
	The home teams for the regionals are Miami, Florida State, Wake  
Forest, Ohio State, Notre Dame, Alabama, Auburn, LSU, Arkansas, 
Houston, Baylor, Texas A&AMP;M, Texas Tech, Wichita State, Southern Cal 
and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think it's going to generate so much more interest,''  
Rockwell said of expanding from 48 teams to 64. ``The coaches like 
it. ... College baseball over the last three or four years has 
gotten bigger and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regional play begins Friday. Survivors advance to a best-of-3  
super regionals beginning June 4 at campus sites to be announced. 
The final eight teams go to the World Series, which begins June 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Southern California (33-23), which beat  
Arizona State 21-14 last year in the championship game, plays 
Virginia Commonwealth in the first round. Arizona State was not 
selected this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama won the Southeastern Conference automatic bid with a 9-3  
victory over Arkansas on Sunday. Arkansas was given an at-large 
bid, along with Auburn, LSU, Mississippi and Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Nebraska from the Big 12 were Baylor, Oklahoma State,  
Texas, Texas A&AMP;M and Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	The expanded format allowed 14 of 29 conferences that play  
baseball to get multiple berths in the postseason, compared with 
nine leagues last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlantic Coast Conference got five teams into the tournament  
and the Pac-10 had four. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State is in the tournament for the 22nd straight year,  
while Oklahoma State will make its 19th consecutive appearance, 
Clemson and Missouri Valley Conference champion Wichita State their 
13th straight, LSU its 11th and Long Beach State its ninth.

<HEADLINE> WWII Survivors Sue German Drug Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Survivors of hideous Holocaust medical  
``experiments,'' some conducted by the infamous Dr. Joseph Mengele, 
are charging in lawsuits that German pharmaceutical companies 
participated in the tests and profited from their pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The survivors include twins who say that, a half-century later,  
they clearly remember Mengele, Auschwitz's ``Angel of Death,'' 
scrutinizing their naked, tortured bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The two federal class-action lawsuits filed here this month  
against Bayer AG, Hoechst AG and Schering AG are among the first in 
the nation linking German companies to Nazi medical experiments. A 
similar class-action lawsuit against Bayer was filed in Indiana in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	The three class-action lawsuits filed May 13 are the latest  
filings in a recent wave of litigation by survivors of Nazi death 
camps or slave labor factories aimed at European banks, insurance 
companies and industrial firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the Newark suits, one is filed on behalf of U.S. citizens,  
the other for citizens of other nations. Each seeks unspecified 
damages for survivors it estimates number in the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	They accuse the companies of providing toxic chemicals to the  
Nazis for the ``experiments.'' Company personnel supervised the 
work and used information from those experiments to market products 
sold during and after the war, the lawsuits said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering also participated in these experiments, but also  
supported experimental sterilization procedures on camp inmates, 
the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations stem from ``various documents that have become  
available for researching that were not available before,'' said 
Joseph D. Ament, a Chicago lawyer representing plaintiffs in the 
Newark cases. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the survivor lawsuits, many filed in U.S. District Court  
here, have been made possible by a 1991 international agreement 
settling German reparations to other nations, and thus allowing 
individuals to sue, said Burt Neuborne, a professor at New York 
University Law School who is among the lawyers pressing the Newark 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoechst issued a statement that did not address the medical  
experimentation claims, but cited the company's support of 
``various organizations and projects dedicated to preserving the 
memory of the atrocities of the Nazi regime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer spokesman Thomas Reinert in Leverkusen, Germany, said the  
company would not comment on the lawsuits at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering spokesman Gert Wlasich said the company would examine  
the claims before commenting.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-China Relations Likely To Sour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Already under heavy strain, U.S.-Chinese  
relations are likely to slide further after charges that Beijing 
stole America's nuclear-weapons secrets. There also could be 
substantial political fallout, with accusations of blame 
reverberating into next year's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	A 700-page report from a congressional committee Tuesday  
documented what even its top Democrat, Rep. Norm Dicks of 
Washington, acknowledged was ``one of the worst counterintelligence 
failures in the nation's history.'' The espionage stretched over 20 
years across Republican and Democratic administrations and probably 
continues today, the chairman of the panel, Rep. Christopher Cox, 
R-Calif., said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the another blow to a relationship already shaken by the  
U.S. bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade and allegations of 
illegal campaign contributions for President Clinton from Beijing. 
Each side has its own list of grievances. China bristles at 
pressure from the United States on human rights and trade and 
planning for a missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	The gulf has widened dramatically since Clinton toured China a  
year ago -- the first visit by an American president since the 1989 
Tiananmen Square crackdown -- and raised expectations for positive 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a perfect example where personal diplomacy got out  
ahead of reality,'' said Richard Haass, director of foreign policy 
studies at the Brookings Institution. ``This is another setback. It 
is a relationship that is deteriorating, and we've yet to come up 
with a formula that both sides can embrace for a relationship that 
is non adversarial and maybe even productive. This is a 
relationship that is yet to find a post Cold War footing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the frontrunner for the Republican  
presidential nomination, put aside his usual reluctance to speak on 
foreign policy matters and seized on the congressional report. He 
attacked the administration's ``failed policies toward China'' and 
urged a congressional investigation into ``what went wrong and 
why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, another GOP presidential hopeful, said the report  
confirms ``that the Clinton-Gore administration cares more for 
their political security than America's national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The China issue and the ways to deal with China are going to  
be the top foreign policy issues in the presidential campaign,'' 
said David Shambaugh, a China military expert at George Washington 
University. ``It's likely to be highly politicized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spying charge threatens prospects for congressional approval  
of China's membership in the World Trade Organization. Another 
casualty is U.S.-Chinese military relations, already frozen after 
the Belgrade bombing. Defense Secretary William Cohen dropped plans 
to visit China next month, in part because of heightened tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations also will cloud the debate next month over  
renewing normalized trade benefits for China -- although analysts 
expect the benefits will be approved, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last few years there has been sharp rhetoric but in  
fact, every time Congress has had to vote, it has voted by bigger 
margins to continue normal trade relations,'' said David Lampton, 
director of China studies at the Nixon Center and the Johns Hopkins 
School of Advanced International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only the American business community but the hundreds of  
thousands of Americans who owe their jobs to trade will leaven 
their anger with recognition we still have positive interests,'' 
Lampton said. 
</P>
<P>
	It should come as no surprise that China spied on the United  
States. Practically everybody does it, even our friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel, one of America's closest partners, stole enough national  
security documents and photographs from Washington in the 1980s via 
former Navy intelligence officer Jonathan Pollard to fill a room 10 
feet by 6 feet by 6 feet. For its part, the United States spies on 
allies and adversaries alike. 
</P>
<P>
	What is alarming about China's espionage is how successful it  
was in obtaining some of America's most closely guarded nuclear 
warhead secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A great deal of the excitement politically will be on who did  
what in either political party, in what regime or administration in 
our country,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats reject criticism that the Clinton administration  
failed to be alert to signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``This matter goes back to 1982,'' said Senate Minority Leader  
Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ``The Reagan administration did nothing. The 
Bush administration did nothing. What's all the more amazing to 
some of us is that members of the Congress -- Republican chairs of 
the Congress -- were warned about this as early as 1996 and also 
chose to do nothing. This administration is the first to do 
something.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Probes L.A. Police Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The FBI is investigating the police killing  
of a homeless, mentally ill woman who allegedly lunged at officers 
with a screwdriver. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began Monday at the request of Assistant U.S.  
Attorney Michael J. Gennaco, who said he wants to determine if the 
shooting involved civil rights violations or the use of excessive 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting also is under police review and the city's civilian  
Police Commission will ``take a hard look at this one,'' 
Commissioner T. Warren Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Laverne Mitchell, 54, was pushing a shopping cart  
Friday when two officers on bicycle patrol approached to ask if the 
cart was stolen. One officer fired a shot after she threatened him 
with a 13-inch screwdriver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	She died of a bullet wound to the chest, coroner's office  
spokesman Scott Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Community activists have questioned why the officer failed to  
use pepper spray or other nonlethal means to disarm the 5-foot-1, 
102-pound woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mitchell, whose last known address was Long Beach, had lived  
on the streets in the Hancock Park area for several years. Her son, 
Richard Mitchell of Long Beach, said Monday that his mother was 
college-educated and was a bank employee until she became mentally 
ill about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	She heard voices but refused to seek treatment, he said. He said

<HEADLINE> Boatman Convicted in Haitian Deaths one conviction in two deaths. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No pickup.  
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A boat captain was convicted  
Tuesday of his role in a smuggling operation in which 19 Haitians 
were forced to swim to shore, leading to the deaths of two by 
drowning. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury found Addison Joseph Hepburn, 45, guilty of one  
count of smuggling for profit resulting in the death of an alien 
and eight counts each of smuggling and smuggling for profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing guidelines call for a minimum mandatory three years  
in prison, and he could face up to life in prison. Sentencing was 
scheduled for Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 33 Haitians who paid $350 each to reach the United  
States via the Bahamas were abandoned in August 1998 on a sandbar 
100 yards offshore near Jupiter Inlet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen swam to shore, but two died struggling to make it.  
</P>
<P>
	Searchers pulled from the water the bodies of Anne Benette  
Dorsonne, 25, of Port-au-Prince, and Richard Presendieu. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors acquitted Hepburn in the death of Presendieu, whose body  
came ashore a day later and a mile north of the landing point. 
Prosecutors were unable to prove Presendieu was on the smuggling 
trip, said Randee Golder, Hepburn's attorney.

<HEADLINE>  Yeltsin Names New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin named a prominent liberal  
Tuesday to take charge of Russia's ravaged economy, apparently 
turning his back on the candidate proposed by his new prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin immediately moved to stanch  
speculation that he had lost his first round of Kremlin infighting. 
But Russian media took the appointment of Mikhail Zadornov as a 
slap at Stepashin. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin, vacationing in the southern resort town of Sochi,  
promoted Zadornov, who had been finance minister, to the more 
important position of first deputy prime minister in charge of the 
economy and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	He appointed Mikhail Kasyanov as finance minister. As first  
deputy finance minister, Kasyanov had been Russia's point man in 
efforts to persuade Western lenders to reschedule some of the 
country's massive Soviet-era debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin had wanted Zadornov to remain finance minister, and  
wanted his own protege, moderate lawmaker Alexander Zhukov, to 
become first deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhukov's candidacy was believed to have been opposed by Boris  
Berezovsky, a millionaire businessman who is said to hold 
extraordinary sway over Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Communists, who remain the most dominant force in parliament,  
criticized the Zadornov appointment as a victory for the widely 
despised Berezovsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is such an obviously dirty, under-the-carpet game that I do  
not want to say anything on this score,'' Communist Party leader 
Gennady Zyuganov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In the previous government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,  
the top economic official was a Communist. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin dismissed the notion that he had been pressured into  
accepting appointments he didn't want. 
</P>
<P>
	``We work as a single team, and we have discussed all the  
(Cabinet) candidacies over the weekend,'' he said. ``It would be 
untrue to say that somebody is pressuring somebody else in making 
appointments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Yeltsin has been accused of purposely creating  
rivalries in his Cabinets in order to strengthen his own grip on 
power. The resulting intrigues have weakened the government and 
contributed to the country's woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov, who favors a market-oriented economy, served as  
finance minister in three previous governments and has taken part 
in talks with the International Monetary Fund on crucial new loans 
needed to help pay off Russia's huge foreign debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov said Tuesday his promotion would help implement the  
agreements with the IMF. The IMF has made the new loans conditional 
on Russia's parliament passing a package of austerity bills to 
boost state revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills face heavy opposition from hard-liners in the  
parliament's lower house, the State Duma.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Begins Relocating Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- Citing possible attacks from nearby Serb  
forces, NATO began relocating 30,000 Kosovo refugees today from 
Albania's northern border to safer camps deeper inside the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of several recent incidents, U.N. spokesman Rupert  
Colville noted that two bullets fired from inside Kosovo struck the 
refugee reception center at the Albanian border Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to empty these camps as soon as possible for a  
whole variety of reasons. The most important is danger,'' said 
Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The relocation began with 204 refugees carrying meager  
belongings setting off in military trucks on a 24-hour road and 
rail journey to a U.S.-run camp in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hope is that once the momentum starts the numbers will  
increase,'' Colville said. ``We're strongly encouraging them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Departing families were reluctant to move farther from their  
homeland but volunteered to go because of the potential danger and 
hopes for better camp conditions in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going because of fear,'' said Zepe Kajtasi, 25, her  
eyes moist with tears as she boarded one of 10 military trucks for 
the 210-mile journey to Camp Hope. She and 12 members of her family 
fled Kosovo after Serbian forces torched their house in the town of 
Djakovica, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Helge Eriksen said plans called for moving up to  
1,000 refugees a day, which would clear the camps around Kukes 
within several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But this would leave some 70,000 Kosovo refugees still living  
with Albanian families or in informal encampments around this town 
of 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the UNHCR, more than 439,000 ethnic Albanians from  
Kosovo have sought shelter in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees were escorted today by Belgian, Dutch and Polish  
troops attached to NATO's 1,300-strong Task Force Romeo, charged 
with tackling refugee problems in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	They were to be trucked to Mjede in northern Albania and then  
taken by train to Fier, near which Camp Hope is located. The U.S. 
military built camp is being expanded to house up to 20,000 
refugees from a current capacity of 3,000, Eriksen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be a mistake to think the general refugee  
population is against moving just because there is a small vocal 
opposition,'' Colville said. ``We are not going to force anybody. 
We hope they will see the light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many refugees simply wish to remain as close to Kosovo as  
possible, guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army find the refugee 
concentration in the north a rich recruiting ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Although vastly outgunned and confined to small enclaves, the  
KLA continues to fight against Serb forces inside Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Colville cited the involvement of the KLA with the refugees  
around Kukes as one reason behind the southward move. Others were a 
shortage of water and the prospect of refugees enduring sub-zero 
temperatures in tents after the onset of winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want them here by winter,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The UNHCR plans to bring some of the relocated refugees back to  
Kukes to spread the word that camp conditions in the south are 
indeed superior. 
</P>
<P>
	For Ahmet Rama, a 40-year-old metallurgical engineer, it was  
just another move in a year of wandering inside Kosovo after he 
watched his home in Kosovska Mitrovica set afire by the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked for 15 years to build my house and the Serbs burned  
it down in five minutes,'' he said. Now, he and his 10-member 
family had only a few clothes, some blankets and food for the 
journey.

<HEADLINE> China Accused of Stealing Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, confronted by a bipartisan  
congressional conclusion that Chinese espionage has led to the 
theft of top-secret information about every U.S. nuclear weapon, 
said Tuesday he will put into place more than two dozen 
recommendations to safeguard America's nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	A special House committee catalogued 20 years of Chinese  
espionage and the panel's chairman, Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., 
said China's spying campaign almost surely continues ``to this very 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an appearance in Texas, Clinton said his administration was  
``moving aggressively to tighten security'' at nuclear laboratories 
and would work with Congress to follow the recommendations of the 
committee. But he also said the administration would continue 
dealing with China on a range of matters because that, too, was in 
the national interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a solemn obligation to protect such national security  
information,'' declared the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the most critical thefts were said to have occurred  
during previous administrations, the findings by the bipartisan 
special House committee brought demands by some Republican 
lawmakers for the resignation of Clinton's national security 
adviser and attorney general. There also were renewed questions 
about why Clinton did not move earlier to boost security at federal 
weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	While defending the president's response, Rep. Norman Dicks of  
Washington, the panel's ranking Democrat, said that Chinese 
penetration of nuclear weapons laboratories was ``a major 
counterintelligence failure ... one of the worst failures in the 
nation's history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three-volume report, covering more than 700 pages, concluded  
that by stealing nuclear secrets China had ``leaped in a handful of 
years from 1950s-era strategic nuclear capabilities'' to a position 
where its weapon designs soon will be ``on par with our own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dicks and another committee member, Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C.,  
characterized that conclusion as an overstatement based on ``worst 
case'' assumptions. They said China has yet to deploy any warhead 
from information believed to have been obtained in the 1980s, and 
the Chinese have only a few nuclear weapons compared with the 
thousands in the U.S. arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	China denied the allegations entirely, dismissing them as a  
``despicable attempt'' to shift attention from the NATO bombing of 
the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	China's ambassador to the United States, Li Zhaoxing, called the  
charges of spying ``a vicious slander'' on his country. ``Some of 
the politicians are still feeling nostalgia for the Cold War. ... 
They are looking for a new enemy,'' he said Tuesday evening on 
CNN's ``Larry King'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, whose committee of five Republicans and four Democrats  
began investigating China's acquisition of U.S. technology last 
July and by fall turned its focus to espionage, said the findings 
in Tuesday's unclassified report were based on facts set out in a 
longer classified version. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our committee did not engage in surmising, did not engage in  
opinion,'' Cox said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who has moved to boost  
security at the weapons labs, said ``we are fixing the problem'' 
and 30 of the 36 recommendations made by the Cox committee already 
have been accepted. The recommendations were sent to the White 
House in January before the report was declassified. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson called the panel's document ``a good solid report,''  
but said ``there's no evidence of wholesale loss of information.'' 
He disputed the conclusions regarding China's potential use of the 
stolen technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is not up to par with the United States on nuclear  
development. It is far behind us,'' said Richardson in an 
interview. ``There is no evidence that is changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even Democrats expressed concern.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm baffled at how this investigation has been handled,''  
Spratt said, referring to a case, still being investigated by the 
FBI, of the loss of design material from one of the country's most 
sophisticated warheads, the W-88, from the Los Alamos weapons lab 
in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	While that information was believed obtained by China in the  
1980s, the theft was not discovered until 1995 and then its impact 
was only slowly recognized, the congressional report said. Sandy 
Berger, the president's national security adviser, notified Clinton 
in mid-1997, prompting the president to direct an overhaul in 
security at the labs in February 1998. The first significant 
security improvements, however, were not put in place for nine 
months, after Richardson took over at the department. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, urged Berger's  
resignation, saying he had ``failed in his duty to the 
administration'' by not pursuing the security matter more 
aggressively. On Sunday, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., had urged 
Attorney General Janet Reno to resign because of FBI and Justice 
Department handling of China espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has full confidence in the attorney general and  
she is secure in her position,'' White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said Tuesday. Clinton previously has expressed full 
support for Berger. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Shelby's call for her resignation, Reno said  
Tuesday, ``We just respectfully disagree.'' She called the Cox 
report ``very constructive'' and said it offered ``some very 
important suggestions about what to do about espionage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another frequent White House critic, House Majority Whip Tom  
DeLay, R-Texas, asked whether Clinton and Vice President Al Gore 
``deliberately ignored the reality of Chinese spying and theft 
because they had ulterior economic and political motives'' -- an 
apparent reference to Democratic fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox declined to join such speculation and Dicks, when told of  
DeLay's remarks, said he believed ``the president acted as soon as 
he was briefed'' and that Berger ``acted properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Republican presidential hopeful Gov. George W. Bush  
said the report ``shines a glaring light on the current 
administration's failed policies toward China.'' Bush's father was 
either vice president or president during the years much of the 
espionage is said to have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	The House committee report, unanimously approved by the special  
panel in December, was held up because of disagreements with the 
administration over how much should be declassified. Finally, about 
70 percent was made public. 
</P>
<P>
	In this atmosphere, Congress will consider the future of  
U.S.-China trade and what additional measures should be taken to 
reduce the risk of espionage at the prestigious -- and up until now 
largely independent -- nuclear weapons labs at Los Alamos and Sandia 
in New Mexico and Lawrence Livermore in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine congressional committees are still looking into the  
espionage charges. On Tuesday, a Senate Appropriations subcommittee 
voted to boost spending for security and counterintelligence by $53 
million, a 40 percent increase.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Markets React to Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The optimism over Brazil's economic  
recovery was dampened Tuesday by allegations that President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso tried to influence the outcome of the $19 
billion privatization of the national phone company last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges, published in the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper,  
added to a spate of economic worries that sent the Sao Paulo Stock 
Exchange down nearly 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Folha published the transcripts of 46 illegally taped phone  
conversations. In one, Cardoso authorizes the use of his name to 
persuade a balky pension fund to take part in the bidding for 
federal telecommunications giant Telebras. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual tapes were played on radio and TV broadcasts.  
</P>
<P>
	Charges of government tampering with the bidding first emerged  
late last year and led to the resignation of former Communications 
Minister Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros and Andre Lara Resende, 
then president of Brazil's National Development Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretly recorded conversations apparently showed the two trying  
to benefit a consortium, although the group lost the bidding. The 
group Cardoso allegedly supported also lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The Presidential Palace issued a statement late in the afternoon  
calling the charges ``sensationalist and riddled with insinuations 
that don't correspond to the transcriptions of the illegally 
obtained information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate president Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, a Cardoso ally and  
one of the country's most powerful politicians, said: ``There's no 
involvement of the president whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Arthur Virgilio, the government leader in the Chamber of  
Deputies, said Cardoso's attitude was not ethically wrong because 
it was the government's job to encourage competition and raise the 
bids. Telebras was sold for 63 percent above the minimum bid, a 
price analysts considered surprisingly good. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandre Barros, a political analyst in Brasilia, the capital,  
said the scandal adds to a list of irregularities that have come 
dangerously close to Cardoso and his top aides. He cited recent 
cases of government officials flying to vacation resorts on Air 
Force planes, and congressional inquiries into irregularities in 
Brazilian banks and courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could further undermine his authority and popularity,  
which recession and unemployment have already weakened,'' said 
Barros.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers To Drop Race Profiling Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- Prosecutors are seeking to drop  
charges against 21 people arrested by two state troopers accused of 
singling out minority drivers for traffic stops and then lying 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Middlesex County prosecutor Lawrence West filed a motion Friday  
to dismiss charges against the black and Hispanic defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases involve arrests by State Police Troopers John Hogan  
and James Kenna on the New Jersey Turnpike. They were indicted last 
month on charges that they falsified records to hide their alleged 
practice of targeting minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days after misconduct charges against the troopers were  
made public, a state report concluded that the State Police target 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21 cases involve charges ranging from minor traffic and drug  
possession violations to attempted murder. The two troopers would 
have likely testified in the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would have no credibility to testify,'' said Chuck Davis,  
a spokesman for the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Robert Longhi scheduled a hearing on the  
motion for Wednesday. Defense attorneys said they expect the 
charges to be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want our clients' rights to a speedy trial  
jeopardized,'' said public defender Dale Jones, who is tracking the 
cases. ``This comes as welcome news to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department also has investigated racial  
profiling allegations against New Jersey's state police. Similar 
accusations have been made in Florida, Maryland, Connecticut and 
elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Bank Robber's Conviction Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTON, Pa. (AP) -- A federal judge has overturned the  
13-year-old conviction of a man sentenced to death row for killing 
three people during a bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William Yohn Jr. ruled Friday that  
court-appointed attorneys for Martin Appel were ineffective because 
they didn't aggressively try to prove him incompetent to represent 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Yohn ordered the state to act within 180 days or Appel could go  
free. 
</P>
<P>
	Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli called the  
decision an ``outrage,'' saying it ``underscores all that is wrong 
with the criminal justice system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the victims also were angered by the judge's  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not right,'' said Shad Confer, 18, whose grandmother  
was slain in the robbery. ``He killed people and he's getting away 
with it. What good is the justice system? He admitted to it and 
then he laughed about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appel, 40, pleaded guilty to robbing the First National Bank of  
Bath in East Allen Township of less than $3,000 on June 6, 1986, 
killing three and wounding two others. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that he had a delusional disorder in which he believed  
he worked for the CIA and had to eliminate ``moles'' or ``clones'' 
at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	After Appel, a former cab driver and prison guard, rejected  
legal help and asked to be executed, he was sentenced to death in 
August 1986. Co-defendant Stanley Hertzog was sentenced to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Yohn ruled that Appel's court-appointed attorneys at his  
competency hearing, Ellen Kraft and Lorenzo Crowe Jr., could have 
interviewed Appel's friends and gathered records to help determine 
his mental fitness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record is undisputed that they failed to do so,'' the  
judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft was unaware of the ruling when contacted for comment  
Monday. Crowe did not return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Morganelli described the judge's decision a ``stretching of  
the right to counsel.'' He pointed out that Appel had refused 
counsel, and two psychiatrists and a psychologist had determined he 
was competent to make the decision to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
	John Spirk Jr., who prosecuted the case in the 1980s, was  
surprised by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first thought when I heard it was for the victims and the  
families,'' said Spirk, now the solicitor for Northampton County. 
``After all these years, it has to be devastating for them. It's 
still a very open wound.''

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs Look for Improvement / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Dominik Hasek won't say if he will play in Game 2  
of the NHL's Eastern Conference finals tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	And nobody is predicting a return date for the Buffalo Sabres  
leading scorer, Miroslav Satan. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Toronto Maple Leafs don't care who's stopping pucks or  
who's shooting them for Buffalo. If the Leafs don't start playing 
better soon, they won't beat anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't prepare for what goaltender is in the net,'' Maple  
Leafs defenseman Bryan Berard said Monday after practice at the Air 
Canada Centre. ``Our game plan with Hasek or Dwayne Roloson is to 
get as many pucks at the net as possible and look for rebounds, 
screens or tips. We have to tighten up defensively. If we sharpen 
up defensively, we should be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs, in pursuit of their first Stanley Cup since 1967,  
will try to bounce back again after opening with a home loss for 
the third straight series. In both other cases, against 
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, they won the second game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're desperate now,'' Leafs center Steve Sullivan said. ``We  
have to win Game 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs were offered a gift when Hasek, the NHL's most  
valuable player the past two seasons, missed Game 1 Sunday with a 
groin injury. But turnovers and a shaky performance by goalie 
Curtis Joseph added up to a 5-4 loss for Toronto and home-ice 
advantage for Buffalo in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	With Hasek officially listed as day-to-day with a strained  
groin, Toronto probably will have another chance to test Roloson, a 
journeyman goalie obtained last July as a free agent after spending 
parts of two seasons with the Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek returned to Buffalo on Sunday night for tests, including a  
bone scan that showed no serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph is ready for another chance to stifle a Buffalo team that  
is still without Satan, who hasn't played since the first round 
when a teammate's shot struck and bruised his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto led the league in scoring during the regular season and  
started out Sunday's game by luring the tight-checking Sabres into 
a shootout. The strategy backfired for the Leafs, whose costly 
turnovers led to three Buffalo goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We scored four goals, and that should be enough to win, but we  
didn't play well defensively,'' Berard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get back to our game where we're strong defensively and  
still a threat offensively, then they'll have to set up the trap, 
and that will work to our advantage,'' Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Joseph allowed five goals on just 21 shots, nobody  
blamed him for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five goals did go in, and we're not pleased with that,''  
Joseph said. ``I don't think there were any softies. They made some 
good plays, but I didn't steal any out of the net, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If he thinks he played a bad game, he knows in his heart what  
he has to do in the next game,'' Leafs wing Steve Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph goes into tonight's game with a 2.05 goals-against  
average, which ranks him third among the four starting playoff 
goalies left in the playoffs. But he's only as good as his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to adjust in the last two series and play a much  
stronger defensive game,'' Thomas said. ``When you play good 
defense, it creates a lot of opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mats Sundin, who scored twice in Game 1 and has six goals and  
six assists in the playoffs for the Leafs, also stressed defense as 
the key. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defense gave us success in the first two rounds,'' Sundin  
said. ``A lack of it cost the game the other night.''

<HEADLINE>  NY Cop Pleads Guilty in Louima Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- His eyes red and voice cracking, a white police  
officer accused of torturing a Haitian immigrant with a wooden 
stick in a stationhouse bathroom pleaded guilty Tuesday after the 
``blue wall of silence'' came tumbling down around him. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Volpe, the central figure in an explosive brutality case  
that shocked the city and heightened racial tensions, pleaded 
guilty to civil rights charges three weeks into his trial. Four 
other white officers remain on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, could be sent to prison for life. No sentencing date  
was set. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer told U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson that he  
rammed a stick into the rectum of a handcuffed Abner Louima. He 
also pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for threatening 
Louima if he ever told anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe said he acted in a fit of rage because he mistakenly  
believed Louima had punched him while police tried to quell a brawl 
outside a nightclub in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe reluctantly admitted his role only after four fellow  
officers testified that he had borrowed gloves he later returned 
covered with blood and that he showed off the stick and boasted, 
``I took a man down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After showing little or no emotion throughout the trial, Volpe  
appeared to wipe away tears Tuesday in the packed courtroom. His 
voice barely rose above a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your honor, if I could just let the record reflect I'm sorry  
for hurting my family,'' he said before being taken away by 
marshals. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours later, he was dismissed from the force.  
</P>
<P>
	The top charge against Volpe -- that he deprived Louima of his  
civil rights by sexually assaulting him -- carries a maximum 
sentence of life in prison without parole, although the judge can 
impose a lesser term. Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, said he 
expects Volpe to get 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea threatened to complicate the case against the remaining  
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Charles Schwarz is accused of holding down Louima, a  
32-year-old security guard, in the bathroom assault. Schwarz and 
Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder also are charged with 
beating Louima on the way to the police station after his arrest on 
charges he punched Volpe. Sgt. Michael Bellomo, their supervisor, 
is charged with covering up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe said another officer was present during the attack in the  
bathroom. When pressed by the judge, he said the other officer did 
not hit Louima but ``saw what was going on and did nothing to stop 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was understood from the circumstances that the police  
officer would do nothing to stop me or report it to anyone,'' Volpe 
said. Volpe did not name the officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Wednesday. The judge is expected to read a  
statement to the jury noting Volpe's absence, but it was unclear 
whether he would reveal Volpe had pleaded guilty. The jury is not 
sequestered. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellomo's lawyer, John Patten, said he will ask for a mistrial  
because Volpe's absence could heighten jurors' suspicions about 
remaining defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements, Kornberg suggested that Louima's injuries  
had come from homosexual intercourse before he was arrested, and 
that Louima, who moved to the United States eight years ago, lied 
about the assault so he could win a $150 million lawsuit against 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, the son of a retired detective, decided to plead guilty  
as charged after hearing the damning testimony of the other 
officers. Prosecutors refused a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	``There came a point in time where the evidence became  
overwhelming,'' Kornberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case touched off demonstrations against police brutality and  
raised tensions between the Police Department and the black 
community. But the trial saw the shattering of the ``blue wall of 
silence'' -- the solidarity that keeps police officers from 
testifying against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The first officer to breach the wall was Detective Eric  
Turetzky, who testified about seeing a disheveled and sullen Volpe 
``swinging the stick around like a sword and hitting it against the 
wall'' around the time of the bathroom assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Next came Officer Mark Schofield, who testified that Volpe  
borrowed a pair of black leather gloves and returned them covered 
with blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, one of two surprise witnesses, Sgt. Kenneth Wernick,  
testified Volpe bragged about brutalizing Louima with the stick. 
</P>
<P>
	And Officer Michael Schoer testified Volpe put the end of an  
excrement-soiled stick -- believed to be a broken broom handle -- in 
his face.

<HEADLINE>  Gandhi Withdraws Party Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Hundreds of Congress party delegates  
filled a sports stadium in New Delhi today to hear a speech by 
Sonia Gandhi, who has withdrawn her resignation as the party's 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian-born Mrs. Gandhi, the widow of a former prime  
minister and heiress to India's strongest political dynasty, 
answered internal criticism that a foreign-born politician should 
not lead India's oldest political party in fall general elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``India accepted me 31 years ago, the day I came here as Indira  
Gandhi's daughter-in-law,'' she told the 1,400 delegates to the 
party's decision making body, referring to the former prime 
minister. ``I got married here, became mother here and became a 
widow here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi said she is not seeking power and that her party  
will decide if she should become prime minister. The delegates 
later adopted a resolution saying Mrs. Gandhi's Italian background 
was a non-issue in the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of party workers jammed the streets surrounding the  
stadium, prompting police to delay her arrival by several hours 
because of security risks. ``Hail Sonia Gandhi!'' the crowd chanted 
in Hindi. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally comes the same day as local newspapers reported that  
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a Sri Lankan rebel group, 
were plotting to assassinate her. In 1991, the group killed her 
husband, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and they still fear 
she will crack down on their supporters in southern India. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hindu, a respected English-language daily, reported today  
that Tiger guerilla have rehearsed a car bomb attack in northern 
India. The guerrillas reportedly want to stage the attack in a 
northern state to deflect suspicion away from the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government recently alerted state police chiefs  
about a secret meeting the Tigers held in South Africa in April 
during which they discussed assassinating Mrs. Gandhi with a car 
bomb, the paper quoted unnamed sources as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian intelligence agencies reportedly learned of the threats a  
few weeks ago and immediately asked Mrs. Gandhi to take extra 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi is among the most protected persons in India. She is  
surrounded by 48 commandoes at all times and 250 policemen set up 
three cordons around her wherever she goes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every drop of my blood belongs to this country,'' Mrs. Gandhi  
said, reading out her speech today in halting Hindi and English. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congress party was thrown into controversy last week when  
three of the party's leaders questioned Mrs. Gandhi's Italian 
ancestry and lack of political experience. A week ago, she resigned 
from the party's leadership in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissenters were later expelled and pledged to set up their  
own party to run in the September elections called after the 
collapse of India's minority government last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of workers besieged her fortress-like house in New  
Delhi to urge her to withdraw her resignation letter. Opposition 
parties called the resignation a sham, aimed at drumming up 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	The elections are mainly a battle between the Congress and the  
Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which lost power in 
April.

in Hindi. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally comes the same day as local newspapers reported that  
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a Sri Lankan rebel group, 
were plotting to assassinate her. In 1991, the group killed her 
husband, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and they still fear 
she will crack down on their supporters in southern India. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hindu, a respected English-language daily, reported today  
that Tiger guerilla have rehearsed a car bomb attack in northern 
India. The guerrillas reportedly want to stage the attack in a 
northern state to deflect suspicion away from the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government recently alerted state police chiefs  
about a secret meeting the Tigers held in South Africa in April 
during which they discussed assassinating Mrs. Gandhi with a car 
bomb, the paper quoted unnamed sources as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian intelligence agencies reportedly learned of the threats a  
few weeks ago and immediately asked Mrs. Gandhi to take extra 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi is among the most protected persons in India. She is  
surrounded by 48 commandoes at all times and 250 policemen set up 
three cordons around her wherever she goes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every drop of my blood belongs to this country,'' Mrs. Gandhi  
said, reading out her speech today in halting Hindi and English. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congress party was thrown into controversy last week when  
three of the party's leaders questioned Mrs. Gandhi's Italian 
ancestry and lack of political experience. A week ago, she resigned 
from the party's leadership in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissenters were later expelled and pledged to set up their  
own party to run in the September elections called after the 
collapse of India's minority government last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of workers besieged her fortress-like house in New  
Delhi to urge her to withdraw her resignation letter. Opposition 
parties called the resignation a sham, aimed at drumming up 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	The elections are mainly a battle between the Congress and the  
Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which lost power in 
April.

<HEADLINE> `East Is East' Short on Substance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The greasy aroma of fish and chips greets  
theatergoers at Manhattan Theater Club these days, getting them in 
the right mood for ``East Is East,'' Ayub Khan-Din's obvious yet 
atmospheric generational comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``East Is East,'' a joint venture between two off-Broadway  
companies (MTC and the New Group), is heavy on atmosphere, 
especially in the way it portrays its tale of immigrant life in a 
working-class English town in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Substance is another thing. Khan-Din's plot tends to mimic the  
sitcoms that forever seem to be on the family's telly, although the 
story delivers a few twists that would never get by the TV censors 
of nearly 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriarch George Khan, born in Pakistan, runs a small  
fish-and-chip shop. Six of his seven children help out, doing their 
jobs with varying degrees of resentment. His harassed, hardworking 
wife, Ella, is English. 
</P>
<P>
	Their Anglo-Pakistani children are caught between the two worlds  
-- and always trying to figure out where and how they belong. This 
clash of cultures forms the heart of ``East Is East,'' most of the 
battles centering on arranged marriages made by the father for two 
of his sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Khan-Din takes a while to sort out these youngsters, and even  
then, they are given only the sketchiest of character development. 
A lot of attention is paid to 12-year-old Sajit, who, his father 
discovers, has never been circumcised. 
</P>
<P>
	Sajit is a strange boy, given to hiding in the coal shed and  
refusing to take off a favorite hooded coat, a garment in serious 
need of a good washing. His eccentricities are mined for a lot of 
jokes, most of them quite funny. 
</P>
<P>
	The other children are not as lovingly developed -- or  
particularly well acted. They are plot devices rather than people. 
The playwright has more luck with the mother, played with 
considerable spirit by Jenny Sterlin. She is the play's weary 
heroine, battling not only the obtuseness of her husband but the 
prejudices of English society. 
</P>
<P>
	As the tyrannical father, Edward A. Hajj blusters effectively.  
He has a harder time managing the play's quieter moments. One would 
have liked to see more of the couple's relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Scott Elliott, who runs the New Group, displays a sure  
hand with the play's frequent histrionics. The fights are staged at 
full throttle. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of atmosphere, he gets considerable help from a strong  
production team. Designer Derek McLane's settings -- including the 
family's fish-and-chip shop -- are models of realism. He manages to 
transform the family's flat into an homage to 1970s bad taste. It 
exudes a lived-in feeling that manages to be theatrical as well. 
</P>
<P>
	If ``East Is East'' sometimes borders on the cartoonish, it  
still pulsates with life. The play, a hit in England, has been made 
into a movie. Its broad strokes should work better on the big 
screen, or maybe, come to think of it, as a television series, 
where all those siblings would have a chance to shine.

<HEADLINE>  MSG Chief Apologizes to Van Gundy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy will remain in limbo for the  
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach of the New York Knicks met with the president of  
Madison Square Garden on Monday and received an apology for being 
lied to about the team's meeting with former Bulls coach Phil 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	But rather than put the issue completely to rest by assuring  
everyone that Van Gundy would remain as coach next season, team 
president Dave Checketts said no decisions will be made until the 
season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to make an evaluation on somebody or a judgment  
on what should happen in the organization based on one series, one 
shot or one win,'' Checketts said. ``He (Van Gundy) has agreed to 
that and he's comfortable with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy, however, was clearly uncomfortable with discussing  
the subject after the Knicks defeated the Atlanta Hawks 79-66 for a 
4-0 sweep of their second-round series. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not every day, after all, that one's boss comes into an  
underling's office and says he's sorry for lying to your face. 
</P>
<P>
	``He explained himself to me and I listened,'' Van Gundy said.  
``It's a non-issue to me. The only thing I was worried about was 
getting one more win, and now all I'm concerned with is trying to 
get back to the finals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the better part of the day Sunday, Checketts denied having  
any contact with Jackson despite two newspaper reports saying they 
sat down together to gauge Jackson's interest in the job. 
</P>
<P>
	But late in the afternoon, while Game 3 was still being played,  
Checketts confessed the truth. He was lambasted in Monday's papers 
as a shiftless corporate snake in a building of backstabbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret that I lied about it,'' Checketts said. ``We met for  
a couple of hours, and there were no offers exchanged. There was 
nothing that came out of the meeting other than getting acquainted 
with a guy who I felt was a tremendous option for us if we had not 
made the playoffs and needed a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, what I did is err on the side of protecting  
everyone. I had to do the job of finding out if I had an option 
like that,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, has been  
running the Knicks on a day-to-day basis since general manager 
Ernie Grunfeld was demoted in mid-April because of a rift between 
him and Van Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the unanswered questions surrounding the  
Checketts-Jackson meeting is who set it up. Checketts said he 
contacted Jackson through an intermediary, but he refused to say 
who it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Wyche, a spokesman for presidential candidate Bill Bradley,  
said the former Knicks forward was not the emissary.

<HEADLINE>  NY Cop Pleads Guilty in Louima Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- His eyes red and voice cracking, a white police  
officer accused of torturing a Haitian immigrant with a wooden 
stick in a stationhouse bathroom pleaded guilty Tuesday after the 
``blue wall of silence'' came tumbling down around him. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Volpe, the central figure in an explosive brutality case  
that shocked the city and heightened racial tensions, pleaded 
guilty to civil rights charges three weeks into his trial. Four 
other white officers remain on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, could be sent to prison for life. No sentencing date  
was set. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer told U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson that he  
rammed a stick into the rectum of a handcuffed Abner Louima. He 
also pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for threatening 
Louima if he ever told anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe said he acted in a fit of rage because he mistakenly  
believed Louima had punched him while police tried to quell a brawl 
outside a nightclub in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe reluctantly admitted his role only after four fellow  
officers testified that he had borrowed gloves he later returned 
covered with blood and that he showed off the stick and boasted, 
``I took a man down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After showing little or no emotion throughout the trial, Volpe  
appeared to wipe away tears Tuesday in the packed courtroom. His 
voice barely rose above a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your honor, if I could just let the record reflect I'm sorry  
for hurting my family,'' he said before being taken away by 
marshals. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours later, he was dismissed from the force.  
</P>
<P>
	The top charge against Volpe -- that he deprived Louima of his  
civil rights by sexually assaulting him -- carries a maximum 
sentence of life in prison without parole, although the judge can 
impose a lesser term. Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, said he 
expects Volpe to get 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea threatened to complicate the case against the remaining  
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Charles Schwarz is accused of holding down Louima, a  
32-year-old security guard, in the bathroom assault. Schwarz and 
Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder also are charged with 
beating Louima on the way to the police station after his arrest on 
charges he punched Volpe. Sgt. Michael Bellomo, their supervisor, 
is charged with covering up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe said another officer was present during the attack in the  
bathroom. When pressed by the judge, he said the other officer did 
not hit Louima but ``saw what was going on and did nothing to stop 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was understood from the circumstances that the police  
officer would do nothing to stop me or report it to anyone,'' Volpe 
said. Volpe did not name the officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Wednesday. The judge is expected to read a  
statement to the jury noting Volpe's absence, but it was unclear 
whether he would reveal Volpe had pleaded guilty. The jury is not 
sequestered. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellomo's lawyer, John Patten, said he will ask for a mistrial  
because Volpe's absence could heighten jurors' suspicions about 
remaining defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements, Kornberg suggested that Louima's injuries  
had come from homosexual intercourse before he was arrested, and 
that Louima, who moved to the United States eight years ago, lied 
about the assault so he could win a $150 million lawsuit against 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, the son of a retired detective, decided to plead guilty  
as charged after hearing the damning testimony of the other 
officers. Prosecutors refused a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	``There came a point in time where the evidence became  
overwhelming,'' Kornberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case touched off demonstrations against police brutality and  
raised tensions between the Police Department and the black 
community. But the trial saw the shattering of the ``blue wall of 
silence'' -- the solidarity that keeps police officers from 
testifying against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The first officer to breach the wall was Detective Eric  
Turetzky, who testified about seeing a disheveled and sullen Volpe 
``swinging the stick around like a sword and hitting it against the 
wall'' around the time of the bathroom assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Next came Officer Mark Schofield, who testified that Volpe  
borrowed a pair of black leather gloves and returned them covered 
with blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, one of two surprise witnesses, Sgt. Kenneth Wernick,  
testified Volpe bragged about brutalizing Louima with the stick. 
</P>
<P>
	And Officer Michael Schoer testified Volpe put the end of an  
excrement-soiled stick -- believed to be a broken broom handle -- in 
his face.

<HEADLINE> Was Mallory First To Climb Everest? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- A 10-member team of Americans and  
Europeans retracing the route taken by George Mallory and Andrew 
Irvine in their quest to become the first to scale Mt. Everest are 
divided over whether the two climbers made it to the top. 
</P>
<P>
	The team discovered Mallory's frozen body earlier this month, 75  
years after he and Irvine disappeared while climbing the 
29,028-foot mountain, the world's highest peak. Irvine's body has 
never been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation for years about whether the two made  
it to the summit of Mt. Everest and died on the way down -- 29 years 
before New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing 
Norgay successfully scaled the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-member team held a news conference Tuesday in Katmandu to  
describe how they discovered Mallory's body, his face frozen to the 
ground, and buried it under rocks on the mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
	However, they were divided over whether the two climbers ever  
made it to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they made it. ... The route was too long and too  
hard,'' said Eric Simonson of Ashford, Wash., who led the 
expedition retracing the route the two climbers followed in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
	But another team member, Andy Politz of Columbus, Ohio,  
disagreed. ``I still think they made it to the top,'' he said, 
without explaining why. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad Anker, 36, of Big Oakflag, Calif., who spotted the body  
on May 1, cited ``the length of time they were gone and the depth 
of difficulty'' of their route for his belief that Mallory and 
Irvine died on the way up rather than the way down. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, a Chinese climber, Wang Hongbao, described finding a  
body he thought was Irvine. It was lying near an ice ax with three 
notches on the handle, similar to the marks Irvine made on his 
equipment. Wang described the body as that of a ``dead Englishman'' 
dressed in old-fashioned clothes. Two days after relating the 
discovery, Wang died. 
</P>
<P>
	So when team members came across a body, ``at first we thought  
it was Irvine,'' Anker said. 
</P>
<P>
	But soon they realized they had found Mallory instead. ``We  
found George in a very different place'' from the spot Wang 
described, said Simonson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all had to sit down'' once the realization set in, said  
Politz. ``Never in my wildest dreams did I think that we would find 
George.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For several hours, team members looked for physical evidence,  
including the camera the two climbers were believed to have been 
carrying, which could yield information about whether they reached 
the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can conclusively say that there was no camera on Mallory.  
It is our intention to come back looking for Irvine and the camera 
since I think we can find it,'' said Simonson who is planning 
another expedition within the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The team brought back handwritten letters addressed to Mallory,  
goggles, an altimeter, a pocketknife and a piece of rope, and 
handed them over to the American Foundation for International 
Mountaineering Exploration and Research. 
</P>
<P>
	They also cut a piece of flesh from the arms of the body and  
sent it to England for forensic tests. The tests could take weeks 
to complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to remove the body, the team buried it under rocks.  
``George is buried. ... He can rest in peace,'' Simonson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has been criticized for selling photographs of  
Mallory's body to Newsweek magazine and newspapers in Britain, 
Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will donate all the money from the photographs to Himalayan  
charities. We are mountaineers and not treasure hunters. Nobody 
expected to get rich by this,'' Simonson said.

<HEADLINE> Immigrant Welfare Rules Clarified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moving to dissipate confusion in immigrant  
communities, the Clinton administration issued rules Tuesday 
clarifying which welfare programs legal immigrants can seek without 
fear of jeopardizing their immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
	The directives ``provide clear and consistent guidance that  
health care and other critical services cannot be used to deny 
individuals admission to the United States or to bar legal 
permanent resident status, or as a basis for deportation,'' the 
White House said in a statement issued as President Clinton and 
Vice President Al Gore visited the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrant advocates welcomed the action, saying that confusion  
has kept tens of thousands of noncitizens from applying for the 
taxpayer-funded health, nutrition and child care programs for which 
they or their family members are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased about the announcement ... because it  
addresses a major fear factor in U.S. immigrant communities 
today,'' said Cecilia Munoz, vice president of the National Council 
of La Raza. ``Today's announcement doesn't change the law in any 
way, but it clarifies it for the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enactment of sweeping federal welfare and immigration policy  
changes in 1996 didn't directly affect noncitizens' eligibility for 
the non-cash benefits in question, but prompted heightened fear 
that accessing the assistance could jeopardize immigrants' 
naturalization or result in deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a century, the United States has held that being a  
``public charge'' constitutes grounds for inadmissibility or, in 
very rare cases, deportation. But until now, there had been no 
definition of the term, and the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and the State Department had differing interpretations of 
what rises to the level of public charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules, drafted over an 18-month period, drew swift  
criticism from the chairman of the House Judiciary immigration 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans believe that immigration policy should bring people  
to our country who will work hard and contribute, but these rules 
will increase the number of immigrants on welfare who will be able 
to bring in more immigrants to go on welfare and are an insult to 
all Americans -- native-born and immigrant,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, 
R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrant advocates deplored Smith's view.  
</P>
<P>
	``Lamar Smith seems to be taking the position that it's okay to  
scare (immigrants) out of programs they are eligible for,'' said 
Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
	Research has suggested enrollment by eligible noncitizens in  
Medicaid and other safety-net programs is far lower than expected. 
Urban Institute researchers, in a study issued in March, found that 
welfare use by noncitizen households plummeted 35 percent between 
1994 and 1997 -- more than double the 15 percent dip posted by 
citizen households. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1996 and 1997, Medicaid enrollment among Asian  
immigrants fell by 38 percent, said Karen Narasaki, executive 
director of the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can really see the kind of fear that was running rampant  
in the community, endangering their health and also endangering 
their nutrition,'' she said.

<P>
	``Summerteeth'' (Reprise) -- Wilco  

</P>
<P>
	Wilco hasn't totally abandoned its roots, so to speak, but the  
Illinois band comes pretty close on its new album. The evolving 
sound may be more pop than its twangy background but that's no 
reason to discount ``Summerteeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What comes to mind first are the influences -- John Lennon  
(``We're Just Friends''), the Kinks (``A Shot in the Arm'') and the 
Grateful Dead (title track). Wilco obviously aims high and hits its 
mark on all but a few tracks with Jeff Tweedy's biting lyrics and 
lush, sparse arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off the sprawling, two-disc ``Being There'' and a  
collaboration with Billy Bragg, ``Summerteeth'' is a quiet gem.

	``Party Doll and Other Favorites'' (Columbia) -- Mary Chapin  
Carpenter 

</P>
<P>
	With ``Party Doll and Other Favorites,'' Mary Chapin Carpenter  
has done more than just throw together her chart toppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, there's ``Passionate Kisses'' and ``I Feel Lucky,'' but  
the crossover country star decided to dig deeper for a greatest 
hits album. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever You Are,'' one of two new songs, and several live  
acoustic recordings, are nice additions. But when assessing her 
entire career, some of her choices are downright puzzling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can't Take Love for Granted,'' from a 1995 David Letterman  
show, and ``Down at the Twist and Shout,'' from her performance 
with BeauSoleil at Super Bowl XXXI in New Orleans, are just 
ordinary. But she redeems herself with the album's closing title 
track, written by Mick Jagger, which may be a favorite some day.

	``Searching for Jimi Hendrix'' (The Right Stuff/EMI) -- Various  
Artists 

</P>
<P>
	Jimi Hendrix has gotten a lot of attention lately, what with a  
reissue of his three complete albums a couple of years ago that 
went along with a tribute record that included the likes of Eric 
Clapton, P.M. Dawn and The Cure. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a few exceptions, the artists on the previous cover  
album ``Stone Free'' played it safe, leaving the door open for this 
11-track disc that pleasantly surprises with its range of styles 
that include rap, gospel, Delta blues and jazz fusion. 
</P>
<P>
	A collection of both covers and tunes inspired by the  
left-handed guitar god, ``Searching'' mines new and fertile 
territory in Hendrix's music. Rapper Chuck D. turns Hendrix's 
legacy as a visionary into a challenge to the sameness of the 
current urban music scene on ``Free at the Edge of an Answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz trumpeter Mark Isham does a stunning imitation of Miles  
Davis (who once flirted with the idea of collaborating with Hendrix 
in the early 1970s) on his version of ``Stone Free'' that shows how 
flexible the music really is. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosanne Cash gives the usually straight-ahead rocker ``Manic  
Depression'' a much-needed emotional depth missing since Hendrix 
originally recorded it. 
</P>
<P>
	And even when someone does paint by the numbers, as Los Lobos  
does on ``Are You Experienced?'' the results stand up. Perhaps 
that's the biggest tribute to Hendrix of them all.

	``Topaz'' (Windham Hill Jazz) -- The Rippingtons  

</P>
<P>
	Pop-jazz artists struggle with the same compartmentalization  
that the rest of popular music has been cursed with for the last 
few years. Play it too soft and you're accused of being the next 
Kenny G -- all style and no substance. 
</P>
<P>
	But push the limits and you risk landing airplay on the ``smooth  
jazz'' radio stations that are popping up with increased frequency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rippingtons have long been able to walk that line. Led by  
guitarist Russ Freeman, the group has included Kenny G in the past. 
But on ``Topaz,'' they take the genre one step farther. 
</P>
<P>
	The record is a shimmering example of tuneful musicianship that  
has just the right amount of passion. It takes standard rhythms and 
wooden flute player Robert Tree Cody adds a touch of Native 
American influence. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening tune, ``Taos,'' sounds like an instrumental version  
of Seal's ``Crazy'' that has taken a trip through Mexico and the 
American Southwest -- thanks to Freeman's mastery on guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish/Native American influences become a bit tiresome  
after a while. But overall, Freeman and The Rippingtons have given 
``smooth jazz'' a much needed twist -- and some soul in the process.

<HEADLINE>  Celtics' Bill Russell To Be Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Bill Russell's No. 6 jersey will be retired for a  
second time Wednesday night by the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he's agreed to let the public be part of it.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, Russell wanted no public ceremony because he was bitter  
at what he perceived as racial prejudice 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 center was Boston's first black sports star, but  
he felt that because of his color, he never received the 
recognition he deserved for helping the Celtics to 11 NBA 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why he refused to allow a retirement ceremony in front of  
fans on March 12, 1972. Only about a dozen players and friends were 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that day, Russell was cheered loudly as he took his  
courtside seat as a broadcaster, but he refused to acknowledge 
their applause. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, the team will finally honor him publicly  
when it rededicates his No. 6 alongside those 11 NBA championship 
banners Russell helped win. 
</P>
<P>
	Some attributed the distance between Russell and Celtics fans to  
the inability of predominantly white Boston to accept a black man 
as a central sports hero. Russell's refusal to sign autographs for 
fans certainly didn't help his popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	In the community where Russell lived, the racism was not always  
so subtle. 
</P>
<P>
	When Russell tried to move from his home in the Boston suburb of  
Reading to a new home across town, neighbors filed a petition 
trying to block the move. When that failed, other neighbors banded 
together to try to purchase the home that Russell wanted to buy, 
said Tom Heinsohn, a close friend of Russell's who played with him 
from 1956 to 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, vandals broke into Russell's home and defecated on his  
bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinsohn said two white sports writers from Boston told him they  
wouldn't vote Russell the league's most valuable player because he 
was black. Heinsohn declined to identify the writers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was very much a part of the non-appreciation of Bill  
Russell as a player here,'' Heinsohn said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell's achievements during his days in Boston, from 1956 to  
1969, drew national acclaim, but never won locals fans' hearts the 
way later Boston sports heroes did, from hockey player Bobby Orr to 
baseball player Carl Yastrzemski to basketball player Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell's shot-blocking, defense and rebounding enabled his  
Celtics teams to play a wide-open style that led to 11 
championships in 13 years. But the Boston Garden averaged 8,406 
fans during Russell's playing career, thousands short of a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always sold out on the road, but rarely when we played at  
home,'' said Satch Sanders, who played with the Celtics from 1960 
to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Celtics teams led by Larry Bird in the 1980s  
sold out the 14,890-seat Garden for 662 straight games, from 1980 
to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's event at the FleetCenter was expected to draw  
celebrities and former players, including Bill Cosby, Aretha 
Franklin, Muhammad Ali, Julius Erving and Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds will go to national and state mentoring programs.  
Russell serves on the board of The National Mentoring Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales to the event were initially slow, but picked up enough to  
allow the promoters to start selling tickets in the top tier of the 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope people turn out,'' Heinsohn said. ``(Russell and the  
Celtics) showed that people could get along. The Celtics just kept 
winning championships, and color didn't matter.''

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The Williams sisters have picked their favorites to  
win the French Open: themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't be surprised if one of the Williams sisters decides it  
is red clay time,'' Serena writes in the sisters' newsletter, ``The 
Tennis Monthly Recap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter lists ``Serena J.'' as chief editor and ``Venus  
Ebony Star'' as chief writer. 
</P>
<P>
	Big sister Venus considers her chances of winning in an article  
called, ``The world according to Venus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, Venus will go into the French as a favorite and if  
the world turns according to the way Venus has planned, you can 
already guess who will be holding the 1999 French Open trophy,'' 
she writes. 
</P>
<P>
	Serena likes her own chances.  
</P>
<P>
	``At last year's French, Serena succumbed to the villain of  
inexperience, but don't expect Serena to fall into the same trap 
this year,'' she writes in an article called, ``Serena, Serena, 
Serena!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the men's tournament, the sisters are rooting for their  
favorite player, Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete can do it. But a small word of advice Pete: Play your  
game. We believe in you!'' Serena writes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras barely escaped elimination in the first round on  
Tuesday, beating 92nd-ranked Juan Antonio Marin of Costa Rica, 6-7 
(5-7), 6-4, 7-5, 6-7 (9-11), 6-4.

	 *GIDDYUP:* Tennis players who make a good impression on the  
Roland Garros crowds could go home on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
	PMU, the major French racing bookmaker, is giving away a race  
horse to the player tournament spectators vote as their favorite. 
The race horse is worth $49,000 but winners cannot just take the 
money. Not every player can house a racehorse in their backyard, so 
PMU will take care of everything for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could come across someone who isn't used to caring for a  
horse,'' said PMU spokesman Jean-Jacques Peyrouzelle. ``The horse 
will be fed, housed and trained for one year to ensure the proper 
care in the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the year is up, the player can sell the horse or keep  
paying for its upkeep and enter it in races.

two favorite teams,'' said Graf, who is bidding for her sixth 
French Open championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf admits to not giving the German team her undivided loyalty.  
</P>
<P>
	``Because my boyfriend always watches Schalke 04, I have become  
a follower of that team too,'' she said.

	Bayern plays England's Manchester United in Barcelona in the  
showpiece match of the European soccer season.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- The Honduran government is  
investigating whether military officers conspired to take control 
of the country and repeal constitutional reforms that weakened the 
power of the armed forces, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	National Defense Minister Edgardo Dumas told reporters ``the  
investigation will establish whether military personnel intended to 
recover the power they once held.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honduras returned to civilian rule in 1981, ending nearly two  
decades of military regimes that had been born from a series of 
coups against the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Congress eliminated the military's autonomy and the  
constitutional immunity enjoyed by commanders since 1957. Dumas, a 
lawyer, also became the third civilian in Honduras' 178-year 
history to lead the defense ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was sparked by media reports that high-ranking  
officers, allegedly led by Joint Chief of Staff Col. Eugenio 
Romero, were conspiring against Dumas. 
</P>
<P>
	Romero admitted meeting last week with opposition and governing  
party politicians to discuss the constitutional reforms but said 
``these conferences were not to recover ground lost by the armed 
forces to civilian rule.''

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A British man has been ordered to stand

foreigners, a court said Tuesday.

<P>
	Bruce Harris, director of the child aid group Casa Alianza, will  
be called to testify on his statements about Susana de Umana, the 
10th Court of Appeals said. 
</P>
<P>
	In news reports last year, Harris accused Umana of trafficking  
in children. Umana says Harris harmed her professional and personal 
reputation and challenged him to present evidence of his claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris was traveling in Costa Rica on Tuesday and could not be  
reached for comment, according to Arturo Echeverria, the national 
director of the U.S.-based Casa Alianza.

	PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- The headquarters of an Army battalion  
that fought in World War II and Vietnam was closed Tuesday as the 
United States continues its withdrawal from the Panama Canal Zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is a moment of closure, a moment of sadness, the time of  
a new beginning,'' said Lt. Col. Randall E. Tindall, commander of 
Battalion 245, headquartered at the Clayton Base. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is slowly transferring its facilities in the  
Canal Zone as it prepares for the Dec. 31 handover under treaties 
signed in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military's presence in Panama dates back to the canal's  
construction around the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Battalion 245 was created under a different name in 1940, and  
its soldiers fought in World War II and Vietnam. It also has helped 
drug-fighting and humanitarian efforts throughout Latin America.

	JALAPA, Mexico (AP) -- Mexico is advancing in the fight against  
drugs, the U.S. ambassador said Tuesday, a day after the outgoing 
head of the Drug Enforcement Administration said the country isn't 
doing enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have to be very clear. The work of the Mexican  
government has improved in recent years,'' Ambassador Jeffrey 
Davidow told reporters in the eastern state Veracruz, where he was 
meeting with Gov. Miguel Aleman. 
</P>
<P>
	DEA head Thomas Constantine, an outspoken critic of Mexico's  
anti-drug efforts, announced Monday he is resigning. He said that 
after 39 years in law enforcement and five years heading the DEA, 
it was time to pursue other options. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Constantine said  
Monday that ``traffickers have become infinitely more powerful in 
the last five years, and they are a major threat to citizens of the 
United States and the institutions of Mexico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post quoted him as saying that U.S. officials  
know who the top 20 or 25 Mexican drug dealers are ``but the 
Mexican law enforcement is so weak it seems unable even to find 
them, never mind arrest them or extradite him.''

<HEADLINE> Clintons To Begin Fla. Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton arrived in Florida on  
Tuesday for a five-day vacation with the first lady at a 7,500-acre 
conservation area inhabited by giraffes, cheetahs and white rhinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton were invited to White  
Oak Plantation in the backwoods of northern Florida as guests of 
the Howard Gilman Foundation, said White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	White Oak, located just across the St. Marys River from Georgia,  
is home to several rare species, including white rhinos and Florida 
panthers. The 14 houses spread across the property include log 
cabins, lodges and modern stucco dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his wife were traveling without daughter Chelsea,  
who is still in school at Stanford University. The president's 
Labrador, Buddy, did make the journey aboard Air Force One. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning up a dirt road leading to the plantation, the president,  
still dressed in a suit, halted the bronze presidential Suburban he 
was riding in to greet a dozen local residents in shorts and 
T-shirts waiting in front of a small house. 
</P>
<P>
	As he turned to leave, he noted an important member of his party  
was missing. ``Hey, where's Buddy?'' Clinton asked. Buddy, after a 
tense standoff with the well-wishers' fence-hopping bulldog, was 
sniffing out the new acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons had no plans to venture off White Oak's grounds.  
But that wasn't a sign that the golfer in chief was giving up his 
favorite pastime for animal watching: White Oak has a nine-hole 
course and a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
	The quiet time also gave Mrs. Clinton an opportunity to ponder  
her potential bid for the Senate seat being vacated by New York 
Democrat Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did say that she planned to spend some time thinking about  
this,'' said spokeswoman Marsha Berry. ``I think she's thinking 
about that stuff all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was to fly to Jacksonville, Fla., and make the short  
drive to Yulee after joining Vice President Al Gore in Edinburg, 
Texas, for Gore's annual empowerment zone conference. 
</P>
<P>
	At the conference, the president touted his work to steer  
investment toward distressed communities and announced formation of 
the Southwest Border Economic Development Initiative, an effort to 
better coordinate federal assistance to poor communities along the 
Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
	With Gore by his side on the turf of Gov. George W. Bush,  
considered the front-runner for the GOP nomination in 2000, Clinton 
urged state leaders to join him in combatting youth violence by 
placing more controls on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every state and every community must be involved in this  
effort,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons planned to stay in Yulee until late Sunday, so they  
can participate in a conference at White Oak by the Democratic 
Leadership Council and its think tank, the Progressive Policy 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The secluded White Oak is located off an unmarked dirt road  
about 20 miles north of Jacksonville. The Clintons were staying at 
Roseland, a two-story, cedar paneled, five-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
	Roseland offered a view of a white rhino's lair, part of a  
wildlife preserve and breeding center established by Gilman in 1982 
on the site of his family home. More than 400 animals representing 
60 different species live on the plantation, which is staffed by 
more than 40 zoologists. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous guests have included Gore, Colin Powell, Mikhail  
Baryshnikov, John F. Kennedy Jr., Julia Roberts and Jessica Lange. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman, who died last year at 73, was chairman and chief  
executive officer of Gilman Paper Co. in nearby St. Marys, Ga.

<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- It's rust, not rest, that worries the  
Indiana Pacers, the only team without a loss through the first two 
rounds of the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-game sweep of Milwaukee in the first round and a  
four-game sweep of Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference 
semifinals took minimal toll on the Pacers physically. But it also 
meant a full week will have passed before they open the conference 
finals against New York.

	``I don't know if it hurts or helps. All I know is that it is  
for all the marbles to go to the championship, to have the 
opportunity to go to the finals and win this whole thing,'' Mark 
Jackson said after a brief shoot-around Tuesday. ``There's no time 
for any excuses now. We're excited about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks wrapped up a four-game sweep of Atlanta on Monday  
night, so they'll have almost as much time between games as the 
Pacers.

	``You get a little rusty,'' Indiana coach Larry Bird said. ``I  
had that happen to us in Boston before. We had eight or nine days 
and came out a little rusty. But New York's got a lot of time, too, 
so we'll get back to work tomorrow and try to practice as hard as 
we possibly can to prepare these guys and hopefully go into the 
first game on Sunday ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will be mental. I think it'll be physical,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers' last game was on Sunday, when they finished off the  
76ers in Philadelphia. They'll break up the practice routine this 
week with a scrimmage, open to the public, at Market Square Arena 
on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Miller called the week between games ``a double-edged  
sword.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes both ways,'' Miller said. ``It's great because we're  
going to be well prepared for New York, and vice versa, but on the 
other hand it's kind of good to be playing basketball games and 
getting banged and moved around. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want some of the rust to settle into your game at  
all, but I'm sure both teams will be ready come Sunday,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two games in the best-of-7 series will be at Indiana  
Sunday afternoon and Tuesday night. Games 3 and 4 will be in New 
York the following Saturday and Monday. If necessary, the remaining 
games will be in Indianapolis on June 9, in New York June 11 and 
back to Indy on June 13 for a Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers are working on a 12-game playoff winning streak at  
home, but in three previous trips to the conference finals -- 1994, 
1995 and 1998 -- they never had homecourt advantage and lost on the 
road each time in the seventh game. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Indiana earned the homecourt edge in the East after  
both Miami and Orlando lost in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't rely on homecourt advantage that much, but we feel  
very fortunate to have it so we want to take advantage of it,'' 
Bird said. ``We played a lot better at home, and we're playing 
awful well on the road. We lucked into homecourt advantage, and 
we're playing against a team that's played a lot better, but we've 
got to worry about ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks were seeded eighth in the East but took out Miami in  
five games and Atlanta in four. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing much better, with a lot more confidence thanks  
to an Atlanta team that looked like they could care less,'' Jackson 
said. ``But give the Knicks credit. They're playing better 
basketball, and it'll be a war of a series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana won two of three regular-season games against New York  
this year. The two teams have met in four previous playoff series, 
each winning twice.

	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- It's rust, not rest, that worries the  
Indiana Pacers, the only team without a loss through the first two 
rounds of the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-game sweep of Milwaukee in the first round and a  
four-game sweep of Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference 
semifinals took minimal toll on the Pacers physically. But it also 
meant a full week will have passed before they open the conference

<HEADLINE> Impact of 'Digital Divide' Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At this embryonic stage of the Internet's  
development, no one disputes figures showing minorities trailing 
whites in computer ownership, cyberaccess and Internet know-how. 
</P>
<P>
	But the impact of ``the digital divide'' is a matter of dispute  
between some Internet experts and civil rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, like B. Keith Fulton of the National Urban League, see the  
gap as a sign that minorities might find themselves relegated to 
second-class citizenship in cyberspace due to a lack of computer 
aptitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are talking about the new information age and heart of a  
new economy,'' said Fulton, director of technical programs and 
policy for the civil rights group. ``The ramifications are enormous 
in terms of jobs and where minorities will be in the new 
millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But E. David Ellington, a founder and president of one of the  
Internet's most popular black-directed sites, believes it's too 
early to fret over the paucity of blacks and Hispanics on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of how I see this issue being positioned in the  
media, of black folks being perceived as in need and not having the 
wherewithal to deal with the computer age,'' said Ellington, 
founder of a San Francisco company that runs the popular NetNoir 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are less than five years into the Internet age. Look at how  
minorities have embraced pager or telephone or cable technology,'' 
Ellington said. ``Black folks will embrace the technology of the 
Internet as soon as it becomes more relevant to our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government data illustrate the gap.  
</P>
<P>
	A Commerce Department report showed that whites are more than  
twice as likely to own home computers as blacks or Hispanics, and 
the racial disparity exists even among families earning more than 
$75,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Across all incomes, about 41 percent of white families own PCs,  
but about 19 percent of black and Hispanic families do. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, called ``Falling through the Net II,'' said about 76  
percent of white families with incomes over $75,000 own home 
computers, compared with 64 percent of black families at the same 
income level. 
</P>
<P>
	A third report is scheduled for release in June.  
</P>
<P>
	Most believe that owning a computer is just part of the fight to  
get minorities online. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem in the underserved community is not  
necessarily the hardware,'' said David Eisner, vice president for 
corporate relations for America Online, the world's largest 
Internet access and online service provider. ``We can put all the 
hardware in the world into a community, but until it's valued, it 
won't do well. The content has to be what people want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towards that end, Eisner said, AOL is working on bringing  
greater organization to the broad array of topics on Internet 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, Eisner said the Web site of the Benton  
Foundation, a nonprofit group devoted to public policy, children's 
issues, community activism and philanthropy, has useful information 
that could win a wide audience but isn't easily accessible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at ways to take that content and make it more  
easy to use,'' Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the AOL docket are plans to help colleges with large  
minority enrollments develop programs for students in mathematics, 
science and engineering, Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Urban League's Fulton said the key to getting more  
minorities on the World Wide Web is to tie greater Internet use to 
real life matters such as better-paying jobs or higher test scores 
for children. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are huge demands for workers with technical skills.  
Critical thinking skills are enhanced when children work with 
computers,'' Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The league became the first civil rights organization to  
broadcast a program live on the Internet with its Urban Technology 
Summit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based organization also plans to build 114  
technical education and access centers around the country by 2006. 
Some of the 65 centers now operating offer free classes ranging 
from personal computer assembly to using Microsoft and Window 
programs, Fulton said.

<HEADLINE> Arraignment Set for Strawberry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry, whose baseball career is  
on hold while he faces charges of drug possession and soliciting a 
prostitute, will be arraigned Wednesday in Hillsborough County 
Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder was arrested April 14 after  
police said he offered an undercover female officer $50 for sex. 
The eight-time All-Star also was charged with possessing .3 grams 
of cocaine found wrapped in a $20 bill inside his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Strawberry could face a maximum five-year prison  
sentence on the drug charge and up to 60 days in jail on the 
solicitation charge. 
</P>
<P>
	A published report last weekend said Strawberry will plead no  
contest in a deal that will spare him a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the New York Daily News said, Strawberry  
would be placed on probation and be required to remain in a drug 
treatment program and perform community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Ficarrotta, Strawberry's attorney, was out of town Tuesday  
and unavailable for comment. The Hillsborough County state 
attorney's office did not immediately return a phone call from The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days after his arrest, major league baseball placed  
Strawberry on administrative leave and barred him from 
participating in workouts or games with the Yankees or their farm 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who underwent colon cancer surgery last October, had  
been working at the Yankees' minor-league complex in Tampa in hopes 
of rejoining the team when he was arrested and released on $6,000 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	He told police that the cocaine found in his wallet, which had  
an estimated street value of $20, did not belong to him. And while 
he acknowledged discussing sex with the undercover officer, he 
insisted he was joking around and never intended to meet her at a 
nearby motel.

<HEADLINE> Censoring Sought for China Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Claiming a need for national secrecy, law  
enforcement and intelligence agencies in the Clinton administration 
initially sought to censor almost all of the first seven pages of a 
congressional report on Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on Capitol Hill blamed the proposal to obliterate  
pages of material on the Clinton White House. They circulated page 
after blacked-out page and a cover sheet titled: ``What the White 
House would let America know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans said a draft of the report's overview was sent  
two months ago to the White House, which sent it back with the 
blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said the  
criticism was unfair. ``We worked in a bipartisan fashion with the 
committee on all declassification,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the few points that remained in the draft after the  
proposed deletions: 
</P>
<P>
	--''A counterintelligence and security plan subsequently  
devised'' by the Energy Department ``in response to'' a 
presidential directive signed by Clinton ``is a step toward 
establishing sound counterintelligence practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''The Select Committee is concerned that the appropriate  
committees of the Congress were not adequately briefed on the 
extent of'' China's ``espionage program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House's role is ``to facilitate communication  
between'' the Cox committee, which released the report Tuesday, and 
the intelligence services, said the NSC's Leavy. Law enforcement 
and intelligence agencies are responsible for deciding what to 
reveal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House's view was always that the appropriate law  
enforcement and intelligence agencies should work with the 
committee to properly identify the areas that need to be protected 
because of national security interests,'' said Leavy. ``It was a 
process that was completed in record time, performed to provide the 
public with the most information possible. Any attempts to score 
political points over the declassification process undermines the 
bipartisan spirit with which the issue is being dealt with by the 
administration and the Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unnecessary partisanship on an issue that both parties  
should agree it is in the national interest to work together to 
address,'' added Leavy. 
</P>
<P>
	If the censored draft of the report had been allowed to stand,  
there would have been no language stating that China ``has stolen 
design information on the United States' most advanced 
thermonuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other language that would have been excised from the  
report: 
</P>
<P>
	--''The stolen information includes classified information on  
seven U.S. thermonuclear warheads, including every currently 
deployed thermonuclear warhead in the U.S. ballistic missile 
arsenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''The stolen information also includes classified design  
information for an enhanced radiation weapon commonly known as the 
`neutron bomb' which neither the United States, nor any other 
nation, has yet deployed.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Foreign Nurse Visa Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A fixed number of licensed, foreign nurses  
would be admitted to the United States to work in understaffed 
hospitals nationwide, mostly in poor inner-city and rural areas, 
under a bill the House passed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which advanced to the Senate by voice vote, would  
create a program similar to one that expired in the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program, which would expire four years after it is  
created, would authorize temporary work visas for up to 500 
qualified foreign nurses to enter the country each year to work in 
short-staffed hospitals for up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	They must be paid the same wages and work the same hours as U.S.  
nurses, according to the bill, which also includes safeguards to 
protect American jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals would be required to prove they have exhausted all  
efforts to recruit and retain domestic nurses before they turn to 
the visa program. 
</P>
<P>
	They also must meet certain criteria to participate. Hospitals  
must be located in an area experiencing a shortage of health care 
professionals, as designated by the Department of Health and Human 
Services; have at least 190 acute care beds; and have certain 
percentages of their patients on Medicare and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was sponsored by Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 441.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Move Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices moved higher  
early today on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors eyed the 
potential for heat damage to newly planted crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters were calling for a high-pressure ridge to begin  
forming in Midwest growing regions next week, which could choke off 
rainfall and place heat stress on young crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains were limited, however, as farmers continued to proceed  
with fieldwork. The pace of corn and soybean planting generally has 
matched or exceeded five-year averages. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also faced pressure from early harvesting of the  
winter wheat crop, where some farmers were reporting above-average 
yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.48 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.13 1/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1/2 cent to 
$1.18 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose 2 1/2 cents to $4.57 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and lean hog futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while pork bellies advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .23 cent to 63.12 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .47 cent to 74.85 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .75 cent to 54.15 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .75 
cent to 52.95 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> NATO Approves Plan for Kosovo Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO's top policy makers today approved  
a revised plan for an enlarged Kosovo ground force, envisaging it 
as a peacekeeping unit to help repatriate nearly 1 million 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new plan devised by the North Atlantic Council but not  
yet authorized by NATO generals, the estimated 50,000-strong force 
will be sent into Kosovo from Macedonia when Serb troops withdraw 
from the province. The United States is expected to supply the unit 
with 7,000-8,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The original plan, drawn up last year, called for a NATO-led  
international force of about 28,000 to implement a peace agreement 
between the Yugoslav government and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the failure of peace talks in France in March, the  
launch of the NATO air campaign and the forced exodus of most of 
the province's ethnic Albanians, that proposal has been overtaken 
by events. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new plan, the estimated 50,000-strong force will be  
sent into Kosovo from Macedonia as soon Serb troops withdraw from 
the province. The United States is expected to furnish the unit 
with 7,000-8,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``This force ... will speak softly, by which I mean that it will  
be friendly to everybody ... but it will have very sharp teeth as 
well as very big teeth if anybody should try to oppose it carrying 
out its mandate or to threaten its personnel,'' NATO spokesman 
Jamie Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO generals are expected to meet before the end of the month  
to assess the plan and detail the force's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance insists it has no intention of conducting a hostile  
entry into Kosovo and that ground troops will get involved only 
when the fighting has stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would imagine the bulk of the operational maneuver  
battalions that would constitute the force would come from the NATO 
countries,'' Shea said.

<HEADLINE> DEA Administrator Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration's most outspoken critic of  
Mexican drug corruption, Thomas Constantine, is resigning as Drug 
Enforcement Administration chief after five years in which he 
increased agent force by more than a third. 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine, 60, who once said there was no civilian law  
enforcement agency in Mexico he would trust with confidential 
information, informed Attorney General Janet Reno on Monday that he 
intends to leave July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got 39 years in law enforcement, including eight years as  
superintendent of the New York State Police and five years here,'' 
Constantine told The Associated Press in an interview. ``It's time 
to start thinking about other things I want to do in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine, who moved up the ranks from state trooper in New  
York, said he would ``probably end up teaching at one of the 
universities in New York and consulting in law enforcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five years is as long as any of the agency's previous  
administrators have served. Both Constantine and his aides said he 
was not leaving over any disputes or grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	His most controversial statements came two years ago in a  
congressional hearing on drug-financed corruption in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Just after Mexico's drug czar, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was  
himself charged with protecting a drug cartel, Constantine said, 
``At this time, there is no civilian law enforcement agency in 
Mexico with which we can share confidential information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he said that since then, DEA and the Justice  
Department have been trying to develop such units. ``Some are 
beginning to work,'' Constantine said, ``but the traffickers have 
become infinitely more powerful in the last five years and they are 
a major threat to citizens of the United States and the 
institutions of Mexico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I say what I think, and the policy-makers can take my advice  
or leave it,'' Constantine said. ``I would like to be proved wrong 
and see all leading organized crime figures in Mexico arrested this 
year, but that looks to be a very, very difficult objective to 
reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Constantine took over DEA in March 1994, the agency has  
added 1,200 agents for a total now of 4,550. He also revamped and 
computerized its intelligence operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Several weeks ago, Constantine achieved a longstanding agency  
goal when he opened a $29 million, separate training academy for 
its agents and the foreign, state and local police they also train. 
The new facility, which can house 250 trainees, is adjacent to the 
FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., where DEA trainees used to have to 
share space with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	He also revised the drug agency's standards for hiring, training  
and internal integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll miss the excitement of law enforcement, but I'm proud to  
have been part of a great profession of people who are 
underestimated in this country,'' Constantine said. ``If I didn't 
have a wife, six children and 11 grandchildren, I'd be willing to 
stay here until the ambulance came for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the nationwide drop in violent crime over the past six  
years, and pointed out that in New York City alone, murders 
declined from 2,252 in 1990 to 629 last year. Constantine, who 
stepped up DEA's work in joint task forces with local police, 
credited law enforcement for ``targeting violent drug gangs in New 
York and removing them.''

<HEADLINE> NASA: Universe 12 Billion Years Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A team of NASA astronomers says its  
measurements to pulsating stars suggest that the universe is about 
12 billion years old, somewhat younger than earlier estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	But other experts quickly said the NASA results are wrong and  
that, despite the agency's announcement Tuesday, the solution to a 
basic question in astronomy is still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of 27 astronomers funded by NASA and led by Wendy  
Freedman of the Carnegie Institute of Washington announced 
completion of an eight-year effort to measure the distance to 800 
special stars in order to calculate the speed at which all of the 
galaxies in the universe are moving apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Calculating that separation speed, called the Hubble constant,  
was a top priority of NASA's space telescope because the result is 
a critical factor in determining the age of the universe, Freedman 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Freedman said the Hubble constant was determined to an accuracy  
of 10 percent, and when this value is combined with other 
measurements, it gives an estimated age of the universe of about 12 
billion years. 
</P>
<P>
	This number could rise slightly, to perhaps 13.5 billion years,  
she said, if assumptions about the amount of matter in the universe 
change with further study. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's announcement was quickly denounced by Allan Sandage, a  
legendary astronomer and head of a Carnegie Observatories team in 
Pasadena, Calif., that has searched for the Hubble constant since 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``If NASA is giving the impression that the problem is solved,  
then we would dispute that,'' Sandage said in a telephone 
interview. ``They have announced a final number, and they are not 
correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers have been searching for the Hubble constant since  
1929, when astronomer Edwin Hubble first found that distant 
galaxies are moving away from the Earth faster than are nearby 
galaxies. Astronomers express the Hubble constant by measuring the 
acceleration rate for every 3.26 million light years in distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Calculations using ground telescopes have ranged up to 558, but  
Freedman said new measurements taken with the space telescope have 
refined the acceleration rate to 70 kilometers per second. This 
means that a galaxy is moving 160,000 miles per hour faster for 
every 3.3 light years it is away from the Earth. Freedman said her 
figure was accurate within 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandage said NASA's new number is still too high.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've said all along that the correct number is about 55,'' he  
said. This would give an age of the universe of 14 to 18 billion 
years, depending on what is assumed about the mass in the universe, 
Sandage said. 
</P>
<P>
	The expanding universe supports the Big Bang theory, the idea  
that the universe began when all matter was compressed into a 
single point that then exploded. The theory states that the 
universe has been expanding ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent studies have shown that the universe probably will expand  
forever. Some researchers also believe the expansion is speeding up 
due to a force that accelerates matter. Whether this force exists 
is still a matter of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Freedman said the age of the universe will finally be determined  
when other researchers have more precisely measured the mass and 
the effect of the mysterious force. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASA team reached its Hubble constant number by measuring  
the distance to a type of star, called a Cepheid, that pulsates at 
a known rate and strength. By measuring Cepheids in 18 galaxies out 
to 65 million light years, Freedman said, the team established the 
rate of expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandage said his team measured distances to nine star  
explosions, called supernovae, and then confirmed those distances 
with Cepheid measurements. He said this method is more accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams used the Hubble Space Telescope, which can study  
stellar detail that is unseen by ground telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the difference in numbers, Robert Kirshner of Harvard,  
head of a third team studying the Hubble constant, said astronomers 
are slowly moving toward agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to disagree by a factor of two,'' which was ``like  
arguing about having one foot or two,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A disagreement of 10 percent, said Kirshner, ``is like a  
difference of one toe, a pinkie.''

<HEADLINE> Four Die After Being Hit by Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- An Amtrak train struck and killed a  
woman and three children early today as they walked along the 
railroad track. A fourth child was critically injured in the 
accident, which left books and backpacks strewn on the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	A westbound train struck the woman and children about 2:20 a.m.,  
said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transit Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	One child, a boy about 9 years old, was in critical condition at  
Bridgeport Hospital. He had his left leg severed and suffered from 
multiple fractures and head trauma, hospital spokesman John 
Cappiello said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said it was unknown why the victims were on the tracks or  
even who they were. The children appeared to be between 3 and 12 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
	The train was bound from Boston to Newport News, Va., according  
to Kevin Regan, an Amtrak official at the scene. The train had been 
running late because of the weather. Regan said investigators do 
not know how fast the train was going, but normal speed on that 
stretch of track is 70 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A device on the train records how fast the train was going, when  
the engineer hit the brakes, when he hit the horn and how long it 
took the train to stop, according to Regan. 
</P>
<P>
	Backpacks and books were scattered by the impact, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The train engineer was emotionally shaken up by the by the  
accident and was taken to a hospital for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to know what those kids were doing out there at two  
o'clock in the morning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	George Okvat, deputy director for customer service of the  
Metro-North commuter rail line, said the 210 passengers remained on 
board the train for about three hours, then were transferred to a 
Metro-North train into New York City, about 50 miles to the 
southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor delays were expected along the train line, used by  
thousands of commuters.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Postpones Trip to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a further sign of strain in U.S.-China  
relations, Defense Secretary William Cohen has dropped plans to 
visit China next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably is not the easiest time to visit China,'' Cohen  
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday, alluding to heightened 
tensions over alleged Chinese espionage at U.S. nuclear weapons 
laboratories and Chinese outrage over the mistaken American bombing 
May 7 of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the Chinese Embassy bombing, Beijing informed the  
Clinton administration that it was suspending high-level military 
contacts at least through May. The first casualty was a planned 
visit to China in mid-May by Gen. Charles Krulak, the Marine Corps 
commandant. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, China refused to allow U.S. warships entry into Hong  
Kong harbor. It barred a scheduled May 21 port visit by an American 
submarine and ship, marking the first time since World War II that 
the U.S. Seventh Fleet has been denied access to the former British 
colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said China did not tell Cohen he was unwelcome, but the  
secretary decided on his own to postpone the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second time this year Cohen has put off a trip to  
China. In April, he cited the urgency of the NATO air campaign over 
Kosovo, then in an early stage. The trip was tentatively 
rescheduled for June, suggesting the Clinton administration had 
expected the air campaign to be over by then, or nearly so. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said Cohen hoped to reschedule a China trip but would be  
preoccupied with other matters in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now he feels that his place is here in Washington,  
devoting as much time as possible to running the U.S. participation 
in the air campaign in Kosovo, preparing for the peacekeeping 
force, et cetera,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions with China are a factor, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``China, as you know, has broken off military-to-military  
relations temporarily with the United States, and he feels that it 
may be better to go later,'' Bacon said. ``He remains, of course, 
steadfastly committed to engagement with China as a long-term 
policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The June trip was never officially announced, but Cohen told a  
congressional committee two weeks ago that he was planning to go. 
In his only trip to China as defense secretary, in January 1998, 
Cohen signed an agreement on maritime cooperation and also urged 
the Chinese to be more open about their military planning and 
strategies.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks To Expand Refugee Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- U.N. aid officials were negotiating with  
Macedonia's reluctant government today for permission to expand 
refugee camps in the country to cope with a surge of ethnic 
Albanians fleeing Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	About 22,000 refugees, many bringing stories of abuse by Serbs,  
have streamed into Macedonia in the past three days, said Ron 
Redmond, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. It 
is the biggest influx since early May. 
</P>
<P>
	Some reports Monday suggested that more than 150,000 people  
could flee Kosovo soon, but Redmond said it was impossible to tell 
how many were on the way. Aid officials have spoken of an apparent 
new push by Serbs to clear ethnic Albanians from the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond said the UNHCR special envoy to the Balkans, Dennis  
McNamara, was negotiating with the government to expand some 
existing camps and possibly open two more. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said two sites that could accommodate about 16,000 refugees had 
already been chosen in western Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond said the United Nations also hopes to boost the number  
of refugees sent on to other countries from about 1,700 a day to 
2,500 daily within the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic of 2.1 million people, now  
is the temporary home to nearly 247,000 refugees. The population of 
Macedonia is primarily Slavic, with ethnic Albanians making up 
about a third, and the government fears a possible demographic 
upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
	There currently are eight refugee camps in Macedonia holding  
about 96,000 people. The rest are staying mainly in private homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has at times sought to stanch the flow of  
refugees by closing the border. Aid officials were infuriated 
Monday after an abortive attempt by the government to bus several 
hundred new arrivals to Albania in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Albania is a willing host, few refugees in Macedonia want  
to go there. A spokesman at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva, Kris 
Janowski, said only about 200 had volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to be able to somehow continue walking this tightrope  
between keeping the Macedonian government on board and at the same 
time ensuring that whatever happens is voluntary,'' Janowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to keep the border open,'' he added. ``If that border  
becomes closed, then those desperate people will rot in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 8,800 people who arrived in Macedonia on Monday were  
from the Kosovo capital of Pristina. They described a broken city, 
where paramilitary police wearing black masks ruled streets emptied 
of the ethnic Albanian residents who once dominated a thriving 
society of shops and cafes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing attacks from nearby Serb forces, NATO began relocating  
30,000 refugees today from Albania's northern border to safer camps 
deeper inside the country.

<HEADLINE> Gore Ventures Into Bush Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINBURG, Texas (AP) -- Venturing into George W. Bush territory,  
Vice President Al Gore was ``very effective,'' but his boss was 
``masterful.'' That's the assessment of one who has worked with 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, son of a former New York  
governor famous for his oratorical power, was asked to explain why 
Gore received a more muted reception than President Clinton from 
the same audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is a masterful communicator. Of historic  
proportions,'' Cuomo said. ``I think the vice president is a very 
effective communicator. Different style from the president, but 
every person has their own style. It doesn't matter if it's 
different. It's whether or not it's effective. And I think there's 
no question that he was effective today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, en route to a Florida vacation, stopped by an  
empowerment zone conference that Gore was hosting, an annual event 
that also allowed Gore to test the political climate in Texas, a 
stronghold for its governor and Republican presidential candidate 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second joint Clinton-Gore appearance since Clinton  
told a reporter last week that Gore's campaign for the Democratic 
nomination was improving but Gore needed to loosen up a bit. Last 
Friday, the president and vice president were together at a gun 
legislation strategy meeting with Democratic lawmakers at the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's speech, Clinton praised Gore effusively, saying he  
responded enthusiastically to Clinton's request to lead the push 
for creating empowerment zones in poor communities. He also 
credited Gore with helping spark an economic rebirth in urban 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a challenge he embraced passionately,'' Clinton said.  
``I am profoundly grateful to him for proving that this is an idea 
whose time had come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the crowd cheered, Clinton then turned the podium over to  
Gore, who wasted no time in telling the crowd, ``I may be from 
Tennessee, but I feel right at home here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore announced $32 million in urban brownfields grants, and  
referred to Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream and his call for a 
``beloved community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past seven years, we've come closer to realizing that  
dream,'' Gore said. Referring to the dragging death of James Byrd 
Jr., he also said, ``As long as a man can be dragged to his death 
from the back of a truck just because of the color of his skin, the 
dream is not yet fulfilled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore's remarks lacked fire, and the audience didn't respond.  
At one point, Clinton propped his hand in his chin and listened 
intently, a serious expression on his face. At the end, he 
applauded Gore vigorously and worked the crowd with Gore afterward.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Campaign Free of Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Top politicians, driven by the need to  
demonstrate credibility and control, have been urging their ardent 
followers to abstain from violence in the campaign for the crucial 
June 7 parliamentary election. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, it's working.  
</P>
<P>
	With the campaign in its seventh day Tuesday, there has been  
little of the violence that many have predicted. The concerns had 
sparked beefed-up security and led many ethnic Chinese -- who were 
targeted in previous unrest -- and expatriates to flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Riot police have dispersed stone-throwing mobs with warning  
shots, but there have been few injuries. Media who swarmed to a 
rock-throwing incident Tuesday found only a dispute between two 
neighborhood gangs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before this, the world was a little bit pessimistic that the  
general election in Indonesia would go peacefully,'' National 
Election Commission Chairman Rudini said. ``Until now ... it has 
been good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The country has not remained entirely free of violence.  
</P>
<P>
	In North Sumatra on Tuesday at least 15 people were injured when  
police fired rubber bullets to disperse an anti-government protest 
by students and farmers, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,500 people took part in the demonstration in Tanjung  
Marawa, demanding dissolution of the ruling Golkar Party and the 
end of the military's role in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the troubled Indonesian province of Aceh, separatist  
rebels shot a physician and nurse to death Tuesday as they rode in 
a police truck to carry out post mortem examinations on the bodies 
of two men killed earlier this week by rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	But the level of violence related to the campaign is much lower  
than had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	One analyst said the frontrunners have told their supporters to  
exercise restraint because peaceful campaigning will boost their 
chances at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership of the contesting parties is aware that it has  
to have a successful general election,'' said Harry Tjan of 
Jakarta's Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``That's 
why they put in a very hard effort to calm down their followers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Tjan said the risk of rioting remained, for example, if an  
attack on a political party's office spilled over into looting of 
nearby shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulya Lubis, a member of the national Election Supervisory  
Committee, said Tuesday that Golkar will get a ``strong warning'' 
for allegedly offering to pay people to attend its rallies and 
allowing its guards to carry sharp weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Riot police fired warning shots Monday outside a Golkar branch  
office in Jakarta to disperse a crowd that claimed the party 
reneged on promises of free T-shirts and $6. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the 48 parties were allowed to hold rallies Tuesday. The  
green of the Muslim-based United Development Party, known as the 
PPP, dominated as about 10,000 supporters rode in long parades of 
overloaded trucks, buses and motorbikes along Jakarta's 
thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamzah Haz, who addressed one PPP rally, said he hopes the party  
will win in Jakarta, as it did in 1977 when it took more than 100 
seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Suharto, only three parties were permitted to field  
candidates. One is the PPP, which agreed last week to form a loose 
coalition with two other major opposition groups to ensure Golkar 
does not return to power. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a top Golkar official who has previously criticized  
President B.J. Habibie said the ruling party still could reconsider 
its nomination of him as its presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Marzuki Darusman was quoted in local newspapers Tuesday as  
saying a decision could depend on progress in a government probe 
into allegations that Suharto enriched himself during his 32-year 
autocratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie was Suharto's hand-picked successor and has been unable  
to shake his image as a loyalist friend. The next president will be 
chosen by a special assembly comprising the new Parliament and 
hand-picked government appointees. 
</P>
<P>
	Golkar is languishing in the opinion polls and has been the  
target of vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Golkar maintains its support remains healthy outside Jakarta, a  
sprawling and polluted metropolis of 11 million people.

<HEADLINE> Don King Joins N.C. College Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Boxing promoter Don King, who was given an  
honorary degree from Shaw University last year, has been named to 
the school's governing board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	King joined the private black college's 40-member board May 7,  
university spokeswoman Regina Boone said Monday. Last year, King 
gave Shaw a $200,000 donation and promised millions more for a Don 
King Fitness Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Trustees and alumni acknowledged King's controversial past but  
applauded his humanitarian efforts, said university president 
Talbert O. Shaw, who shares the school's name by coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it weren't for redemption, none of us would have a  
chance,'' Shaw said. ``King has a good heart, believe it or not, 
and he really wants to help young people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, King said he was honored by the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	King was convicted of murder, a charge later reduced to  
manslaughter; faced numerous lawsuits from boxers and their 
handlers; was acquitted on tax evasion charges in 1985; and was 
acquitted last year of insurance fraud in the second of two trials.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Story Flops in the Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In terms Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura can  
understand, his television story was body-slammed by Michael 
Landon, Cleopatra and Will Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, with the help of Landon and Susan Lucci's victory at the  
Daytime Emmy Awards on Friday, won last week's Nielsens prime-time 
ratings race over second-place NBC as the May ratings ``sweeps'' 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	For the broadcast networks, Sunday nights are often the most  
competitive sweeps month battlegrounds. Sunday is usually the most 
popular night for TV viewing and the time for the networks' 
high-profile movies and mini-series. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's Sunday movie, ``Michael Landon: The Father I Knew''  
narrowly beat ABC's critically-praised miniseries opener, 
``Cleopatra.'' Both were in the week's top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's showing of the Smith movie, ``Independence Day,'' came in  
third place Sunday night. But it was still the network's second 
most-watched program of the week behind ``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's TV movie on Ventura, the former pro wrestler and now  
Minnesota governor, was the big loser. It drew poor reviews and 
even worse ratings, a dismal 58th place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC can take some solace from the solid performance of its  
Thursday night lineup. The triumvirate of ``ER,'' ``Frasier'' and 
``Friends,'' in their season finales, was easily the week's three 
most-watched programs. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's telecast of the Daytime Emmy awards was Friday's most  
popular program. Soap star Lucci climaxed that broadcast by winning 
her first best actress award after 18 defeats. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 9.6 rating and 16 share, and NBC had a  
9.3 rating and 16 share. ABC was third at 7.3 and 12, while Fox had 
a 7.0 rating and 12 share. The WB had a 3.4 rating and 6 share, UPN

	China Rejects Allegations of Spying  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China today rejected allegations that it  
bolstered its nuclear arsenal by pilfering U.S. military secrets, 
saying Beijing has never stolen classified material from any 
foreign country. China's Foreign Ministry had no immediate reaction 
to the allegations contained in a U.S. congressional report to be 
released later today. But a Defense Ministry official noted that 
Chinese leaders have repeatedly denied allegations of nuclear 
thefts. The report by a select House committee on Chinese espionage 
chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox said China stole secrets about 
seven major warheads in the U.S. nuclear arsenal as well as the 
neutron bomb.

	NATO Campaign Enters Third Month  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO's bombing campaign entered its  
third month today with missiles striking the abandoned Serb police 
headquarters in downtown Belgrade. In western Kosovo, fierce 
fighting was reported between rebels and the Yugoslav army. 
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, was down to its last 8 percent of 
water reserves today because of damaged pumping stations and a 
power outage, Serbian media reported. NATO planes had targeted 
power plants over the weekend, cutting electricity to water 
services.

<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Rescuers have recovered the bodies at least  
39 miners killed in an underground gas explosion, Ukrainian 
officials said today. Another 48 workers were hospitalized with 
injuries from yesterday's blast, including two miners in grave 
condition, said a spokeswoman at the State Work Safety Committee in 
Donetsk, a coal-rich area in eastern Ukraine. The methane gas blast 
occurred at a depth of about 4,125 feet in the Zasiadko mine, one 
of the largest in the Donetsk region and one of a few profitable 
mines in the former Soviet republic.

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's new government will make the  
resumption of peace talks with Syria and the Palestinians a top 
priority but will not forge ahead at any price, a lawmaker close to 
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak said today. Labor party legislator 
Shlomo Ben-Ami spoke a day after Barak asked potential coalition 
partners to accept a 10-point plan that ruled out a withdrawal from 
all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and failed to mention peace 
talks with Syria and Lebanon. The plan forms the basis of coalition 
talks that entered their second day today. Barak has 45 days to 
form a government.

	Frays in Alliance Drawing Attention  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Frays in the alliance are drawing attention,  
with Germany bringing its dissenting views on ground troops to the 
Clinton administration. Today's visit of Foreign Minister Joschka 
Fischer is the first in a series by allied leaders in which 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will try to put the best face 
possible on NATO's degree of unity. Germany vehemently opposes any 
consideration of sending combat troops into the unresolved conflict 
-- an option the State Department said yesterday was open -- and is 
making a public point of errant targeting that embarrassed the 
allies and touched off a furor with China after its embassy in 
Belgrade was hit.

	Attorney: NYC Cop To Plead Guilty  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A police officer accused of torturing a prisoner  
in a Brooklyn stationhouse will change his plea to guilty, his 
lawyer told a U.S. judge. ``We would like to enter a plea,'' 
attorney Marvyn Kornberg, lawyer for Justin Volpe, said in a 
transcript. A source connected with the prosecution said there was 
no agreement with Volpe on a recommended sentence. The case against 
four remaining officers was expected to proceed. The five were 
accused of mistreating a black Haitian immigrant.

advantage of Lenny Harris' Colorado-record three errors to beat the 
Rockies 5-2 last night. The Astros beat Brian Bohanon to improve to

<HEADLINE> Ohio To Have Earlier Primary in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- In an effort to make Ohio more influential  
in presidential politics, the state Senate voted Tuesday to move 
next year's primary up two weeks, from March 21 to March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-12 vote, along party lines with Republicans prevailing,  
sends the bill back to the House for consideration of minor Senate 
changes. The House has already approved the date change. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats complained that the earlier date increased the  
chance of low voter turnout due to late-winter weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Gene Watts of Dublin, the Senate sponsor, disagreed. He  
said Ohio will join other states holding primaries that day, 
including California and New York, giving Ohio more clout in 
picking presidential nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am optimistic that this legislation will increase voter  
turnout,'' said Watts, a Republican. ``It's time for Ohio to adapt 
to this change in the political landscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dan Brady, a Cleveland Democrat, questioned the assumption  
that the presidential nominations will be wrapped up before March 
21. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any attempt to try to determine what the presidential primary  
is going to look like is futile,'' Brady said. ``We could see a 
climactic primary after March 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In non-presidential years, the Ohio primary is the first Tuesday  
after the first Monday in May.

<HEADLINE>  Report Accuses China of Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China has stolen classified information about  
every currently deployed nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal and it 
is ``exceptionally likely'' that Chinese spying continues to this 
day, the chairman of a congressional investigating committee said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., also said two U.S. defense  
companies ignored legal requirements and allowed China to obtain 
information critical to its ballistic missile program. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton responded by saying his administration was  
already ``moving aggressively to tighten security'' at America's 
nuclear laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a solemn obligation to protect such national security  
information and we have to do more to do it,'' the president told 
an audience in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to assure you and all the American people that I will  
work very hard with the Congress to protect our national security, 
to implement the recommendations (of the Cox committee) and to 
continue our policy of engagement because both of them are in the 
national interest,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox gave his assessment at a news conference after copies of the  
unclassified 700-page report were made public. He said the 
conclusions reached in the unanimous report were supported by 
additional volumes of classified factual material. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Norm Dicks of  
Washington, called the security losses ``one of the worse 
counterintelligence failures in the nation's history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Republican Rep. Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, a former Army  
counterintelligence officer, added, ``What is so gravely 
disappointing is the fact that we had the incompetence, laxity, 
naivete to let this happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dicks said security was already being improved. Dicks said he  
personally took the committee's findings to Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson last fall and urged him to fully implement 
recommendations from the FBI official now in charge of the 
department's counterintelligence program. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, said Dicks, the Department of Energy now has ``a  
credible counterintelligence program at our national labs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee report concludes that an ``insatiable appetite''  
for U.S. technology leaves China ready to leap from a 1950s nuclear 
weapons program to sophisticated designs ``on par with our own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A committee Democrat, Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina,  
questioned whether that conclusion went too far. He said some of 
the report's findings ``probably would have been left on the 
cutting-room floor'' if the committee had summoned top intelligence 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Dicks noted that the Chinese haven't deployed any warheads using  
the technology that they are alleged to have stolen. He also 
pointed out that China has about two dozen nuclear weapons compared 
to the thousands in the U.S. arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration called the committee document a  
``good solid report'' but also challenged some its conclusions 
about the impact of the technology losses on China's nuclear 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is not up to par with the United States on nuclear  
development. It is far behind us. There is no evidence that that is 
changing,'' Richardson said in an interview today. The energy 
secretary said ``the conclusion of wholesale loss'' is not 
supported. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the report at a Justice Department awards ceremony,  
Attorney General Janet Reno said, ``I think it presents 
constructive proposals for how to deal with espionage over the last 
several decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two U.S. satellite manufacturers, Loral Corp. and Hughes  
Electronics, provided China with valuable information to improve 
the reliability of missiles used to launch communications 
satellites. That same know-how passed on by the U.S. companies 
could be used to make China's nuclear missiles more reliable, the 
report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loral and Hughes showed the PRC (People's Republic of  
China)how to improve the design and reliability of the guidance 
system used in the PRC's newest Long March rocket,'' the report 
said. It said these activities went beyond the license authority 
given the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the espionage dated back to the 1970s and  
singled out as particularly damaging the loss of design material 
for one of America's most sophisticated warheads in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he has taken ``very dramatic steps'' to guard  
against theft of secrets by tightening computer security at weapons 
labs and that the report does not reflect counterintelligence and 
security improvements made this year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton  
received a classified version of the report Jan. 4. He said the 
administration doesn't agree with all of the report's analysis but 
``found most of the recommendations constructive, and we are in the 
process of implementing them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report describes a breadth of Chinese espionage that is so  
threatening to U.S. interests that some members of Congress have 
compared it to the theft of atomic bomb secrets by the Soviet Union 
in the 1940s. The fallout could have a profound impact on the 
operation of U.S. weapons labs and on U.S.-Chinese relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``These thefts of nuclear secrets from our national weapons  
laboratories enabled ... (China) to design, develop and 
successfully test modern strategic weapons sooner than would 
otherwise have been possible,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of stolen secrets and other technology gains,  
China ``has leaped, in a handful of years, from 1950s-era strategic 
nuclear capabilities to the more modern thermonuclear weapons 
designs'' that took the United States decades to achieve, says the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	China has all along denied conducting any espionage against the  
United States. China Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said in 
Beijing that the allegations were cooked up by people who want to 
slander China and declared that ``their despicable attempt is 
doomed to failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan committee began investigating technology  
transfers to China nearly a year ago. Last fall it refocused much 
of its attention to espionage at U.S. weapons labs. The committee 
and Clinton administration have been negotiating for several months 
on how much of the document to make public. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee of five Republicans and four Democrats found that  
the primary focus of Chinese espionage was the weapons research 
labs of Los Alamos and Sandia in New Mexico and Lawrence Livermore 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Information on a total of seven U.S. warheads, including two of  
America's most modern, is believed to have been obtained through 
Chinese espionage in the 1980s, although the losses were not 
discovered until the mid-1990s. The report also referred to the 
apparent theft of neutron bomb technology in 1995, but said details 
remained classified because the matter is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that in the late 1990s, China obtained  
``electromagnetic weapons technology'' that could be used to attack 
satellites and missiles, improved detection techniques that could 
be used against submarines, and ``research technology that if taken 
to successful conclusion could be used to attack U.S. satellites 
and submarines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of the report remains classified, including some  
details about the espionage investigation at the Los Alamos lab in 
New Mexico where a scientist was fired in March after being under 
suspicion of espionage for more than three years. He hasn't been 
charged.

<HEADLINE> NYSE May Extend Stock Trading Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors clamoring to trade stock in the  
after-work hours could have the chance as soon as this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the New York Stock Exchange said Monday that the  
Big Board may extend trading hours starting in July, giving 
investors more time to buy and sell stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE is not alone. The Nasdaq Stock Market will vote this  
week on a plan to create a second trading session from 5:30 p.m. to 
9 p.m. Eastern time. And Eclipse Trading Inc., a new trading 
company, plans to offer after-hours trading from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
by fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The New York Stock Exchange owes its customers the same level  
of service,'' said Richard Grasso, chairman and chief executive 
officer of the NYSE. The NYSE board will consider its options 
during its June 3 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept of expanded trading hours, while simple, has sparked  
a complex debate from Wall Street to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, many in different time zones, want more time to react  
to news. At Charles Schwab, the nation's largest online brokerage, 
for example, between 20 percent and 25 percent of its customers' 
orders are placed either before the market opens or after it 
closes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we have a large West Coast clientele, extending hours  
is something we have an interest in,'' said Marta Von Lowenfeldt, a 
spokeswoman for Charles Schwab, which is based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobbying against longer hours, however, are numerous small  
brokerage firms that don't have the resources to meet the demands 
of late night and early morning business. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Davidson, president of the Independent Broker-Dealer  
Association and a governor of the National Association of 
Securities Dealers, said he will vote against Nasdaq's second 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has canvassed small brokerage firms across the  
country, and ``I have yet to see one hand go up in favor of this,'' 
adding, ``I consider it to be an anti-small business measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Extended hours also would create a challenge for the financial  
media, which produce stock listings for their publications. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press, which provides stock tables for 900  
newspapers, is making preparations for a longer trading day but it 
has been unclear how the exchanges would report price information 
from late sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq's board of directors will vote on the measure Wednesday.  
If it passes, it will go before the 33-member board of governors 
for the National Association of Securities Dealers for a vote 
Thursday. If approved, the measure will be referred to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, however, has said repeatedly that stock exchanges 
should wait to make changes to their trading days until after Jan. 
1, to limit the impact of any computer problems associated with the 
year 2000. He also wants a smoother transition to the widespread 
use of decimal pricing of stocks, compared with the current 
reporting in fractions. 
</P>
<P>
	But pressure is mounting on Levitt and all of the traditional  
exchanges to wake up earlier and burn the midnight oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Alternative markets, like Eclipse Trading and Instinet, give  
investors and institutions a chance to trade when the markets are 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Eclipse Trading, which will cater to individual investors, was  
founded by Eugene Choe and Michael Satow, both former SEC 
enforcement lawyers. Satow, president of Eclipse Trading, said he 
worked on a lot of insider information cases, where people buy or 
sell a stock based on information that is not public. 
</P>
<P>
	While after-hours trading is legal, it has been largely the  
privilege of mutual funds, pension funds and other large 
institutions. ``Such a huge amount of news comes out after hours, 
and individuals, up until now, have largely been excluded from 
trading opportunities,'' Satow said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes To Exonerate Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate, trying to put to rest an old  
military controversy, voted narrowly today to exonerate two 
American military commanders accused of dereliction of duty in the 
1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	If agreed to by the House as part of the Defense Appropriations  
bill the action would reverses the findings of nine separate panels 
that looked into the matter over the past five decades. 
</P>
<P>
	On a 52 to 47 vote, the Senate voted to give posthumous  
promotions to Adm. Husband Kimmel and Gen. Walter Short, the two 
senior commanders of U.S. military forces in the Pacific at the 
time of the surprise attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were held responsible for what happened in Pearl Harbor.  
And that is not fair. And that is not just,'' said Sen. William 
Roth, R-Del., chief sponsor of the legislation to clear their 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted to restore the ranks they held prior to the  
attack: full admiral for Kimmel and lieutenant general for Short. 
Both had been reduced in rank -- Kimmel to rear admiral and Short to 
major general -- and retired under a cloud. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also expressed a ``sense of Congress'' that both  
officers had performed their duties ``competently and 
professionally'' and that the Japanese attacks were ``not a result 
of dereliction of duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote followed two days of divisive debate that split the  
ranks of the Senate's small band of World War II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who enlisted in the Navy in 1944 at age  
17 and was Navy secretary in the Nixon administration, opposed what 
he called the ``tombstone promotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no new evidence before the Senate,'' said Warner,  
noting that none of the nine inquires had recommended promotions 
for the two officers -- and that both Presidents Bush and Clinton 
had also turned down such requests from family members. 
</P>
<P>
	``If none of these reports exonerated these officers, then why  
should we now at this late date in history try to make a different 
finding?'' Warner asked. He expressed the view of the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	But joining forces with Roth, who fought in the Army in the war,  
was the Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. ,who told the Senate, ``It's 
never too late to correct an injustice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond, 96, a retired general in the Army Reserve who  
parachuted into Normandy on D-Day and later served as chairman of 
the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Kimmel and Short ``the 
two final victims of Pearl Harbor.''

<HEADLINE> British Airways Has Pre-Tax Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Airways PLC posted a pretax loss in the  
fourth quarter and a 61 percent decline in pretax earnings for the 
year due to weaker demand in Asia and fewer bookings for premium 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported today it had a pretax loss of 85 million  
pounds, or $135 million, in the three months ended March 31 in 
contrast to a profit of 70 million pounds a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly revenue was 2.05 billion pounds, or $3.25 billion, up  
slightly from 2.02 billion pounds the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, British Airways earned 225 million pounds, or $357  
million, down from 580 million pounds a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual operating profit fell 12 percent to 442 million pounds  
from 504 million pounds. But revenue increased 3 percent to 8.92 
billion pounds, or $14.16 billion, from 8.64 billion pounds a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts and investors had anticipated the poor  
results. The company's shares rose almost 4 percent in afternoon 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very simple story. There is more capacity in the market  
than there is demand,'' chief executive Bob Ayling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over-capacity, particularly on transatlantic flights, was ``not  
likely to improve materially in the short-term,'' Ayling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia's lingering financial crisis squeezed profits, as did  
industry-wide fare discounting and a drop-off in business and 
first-class bookings. 
</P>
<P>
	Stiffer competition in the economy-priced market also ate away  
at BA's bottom line. In response to this challenge, BA launched its 
own economy airline brand, Go, last year. Ayling expressed 
satisfaction with Go's performance so far. 
</P>
<P>
	BA said a cost-cutting program had saved it 610 million pounds  
during the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's strategy for recovery focuses on replacing its  
Boeing 747 planes with smaller 777 aircraft, which have fewer 
economy seats and more premium seats. By eliminating more of its 
discounted seats, the airline hopes to boost its profit on each 
ticket sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline plans for half its fleet to consist of the smaller  
777s by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	BA also plans to market more aggressively to business  
passengers, introducing new products like flat beds in its premium 
Club class. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the right strategy, but it is going to take a while for  
the benefits to come through in the financial figures,'' said 
Jeremy Batstone, head of research at NatWest stockbrokers. ``The 
company is not yet out of the woods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayling denied reports that BA might cut back on its domestic  
British flights but said the airline was reevaluating its shorter 
flights from London's Heathrow airport to destinations in 
continental Europe.

<HEADLINE> Avis Buying Cendant Auto Leasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Moving beyond its core car-rental business, Avis  
Rent A Car is buying the corporate auto-leasing operations of its 
former parent company, Cendant Corp., for $1.8 billion in cash and 
stock. Investors frowned on the deal, pushing Avis' stock sharply 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Avis officials tried to put a positive spin on the transaction,  
saying the company would gain a foothold in Europe and financial 
and technical expertise in managing large fleets of cars from its 
purchase of PHH. 
</P>
<P>
	``PHH and Avis are a natural fit, since both companies  
principally serve corporate clients and there are a number of 
opportunities to cross-market to each other's customers,'' Avis 
chief financial officer Kevin Sheehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wall Street investors, who have been favoring car rental  
stocks in recent months, quickly dumped Avis shares out of concern 
that the company was paying a rich price for a business that was 
too different from its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Avis shares tumbled $7.37 1/2 or 20 percent to $28 in heavy trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Despite the dropoff, the stock is 
still above its level in early April, when it was trading at about 
$25. 
</P>
<P>
	Other car rental companies also dabble in the fleet management  
business, but on a much smaller scale. PHH is one of the largest 
managers of fleet cars, providing services to one-third of the 
Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Avis is the one of the leading companies in the U.S. car rental  
business, managing a fleet of some 200,000 cars. PHH manages cars 
for 19,000 companies in the United States and Europe, coordinating 
a massive array of 700,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
	For Cendant, the deal gets the company further along toward its  
goal of shedding businesses that are outside its core strengths of 
franchising brands in real estate, travel and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction also raises cash for Cendant to buy back stock  
and pay down debt as the company struggles to rebuild itself after 
a crushing accounting scandal brought down 10 company directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, seeing the deal as good news for Cendant, pushed the  
company's shares up 68 3/4 cents or 3.6 percent at $19.87 1/2 on the 
NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Cendant shareholders, this is pleasing news,'' said Gary  
Balter, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``It's another 
move to make it a clearer company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant still owns the Avis name and 20 percent of Avis Rent A  
Car. It spun off the rest of the Garden City, N.Y.-based company in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Cendant sold its consumer software business to a  
French media company, and earlier this year it moved its 
headquarters to New York from Parsippany, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Shifts Defense Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Appropriations Committee voted  
Tuesday to shift $3.1 billion from defense to domestic programs as 
they struggled to write spending bills that honor stringent limits 
required by Congress' budget. 
</P>
<P>
	As they did, a conservative rebellion against Republican leaders  
slowed House debate to a crawl on a $61 billion measure financing 
agriculture and food programs. The first spending bill of the year 
to reach the full House, it became the target of repeated attempts 
at cutting. The assault was led by Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who 
said GOP leaders were on a course to ignore spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a leadership issue that we need to deal with,'' Rep.  
Steve Largent, R-Okla., told his colleagues. ``And I need to tell 
you, this was a last resort to come to the House floor, because we 
hit dead end after dead end in trying to carry on this family 
discussion inside our own house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House debated the bill for nearly nine hours before quitting  
for the evening. Only one of the six amendments conservatives 
offered was approved. It would cut the Agriculture Department's 
chief information officer's budget by $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Things were less chaotic on the Senate side of the Capitol, but  
the budget pressures were just as knotty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee voted 24-3 to divide $536  
billion among its 13 annual spending bills for federal agencies for 
fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1. The only opponents were three 
Democrats: Richard Durbin of Illinois, Dianne Feinstein of 
California and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Like an outline approved last week by the House Appropriations  
Committee, the Senate plan would leave bills covering education, 
environment and other domestic programs about $24 billion below 
this year's levels and more than $30 billion below what President 
Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	To begin bridging that gap, the Senate panel voted by voice to  
set aside $3.1 billion approved in earlier bills for defense 
programs, eventually to use the money for domestic spending bills 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to go step by step by step across each little  
puddle,'' said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted 
Stevens, R-Alaska. But Stevens conceded his panel remained billions 
of dollars short of what it would need for its spending bills this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said the $3.1 billion came from unspent allocations and  
from money approved in advance this year for fiscal 2000 programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Republicans had put more defense money than Clinton  
requested into a recent $15 billion emergency measure for Kosovo, 
knowing earlier defense funds were unspent, Stevens said, ``because 
we had this in mind,'' the shift of defense spending to domestic 
programs. ``I do think beyond the next job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate and House plans are designed to live within spending  
limits imposed by the GOP-written budget Congress approved this 
year. At GOP leaders' insistence, that budget honored spending 
reductions promised by the 1997 budget-balancing deal between 
Clinton and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Because spending is limited so severely, most lawmakers believe  
it will take negotiations between themselves and the White House 
before some of the measures will be enacted this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $267.6  
billion measure for the Pentagon, $4.3 billion more than Clinton 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Appropriations subcommittees approved two spending  
bills: a $21.2 billion measure for energy and water projects, and a 
$48.9 billion transportation bill. In each case, lawmakers grumbled 
they did not have enough money. 
</P>
<P>
	The energy and water bill would spend $100 million less in the  
fiscal year starting Oct. 1 than this year and $400 million less 
than Clinton wanted. The transportation measure would spend $1.6 
billion more than this year, but that's $1.3 billion less than 
Clinton proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak, the nation's passenger railroad, would get $571 million,  
$38 million less than this year. Construction on Army Corps of 
Engineers water projects would get $1.1 billion, a cut of $318 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The transportation measure also places new requirements on how  
airlines treat passengers, said subcommittee Chairman Richard 
Shelby, R-Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require an airline that knows a flight's arrival  
will be delayed to notify passengers before they board the plane. 
Airlines advertising bargain fares would have to specify the 
numbers of seats available at that rate. And passengers who don't 
use a portion of a ticket could not be penalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The House agriculture bill was $500 million less than Clinton  
requested. Rep. Joe Skeen, R-N.M., chairman of the Appropriations 
agriculture subcommittee, said it was the best that could be done 
under a tight budget, but the bill drew fire from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said in a statement the measure was  
``simply inadequate to make the necessary investments our citizens 
need and expect.'' It urged the House to increase spending for food 
safety, child nutrition, seafood inspection, conservation and 
agricultural research. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, conservatives said the measure would set  
Congress on course to violate spending caps. They said the extra 
spending would have to come out of Social Security's surplus, 
something both parties say they want to avoid.

<HEADLINE> Soccer: It's United Vs. Bayern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Two of the biggest clubs in European  
soccer end their long waits Wednesday for another shot at the 
continent's most prestigious prize. 
</P>
<P>
	When Manchester United and Bayern Munich meet in the Champions  
Cup final at Camp Nou stadium, each will be chasing a rare triple -- 
and the one victory it really wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are absolutely the two top teams in Europe right now,''  
Bayern Munich midfielder Stefan Effenberg said. ``But only if we 
win Wednesday we can call ourselves true champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manchester United last won the cup in 1968, with a lineup that  
included George Best and Bobby Charlton. Charlton scored twice, 
Best and Brian Kidd added one goal apiece, and United beat Benfica 
Lisbon 4-1 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayern's 1-0 win over St. Etienne in 1976 was its third  
Champions Cup win in a row and the last major trophy won by Franz 
Beckenbauer, Gerd Mueller &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither club won its national title last season, but qualified  
for the expanded Champions League. If they were below par last 
season, the two European powers have been outstanding this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have won their league titles, and Manchester United added  
the Football Association Cup to move within one victory of becoming 
the first English club to win all three in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would be the first English club since Liverpool in 1984  
to win the Champions Cup. English clubs were excluded form European 
cup tournaments after deadly riots between Liverpool and Juventus 
fans at the 1985 cup final in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's significant,'' Manchester manager Alex Ferguson said.  
``The English teams in the 1980s were fantastic and you could say 
they dominated the competition, really. I think we've progressed to 
that level and we're as good as any English team that has been here 
before. So that must give us a great chance to change the 
pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bayern is one step behind United in the triple crown chase -- it  
still has to play the German Cup final June 12. 
</P>
<P>
	United has not lost in 32 games and is averaging 3.05 goals a  
game, getting sparkling play from star wingers David Beckham and 
Ryan Giggs and strikers Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole. 
</P>
<P>
	By scoring 27 goals en route to the final, United is the  
highest-scoring finalist since the Champions League began seven 
years ago. Bayern has been almost as impressive domestically. 
</P>
<P>
	The two teams met twice in group matches and both ended in ties  
-- 2-2 in Munich and 1-1 in Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what will decide Wednesday's game, Bayern goalkeeper  
Oliver Kahn replied: ``Luck and only luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bayern arrived in Barcelona on Tuesday, while United settled  
into the seaside resort of Sitges just outside the Catalan capital 
after arriving Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Camp Nou has been sold out for the final with 90,000 fans, each  
team officially receiving 30,000 tickets each. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are missing stars. Manchester will be without  
suspended captain Roy Keane and midfielder Paul Scholes, while 
Bayern is without injured Bixente Lizarazu and striker Giovane 
Elber.

<HEADLINE> O'Donnell's Gun Crusade Off Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell hasn't exactly had an  
unobstructed shot in her advocacy for gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk television's ``Queen of Nice'' has argued on the air about  
guns with actor Tom Selleck, become a target for Howard Stern and 
was accused -- in a report heatedly denied -- of trying to alter a 
Broadway show lyric because it conflicted with her views. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advocacy has at least given the National Rifle Association  
and gun control advocates something new to argue about. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell reportedly asked the cast of Broadway's ``Annie Get  
Your Gun'' to change a song lyric in ``Anything You Can Do'' before 
taping her show. She supposedly wanted the line ``I can shoot a 
partridge with a single cartridge'' removed, but the show's stars 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell's spokeswoman, Laura Mandel, and a representative of  
the musical both denied the talk show host asked for the line to be 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	After initially considering singing ``Anything You Can Do'' on  
O'Donnell's show, producers of the Broadway revival decided to 
perform the song ``My Defenses Are Down,'' which doesn't mention 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The producers wanted a song that featured more of the cast,  
spokesman Pete Sanders said. If O'Donnell was so sensitive about 
guns, he said, she wouldn't have booked a Broadway show with guns 
in the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Tempers had only begun to cool since the O'Donnell-Selleck  
donnybrook last week. Since the Columbine High School massacre, 
O'Donnell has called for legislation that would make it harder for 
minors to get guns. Selleck was asked to talk about the issue 
because he participated in an NRA ad. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't a congenial chat.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's entitled to her views,'' said NRA spokesman Bill Powers.  
``She certainly didn't treat Mr. Selleck with the same sort of 
respect or courtesy that my mother taught me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell apologized to Selleck, saying she didn't intend to  
embarrass him. She said she assumed he would be better prepared to 
debate the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell soon found herself with another potential debate  
partner. Stern publicly questioned whether O'Donnell was being 
hypocritical by fighting for gun control and being a commercial 
spokeswoman for Kmart, which sells guns. 
</P>
<P>
	On her show Friday, O'Donnell said Kmart was a responsible  
seller of hunting rifles, which are legal to own. She said she's 
interested in gun control efforts for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Naomi Paiss, spokeswoman for the lobbying group Handgun Control,  
said her office was flooded with more than 1,000 calls, mostly from 
people who wanted to help, after the number was flashed on the 
screen during O'Donnell's show. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's spoken to an audience that wouldn't be caught dead  
watching `The McLaughlin Group,''' Paiss said. ``She's been very 
brave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Countered the NRA's Powers: ``I don't think anybody who treats  
people with that much of a lack of respect has much of a platform. 
When you're shrill and rude, your platform diminishes.''

<HEADLINE> `Mom-and-Pop' Motels a Dying Breed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- Travelers Rest Inn looks like it's  
caught in a time warp. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-room, bracket-shaped motel with its quaint ambiance and  
antique decor hasn't changed much since it opened 45 years ago, but 
everything around it has. 
</P>
<P>
	The sleepy two-lane road in front has been replaced by a  
traffic-clogged five-lane highway. The farm behind where 
Clydesdales were raised now is an office park with gleaming new 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	And all around it are restaurants, banks, gas stations and other  
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The motel industry has changed almost as much as Travelers  
Rest's surroundings. Family-owned motels like Travelers Rest -- 
those places where baby boomers stopped on long car trips with 
their parents -- are dying off, replaced by chains that can offer 
more modern conveniences. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're one of the last mom-and-pop motels left,'' said Gina  
Delboy, who took over management of Travelers Rest with her 
husband, Jan, after her father retired. Mrs. Delboy's brother, Alex 
Noble, is part-owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many modern chain motels, Travelers Rest doesn't offer  
room service, free movies or complimentary breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	What it does offer is rooms with bed posts and easy chairs  
reminiscent of a grandmother's bedroom; dark-wood rocking chairs 
out front offering weary motorists a reprieve from their car seats; 
and doors that open with keys, not plastic cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Erbe of Naples, Fla., stays at Travelers Rest every time  
she visits Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's the nostalgia,'' Erbe says. ``You go to Opryland  
(Hotel), and everything's fake. They're trying to achieve what this 
has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Howe of Cincinnati recently spent three nights at  
Travelers Rest while in town on business. He chose it because it 
has ``a little more charm'' than chain motels. 
</P>
<P>
	The first motels were less charming. In fact, they weren't  
motels at all; they were campsites that sprang up along roads with 
the advent of the automobile around the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	For travelers who didn't want to march across the lobby of a  
hotel in their road-worn clothes, camping in a farmer's field or on 
a lake front was a popular alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Traveling) was a great adventure for people, and camping was  
part of that adventure,'' said Jefferson Rogers, coauthor of the 
book ``The Motel in America'' and assistant professor of geography 
at the University of Tennessee-Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	These campers became known as ``tin-can'' tourists for the trash  
they left behind, and eventually municipalities began cracking down 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1930s, cabins started sprouting along highways. Typical  
of the time was the U-Smile Cabin Camp in Kansas City. Guests paid 
$1 a night for a cabin and 25 cents more for a mattress. Blankets, 
sheets and pillows were 50 cents more. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, places like U-Smile added laundry rooms. Gas  
stations and restaurants were built nearby ``and we start seeing 
the development of roadside businesses on the outskirts of town,'' 
Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1940s, cabins were replaced with cottages equipped  
with car ports. Seeking to maximize profits, owners later replaced 
car ports with more rooms and the ``motor hotel'' -- later shortened 
to ``motel'' -- was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Belasco, professor of American studies at the University  
of Maryland-Baltimore County and author of ``Americans on the 
Road,'' said the motel became as integral a part of a trip as 
reaching the destination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Motels were the places where you found the latest  
conveniences,'' Belasco said. ``For many people, it was the first 
place they may have encountered a shower. In more recent years, 
things like cable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the years went by and travelers demanded more amenities, the  
line between hotels and motels blurred. Chains emerged, promising 
guests the same service in the same surroundings whether they were 
in Portland, Maine, or Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	While these changes were occurring, Travelers Rest stayed the  
same. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Delboy's parents, Glenn and Iva Lee Noble, opened the motel  
when she was a senior in high school. It had 12 rooms that went for 
$4 to $6 a night. 
</P>
<P>
	The motel has tripled in size since then. Prices now range from  
$42 to $52 a night. 
</P>
<P>
	Motels like Travelers Rest face an uphill battle to stay in  
business as guests continue demanding more perks. A family-owned 
motel across the street from Travelers rest went out of business 
several years ago, and a Holiday Inn and Hampton Inn have been 
built nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Travelers Rest endures, and the Delboys have no plans to  
sell or change. They believe they offer travelers something the 
chains can't -- a family atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was born and raised on this corner,'' Delboy says. ``We have  
a lot of people who've been coming back for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been here a long time, and we treat them like family.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Mostly Higher / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds were mostly higher Tuesday in a second day  
of quiet trading amid steep downturn by stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/32  
point, or 1.56 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.74 percent from late 
Monday's 5.76 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasuries ranged from unchanged to a loss  
of 1/32 point, and intermediate maturities ranged from unchanged to 
3/32 point higher, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds struggled early on in the session as stocks showed signs  
of a rebound from Monday's heavy selling, which sliced about 175 
points off the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	But by midafternoon on Tuesday, stocks turned lower, leaving the  
Dow another 123 points lower and sending money in search of safe 
harbors such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
rose to 4.62 percent from late Monday's 4.61 percent, while the 
discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields rose to 4.77 percent as the discount rose 0.02  
percentage point to 4.59 percent. One-year yields rose to 4.86 
percent from late Monday's 4.82 percent, while the discount was 
unchanged at 4.62 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.81 percent from late Monday's 4.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 5/32 point to 122 3/32. The average 
yield to maturity was rose to 5.36 percent from late Monday's 5.35 
percent.

<HEADLINE> More Than 136,000 Saturns Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) -- Saturn Corp. is recalling 136,300 cars  
because their seat backs can recline or collapse suddenly, which 
has caused at least one driver to crash. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was killed, but at least two people reported injuries  
because of the faulty seat backs, spokesman Bill Betts said 
Tuesday. He had no further details. 
</P>
<P>
	The gear teeth on the reclining mechanisms of driver and front  
passenger seats in 1994 and 1995 models are to blame, according to 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this happens while the vehicle is being driven it could  
cause a loss of control, increasing the risk of a crash,'' 
according to a NHTSA report. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 123 Saturn customers said the seat reclined or collapsed  
after the car was rear-ended by another vehicle, according to 
NHTSA, which spent a year investigating the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	An NHTSA spokesman said he knew nothing more than what was in  
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Betts said the company discovered the problem by examining  
computer data on warranty work for customers, and that it was the 
seat supplier's fault. 
</P>
<P>
	The seats were provided by Hyperion Corp. of Lawrenceburg, which  
fixed the problem in later models and has supplied all of Saturn's 
seats since the Spring Hill plant began operating in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyperion officials did not immediately return phone calls.  
</P>
<P>
	Betts said Saturn began notifying owners of the recall in March,  
but they haven't all brought their cars to dealerships to be fixed, 
a process that takes about two hours.

<HEADLINE> Rookies Must Learn in Indy 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indy Racing League is succeeding in its  
plan to bring young drivers into the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the four who will take the green flag on Sunday, there  
have been 42 first-year starters at Indianapolis since the IRL took 
over in 1996, the largest group of rookies in any four-year span 
since 57 newcomers were in the lineup from 1929-32. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the 1970s, '80s and even the early 90s, when drivers  
such as A.J. Foyt, Johnny Rutherford, Al Unser Sr., Gordon 
Johncock, Mario Andretti and Rick Mears raced year after year, even 
decade after decade, experience is at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this bunch of young kids that we have coming on ... they  
grew up driving sprint cars and midgets,'' said Rodger Ward, who 40 
years ago earned the first of his two Indy 500 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you this, that when you learn how to drive a race  
car, coming here and going this fast is a little bit different, but 
the training you get in a midget and sprint car and perhaps in a 
Silver Crown car is really the kind of experience that makes you 
into a damn good race driver,'' said Ward, 78, the oldest living 
former winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven years ago, the Indy lineup had a record 260 driver-years  
of experience. Two years ago, after the boycott of many veteran 
Championship Auto Racing Teams drivers and the retirement of most 
of the old guard, the starters had a combined 70 years of previous 
starts at Indy, the fewest in modern Speedway history. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides pole-winner Arie Luyendyk and Roberto Guerrero, each  
making his 15th start; Raul Boesel, in the race for the 11th time; 
Eddie Cheever, making his 10th start; and Scott Goodyear, his 
ninth, no other driver this year has more than four previous 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new guys have all got talent from other arenas, and they  
come from the same place we came from,'' Rutherford said of the 
short-track background of many of today's Indy drivers. ``We all 
did the same bull-ring racing before, and I think it's just a 
mindset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No rookie has won at Indianapolis since Graham Hill in 1966.  
Guerrero in 1984, Jacques Villeneuve in 1994 and Christian 
Fittipaldi in 1995 finished second; the top rookie each of the past 
three years -- Richie Hearn, Jeff Ward and Steve Knapp -- finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Knapp, Robby Unser, Andy Michner and J.J. Yeley all  
finished among the Top 10, the most since five rookies were among 
the Top 10 in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Speedway president Tony George founded the IRL,  
which prompted the CART boycott, rookies were showing significant 
success at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	After Donnie Allison in 1970, the first rookie to drive the full  
500 miles was Nigel Mansell in 1993. Villeneuve then did it in 
1994, Fittipaldi and Eliseo Salazar matched the feat in 1995, Hearn 
did it in 1996, and Ward and Knapp did it in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A big reason for the rookies' success has been their better  
preparation before practice even begins. The Speedway started the 
annual Rookie Orientation Program in the early '80s. It was 
optional at first, then mandatory. No driver who hopes to qualify 
for the 500 can afford to pass it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had all the rookies here in April and they went through  
their tests without the pressure of a lot of cars on the track,'' 
Rutherford said. ``They had a chance to run their tests, get 
through that, get some speed, have a couple of days to run on their 
own and experiment and be with other cars on the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once that's out of the way, the newcomers can focus on  
qualifying and the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tested previously twice, but this was a good step in the  
progression,'' said John Hollansworth Jr., the fastest rookie 
qualifier, who will start 12th, on the outside of the fourth row. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible,'' said Robby McGehee, who will start 27th, on  
the outside of Row 9. ``I'm at a famous track and a famous race. 
It's been a childhood dream. What more could I say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Jeret Schroeder qualified 21st for a start on the outside  
of Row 7. Wim Eyckmans, driving for owner-teammate Cheever, was the 
slowest qualifier and will start from the middle of Row 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie's experience has helped me quite a lot,'' the rookie  
from Belgium said. ``He told me to drive like I always do, and do 
what you have to, to qualify. Mentally, it's really hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, as Cheever said, ``The most important thing about the 500  
is to be in it.''

<HEADLINE> Springer Distributor Halts Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jerry Springer fans will have to look elsewhere  
for fisticuffs. His television distributor issued an order on 
Tuesday: no more fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Studios USA, syndicator for ``The Jerry Springer Show,'' also  
replaced some scheduled episodes this week with tamer shows. The 
efforts are seen as another fallout from the recent school 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will produce and distribute a program that we feel is  
responsible -- no violence, physical confrontation or profanity,'' 
Studios USA said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	All three ingredients helped rocket Springer's talk show to the  
top of the ratings, with episodes often degenerating into 
hair-pulling, fists-flying donnybrooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer had no comment on the order, a spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
	New programs will have to meet the no-violence standard and  
reruns will be edited to take out any fights, Studios USA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will inform stations that we are not providing any Jerry  
Springer program if these standards cannot be met,'' the studio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Studios USA pulled scheduled Springer episodes titled ``Guess  
What? I'm Bisexual'' and ``I'm Proud to be a Prostitute'' this 
week. They were replaced with shows about tall people and street 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think you're seeing the reaction to Littleton, to last  
week's school shooting and the reaction to Jenny Jones,'' said 
Richard Kurlander, an expert on syndication for Petry TV. ``Those 
three are coming together to move a lot of people toward the 
center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a Michigan jury issued a $25 million verdict  
against ``The Jenny Jones Show'' for negligence in the shooting 
death of a homosexual guest who admitted a crush on another man. 
</P>
<P>
	Several prime-time shows depicting violence have been yanked  
from the air by networks concerned about violence after the 
Littleton school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer's studio, while reaping the benefits of his high  
ratings, has tried to rein him in before. A year ago, the studio 
ordered Springer to have security guards move faster to defuse 
explosive situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio blamed its own staff, however, for doing a poor job  
of policing the show.

<HEADLINE> NFL Owners Approve Redskins Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The price was $800 million, the highest for a  
franchise in sports history. A heavy tab for a 34-year-old lifelong 
Washington Redskins fans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daniel Snyder, a communications mogul and college dropout,  
finally got what he wanted Tuesday -- ownership of one of the 
league's premier teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow!'' exulted Snyder after receiving unanimous approval from  
NFL club owners. ``It's been an unbelievable journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a league long ruled by old money, he becomes the youngest  
among the league's current owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31 owners accepted his record bid in the only action taken  
at the start of two days of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four votes were needed to approve the sale, which  
includes the new Jack Kent Cooke Stadium. Approval was widely 
expected following last week's endorsement by the NFL's finance 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners also discussed the situation in Los Angeles, which  
lost its two NFL teams after the 1994 season. Two ownership groups 
are jockeying for the franchise, which the NFL hopes to have ready 
for the 2002 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate concerning Los Angeles involves parking lots. One of  
the plans put forward Tuesday included a garage at the renovated 
Coliseum that would cost more than $200 million by itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder had been a junior partner to Howard Milstein in a  
previous bid to buy the team from the trustees of the late Jack 
Kent Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
	When Milstein pulled out after it became clear he couldn't win  
support from other owners, Snyder went his own way. He brought in 
Fred Drasner and Mort Zuckerman, co-owners of the Daily News in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's bid was the same as Milstein's. But he backed it with a  
$300 million down payment that sold the rest of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous high price for a franchise was the $550 million Al  
Lerner paid for the new Cleveland Browns, who will begin playing in 
September as the NFL's 31st team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins sale has been a long-running soap opera since the  
team was put up for sale by the trustees of the estate of Jack Kent 
Cooke, who died in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke's son, John, was one of the bidders when Milstein got the  
franchise. When Milstein dropped out, he sued John Cooke and 
general manager Charley Casserly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a long goodbye,'' Cooke said in a statement.  
``As disappointing as it has been, it has also been very gratifying 
to hear how much my family has meant to the National Football 
League and Redskins fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder has said that for this season he will retain Casserly and  
coach Norv Turner. He also expects to hire a team president soon, 
but not necessarily someone from football, although one of those 
mentioned is former Miami coach Don Shula. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, the NFL has decided the renovated Coliseum will  
be the venue of choice. Now parking -- always a vexing issue in the 
city -- figures into the discussion. The NFL insists 25,000 parking 
spaces be available. 
</P>
<P>
	One group, headed by Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz, presented a  
plan Tuesday for a parking garage with a park on top that could 
cost as much as $225 million. The project features a garage covered 
with trees, grass in front of luxury suites and a cooling system 
that would spray mist on sweltering fans. 
</P>
<P>
	It impressed commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who called it  
``exactly the kind of vision necessary to transform the venue in 
the interests of the city of Los Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But public money must cover some of the costs, and California  
politicians are not all that happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 2.5 million uninsured children and adults in this county,  
with 75,000 children in foster care ... with sidewalks that can't 
be repaired by the city? Give me a break,'' Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Assemblyman Roderick Wright of Los Angeles: ``Why should a  
lady in Fresno pay for parking spaces for the Coliseum?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other group, led by developer Eli Broad, has a more modest  
plan. It would provide a 7,500-car garage plus space for more than 
17,000 other cars, using the adjacent campus of the University of 
Southern California and other existing space. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles, which beat out Houston for the expansion team, has  
until Sept. 16 to present owners with a workable plan although that 
deadline is believed to be flexible if progress is shown. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners are to discuss the New England Patriots' decision to  
stay in the Boston area after withdrawing a commitment to Hartford, 
Conn. Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci signed legislation Monday 
that will provide $70 million to help the Patriots build a new 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners will also discuss stadium situations in Denver and  
Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Petrie Named NBA Exec of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Geoff Petrie, Sacramento's vice  
president of basketball operations, was selected NBA Executive of 
the Year on Tuesday, capping a spectacular comeback year for him 
and the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	The award, announced in New York by The Sporting News,  
recognized Petrie's key role in rebuilding a team which had not had 
a winning season since moving from Kansas City to Sacramento in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting his fifth year with the Kings, Petrie made a series of  
trades and signings, some of them controversial, that resulted in 
four new starters playing for a new coach, Rick Adelman. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA lockout meant an abbreviated training camp and season  
for the young team, and the start was rocky. The Kings' 
inconsistency and lapses often made them look like the 27-55 team 
of the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sacramento closed the regular season with 10 wins in their  
final 11 games for a 27-23 record. Then they came within one missed 
shot on the final buzzer of upsetting the Utah Jazz, the defending 
two-time Western Conference champion, in the fifth and final game 
of the opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie received eight of a possible 33 votes from his fellow NBA  
executives and league representatives. Orlando's John Gabriel 
received seven votes, followed by Toronto's Glen Grunwald with five 
and Portland's Bob Whitsitt with four. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie said the award was especially gratifying ``coming with  
the type of year we had ... the way it came together under such 
great uncertainty and much doubt. I'm really proud of everybody 
associated with the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of that doubt and uncertainty involved Petrie's own job.  
Earlier this year, as Petrie faced a scheduled mid-year change in 
team ownership and the expiration of his contract. At one point he 
reportedly was just hours away from resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	But Petrie signed a multiyear contract extension in January, and  
his team of strangers -- nine new players on the 12-man roster -- won 
national attention with a sometimes erratic but always exciting 
style. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie's major accomplishments were trading for power forward  
Chris Webber, signing free agent center Vlade Divac and drafting 
point guard Jason Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as important were the free agent signings of guards  
Vernon Maxwell and Jon Barry and forward Scot Pollard and the 
recruitment and signing of guard Peja Stojakovic, a 1996 
first-round draft choice from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Only forwards Corliss Williamson and Lawrence Funderburke and  
guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad -- all draft choices during Petrie's 
five-year tenure -- returned from the 1997-98 squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Geoff has done a terrific job in rebuilding the Sacramento  
Kings. A lot of hard work has started to pay off for the 
organization,'' said Kings chief executive officer Jim Thomas, who 
hired Petrie in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Gavin Maloof, whose family will assume control of the franchise  
from Thomas on July 1, said the honor was well deserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say I was surprised,'' Maloof said from Las Vegas. ``I  
do know it's an honor for him individually and for the Kings 
organization to have a person of his quality. It's certainly a very 
prestigious award, and I'm happy for him because he works very hard 
and deserves it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie, 51, shared the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 1971,  
when he played for the Portland Trail Blazers. His latest award 
makes him the first person to win both the NBA's rookie and 
executive honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie played six years for the Trail Blazers. After his playing  
career was curtailed by injuries, he spent five years as a members 
of the Trail Blazers broadcast team and another four years in the 
team's front office before joining the Kings.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Renews Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The Iraqi government has formally renewed  
its oil-for-food deal with the United Nations that provides food 
and medicine for its people, a senior official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The official also said Iraq's SOMO, the state oil marketing arm,  
was now working on new contracts for the sixth phase of the deal, 
which started Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The contracts could be ready in a matter of days,'' the  
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Sources at SOMO 
said there should be no interruption in oil exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq is now producing 2.65 million barrels of oil a day with  
about 2 million earmarked for exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said any production and export increase would be  
impossible without spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said, $14 million of equipment and spare parts have  
already arrived in the country and if the current pace of arrivals 
continues they will be able ``to add another 250,000 barrels a day 
to output before the end of this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to bypass U.N. trade  
sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and sell 
limited amounts of oil on condition the proceeds are used to buy 
food, medicine and humanitarian goods for its people. The program, 
which is approved in six-month phases, began in December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run newspapers, which reflect government thinking, have  
been very critical of the program recently, with some even advising 
the government to abandon the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper Babil, which is owned by President Saddam  
Hussein's eldest son Odai, speculated Monday that the United States 
and Britain would turn the oil program into a permanent measure 
that would substitute for any eventual lifting of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Iraq desperately needs the program, particularly as it is  
facing its worst drought in almost fifty years. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has so far received up to 10 million tons of food through  
the program.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Library Tax Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A 1 cent sales tax increase, a small  
piece of which could have helped pay for the site for the Bill 
Clinton presidential library, was defeated by more than a 2-1 vote 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase would have funded $200 million in improvements to  
city streets, parks, and its zoo, and barely 4 percent of the money 
could have gone toward paying off the debt incurred buying land for 
the Clinton library. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents complained that voters were not told some of the money  
could go toward the library. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the people who have not liked the president all along.  
They dislike anybody associated with the library,'' said Skip 
Rutherford, a friend of Clinton. ``You're going to have those 
people who are going to criticize the Clintons, but this package is 
far broader than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal included two taxes -- a 3/4-cent temporary tax to  
raise $150 million over five years and a 1/4-cent permanent tax to 
raise $9.3 million annually. The city now has a half-cent local tax 
rate, and state and county sales taxes push the figure to 6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of Tuesday's vote on the 3/4-cent tax was 15,061 to  
6,891, or 69 percent to 31 percent. The 1/4-cent tax was voted down 
15,541 to 6,144, or 72 percent to 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynda Cooper said the ballot was confusing.  
</P>
<P>
	``The city will be sorry when they find out that most people  
couldn't understand it,'' said Ms. Cooper, 39. ``I'm sure people 
stayed away from voting because they didn't know what was going 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton selected Little Rock as his library site in 1997,  
city officials scrambled to make good on a pledge to provide the 
land. They considered raising the city tax on hotels and 
restaurants, but settled on using $11.5 million from a bond issue 
that also benefits the city zoo and golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is in the process of buying the land. Private donations  
will construct the complex and the federal government will operate 
it.

	NATO Begins Relocating Refugees

<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- Citing possible attacks from nearby Serb  
forces, NATO began relocating 30,000 Kosovo refugees today from 
Albania's northern border to safer camps deeper inside the country. 
In one of several recent incidents, U.N. spokesman Rupert Colville 
noted that two bullets fired from inside Kosovo struck the refugee 
reception center at the Albanian border last night. The relocation 
began with 204 refugees carrying meager belongings setting off in 
military trucks on a 24-hour road and rail journey to a U.S.-run

saying Beijing has never stolen classified material from any 
foreign country. China's Foreign Ministry said allegations of 
Chinese nuclear espionage, detailed in a U.S. congressional report, 
were ``groundless'' and aimed at deflecting attention from NATO's 
May 7 bombing of China's embassy in Yugoslavia. Ministry spokesman 
Zhu Bangzao accused anti-China factions of cooking up the 
allegations to slander China and paint it as a threat. The report 
by a select House committee on Chinese espionage said China stole 
secrets about seven major warheads in the U.S. nuclear arsenal as 
well as the neutron bomb.

<HEADLINE> Norris To Appear in Fla. Crime Ads </HEADLINE>

	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gun-toting criminals will go to jail  
longer under a new Florida crime law, and one of Hollywood's 
toughest actors will be spreading the word. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Norris, the karate-kicking star of television's ``Walker,  
Texas Ranger,'' has agreed to issue a stern warning in a series of 
TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads, which Norris is doing free of charge as a favor to his  
friend, Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, will let crooks know about the 
new ``10-20-life'' law. They will begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The law stipulates that a criminal can go to jail for 10 years  
if a gun is used in certain felonies, 20 years if it's fired and 25 
years to life if anyone is seriously hurt or killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush made the announcement Monday in front of about 200 law  
enforcement officers. ``He's a friend, and he's a good conservative

<HEADLINE> Baseball Fires Curve at ESPN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nasty feud continues between ESPN and Major  
League Baseball, with MLB countersuing the cable network over three 
late-season games that conflict with NFL telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN sued MLB earlier this month after the sport terminated a  
regular-season contract with the cable network that was supposed to 
run through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	MLB countersued Friday in papers filed in U.S. District Court in  
Manhattan. The judge received the papers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	MLB is claiming it should be paid damages because the cable  
television network broke its contract when it decided three 
football games would draw much higher ratings than three baseball 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, ESPN wanted to switch three Sunday baseball games to  
ESPN2 so it could show three NFL games instead. The two sides 
couldn't reach an agreement and the games were given back to local 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL was and is unwilling to have its games telecast on  
ESPN2, even three games in September at the very start of its 
season,'' MLB said. 
</P>
<P>
	MLB said in court papers that ESPN deliberately broke its 1996  
contract ``solely to cut a deal that it viewed as promising and 
having a more positive impact on the network's pricing structure 
and the corporate bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MLB demanded unspecified damages, saying ESPN2, which is  
available in 64 million homes, to be inferior to ESPN, which is in 
76 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Glover, ESPN executive vice president of programming, said  
Monday that the cable network did not violate the contract when it 
exercised its right to pre-empt three baseball games with football 
games because the football games were of significant viewer 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	MLB said in its court papers that ESPN could not do so without  
MLB's written permission, which MLB did not grant. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover called the NFL the ``gold standard of viewer interest.''  
</P>
<P>
	He said baseball averaged a 2.5 rating for its Sunday night  
games last year, while football had a 7.3 rating for its first 
three Sunday night games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that we've been not only a good partner, but by far  
their best partner for 10 years and don't understand why they would 
look to terminate the relationship over three games out of 500 
hours,'' Glover said. ``If they won the suit, it would be terrible 
for baseball. ESPN being out of baseball would be terrible for 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glover also said he believed MLB was trying to force ESPN to pay  
more money for a contract it had already negotiated. In its court 
papers, ESPN said MLB was asking for an additional $350 million for 
1999-2002 and a two-year extension at an annual threefold increase 
over the rights fee agreed to for 2002.

<HEADLINE> Upscale Mall Set for Vegas Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Forget blackjack and slot machines, where's the  
shopping? 
</P>
<P>
	Yet another casino is planning an upscale shopping center.  
</P>
<P>
	The Aladdin resort's 500,000-square-foot Desert Passage promises  
to transport shoppers from Spain to Africa to India through exotic 
marketplaces and street festivals with shops, restaurants and night 
clubs along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted it to feel like you're going through a movie,'' Paul  
Beirnes, director of marketing for Desert Passage, said Tuesday at 
the retail industry's International Council of Shopping Centers 
conference. ``There'll always be something going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $250 million Desert Passage is set to open in spring 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	But can Las Vegas really support another mall on the Strip? The  
city already has the Forum Shops at Caesars, the Fashion Show Mall 
and many casinos have mini malls inside their properties. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Circus Circus Enterprises announced it is entering  
the shopping business with a planned high-end retail complex 
linking the company's Mandalay Bay and Luxor resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists seem to be validating the shopping buildup.  
</P>
<P>
	Visitors spent more last year on dining and shopping and less on  
entertainment and gambling than they did in 1997, according to the 
1999 Las Vegas Perspective, which chronicles the economic growth in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The Las Vegas Strip will add more than 3 million square feet of  
new retail facilities over the next two years, creating 15,000 new 
jobs and generating annual revenues of $2.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Illes, vice president of strategic design for Desert  
Passage developer TrizecHahn Development Corp., said the Desert 
Passage will have an edge because its entrance will be right on the 
Strip; shoppers won't have to enter the casino first.

marketing and promotion services for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC also announced the shifting of another official and the  
hiring of a third. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoemaker will be responsible in developing activities promoting  
the torch relay, mascot tour, education and youth sports, arts and

</P>
<P>
	``Judy brings a wealth of experience in sports marketing,

<HEADLINE> Rays' McCracken Tears ACL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Devil Rays outfielder  
Quinton McCracken is expected to miss the rest of the season after 
tearing a ligament in his right knee in Monday night's loss to the 
Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was placed on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday, the 12th  
Tampa Bay player to go the DL this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays recalled outfielder Randy Winn from Triple-A  
Durham. 
</P>
<P>
	McCracken was injured while attempting to make a leaping catch  
on a sixth inning home run by Juan Gonzalez. After the game, 
McCracken said his knee ``buckled'' when he tried to leave the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the news we wanted to hear. After seeing the way it  
happened, it's not totally unexpected,'' Tampa Bay manager Larry 
Rothschild said before Tuesday night's game against Texas. ``It's 
unfortunate. His future, as far as playing, I don't think is in any 
dire jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCracken, who is hitting .250 with one home run and 18 RBIs in  
40 games, will decide over the next several days whether to undergo 
surgery or try to rehab the injured knee. He reviewed an MRI with 
doctors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the diagnosis that the doctors explained, I'll take  
some time to weigh my options and come to a decision in the next 
couple of days,'' McCracken said. ``Either way, it's a tough 
obstacle I'll have to overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCracken sprained the same knee just before the start of spring  
training and was sidelined until March 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in time, it's not unreasonable to expect him to  
be fine by next spring,'' Rothschild said.

<HEADLINE> Harassment Ruling May Change Little </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court decision holding schools responsible for  
sexual harassment between students was so narrow that some legal 
experts say it may have little effect in the courts, and even less 
sway on America's playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-4 ruling Monday opens the door to lawsuits against school  
boards, but only if officials were deliberately indifferent to 
sexual harassment so severe and pervasive that it deprived a 
student of his or her right to an education. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very high standard,'' said Catherine Fisk, a law  
professor at Loyola University in Los Angeles who has written 
extensively on sexual harassment. ``I don't think it is a big 
change in what most people thought the law was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``I suspect that the usual kids being mean to other  
kids, pulling up girls' dresses or whatever, isn't going to meet 
the standard of pervasive and severe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling follows a Supreme Court decision last June that said  
schools could be sued under the anti-bias federal law known as 
Title IX for a teacher's sexual harassment of a pupil. The ruling 
Monday extends that to student-against-student harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision stems from a Georgia case in which the mother of a  
fifth-grade girl named LaShonda Davis claimed that Monroe County 
school officials ignored her daughter's repeated complaints about a 
classmate who had allegedly groped and sexually threatened her. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court set a very high standard for holding school  
officials responsible, saying they had to have direct knowledge of 
the harassment and fail to act. 
</P>
<P>
	Some education officials said that is a narrower definition than  
Education Department guidelines issued in 1997. Under the 
guidelines, officials have a responsibility even if they had no 
knowledge of sexual harassment, but should have known. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court was quite clear that to be liable for damages it has  
to be pretty egregious. Basically, you knew about it and didn't do 
anything at all,'' said Stephen Yurek, general counsel for the 
National Association of Secondary School Principals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yurek said schools are already cracking down on sexually  
inappropriate behavior under the Education Department guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools, particularly in this day and age, have to err on the  
side of safety and protecting the kid,'' he said. ``The days of 
`boys will be boys, girls will be girls' are gone, and schools have 
a responsibility for educating kids on having respect for others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Houston, executive director of the American Association of  
School Administrators, which opposed the high court decision, said 
he worried the case could raise schools' legal costs and prompt 
officials to overreact to student misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid that people may come down overly hard on kids for  
things that aren't actually sexual harassment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said the case should prompt schools to adopt more  
counseling for students and training for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Stockdale, a psychology professor at Southern Illinois  
University in Carbondale and an expert on sexual harassment in the 
workplace, said the ruling puts school systems ``on notice that 
they should take this seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she said it will still be more difficult to sue a school  
than a company. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a difference. We are talking about kids, and teaching  
them lessons,'' Stockdale said. ``In the workplace people are 
adults and they should know better. But in school, it is a 
developmental process.''

<HEADLINE>  MSG Chief Apologizes to Van Gundy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy will remain in limbo for the  
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach of the New York Knicks met with the president of  
Madison Square Garden on Monday and received an apology for being 
lied to about the team's meeting with former Bulls coach Phil 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	But rather than put the issue completely to rest by assuring  
everyone that Van Gundy would remain as coach next season, team 
president Dave Checketts said no decisions will be made until the 
season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to make an evaluation on somebody or a judgment  
on what should happen in the organization based on one series, one 
shot or one win,'' Checketts said. ``He (Van Gundy) has agreed to 
that and he's comfortable with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy, however, was clearly uncomfortable with discussing  
the subject after the Knicks defeated the Atlanta Hawks 79-66 for a 
4-0 sweep of their second-round series. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not every day, after all, that one's boss comes into an  
underling's office and says he's sorry for lying to your face. 
</P>
<P>
	``He explained himself to me and I listened,'' Van Gundy said.  
``It's a non-issue to me. The only thing I was worried about was 
getting one more win, and now all I'm concerned with is trying to 
get back to the finals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the better part of the day Sunday, Checketts denied having  
any contact with Jackson despite two newspaper reports saying they 
sat down together to gauge Jackson's interest in the job. 
</P>
<P>
	But late in the afternoon, while Game 3 was still being played,  
Checketts confessed the truth. He was lambasted in Monday's papers 
as a shiftless corporate snake in a building of backstabbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret that I lied about it,'' Checketts said. ``We met for  
a couple of hours, and there were no offers exchanged. There was 
nothing that came out of the meeting other than getting acquainted 
with a guy who I felt was a tremendous option for us if we had not 
made the playoffs and needed a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, what I did is err on the side of protecting  
everyone. I had to do the job of finding out if I had an option 
like that,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, has been  
running the Knicks on a day-to-day basis since general manager 
Ernie Grunfeld was demoted in mid-April because of a rift between 
him and Van Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the unanswered questions surrounding the  
Checketts-Jackson meeting is who set it up. Checketts said he 
contacted Jackson through an intermediary, but he refused to say 
who it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Wyche, a spokesman for presidential candidate Bill Bradley,  
said the former Knicks forward was not the emissary.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks tumbled at the open of trading  
Wednesday, hurt by declines on Wall Street and pessimism the 
stronger yen could erode profits at exporters. The dollar fell 
again against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 107.93 points,  
or 0.67 percent, to 16,086.81 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Tuesday, the average lost 176.26 points, or 1.08 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.34 yen in early trading, down 0.38 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 122.70 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of electronics and telecommunications companies were  
among the biggest decliners, with NEC Corp. and Nikon Corp. leading 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Selling came as the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite index fell  
3 percent in the United States. The Dow Jones Industrial Average 
also fell, losing about 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger yen was also seen driving up the prices of these  
companies' products overseas, eating into export earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank shares fell after the nation's top lenders announced record  
losses this week. The 15 largest banks said they spent $82 billion 
over the last year writing off failed loans left on their books 
from the speculative 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was down 9.40 points, or 0.72 percent, to 
1,299.28. The TOPIX lost 8.83 points, or 0.67 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar remained under selling pressure  
from domestic investors taking profits on recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the dollar climbed to a seven-month high against the  
yen, rising above 124 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 129.76 yen, down  
from 130.35 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.320 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.355 percent, driving 
its price up to 100.70 yen from 100.39 yen.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Osborne Out 2-3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Often-injured St. Louis left-hander Donovan  
Osborne will be sidelined 2-3 months after undergoing arthroscopic 
surgery on his pitching shoulder Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 2-3 months and then you don't know how long before he  
gets in pitching shape,'' general manager Walt Jocketty said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know if he could help us at the end of the year or  
not,'' he said. ``We have to pretty much figure he won't be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Frank Jobe performed the surgery in Los Angeles, repairing  
an arthritic joint in Osborne's shoulder. Osborne had 
reconstructive surgery on the shoulder in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne, 29, was the Cardinals' opening day starter for the  
first time of his career. He went on the disabled list for the 
seventh time in seven major league seasons on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne is 1-3 with a 5.52 ERA in six starts in the final season  
of a three-year, $12.75 million contract. He has missed much of the 
first two seasons because of a hernia, two groin injuries and a 
shoulder injury, totaling 14 starts in 1998 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobe gave Osborne a cortisone shot last week, but the pitcher  
told the team it had no effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Originally what we were going to do was wait a month and see  
how it was, but it just wasn't getting any better,'' Jocketty said. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne's injury means that Juan Acevedo, who began the year as  
the closer, likely will now be a full-time starter. Acevedo, who 
struggled as the closer, will make his third start Thursday against 
the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Jocketty said he's been frustrated in efforts to trade for  
another starter. He doesn't expect much to happen before the July 
31 trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the road, the Cardinals may get right-hander Alan Benes  
back. Benes, who totaled 22 victories in 1996 and '97, has been 
sidelined since the middle of the '97 season with rotator cuff 
injuries, but has been throwing off a mound without pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably closer than Donovan,'' Jocketty said. ``He could  
be back, but you've got to remember you can't really count on him. 
If he comes back, it's a plus.''

<HEADLINE>  Panel Urged To Double President Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House plan to double the president's  
$200,000 annual salary after President Clinton leaves office is 
overdue and can be sold to a skeptical public, former top aides to 
Democratic and Republican presidents are telling Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a business of polling. This is a question of  
equity,'' Kenneth Duberstein, who was chief of staff to President 
Reagan, told a House subcommittee on Monday. ``I think the American 
people will in fact support a significant pay raise for the 
president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duberstein was among seven top presidential assistants, joined  
by representatives of think tanks and experts on executive 
compensation, who testified to a House Government Reform 
subcommittee. Almost all supported current legislation to double 
the next president's salary, with many saying the increase should 
be even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's salary should reflect the importance the  
American people place on this job,'' said Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty 
III, who was Clinton's first chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Language raising the salary to $400,000 for whomever succeeds  
Clinton in January 2001 was included in a $13.7 billion spending 
bill for the Treasury, White House and other agencies approved May 
14 by a House Appropriations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan has the support of House GOP leaders, said top  
Republican aides. It is also backed by the Clinton administration, 
which submitted a statement warning that failing to grant the 
increase would keep other senior federal salaries too low and make 
it hard for the government to attract talented people. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Constitution, lawmakers may vote pay raises only for  
future presidents, not sitting ones. Republicans have been 
underlining that point because of Clinton's deep unpopularity 
within their party. 
</P>
<P>
	``This hearing is not about whether President Clinton should get  
a pay raise,'' said the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Stephen Horn, 
R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Also released at the hearing was a poll by the Pew Research  
Center for the People and the Press showing scant public support 
for increasing presidential pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, taken earlier this month, showed that when told the  
last presidential pay raise was in 1969, 49 percent favored an 
increase for the next president. Support dropped to 41 percent when 
the question noted that the president currently receives $200,000 
plus housing and travel expenses. And only one in four said the 
president's pay should be increased by more than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, most of the former presidential aides said the public  
would accept an increase to $400,000 once it learned all the 
reasons why it was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the American people are ready to take this if it's  
given to them with factual data,'' said Alexander Haig, President 
Nixon's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The last presidential pay raise was granted in 1969, when it was  
doubled from $100,000. If the current $200,000 had been adjusted 
annually for inflation as measured by the consumer price index, it 
would now be $923,000, said Jane Weizmann, senior consultant for 
Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a human resources consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional Accountability  
Project, which is affiliated with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, 
argued that the president already earns more than 99 percent of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a high presidential compensation package begins to look  
as if the president were taking advantage of the taxpayers,'' 
Ruskin said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticizes Clinton on China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush today sharply  
criticized the Clinton administration over the theft of nuclear 
secrets by China, even though some of the espionage occurred while 
his own father was in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential  
nomination, said the congressional report calls into question the 
Clinton administration's China policies and response to the 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the balance of power is going to shift as a result of  
this. I think it's going to accelerate China's emergence as a 
nuclear power. And the next president and presidents after that are 
going to have to deal with that,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the chairman of the congressional investigating  
committee said China has stolen classified information about every 
currently deployed nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal and it is 
``exceptionally likely'' that Chinese spying continues to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush called for a congressional investigation into ``what went  
wrong and why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's report also shines a glaring light on the current  
administration's failed policies toward China,' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Presented with detailed information about China's espionage,  
the administration apparently did not take it seriously, did not 
react promptly and is still trying to minimize the scope and extent 
of the damage done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush acknowledged that the problem has been going on for years,  
including the time his father, George, was vice president and 
president. But he said he doesn't believe that gives Clinton an 
excuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that China has been stealing secrets during  
Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton. But there is only one 
administration that has been given the news; only one 
administration knew -- and that's the Clinton administration. The 
interesting question is when did they know? 
</P>
<P>
	``There are reports that the national security adviser knew in  
1996. Should I run and should be the president, I can assure you 
that if my national security adviser knew that secrets were being 
stolen, I'd want to know about it and I'd do something about it 
immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the espionage allegations, Bush said he still believes  
China and the United States should be trading partners and that 
China should be admitted to the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE>  Quaranta Wins Tour of Italy Stage 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CESENATICO, Italy (AP) -- Ivan Quaranta outdueled sprint  
specialist Mario Cipollini in the stretch Tuesday for his second 
stage victory in the Tour of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Frenchman Laurent Jalabert increased his lead in the standings  
over defending champion Marco Pantani as the 22-stage race hit its 
halfway point. Jalabert picked up four bonus points for being in 
second place at the checkpoint 25 miles from the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-mile run ended in Cesenatico, the Adriatic coast city  
where Pantani was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers added Cesenatico to the race's route this year to  
honor Pantani, who won both the Tour of Italy and Tour de France 
last summer. He tried but failed to cross the finish line first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pantani wanted to get ahead of me, because he wanted to arrive  
at his home in the pink jersey. But I didn't let him, because it's 
important to me, too, to wear this jersey,'' Jalabert said of the 
jersey always worn by the overall leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Quaranta, who won the race's opening stage, beat Cipollini by  
half a bicycle length and crossed the finish line in the unofficial 
time of 2 hours, 53 minutes and 49 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Cipollini was seeking to become the first rider to win  
consecutive stages this year. His victory Monday was the 27th Giro 
stage win of his career.

last summer. He tried but failed to cross the finish line first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pantani wanted to get ahead of me, because he wanted to arrive  
at his home in the pink jersey. But I didn't let him, because it's 
important to me, too, to wear this jersey,'' Jalabert said of the 
jersey always worn by the overall leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Quaranta, who won the race's opening stage, beat Cipollini by  
half a bicycle length and crossed the finish line in the unofficial 
time of 2 hours, 53 minutes and 49 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Cipollini was seeking to become the first rider to win  
consecutive stages this year. His victory Monday was the 27th Giro 
stage win of his career.

<HEADLINE>  Panel Urged To Double President Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House plan to double the president's  
$200,000 annual salary after President Clinton leaves office is 
overdue and can be sold to a skeptical public, former top aides to 
Democratic and Republican presidents are telling Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a business of polling. This is a question of  
equity,'' Kenneth Duberstein, who was chief of staff to President 
Reagan, told a House subcommittee on Monday. ``I think the American 
people will in fact support a significant pay raise for the 
president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duberstein was among seven top presidential assistants, joined  
by representatives of think tanks and experts on executive 
compensation, who testified to a House Government Reform 
subcommittee. Almost all supported current legislation to double 
the next president's salary, with many saying the increase should 
be even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's salary should reflect the importance the  
American people place on this job,'' said Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty 
III, who was Clinton's first chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Language raising the salary to $400,000 for whomever succeeds  
Clinton in January 2001 was included in a $13.7 billion spending 
bill for the Treasury, White House and other agencies approved May 
14 by a House Appropriations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan has the support of House GOP leaders, said top  
Republican aides. It is also backed by the Clinton administration, 
which submitted a statement warning that failing to grant the 
increase would keep other senior federal salaries too low and make 
it hard for the government to attract talented people. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Constitution, lawmakers may vote pay raises only for  
future presidents, not sitting ones. Republicans have been 
underlining that point because of Clinton's deep unpopularity 
within their party. 
</P>
<P>
	``This hearing is not about whether President Clinton should get  
a pay raise,'' said the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Stephen Horn, 
R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Also released at the hearing was a poll by the Pew Research  
Center for the People and the Press showing scant public support 
for increasing presidential pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, taken earlier this month, showed that when told the  
last presidential pay raise was in 1969, 49 percent favored an 
increase for the next president. Support dropped to 41 percent when 
the question noted that the president currently receives $200,000 
plus housing and travel expenses. And only one in four said the 
president's pay should be increased by more than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, most of the former presidential aides said the public  
would accept an increase to $400,000 once it learned all the 
reasons why it was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the American people are ready to take this if it's  
given to them with factual data,'' said Alexander Haig, President 
Nixon's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The last presidential pay raise was granted in 1969, when it was  
doubled from $100,000. If the current $200,000 had been adjusted 
annually for inflation as measured by the consumer price index, it 
would now be $923,000, said Jane Weizmann, senior consultant for 
Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a human resources consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional Accountability  
Project, which is affiliated with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, 
argued that the president already earns more than 99 percent of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a high presidential compensation package begins to look  
as if the president were taking advantage of the taxpayers,'' 
Ruskin said.

<HEADLINE> Rookies Must Learn in Indy 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Being a rookie in the Indianapolis 500 can  
be as intimidating as it gets for a driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of them will be in the 33-car lineup Sunday. They are  
virtually unknown and facing by far the biggest race of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Hollansworth Jr., Jaret Schroeder, Robby McGehee and  
Belgian Wim Eyckmans have a couple of experienced friends backing 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time Indy 500 champion Johnny Rutherford and four-time  
Indy winner Al Unser Sr. have a vested interest in the rookies. The 
two retired veterans have been hired by the Pep Boys Indy Racing 
League as driver coaches, a unique situation at the top level of 
motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like watching one of your own kids out there,''  
Rutherford said. ``You really, really want them to succeed. You're 
as nervous as they are -- maybe more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollansworth joined the Indy Racing League from the U.S. F2000  
series and the American IndyCar Series. The 35-year-old driver 
already has one-upped his father, who failed to make the Indy 
lineup in 1967. The younger Hollansworth began his IRL career this 
season with finishes of 19th in Orlando, Fla., and 15th in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder, 29, is a graduate of the Toyota-Atlantic series and  
finished 14th and 19th in his only two previous IRL starts -- both 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	McGehee, 25, was third last year in the F2000 series.  
</P>
<P>
	Eyckmans, 26, came up through the European Formula 3000 series  
and ran three Indy Lights races in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither McGehee nor Eyckmans has run in an IRL event.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know, these guys have a great aptitude for racing,''  
Rutherford said. ``During the rookie orientation, we had more 
problems with the engines than we had with the drivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 rookie class started out with nine drivers, but Mike  
Borkowski, Nick Firestone, Jaques Lazier, Dave Steele and Brian 
Tyler failed to make the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Borkowski and Steele crashed last week during practice; Lazier  
qualified but was bumped out of the lineup by a faster car; and 
Firestone and Tyler never came up with enough speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The four survivors now have a chance to establish themselves.  
But Rutherford says they face a ``huge learning curve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to forewarn them about what to expect out here on race  
day, as opposed to any other day they've had out here this month,'' 
said Rutherford, who retired in 1988 after 24 Indy starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an entirely different world with 400,000 people out here,  
and all the excitement and all that's going on around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the track, Rutherford said the biggest difference for the  
newcomers will be braking. 
</P>
<P>
	``You practice all month and you don't use any brakes because  
you're trying to learn how to go flat out all the way around,'' he 
said. ``When they drop the green flag on race day, it's a 
180-degree flip. You use the hell out of your brakes because the 
racetrack is totally different because of the traffic and 
turbulence out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, they'll learn how to handle it without a big  
incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder said he has not been intimidated at all since practice  
began May 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressures I thought would be here haven't been,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	As for nerves, Schroeder said, ``I've really tried not to let  
that aspect of it get to me. Right now, I'm just trying to treat 
this like any other race. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I want to do on Sunday is drive a safe, consistent race  
and make it to the checkered flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollansworth has much the same goal.  
</P>
<P>
	``The key thing is to just stay out of trouble, stay out of  
people's way until you get the rhythm of the race and pick it up as 
you go,'' he said. ``I know I'll be a little nervous on race 
morning, but there's a lot riding on this.''

<HEADLINE>  MSG Chief Apologizes to Van Gundy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy will remain in limbo for the  
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach of the New York Knicks met with the president of  
Madison Square Garden on Monday and received an apology for being 
lied to about the team's meeting with former Bulls coach Phil 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	But rather than put the issue completely to rest by assuring  
everyone that Van Gundy would remain as coach next season, team 
president Dave Checketts said no decisions will be made until the 
season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to make an evaluation on somebody or a judgment  
on what should happen in the organization based on one series, one 
shot or one win,'' Checketts said. ``He (Van Gundy) has agreed to 
that and he's comfortable with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy, however, was clearly uncomfortable with discussing  
the subject after the Knicks defeated the Atlanta Hawks 79-66 for a 
4-0 sweep of their second-round series. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not every day, after all, that one's boss comes into an  
underling's office and says he's sorry for lying to your face. 
</P>
<P>
	``He explained himself to me and I listened,'' Van Gundy said.  
``It's a non-issue to me. The only thing I was worried about was 
getting one more win, and now all I'm concerned with is trying to 
get back to the finals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the better part of the day Sunday, Checketts denied having  
any contact with Jackson despite two newspaper reports saying they 
sat down together to gauge Jackson's interest in the job. 
</P>
<P>
	But late in the afternoon, while Game 3 was still being played,  
Checketts confessed the truth. He was lambasted in Monday's papers 
as a shiftless corporate snake in a building of backstabbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret that I lied about it,'' Checketts said. ``We met for  
a couple of hours, and there were no offers exchanged. There was 
nothing that came out of the meeting other than getting acquainted 
with a guy who I felt was a tremendous option for us if we had not 
made the playoffs and needed a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, what I did is err on the side of protecting  
everyone. I had to do the job of finding out if I had an option 
like that,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, has been  
running the Knicks on a day-to-day basis since general manager 
Ernie Grunfeld was demoted in mid-April because of a rift between 
him and Van Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the unanswered questions surrounding the  
Checketts-Jackson meeting is who set it up. Checketts said he 
contacted Jackson through an intermediary, but he refused to say 
who it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Wyche, a spokesman for presidential candidate Bill Bradley,  
said the former Knicks forward was not the emissary.

<HEADLINE> California Cities Suing Gun Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A group of California cities and counties led  
by Los Angeles and San Francisco sued handgun makers Tuesday, 
hoping to force the weapons industry to pay for gun-related 
injuries and deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Using state laws against public nuisances and unfair business  
practices, the lawsuits claim the industry's marketing practices 
allow guns to fall into the hands of criminals and children. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to pay for the violence in this country,'' Los  
Angeles City Attorney James Hahn said. ``They need to pay for the 
bloodshed. They need to pay for the suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compton, West Hollywood, Sacramento, Berkeley, San Mateo County  
and Alameda County joined Los Angeles and San Francisco in the twin 
Superior Court actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits claim the industry floods areas with more guns than  
the legitimate market can absorb and doesn't place any controls on 
distributors or dealers to ensure the weapons don't fall into the 
wrong hands through illegal purchases or via ``straw buyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gunmakers' contracts with distributors don't use background  
checks to ensure dealers are not lawbreakers, according to the 
suits. They also claim gunmakers ignore safer gun technology, such 
as devices that allow only the registered owner to fire the 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	One gun manufacturer said the suits' issues have failed legal  
tests in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``These theories all been tried before and have all been shot  
down before,'' said Steve Sanetti, vice-president and general 
counsel of Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co., the largest and only publicly traded 
gun manufacturer in the United States. ``They have a very tough 
time to try to make these cases withstand legal scrutiny. These are 
political lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The claims in the California suits differ from other suits  
around the country in that they do not rely on product liability 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's absolutely ridiculous,'' said Robert Ricker,  
executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council. ``This 
industry follows the law. How can following the law be an unfair 
business practice?''

<HEADLINE> DC Tuition Bill Advances to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- District of Columbia high school graduates  
would get a break on their college tuition under a bill awaiting 
Senate consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed the $17 million measure by voice vote Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, District of Columbia high school graduates  
accepted to a public university outside the city would be treated 
as though they were residents of the school's state, thus allowing 
them to pay reduced in-state tuition to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Public colleges and universities charge higher tuition of  
students who come from outside the state that funds them than for 
students who are state residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors say the measure will help ``level the playing field''  
for D.C. graduates, who pay higher tuition to attend public 
colleges and universities other than the University of the District 
of Columbia, the city's open enrollment institution of higher 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city, by its very nature, lacks the capacity for a  
university system of higher education as that concept is understood 
in the 50 states,'' said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., a prime sponsor. 
``The same choices and opportunities simply do not exist for 
students and parents here as exist elsewhere in the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, the federal government would pay the  
difference in tuition rates through a fund administered by the 
city's mayor, who would award scholarships of up to $10,000 per 
academic year to qualified students. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also includes an incentive to keep talented District of  
Columbia students in the region, making them eligible for 
scholarships of up to $3,000 for attending private colleges in the 
District of Columbia, Maryland or Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which the Clinton administration supports, would  
not alter the admissions policies of any public college or 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	A competing Senate version, however, would restrict scholarship  
assistance to public universities in Maryland and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 974.

<HEADLINE> Starr Won't Retry Julie Hiatt Steele </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bowing after legal setbacks, Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr won't retry a Virginia woman accused of 
hindering his investigation, The Associated Press has learned. The 
case ended with a deadlocked jury earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr on Tuesday informed the federal judge who oversaw the case  
of Julie Hiatt Steele of his decision, according to legal sources 
familiar with his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel's move came after juries handed him  
consecutive setbacks in his efforts to punish witnesses he 
contended were uncooperative or gave false testimony that delayed 
his investigation. Jurors deadlocked in both the cases of Ms. 
Steele and Whitewater figure Susan McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr still has two more trials involving another witness he has  
accused of being uncooperative, presidential friend and former 
Justice Department official Webster Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell, who has already served prison time on charges brought  
by Starr, faces separate indictments alleging tax evasion and false 
testimony. The first of those trials is to begin in August. 
</P>
<P>
	But the decision in the Steele case is another sign that, in the  
aftermath of President Clinton's impeachment, Starr may be closer 
to winding down his five-year, $40 million-plus investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Starr's key deputies during the height of the  
investigation left his office to join private law firms this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office charged Ms. Steele, of Richmond, Va., with lying  
to federal investigators in her testimony that undercut the claims 
of presidential accuser Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey alleged Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance  
inside the White House in 1993 and that she told Ms. Steele 
immediately about the episode. Ms. Steele testified that Mrs. 
Willey had not told her about the incident and later asked her to 
lie about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Starr provided testimony from friends that Ms. Steele had  
indeed told them about Mrs. Willey's allegation shortly after the 
alleged incident occurred, a jury in northern Virginia earlier this 
deadlocked on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr had accused Mrs. McDougal, a former business partner of  
the president and first lady, of obstructing his investigation and 
defying a federal judge's order by refusing to testify before the 
grand jury that probed the Clintons' Arkansas business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	But a jury in April acquitted Mrs. McDougal of the obstruction  
charge and deadlocked on the two contempt of court charges. 
Mistrials were declared in both cases, giving the Starr the option 
to pursue the charges again.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed by Train in Conn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photo XWPT105, CTHAR101    	
</P>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- An apparently desperate woman and three  
of her sons were killed by an Amtrak train that struck them from 
behind as they trudged across a railroad bridge Tuesday in the 
middle of the night. A fourth son was critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the family was from Ecuador and had an  
``unstable'' housing situation. But few other details were 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``For children and an adult to be walking on train tracks at 2  
in the morning, obviously they were scared and had nowhere to go,'' 
said First Selectman Ken Flatto, the town's top elected official. 
``It's obvious they weren't going for a joy ride. This was a family 
in distress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boys were 3, 6, 10 and 12. The 6-year-old was the only  
survivor. The boy's left leg was severed by the train, and he 
suffered a grave head injury and fractures of his legs and pelvis. 
He lay in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twilight Shoreliner from Boston to Newport News, Va., struck  
the family as they crossed a trestle over a two-lane street in 
Fairfield, about 50 miles northeast of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The front of the train was splattered with blood. Lying amid the  
shattered bodies were books, backpacks, a small tennis shoe and a 
Sesame Street figurine. 
</P>
<P>
	James O'Donnell, police chief for the Metropolitan  
Transportation Authority, which owns the tracks, said the engineer 
reported seeing a child on the right side of the tracks. A 
split-second later, he saw a woman and three other children on the 
left side of the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman crossed the tracks in front of the oncoming train to  
reach the child, and the other youngsters followed, O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her last act was an attempt to save her other child,''  
O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell identified the survivor as Angel Gabriel Urgiles  
Toledo. The names of the other victims were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	A family friend identified the mother as Julia Urgiles, who  
according to WTIC-TV had recently been diagnosed with mental 
problems. The friend said Urgiles had vanished from her home for 
several days recently before her family found her in a Bridgeport 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Bridgeport hospital a cluster of Ecuadoreans prayed for  
the little boy the train spared. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are from our country,'' explained Washington Paredes of  
Stamford, who emigrated to the U.S. 20 years ago. ``We came to show 
support and to pray for little Angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Timileida Martorony, a fifth-grader at Angel's school, said the  
three oldest boys walked to school together. She said she knew one 
of the older boys, whom she identified as Carlos Urgiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was nice,'' Timileida said. ``He liked to draw.''  
</P>
<P>
	The train's event recorder -- the locomotive's ``black box'' --  
showed the train was doing 71 mph in a 75 mph zone, Amtrak 
spokesman Rick Remington said. The recorder also shows the engineer 
sounded the horn and applied the emergency brakes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Gambardella, an official with the state Transportation  
Department, said that at 75 mph, the train would have needed more 
than a mile to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The train had two electric locomotives, which are much quieter  
than diesel models, Gambardella said. The welded track in the area 
also reduces train noise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you can't hear these trains at all until they're  
right on top of you, and by then, of course, it's too late,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no injuries on the train, which had about 185  
passengers.

<HEADLINE> Schools May Be Liable in Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Aurelia Davis and her daughter LaShonda made it  
by the U.S. Supreme Court. Now comes the harder part: winning their 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Davises won a landmark decision against the Monroe County  
school system when the high court decided Monday that schools 
receiving federal funds can be sued in some cases in which a 
student sexually harasses another. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenters on the court noted that the case has potentially huge  
financial ramifications for schools across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Davises' lawsuit revived and heading back to a lower  
court, school officials remain confident they did nothing wrong in 
dealing with a male classmate's alleged harassment of LaShonda. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first I heard about it from Mrs. Davis was with a week  
left to go in school, and she said it had been going on since 
Christmas,'' Superintendent Charles Dumas said. ``So while we're 
disappointed in the ruling, we welcome the chance to tell our 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Davis sued the county school board and two officials over a  
five-month ``barrage of sexual harassment and abuse'' her daughter 
LaShonda allegedly endured from a fellow fifth-grader at Hubbard 
Elementary School in Forsyth, Ga., in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, identified in court papers as G.F., allegedly touched  
the girl's breasts, rubbed against her suggestively and repeatedly 
told her he wanted to have sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit states that LaShonda, now a high school junior, and  
her mother reported each incident to school officials but G.F. was 
never disciplined. The boy pleaded guilty to sexual battery after 
Mrs. Davis complained to the county sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit said the harassment caused LaShonda's grades to fall  
and had a debilitating effect on her mentally and emotionally. Her 
case was dismissed by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and 
appealed to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 5-4 ruling, the high court said that school officials can  
be held accountable only when they know about and are deliberately 
indifferent to sexual harassment ``so severe, pervasive and 
objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of 
access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the 
school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schools -- from elementary to college -- that accept federal money  
can be forced to pay victims of such harassment, the court said, 
adding that the legal standard is high enough to keep children and 
parents from making a case out of every playground taunt. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's dissenters were not convinced. ``After today, Johnny  
will find that the routine problems of adolescence are to be 
resolved by invoking a federal right to demand assignment to a desk 
two rows away,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Davis' lawyer, Verna Williams of the Washington-based  
National Women's Law Center, said the ruling put schools on notice 
to ``listen to your students and assist them before their learning 
environment becomes intolerable. Set up guidelines, make them 
well-known and respond to calls for help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumas said his district has already put stricter guidelines in  
place for documenting harassment claims and for handling such 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Davis, who said her daughter was ecstatic at news of the  
court victory, said the next step is ``to get with our lawyers to 
figure out where to go from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if she and LaShonda eventually lose the case, getting this  
far has been worth it, Mrs. Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what makes me proud, is that we were able to make a  
difference,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Ping Celebrates 40 Years of Putters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It started with two sugar cubes, two popsicle sticks and a  
``ping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karsten Solheim was working as a mechanical engineer for General  
Electric in 1959 when he developed the design for his 1-A putter, 
placing the sticks on each side of the cubes with a shaft in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon contact with a golf ball, the putter made a high-pitched  
ringing sound that gave birth to the brand name Ping. 
</P>
<P>
	The sleeve of a 78-rpm record made Solheim leave GE for a new  
career making clubs. On that sleeve is his sketch of a 
revolutionary idea for another putter -- the Ping Anser, which has 
become a model for today's most popular styles. 
</P>
<P>
	Having grown from such extraordinary roots, Ping is celebrating  
its 40th anniversary this year as a family run business that has 
helped shape the golf-equipment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The founder, who gave women's golf the Solheim Cup and has two  
college golf courses named for him, spends most of his time in a 
wheelchair now. Solheim has Parkinson's disease and is unable to 
communicate effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he has lunch with his wife every day at Moon Valley Golf  
Club. He also joined the Ping staff for pizza and soft drinks when 
it held a 40th birthday party this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing that he's helped so many people's golf games just made  
him feel real good inside,'' said John Solheim, his son and now 
president of Ping. 
</P>
<P>
	John Solheim was in junior high when his father began making the  
1-A putter in the garage of their Redwood City, Calif., home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dad had me drilling the holes in the putter head for the  
shaft,'' Solheim said. ``My brother was doing the grips. It turned 
into a family affair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking back over 40 years, Solheim went silent when asked what  
first comes to mind when Ping is mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the Anser putter, which has been used to win 500 events  
on professional tours around the world, or investment casting, 
another Solheim innovation aimed at improving product consistency. 
</P>
<P>
	Who can forget perimeter weighting on the Ping Eye2 irons?  
Solheim was the first to design clubs that distributed weight to 
the extremities, which increased the sweet spot and offered more 
forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Ping also put an ``L'' on a high-lofted club that has become  
part of golf's glossary these days -- the lob wedge. 
</P>
<P>
	John Solheim is just as enthused looking forward as looking back  
at 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He measured Ping's growth in double digits last year and  
anticipates a big push over the next 12 months. Having done well 
with its new TiSi driver, Ping plans to unveil a new line of 
fairway metals in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a low center of gravity, but not the shallow heads  
like what the current market trend is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The big surprise is what's in store next year. The company that  
has become known for its offset clubs with the modern cavity back 
plans to introduce its own line of blade irons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We totally believe in the offset club,'' Solheim said. ``There  
is part of the marketplace that refused to go with offset. We 
decided we're going to build a blade -- but not like every else's 
blade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, Ping will have come full circle. The company  
essentially took off when Karsten Solheim was looking for an answer 
to the blade putters that Arnold Palmer popularized by winning six 
major championship in a five-year span. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer, which became the Anser, can be found on the record  
sleeve and dated Jan. 16, 1966. The sketch shows a cavity-back 
design for heel-toe balance and the offset hosel. 
</P>
<P>
	The only problem was, Solheim wanted to fit the name on the back  
of the toe, and ``Answer'' was one letter too long. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really upset him because my mother told him to name it  
'Answer,''' Solheim said. ``The next morning she said, 'Why don't 
you take the 'w' out?' He took it out and it fit perfectly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ping got a boost when Julius Boros won the Phoenix Open the next  
year using the Ping Anser. Now, the company has a vault at its 
headquarters with more than 1,800 gold-plated replicas of putters 
that have won on the major professional tours around the world. It 
also sends a replica to the player. 
</P>
<P>
	Seve Ballesteros has the most of the gilded putters -- 45. He has  
used the Scottsdale Anser for most of his international victories, 
and Ping gave him another one for his role as captain of Europe's 
winning Ryder Cup team in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ping also has three gold-plated sand wedges in the vault from  
three memorable victories -- Bob Tway, holing out from the bunker on 
the 72nd hole of the 1986 PGA Championship; Paul Azinger doing the 
same thing in the 1993 Memorial; and Jeff Maggert chipping in for 
birdie on the 38th hole to win $1 million in the Match Play 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't always been smooth sailing for 40 years.  
</P>
<P>
	Ping also was out front by taking on the USGA and the PGA Tour  
over its use of square grooves. The controversy and subsequent 
lawsuits lingered for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ping agreed to reduce the width between the grooves the size of  
a human hair in settling a lawsuit with the USGA in 1990. Three 
years later, the PGA Tour backed away from its threat to require 
only V-shaped grooves in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the courtroom battles took a toll.  
</P>
<P>
	``His mind was not on golf clubs, it was on the lawsuit,'' John  
Solheim said of his father. ``That took a lot out of him. What 
Karsten really enjoyed was designing clubs and making them 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From a popsicle sticks and sugar cubes, Ping has been doing that  
for 40 years.

<HEADLINE> Martin Wins Kentucky GOP Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- A publicist edged a former Democrat on  
Tuesday for Kentucky's Republican gubernatorial nomination and will 
face heavily favored incumbent Gov. Paul Patton in the general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first Kentucky gubernatorial race in which an  
incumbent has been allowed to succeed himself. The state 
constitution was changed in 1992 to allow succession, which had 
been banned in Kentucky for nearly 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton was not challenged in the Democratic primary.  
</P>
<P>
	With 98 percent of precincts reporting in the GOP race, Peppy  
Martin had 19,173 votes, or 51 percent, while David L. Williams, 
who ran for the Senate as a Democrat a year ago, had 18,185 votes, 
or 49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Martin spent only $10,000 on her campaign, and Williams  
spent next to nothing. Williams, a onetime operator of a 
construction company who lives in a trailer with his running-mate 
wife, Joanna, a candidate for lieutenant governor, had declined 
interviews and had his telephone disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton is heavily favored to win re-election, largely because  
Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans on Kentucky voter 
registration rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Jonathan Miller, a former member of Vice President  
Al Gore's staff, won the Democratic nomination for state treasurer. 
Miller spent nearly $500,000 on the race, about 10 times his 
rival's total.

<HEADLINE> MTV Continues Anti-Violence Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As MTV prepared to tape the latest program in  
its anti-violence campaign, the urgency of the issue was again made 
clear: Six students had been shot at a Georgia school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, I'm watching it right now on CNN,'' MTV  
President Judy McGrath said as last week's tragedy unfolded. 
Another troubled student, another spasm of violence, another 
devastated community. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, MTV will offer ``Point Blank,'' a round-table  
discussion of gun control moderated by MTV News' John Norris. If 
the program matches the quality of the cable channel's other 
specials on violence, it will be worth watching. 
</P>
<P>
	In the torrent of words that followed Columbine High School's  
unspeakable agony, some of the most illuminating were heard on MTV. 
The channel was not part of the pack attempting to fix blame for 
the attack or exploit it -- it was ahead, and thoughtfully so. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, two days after the Littleton, Colo., campus shootings,  
MTV aired ``True Life: Warning Signs,'' a sensitive and 
constructive look at a teen-age couple's suicide, a boy who averted 
tragedy in his life and a school shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Evan Ramsey, an Alaska teen-ager convicted of murdering his  
principal and a fellow student in 1997, was among those profiled. 
Ramsey, serving a 210-year sentence, offered advice to other 
desperate youths. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation now, even though it's bad, the aftermath is even  
worse,'' a tearful Ramsey said. ``You have to tell somebody. It may 
seem that there's nobody that cares. There is; there is somebody 
that does care. I realized that too late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the timing, ``Warning Signs'' was not a quickie response  
to Columbine, just as ``Point Blank'' is not directly tied to the 
Conyers, Ga., shooting. They are volleys in MTV's carefully planned 
counter-violence effort involving such diverse contributors as the 
Justice Department and artists Lauryn Hill and Tori Amos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fight for Your Rights: Take a Stand Against Violence'' is  
intended to help MTV's young viewers understand and prevent 
violence in their lives and their world. The first program looked 
at the murder of gay student Matthew Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	While critics slam MTV and other elements of popular culture for  
creating a climate of violence, the music channel is trying to be 
part of the solution by examining the deeper and more realistic 
causes of youthful turmoil and potential tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Point Blank,'' to be taped Wednesday for its 8 p.m. EDT Friday  
airing, was to include as panelists David Kennedy from Harvard 
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government; James Fotis, 
executive director of the Law Enforcement Alliance of America; 
musician John Popper of Blues Traveler; and the mother of a 
10-year-old gunshot victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, when MTV was weighing its next public service  
campaign -- following such efforts as ``Rock the Vote'' -- it based 
its choice not on headlines but on viewer research, according to 
McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response was undeniable: Violence was the No. 1 thing on  
our audience's mind,'' the MTV president said. ``I was distressed 
because I thought, 'This is hard. It's tough.' But it's what 
they're talking and thinking about, so we have to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One finding that stood out for McGrath was that two-thirds of  
those polled said no one in their home or at school had ever had a 
serious conversation with them about violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel's research also showed that young people felt they  
were being excluded from the national debate, said Stephen K. 
Friedman, MTV's vice president for public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like there was a natural role for MTV to highlight  
what they had to say about the issue and also how they could take a 
stand and to show solutions,'' Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV developed the campaign in partnership with the federal  
departments of education and justice, the National Endowment for 
the Arts, the American Psychological Association, the Recording 
Industry Association of America and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Among upcoming specials: ``Scared Straight! '99,'' in which  
convicts confront young lawbreakers to try to break the cycle of 
crime; an update on child abuse victims previously profiled; a look 
at the rising number of hate crimes; a special edition of the 
``Unfiltered'' series in which young people are given a camera to 
document violence in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV also has created and is distributing a free ``action guide''  
that outlines ways young people can reduce violence in their 
community and lists resources available to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweetening the guide: A CD featuring songs from Hill, Amos,  
Alanis Morrisette, Backstreet Boys and more, and comments from the 
Beastie Boys' Adam Yauch and others. Copies are being distributed 
at concerts and are available from MTV. 
</P>
<P>
	Is there a conflict between the channel's role as a peacemaker  
and the music videos it plays -- some of which have been criticized 
as violent? 
</P>
<P>
	``I really do believe that the vast majority of the audience  
trusts us and likes us because we play the music they like and we 
believe they can handle the music we play,'' McGrath responded. 
``It doesn't glorify or suggest that violence is a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend in music is very much pop, very much positive.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....

	BUTTERFLY DELIGHT: Advanced film techniques are used to reveal  
the intricacies of butterflies in ``Magic Wings,'' debuting 9 p.m.

the world, the program offers glimpses into the behavior and social

<HEADLINE>  IRL Introduces Safety Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Unfortunately, the only place to crash test  
Indy cars at 200 mph is on a racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Leo Mehl and the rest of the top officials of the  
Indy Racing League say they can't guarantee that the introduction 
of a ``suspension wheel energy management system'' will insure the 
safety of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody can test at 200 mph, and our cars spend a great deal of  
their racing life over 200,'' said Mehl, the executive director of 
the IRL and vice president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. ``A 
normal crash creates 60 to 85 G's of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any of us are sure what's going to happen when  
you hit at 85 G's. I think it's going to be much better. I think 
we're going to have less wheels, less suspensions running around in 
the middle of the racetrack that can be run into. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anybody would be crazy to say this system is going to  
retain every wheel at 210 miles per hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``I think we're doing everything possible to make it  
as safe for the fans as it can be. I mean, there isn't a 100 
percent guarantee that we're going to walk out there and not get 
run over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mehl said the system designed to keep suspension parts from  
flying off the open-wheel cars will be installed prior to 
Thursday's two-hour ``Carburetion Day'' practice. That is the only 
time between the end of qualifications and the 500-mile race that 
the 33 starters can drive on the speedway oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's announcement of the move to tether the suspension parts  
to the Indy cars came just 24 days after the tragedy at Lowe's 
Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., where flying wheel and suspension 
parts flew into the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
	Three spectators also were killed and several others injured  
last July at Michigan Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich., by a wheel and 
other debris from a crash during a CART event. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of those tracks are high-speed, high-banked ovals.  
</P>
<P>
	Formula One began the 1999 season with a tethering system on its  
cars, while Championship Auto Racing Teams, the IRL's U.S.-based 
rival, will debut similar wheel and suspension restraints -- though 
for the front wheels only -- Saturday in the Motorola 300 in 
Madison, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Anderson, team manager of three-time defending CART champion  
Target-Chip Ganassi Racing, said this is all just a first step in 
an evoluation toward more safety for spectators and drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a big investment in our fans and in the drivers, and  
we can't afford to hurt either one,'' Anderson said from the team's 
race shop two miles from the speedway. ``We've lost six fans in the 
last year and there's no way of telling how many people that has 
stopped from coming to races. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to react in a hurry to get something rolling. We're  
following Formula One's lead, and this is the best first step we 
could take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eliseo Salazar, who has finished fourth and sixth at Indy and  
will be starting 18th on Sunday, said, ``It's absolutely necessary 
we try something. Nobody can say if this will be 100 percent 
efficient, but it's crucial we never put the spectators in that 
position again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL announcement said all four suspensions on its cars will  
be attached to the chassis with multiple cables of Zylon -- a space 
age fiber Mehl said is two times stronger than Kevlar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has a breaking strength of five tons,'' said Mehl, who  
added that it's the same material being used by Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
	One worry about using restraints is the possibility that  
tethered suspension pieces or wheels could rebound into the open 
cockpit, hitting the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mehl said the IRL believes its system will actually make the  
drivers safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of loose pieces out there right now (in a  
crash),'' Mehl said. ``The more we can keep attached to the car, 
the better off the driver and the spectators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cables will connect the rear hubs and the front hubs and  
will also be attached to the farthest points from the driver on the 
frame. Mehl said they should not be able to reach the driver's 
compartment in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	But, even if they could reach the cockpit, most of the drivers  
have said they'd rather be at more risk than put spectators in 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people say it might be dangerous for the drivers,''  
Salazar said. ``We live for this, and we know what can happen. You 
never want to put other people in the way of harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restraints will not keep the tire itself from flying off in  
a severe crash, but Phil Casey, technical director for the IRL, 
said the problems have been caused not by the tire, which is 
attached to the hub with a locking pin, but by the hub and 
suspension pieces being sheared off the cars and taking the tire 
with it.

<HEADLINE> Ex-AOL Volunteers File Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two former volunteers for America Online Inc.  
who helped advise the online giant's millions of customers filed a 
lawsuit Tuesday alleging that AOL violated labor laws by failing to 
pay them minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Hallissey of New York and Brian A. Williams of Dallas  
filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, seeking to 
obtain class-action status so that as many as 10,000 AOL volunteers 
can benefit from any outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleged that the volunteers were entitled to hourly  
wages and overtime wages to be determined as the case proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallissey and Williams are among the thousands of volunteers who  
lead chat rooms, report violations of Internet rules and answer 
questions from puzzled users. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early days of the Internet, before companies went public  
and grew to be worth billions of dollars, scholars of all kinds 
frequently contributed their services to further the fledgling 
communication device. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Brackbill, a spokeswoman for the Dulles, Va.-based company,  
said the company had not seen the complaint, and therefore could 
not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the company believes that its actions comply with the law,  
that the community leader program reflects industry practices and 
that the community leaders are volunteers and not employees,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said in a telephone interview that he had worked an  
average of 40 hours a week for AOL for more than three years before 
quitting a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was motivated to volunteer because of the sense of  
community on the Internet and his desire to help other people, a 
spirit that AOL seemed to capture well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now they've changed to where they just want to make a  
dollar,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Wrestler's Family Criticizes WWF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The family of Owen Hart lashed out at pro  
wrestling officials, saying they took too many chances by devising 
stunts like the one that killed him. ``My poor brother Owen was a 
sacrifice for the ratings,'' his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, a member of a prominent Canadian wrestling family,  
plummeted 70 feet or more to his death Sunday at Kemper Arena in 
Kansas City as he was being lowered into the ring from the arena's 
ceiling. At the World Wrestling Federation's event the next night, 
in St. Louis, some wrestlers wept openly, as did some of the 19,000 
fans at the sold-out Kiel Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Kansas City said today they were still trying to  
determine what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's brother Bret, also a wrestling star, told ABC's ``Good  
Morning America'' today that his brother had been worried about the 
stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This idea was taken to him,'' Bret Hart said. ``There was a  
bit of discomfort about the danger in it. But somehow over the 
weekend he got talked into doing it again. He was very uneasy about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said there should have been ``some kind of a safety cable.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We're professional wrestlers; we take our falls on the mat,  
inside the ring,'' Hart said. ``I was never a stuntman, and my 
brother Owen was never a stuntman. He never should have been put in 
a situation where he was up on the top of a ceiling of an arena to 
go into the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bret Hart, known as ``The Hitman,'' is a star on the World  
Championship Wrestling circuit, rival to his brother's 
organization, the World Wrestling Federation. They are sons of Stu 
Hart, a member of Canada's Olympic wrestling team in the 1940s. All 
seven of his sons went into wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellie Hart, a sister, said both organizations were trying more  
and more tricky stunts to attract fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, wrestling was getting so far out and my poor brother  
Owen was a sacrifice for the ratings, that's how I look at it,'' 
she said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's widow, Martha, said: ``I think if you're asked to do some  
ridiculous stunt from 90 feet in the air, that the least they could 
do is consider safety first before ratings or, you know, how it 
looks to the fans. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not doing very well at all, and -- and I miss my husband,  
and I'm just sad for myself that I'm a widow at 32, and I have two 
children that are fatherless now. It's very hard for all of us,'' 
she said this morning on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WWF spokeswoman Susan Warner said the organization had no  
comment on the family's statements. ``We don't want to get into a 
'he said, he said' situation over this. Our thoughts are with Owen 
Hart's family,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's death was all the more shocking to fans because the  
performers aren't supposed to get hurt -- no matter how painful the 
pounding seems. Even after Hart hit the canvas, many of the 16,200 
Kansas City fans thought the stunt was part of the scripted 
theatrics that have helped fuel the explosion of popularity in 
wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	More improvisational theater than sport, pro wrestling has been  
likened to soap opera for men, complete with storylines, subplots 
and love triangles. The eternal themes are respect, revenge and 
redemption. 
</P>
<P>
	In popular weekly broadcasts on cable television, wrestling has  
the flash and thunder of a rock concert, the costume and color of a 
Broadway production. 
</P>
<P>
	In that vein, Hart was about to make another of his dramatic  
entrances Sunday night. He had been attached to wires near the top 
of Kemper Arena, whose ceiling is 90 feet above the floor. The plan 
was for him to descend into the ring in ``superhero-type fashion,'' 
WWF President Vince McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the wrestler plunged into the ring. His head hit a  
padded turnbuckle, a metal coupling that holds the ring's ropes 
together, and snapped backward. Hart struggled to lift his head and 
his arms rose slowly, about a foot off the mat, then collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics rushed into the ring, unraveling Hart's trademark  
``Blue Blazer'' mask and unsuccessfully trying to resuscitate him. 
He was pronounced dead at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Keller, editor of the Pro Wrestling Torch newsletter, said  
it was the first fatal accident he knew of in U.S. wrestling since 
1969, when Mike DiBiase died of a heart attack during a match in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon said WWF wrestlers will stop performing the aerial move,  
but other stunts will continue. The WWF has scrapped plans to 
replay Sunday's event on pay-per-view TV and called off live events 
in Peoria, Ill.; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Hamilton, Ontario; Montreal 
and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Kansas City event resumed after about 15 minutes, and  
the show in St. Louis went on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of respect for Owen, knowing the consummate performer he  
was, I'm sure members of the Hart family would concur with me that 
he would want the show to go on,'' McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellie Hart agreed that her brother, ``being the kind of person  
he was, would have wanted Vince to continue. That's the nature of 
wrestling.'' But she said she thought Sunday's event should have 
been halted.

<HEADLINE> ProXeed Claims To Aid in Fertility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A company is beginning to market a  
nonprescription fertility aid to couples struggling to have a baby, 
saying the dietary supplement may improve a man's sperm quality. 
</P>
<P>
	The direct-to-consumer marketing of proXeed gives fertility  
specialists a dilemma: Some are intrigued enough to try the product 
on their own patients even as they caution there's no proof yet 
that it works. 
</P>
<P>
	But doctors urged Americans to see a physician before buying  
proXeed on the Internet, because there are too many other causes of 
male infertility -- occasionally life-threatening ones -- that 
proXeed won't help but regular medicine can. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious and excited to see how it works, but I'd not at  
this point tell patients it's going to work,'' said Dr. Larry 
Lipshultz, a Baylor College of Medicine urologist and president of 
the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	ProXeed isn't thought to cause side effects, so ``the only thing  
you have to lose is the $100 a month you're going to spend,'' added 
Lipshultz, who is giving it to patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Other options such as in vitro fertilization can cost thousands.  
</P>
<P>
	Up to 40 percent of conception difficulties are believed caused,  
at least partly, by poor sperm. That means 2.5 million American 
couples potentially could try proXeed, said Sigma-Tau Consumer 
Products, which begins marketing the citrus-flavored drink mix to 
consumers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	ProXeed contains two types of L-carnitine, a compound naturally  
present in the body important for cellular metabolism. People 
absorb L-carnitine mostly from red meat and dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists know L-carnitine is highly concentrated in  
sperm-related tissues. The theory: Perhaps men with low sperm 
counts or poor sperm quality -- such as sperm that don't swim well -- 
lack L-carnitine. Small European studies suggest taking specific 
amounts of L-carnitine and a metabolite, acetylcarnitine, for three 
to six months gave subfertile men more normal sperm. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't create super fertility.  
</P>
<P>
	``ProXeed's not a miracle drug. It does one thing: It optimizes  
sperm quality, and it does that very well,'' said Brad Stewart of 
Sigma-Tau, an Italian-based company that also sells prescription 
drug versions of L-carnitine, including one sold here to treat a 
rare metabolic disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The European research is promising, but ``it's not all that  
firm, in all honesty,'' cautioned Dr. Jon Pryor of the University 
of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	He will perform the first U.S. study this summer, giving up to  
80 men at his clinic and Brown University either proXeed or a dummy 
pill. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors are reassured about trying proXeed because the Food and  
Drug Administration says the prescription L-carnitine that treats 
metabolic disease has proved very safe. 
</P>
<P>
	But L-carnitine also is sold as a dietary supplement, and  
dietary supplements are largely unregulated. The FDA cracks down 
only on dangerous ones, or those claiming to treat disease like a 
drug. FDA officials could not say if ``optimizing sperm quality'' 
would cross that line. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers, however, can buy supplements without ever consulting  
a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't do that, Pryor urged infertile men. Much male infertility  
is something treatable like a hormone imbalance that proXeed won't 
affect, and a few men even may have testicular cancer or another 
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Sigma-Tau promised to pass that message to customers, and says  
it is working closely with fertility specialists ``to develop the 
science'' behind proXeed. 
</P>
<P>
	So why not seek FDA approval as a fertility drug rather than  
sell it as a supplement? It would take about $100 million more 
research -- and wouldn't prevent unregulated competitors sold in 
health food stores from claiming to work as well, said Stewart, who 
will sell proXeed on the Internet and by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Other L-carnitine supplements are sold mostly for weight loss,  
something Sigma-Tau's testing shows doesn't work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sperm enhancement requires precise amounts of two specific  
types, not just any L-carnitine, Stewart added -- and he cited a 
1993 Duke University analysis of L-carnitine supplements that found 
most did not contain the amount promised on the products' labels 
regardless.

<HEADLINE> American Buys Sudan Slaves' Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In the 19th century, abolitionists came to Faneuil  
Hall to champion their antislavery cause. Now the Colonial meeting 
house is a tourist attraction with souvenirs and street musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Charles Jacobs, it's still a place to speak out about  
the injustices of slavery. He has plenty to talk about: He heads a 
group that buys people out of slavery in northern Africa -- usually 
for about $50 a person. 
</P>
<P>
	UNICEF and other human rights groups criticize the practice by  
saying it encourages slavery by creating a market, but Jacobs says 
his work is essential. He is scheduled to testify before Congress 
about the subject on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is both sweet and sad,'' said Jacobs, a white man in his  
50s. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Jacobs was working for a management consulting firm.  
Then he happened to read a magazine article about millions of 
slaves being sold: as prostitutes in Thailand, charcoal workers in 
Brazil, brick kiln operators in Pakistan and bonded farmers in 
India. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided to find a new career speaking out against slavery --  
specifically in Africa. ``How many people have a chance to do 
something that's important?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs co-founded the American Anti-Slavery Group and has since  
raised $35,000 to buy and free nearly 350 slaves in Sudan. Civil 
war has led Arab Muslim northerners there to capture and enslave 
black villagers who practice Christianity and traditional tribal 
religions. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of Abuk Deng Akuei is typical of those recounted by  
American Anti-Slavery. The Christian teen-age girl was captured by 
an Arab militia that raided her Sudanese village in 1997. She was 
sold to a man who beat her, raped her, forcibly circumcised her and 
made her work in the fields and sleep with his cows and goats. 
</P>
<P>
	She was freed by Christian Solidarity International, a Swiss  
organization that does the dangerous work of buying slaves from 
Arab middlemen, according to Jacobs' group. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mauritania, another African country, slavery was declared  
illegal in 1980, but human rights groups say it is still widely 
practiced. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said slave owners there won't allow their slaves' freedom  
to be bought, but his organization pays for people like Moctar 
Teyeb, a Mauritanian slave who escaped to America four years ago, 
to travel around the country and tell his story. 
</P>
<P>
	At churches, schools and abolitionist conferences, Teyeb rolls  
up a sleeve and describes how his master broke his arm when he was 
9 and refused to have it set. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs has persuaded students from at least 100 schools around  
the country to raise money to buy slaves their freedom, and 
American Anti-Slavery has chapters in several other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	UNICEF, however, has severely criticized the practice of buying  
freedom for slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Bellamy, executive director of the United Nations' group,  
said in March, ``The sobering truth is that these efforts will not 
end the enslavement of human beings.''

<HEADLINE>  IRL Introduces Safety Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Unfortunately, the only place to crash test  
Indy cars at 200 mph is on a racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Leo Mehl and the rest of the top officials of the  
Indy Racing League say they can't guarantee that the introduction 
of a ``suspension wheel energy management system'' will insure the 
safety of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody can test at 200 mph, and our cars spend a great deal of  
their racing life over 200,'' said Mehl, the executive director of 
the IRL and vice president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. ``A 
normal crash creates 60 to 85 G's of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any of us are sure what's going to happen when  
you hit at 85 G's. I think it's going to be much better. I think 
we're going to have less wheels, less suspensions running around in 
the middle of the racetrack that can be run into. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anybody would be crazy to say this system is going to  
retain every wheel at 210 miles per hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``I think we're doing everything possible to make it  
as safe for the fans as it can be. I mean, there isn't a 100 
percent guarantee that we're going to walk out there and not get 
run over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mehl said the system designed to keep suspension parts from  
flying off the open-wheel cars will be installed prior to 
Thursday's two-hour ``Carburetion Day'' practice. That is the only 
time between the end of qualifications and the 500-mile race that 
the 33 starters can drive on the speedway oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's announcement of the move to tether the suspension parts  
to the Indy cars came just 24 days after the tragedy at Lowe's 
Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., where flying wheel and suspension 
parts flew into the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
	Three spectators also were killed and several others injured  
last July at Michigan Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich., by a wheel and 
other debris from a crash during a CART event. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of those tracks are high-speed, high-banked ovals.  
</P>
<P>
	Formula One began the 1999 season with a tethering system on its  
cars, while Championship Auto Racing Teams, the IRL's U.S.-based 
rival, will debut similar wheel and suspension restraints -- though 
for the front wheels only -- Saturday in the Motorola 300 in 
Madison, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Anderson, team manager of three-time defending CART champion  
Target-Chip Ganassi Racing, said this is all just a first step in 
an evoluation toward more safety for spectators and drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a big investment in our fans and in the drivers, and  
we can't afford to hurt either one,'' Anderson said from the team's 
race shop two miles from the speedway. ``We've lost six fans in the 
last year and there's no way of telling how many people that has 
stopped from coming to races. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to react in a hurry to get something rolling. We're  
following Formula One's lead, and this is the best first step we 
could take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eliseo Salazar, who has finished fourth and sixth at Indy and  
will be starting 18th on Sunday, said, ``It's absolutely necessary 
we try something. Nobody can say if this will be 100 percent 
efficient, but it's crucial we never put the spectators in that 
position again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL announcement said all four suspensions on its cars will  
be attached to the chassis with multiple cables of Zylon -- a space 
age fiber Mehl said is two times stronger than Kevlar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has a breaking strength of five tons,'' said Mehl, who  
added that it's the same material being used by Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
	One worry about using restraints is the possibility that  
tethered suspension pieces or wheels could rebound into the open 
cockpit, hitting the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mehl said the IRL believes its system will actually make the  
drivers safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of loose pieces out there right now (in a  
crash),'' Mehl said. ``The more we can keep attached to the car, 
the better off the driver and the spectators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cables will connect the rear hubs and the front hubs and  
will also be attached to the farthest points from the driver on the 
frame. Mehl said they should not be able to reach the driver's 
compartment in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	But, even if they could reach the cockpit, most of the drivers  
have said they'd rather be at more risk than put spectators in 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people say it might be dangerous for the drivers,''  
Salazar said. ``We live for this, and we know what can happen. You 
never want to put other people in the way of harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restraints will not keep the tire itself from flying off in  
a severe crash, but Phil Casey, technical director for the IRL, 
said the problems have been caused not by the tire, which is 
attached to the hub with a locking pin, but by the hub and 
suspension pieces being sheared off the cars and taking the tire 
with it.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Season Ends With a Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- By the end, the Atlanta Hawks were too old, too  
banged up and too worn out. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger legs of the New York Knicks ran circles around the  
Hawks, sweeping them out of the playoffs in four straight games. 
Once again, Atlanta failed to make it past the second round, which 
has been the case every year since the franchise moved from St. 
Louis in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, you want to go farther,'' Mookie Blaylock said.  
``I'm not going to look back and say we did a great job, because we 
didn't. We didn't go nowhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the Hawks probably lost any hope of making an extended  
playoff run when they needed five exhausting games to beat Detroit 
in the opening round. Plagued by injuries, the Hawks were forced to 
use five 30-something starters in the deciding contest -- all of 
them playing at least 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was time to meet New York, the Hawks had nothing left.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are disappointed,'' coach Lenny Wilkens said. ``Real  
disappointed, because they feel they are a better team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all fairness, the Hawks were hardly at full strength by the  
end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPhonso Ellis, the team's most noteworthy addition after the  
lockout, lasted only 20 games before he was sidelined for the 
season with a sports hernia. Alan Henderson haggled over a new 
contract, was plagued by myriad injuries, then was knocked out for 
good when an eye abrasion in the final days of the regular season 
left him with double-vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Crawford took over for Ellis and showed promise, but he  
missed three playoff games with a separated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say if we had this or if we had that,'' Blaylock  
said. ``We didn't have it and we had to go play with what we had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What they had was very little depth, a familiar bugaboo for this  
team over the last couple of seasons and one that management worked 
hard to correct after the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant Long, who resurrected his career after two lost seasons in  
Detroit, was a valued player off the bench. But his weaknesses were 
exposed in the playoffs when he was forced into the lineup for 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Anthony Johnson, who had a solid rookie season in  
Sacramento, played erratically after signing with the Hawks. Ed 
Gray, the No. 1 pick in 1997, was even more of a disappointment. 
Instead of providing needed scoring punch off the bench, he shot 
less than 30 percent from the field, played only 30 games and spent 
a night in jail after being arrested on marijuana charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas the Knicks had Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby to  
energize their offense, the Hawks had no one to turn to when Steve 
Smith was shooting poorly and Dikembe Mutombo was being 
double-teamed in the low post. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Atlanta has shown all through the regular season that  
it was woefully inadequate at the offensive end. The Hawks averaged 
86.3 points per game, beating only the woeful Chicago Bulls. More 
telling, they averaged less than 16 assists per game, by far the 
lowest figure in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaylock, the point guard, failed to keep the offense moving,  
seeming to age right before our eyes as the season went along. He 
often resorted to sitting outside and heaving 3-pointers, but made 
only 37.9 percent for his lowest shooting percentage since his 
rookie season in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their flaws, the Hawks have plenty of reason for  
optimism: 
</P>
<P>
	--A move into the 20,000-seat Philips Arena next season, giving  
the team its first true home court since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	--Four first-round picks in the upcoming draft, providing general  
manager Pete Babcock with an opportunity to package some picks for 
a higher selection. 
</P>
<P>
	--Room under the salary cap to upgrade the bench even more.  
</P>
<P>
	For now, though, the team is trying to get over the  
disappointment of being swept by the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't give ourselves a good enough test,'' Blaylock said.  
``If we go out and play the way we're able to play, we can win some 
games. But we played terrible all four games.''

<HEADLINE> Starr Won't Retry McDougal, Steele </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bowing to legal setbacks, Kenneth Starr  
decided Tuesday he won't retry Whitewater figure Susan McDougal and 
another woman accused of hindering his investigation. Both cases 
ended in mistrials this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking many legal battles all the way to the Supreme Court  
to uphold ``the rule of law,'' Starr said prosecuting anew Mrs. 
McDougal and Julie Hiatt Steele wasn't worth the trouble given 
earlier hung juries in the two cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retrials raise important questions of resource allocation,....  
The jury's inability to reach a unanimous verdict is a reality that 
we have taken seriously,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel's decision Tuesday came after juries  
handed him consecutive setbacks in his effort to punish two 
witnesses he contended were uncooperative or gave false testimony, 
and delayed his investigation. Jurors deadlocked in both trials. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement also brought Starr a couple of steps closer to  
winding up a $40 million investigation that produced only the 
second impeachment ever of a U.S. president. Three of Starr's key 
deputies have left this spring for private law practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe he would have gotten a conviction and he would  
only have put my family through the misery of a retrial. I think he 
did the right thing,'' said William Henley, one of Mrs. McDougal's 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's decision ends five years of legal warfare with Mrs.  
McDougal, who with her late ex-husband, started the Whitewater land 
venture with the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	She was sent to prison after being convicted in the first  
Whitewater trial in 1996, was also jailed for refusing a judge's 
order to answer Starr's questions before a grand jury and then was 
tried this year for obstruction. From her jail cell to television 
interviews, Mrs. McDougal incessantly attacked Starr's motives and 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyer, who also made Starr's tactics an issue in  
her client's trial, said the decision reflected an assessment that 
``this was a case that could not be won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever his motivation, we are pleased and relieved,''  
attorney Nancy Luque said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr still has two more trials involving another witness he has  
accused of being uncooperative, presidential friend and former 
Justice Department official Webster Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell, who has already served prison time on charges brought  
by Starr, faces separate indictments alleging tax evasion and false 
testimony. The first of those trials is set to begin in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr had accused Mrs. McDougal, a former business partner of  
the president and first lady, of obstructing his investigation and 
defying a federal judge's order by refusing to testify before the 
grand jury that probed the Clintons' Arkansas business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury in April acquitted Mrs. McDougal of the obstruction  
charge and deadlocked on the contempt of court charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office charged Ms. Steele, of Richmond, Va., with lying  
to federal investigators in testimony that undercut the claims of 
presidential accuser Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey alleged Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance  
inside the White House in 1993 and that she told Ms. Steele 
immediately about the episode. Ms. Steele testified that Mrs. 
Willey had not told her about the incident and later asked her to 
lie about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Starr provided testimony from friends that Ms. Steele had  
indeed told them about Mrs. Willey's allegation shortly after the 
alleged incident occurred, a jury in northern Virginia deadlocked 
and a mistrial was declared. 
</P>
<P>
	In both cases, defense lawyers made an issue of the tactics used  
by Starr's office in pursuing a wide-ranging investigation that 
included the Clintons' Whitewater business dealings, the gathering 
of FBI files inside the White House the firing of the White House 
travel office and the Monica Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, who served prison time on Whitewater-related  
charges earlier in the investigation, testified in her own defense. 
She said she refused to talk to the grand jury because she feared 
that Starr would punish her if she did not give testimony that 
matched his theory of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers surprised many by resting their case  
without calling any witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent interviews, jurors described widely varying views of  
Starr's work. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Thomas, the jury foreman in the McDougal case, said he  
was put off by the ``arrogance'' of Starr's prosecutors and that 
some jurors were convinced that Mrs. McDougal's fears were 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jack Hawxhurst, the jury foreman in the Steele case, said  
the evidence against Ms. Steele lied was ``very persuasive'' and 
Starr should have sought a retrial.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Finally Get New Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Washington Redskins finally got their new  
owner, who's paying more money for a franchise than anyone in 
sports history. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners today voted 31-0 to approve the sale of the Redskins  
to Daniel Snyder for $800 million from the trustees of the estate 
of Jack Kent Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was a member of the group headed by Howard Milstein that  
withdrew its bid after it became apparent the owners wouldn't 
approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record price for a professional sports franchise  
was $530 million, paid by Al Lerner last year for the expansion 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four of the 31 owners needed to vote in favor of the  
sale, which also includes the new Jack Kent Cooke Stadium. Now 
Snyder, a 34-year-old communications executive, becomes the 
youngest owner in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The widely expected action by the owners today came at the start  
of their two-day meeting. The finance committee last week 
recommended that the sale go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder has said that for this season he will retain Redskins  
general manager Charley Casserly and coach Norv Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings will be devoted largely to franchise issues,  
although the owners also will get a look at the new replay system. 
Replay, in effect from 1986-91, was voted back in last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are expected to discuss the New England Patriots'  
decision to stay in the Boston area after withdrawing a commitment 
to Hartford, Conn. Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci signed 
legislation Monday that will provide $70 million to help the 
Patriots build a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most pressing issue might concern Los Angeles. The  
expansion and finance committees met Monday night to hear the 
presentations from the two groups seeking franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	One group is led by entertainment agent Michael Ovitz and the  
other is headed by real estate moguls Eli Broad and Ed Roski. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz's plan for the Los Angeles Coliseum includes a parking  
garage covered with trees, grass in front of luxury suites and a 
cooling system that would spray mist on sweltering fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, first reported Sunday in The Los Angeles Times, seems  
to have impressed most of the owners who have seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exciting juxtaposition of ancient architecture with  
the Los Angeles scene,'' said Carmen Policy, president of the 
Browns, who will become the 31st team this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Times today reported that local and state lawmakers  
oppose Ovitz's plan as long as it requires using an estimated $225 
million in taxpayers' money to build parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 2.5 million uninsured children and adults in this county,  
with 75,000 children in foster care ... with sidewalks that can't 
be repaired by the city? Give me a break,'' Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm against giving any city taxpayer money to bring football  
to Los Angeles,'' Mayor Richard Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Assemblyman Roderick Wright of Los Angeles: ``Why should a  
lady in Fresno pay for parking spaces for the Coliseum?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the March meetings, the league tentatively awarded Los  
Angeles the 32nd franchise over Houston. But the NFL told Los 
Angeles it needed to come up with a viable plan by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad contends his plan is more practical because of his  
relationships with area agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said I don't want to be negative, but I hope you choose a  
plan that is not only dazzling, but is also feasible and will get 
built,'' Broad said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the group on Monday reportedly waived that two-year  
exclusivity agreement with the Coliseum Commission for renovating 
the stadium and owning a Coliseum team. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL already has chosen the Coliseum, the Roski-Broad site,  
as the setting for the new stadium. But Ovitz's plan might give his 
group the edge. 
</P>
<P>
	The franchise will replace the Rams and Raiders, who defected to  
St. Louis and Oakland after the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broad-Roski group claims to hold a special right to bring  
the NFL back to the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	If the owners decide on Ovitz's plan, their claim could hurt Los  
Angeles' chance of meeting the deadline set by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	League officials also have said if Los Angeles seemed close to a  
new plan, it might be considered to have met the deadline.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Wants 2010 Winter Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Muju, a resort village in South Korea,  
will officially open a campaign to serve as the host for the 2010 
Winter Olympics by launching a bid committee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will be led by Kim Un-yong, chairman of the Korean  
Olympic Committee and an executive board member of the 
International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Muju's bid has been endorsed by the Korean Olympic Committee.  
Muju, 120 miles southeast of Seoul, was the site of the 1997 Winter 
University Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 18 facilities are needed for a site to serve as a  
host for the Winter Olympics. Muju plans to use 11 existing 
facilities and build the others, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The site for the 2010 Winter Olympics will be selected by 2003.  
</P>
<P>
	The Winter Games have been staged only twice in Asia -- in Japan  
in 1972 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Seoul, South Korea's capital, was host to the 1988 Summer Games.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules for Sun Over Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Several Microsoft Corp. products,  
including Windows 98, infringed Sun Microsystems Inc.' copyrights, 
a federal judge said in a nonbinding, tentative ruling on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the ruling -- issued by U.S. District Court in San Jose  
-- said that Microsoft can develop and distribute ``independently 
developed'' tools that do not comply with a contract with Sun, so 
long as such products do not infringe any Sun copyright, patent or 
other intellectual property right. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-part ruling will be finalized -- and possibly changed --  
after oral arguments scheduled in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, based in Palo Alto, has tried to promote its programming  
language Java as a universal language that can be used with any 
form of software. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sued Microsoft, contending that the Redmond,  
Wash.-based computer company used its licensed version of Java to 
design a Windows-only form that was incompatible with rival 
software, in violation of a contract.

<HEADLINE>  NY Cop Pleads Guilty in Louima Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A white police officer pleaded guilty today to  
federal civil rights charges for sodomizing a Haitian immigrant 
with a wooden stick in a vicious precinct-house assault that 
created a national outcry against police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Volpe, 27, the ringleader in the attack on Abner Louima,  
faces up to life in prison without parole in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	With his hands clasped in front of him and his voice showing  
signs of nervousness, Volpe -- who agreed to plead guilty after a 
string of witnesses against him -- made his first public admission 
of what happened in the Brooklyn stationhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the bathroom of the precinct, I sodomized Mr. Abner Louima  
with a stick, then threatened to kill him if he told anybody,'' 
Volpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wanted to intimidate, did you not?'' Judge Eugene  
Nickerson asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' the officer replied.  
</P>
<P>
	The jury was out of the courtroom when Volpe entered his plea in  
the August 1997 assault. Earlier, the officer and his lawyer, 
Marvyn Kornberg, entered the Brooklyn courthouse without saying a 
word to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kornberg had told a federal judge on Monday that his client  
intended to enter the plea. Four other police officers remain on 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea was not part of a bargain with the prosecution. After  
several fellow officers testified against him, Volpe essentially 
threw himself on the mercy of the court, hoping for leniency from 
the judge. No sentencing date was set. His lawyer said he expected 
the sentence against Volpe to be ``in the vicinity of 30 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guilty plea was hailed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, saying the  
resolution of the charge was ``very encouraging to the image of the 
police department. ... (It) destroys the myth of the blue wall of 
silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights leater the Rev. Al Sharpton said Volpe's plea was  
only the first step in the process. ``New York would be a safer 
place if everyone engaged in this is taken off the street,'' he 
said. ``We will not be satisfied until full justice is achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe was the central figure in the racially charged case, where  
five white officers were indicted on charges of violating the 
Louima's civil rights. The jury, which is not sequestered, will not 
be told in court of the plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickerson later asked Volpe if any other officers were involved  
in the attack -- a key question, since Volpe's four police 
co-defendants remain on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I testified to is the truth about what I did,'' Volpe  
responded. ``I did not see any other officer hit Mr. Louima.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe did say another police officer was in the precinct  
bathroom, saw what had happened, and failed to intervene. He did 
not identify the officer, and defense attorneys pointed out that 
nothing Volpe said today can be used against their clients. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no indication that he would be testifying against the  
remaining defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The red-eyed officer, the son of a retired police detective,  
apologized to his family in court for his role in the beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe was accused of ramming a stick into Louima's rectum and  
mouth in a fit of rage -- the charge carrying the life sentence. He 
was injured so severely he was hospitalized for two months and had 
to undergo a colostomy. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements, Kornberg had suggested the married Louima  
had been injured during homosexual intercourse and also suggested 
he made up the attack story to get money from a civil suit against 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Volpe mistakenly thought Louima, 32, punched him  
in a disturbance outside a Brooklyn nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997. 
Volpe also was charged with beating Louima en route to the 70th 
Precinct stationhouse, conspiracy, witness tampering and falsely 
arresting and beating another Haitian. He entered guilty pleas 
today to all counts, but the judge rejected one plea involving the 
other man. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Charles Schwarz is accused of holding down Louima during  
the bathroom assault. Schwarz and Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas 
Bruder also are charged with beating Louima en route to the 
stationhouse; Sgt. Michael Bellomo is charged with covering up the 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Volpe's legal team had not yet begun its defense, the  
officer's case appeared to be damaged by testimony from fellow 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first officer to shatter the so-called ``blue wall of  
silence,'' Detective Eric Turetzky, testified seeing a disheveled 
and sullen Volpe ``swinging the stick around like a sword and 
hitting it against the wall'' around the time of the bathroom 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Next came Officer Mark Schofield, who testified that Volpe  
borrowed a pair of black leather gloves and returned them covered 
with blood and that he also had seen Volpe with a ``stick-like 
object.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Kenneth Wernick testified Volpe bragged that he ``took a  
stick and put it 5 or 6 inches up (Louima's rectum), took it out 
and put it up to his mouth and teeth area, kind of like showing it 
to him.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Michael Schoer testified Volpe had taunted him by  
putting the end of an excrement-soiled stick in his face.

<HEADLINE> No Change in Van Gundy's Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nobody talked much Tuesday about Reggie Miller  
or Spike Lee or Larry Bird or Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Knicks taking the day off and the series against the  
Indiana Pacers still several days away, the topic on everyone's 
minds in New York continued to be the unsettled status of Knicks 
coach Jeff Van Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the huge distraction the issue has become, Knicks  
president Dave Checketts again refused to give Van Gundy a vote of 
confidence despite the team's sweep of the Atlanta Hawks that has 
put them into the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts again said he'll wait until the end of the season,  
even if it lasts another month, before deciding whether Van Gundy 
will return. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I have a lot of questions about how things went this  
year, about what happened early in the year, about why we 
struggled,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts also denied having any kind of informal pact with  
former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who met with Checketts in 
mid-April when the Knicks were struggling to discuss the 
possibility of taking over the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what it's worth today, you have my word I don't have a  
handshake agreement with anybody,'' Checketts said on WFAN radio. 
``I haven't made any offers, there haven't been any informal 
discussions. I'm not pursuing anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will return to practice Wednesday to begin preparing  
for their fifth postseason matchup with the Pacers this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The series begins Sunday at Market Square Arena.  
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy, with one year remaining on a three-year, $6 million  
contract, has been told his fate will be decided at the end of the 
season after Checketts has met privately with all the players and 
has spent a couple of days secluded with Van Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I have learned about team sports is that the focus  
should be kept on the team, and that's what I'm going to do 
throughout these five days off and in the series,'' Van Gundy said. 
``It's not about me, it's all about the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks had problems with the Pacers during the regular  
season, losing by 23 and 13 in their two games at Market Square 
Arena and winning by one point at Madison Square Garden when 
Indiana missed three open shots in the final six seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana ousted the Knicks from the postseason last year, winning  
4-1 in the second round as Mark Jackson and Rik Smits dominated 
their individual matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	During their games this year, Indiana coach Larry Bird continued  
to attack the Knicks' point guards as he regularly ran clear-out 
plays for Jackson and Travis Best against Chris Childs and Charlie 
Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a heck of a time guarding them. They're one of the few  
teams in the league that you have to guard all five spots, all five 
positions,'' Van Gundy said. ``And not just the first five, but 
everybody they bring in is very capable. That's what separates 
them, I think, from the other teams in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 in the best-of-7 series will be next Tuesday, and the  
teams will then have three days off before playing Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	All that downtime should benefit Patrick Ewing, who has been  
hobbled since midseason by Achilles' tendinitis and sore knees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to help me a lot,'' Ewing said. ``Every  
time I have an opportunity to rest, I feel a lot better.''

	``I never used to notice it, but now whenever I hear a violent  
song or see violence on TV, I get sick to my stomach,'' senior Matt 
Powell said Monday, the first day of classes after six students 
were wounded by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	T.J. Solomon, 15, faces 20 counts of aggravated assault, cruelty  
to children and weapons charges after Thursday's shootings at the 
suburban Atlanta school. All but one victim has been treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of the school's 1,340 students showed up  
Monday, primarily to get their yearbooks, each emblazoned with the 
motto ``1998-99 ... What A Time It Was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students hugged in the parking lot, and some needed to visit the  
commons area -- where the shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom and I watched hours and hours of coverage of  
Columbine,'' said senior Katy Hinesley, referring to last month's 
massacre in Littleton, Colo. ``But to have it happen here ... I 
still haven't come to grips with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the injured students -- Brian Barnhardt, 16, Jason Cheek,  
17, Drake Hoy, 17, and Ryan Rosa, 18 -- were at school and off their 
crutches. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in a tearful interview on CNN, Solomon's mother  
apologized for her son's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We grieve for each one of you and we pray for a full  
recovery,'' Mae Dean Daniele said. ``We thank God that all the 
children are alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Daniele also thanked assistant principal Cecil Brinkley, who  
persuaded her son to surrender after Solomon sank to his knees and 
put a .357-caliber revolver into his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will forever be grateful to him,'' said Ms. Daniele, who  
was accompanied by her husband, Robert Daniele. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who was campaigning in Atlanta, stopped  
briefly in Conyers on Monday to meet privately with five of the six 
shooting victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon's lawyer, Ed Garland, acknowledged that the teen was the  
gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question he did the shooting,'' Garland said. ``The  
question that everyone wants to know the answer to -- and that we 
want to know the answer to -- is why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garland said he would try to keep Solomon -- being held at an  
undisclosed youth detention center -- within the juvenile court 
system. District Attorney Richard Read has said he wants the case 
moved to circuit court so he can try Solomon as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing on the issue is scheduled for June 1.

<HEADLINE> McKesson To Restate Earnings Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Medical supplies distributor McKesson HBOC  
Inc. says it will revise downward its fiscal 1999 earnings for a 
second time in two months after finding more accounting problems in 
its recently acquired health information company HBO. The news sent 
its stock sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The restatement may also include previous years' earnings  
reports, McKesson disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed ``improper revenue recognition matters''  
involving software sales at HBO, which provides computer solutions 
to help health care providers manage their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson said it's still to early to project revised earnings  
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	In early afternoon trading today on the New York Stock Exchange,  
McKesson shares were down almost 9 percent, or by $3.31 1/4 a share, 
at $34.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson's shares plummeted nearly 50 percent, to $34.50, after  
it first acknowledged the problem on April 28. The stock's 52-week 
high had been $89.75. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four law firms have been retained by investors to  
consider a class-action suit alleging that false statements 
artificially inflated the profits of McKesson HBOC. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson is the nation's largest pharmaceutical supply  
management and health care information technology company. It 
bought HBOC in January. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 28,, McKesson restated its fourth-quarter operating  
income to 56 cents a share, down from 62 cents, and its full-year 
operating income to $1.97 a share, down from $2.06. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-quarter net loss was revised to 27 cents a share from  
22 cents, and the full-year net income was revised to 75 cents a 
share from 84 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 22, McKesson reported a net loss of $60.4 million for  
the fourth quarter ended March 31, and net income of $237.1 million 
for the full year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it also reduced its earnings goal for its  
fiscal year ending March 2000, because it expects its software 
revenue to fall.

<HEADLINE> NH Man Accused of Abducting Ex-Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOWELL, Mass. (AP) -- Authorities arrested a man accused of  
abducting his ex-wife from her workplace, a shelter for women and 
children in crisis in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Gary Collinge, 49, and found his ex-wife,  
Marguerite Eno, apparently unharmed, according to Nashua, N.H., 
police Lt. Wayne MacDonald. He said tips from relatives led police 
to their location in a Lowell home. 
</P>
<P>
	Collinge was arrested on a fugitive from justice warrant issued  
in New Hampshire. He put up no resistance when arrested, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Collinge abducted Eno, 46, at gunpoint Sunday night  
from Marguerite's Place in Nashua, about 12 miles north of Lowell. 
Sgt. Frank Paison said four shots were fired as she was dragged but 
were apparently not aimed at anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple separated in 1995, five years after marrying. Eno  
filed for divorce last year, accusing Collinge of beating her and 
violating restraining orders. The divorce was granted last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Marguerite's Place is run by the Order of Grey Nuns and was the  
state's first long-term transitional housing for women and children 
in crisis when it opened in 1994. It's just a coincidence that it 
has the name of Eno, a longtime employee.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Respond to China Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First it was Kosovo, then Littleton. Now, GOP  
presidential contenders are seizing on reports of Chinese espionage 
as a hot-button campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	A round of potential Republican candidates pointed fingers at  
the Clinton administration Tuesday after a congressional panel 
reported that China had stolen classified information about every 
U.S. nuclear weapon for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Previous administrations must share in the blame, but this  
administration knew more and still chose not to take action,'' 
declared Elizabeth Dole. ``The Clinton-Gore administration needs to 
get a grip on the gravity of this crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., long a critic of President Clinton's  
China policy, said the report will prompt questions about why the 
administration did not do more to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it troubling that too little action was taken too late  
by this administration, resulting in the fact that the Chinese may 
have been able to build nuclear weapons comparable to ours,'' 
McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidates, who have touted remedies for  
school violence and criticized U.S. policy in Yugoslavia, quickly 
turned their attention to the sweeping three-volume report, which 
concluded it is ``exceptionally likely'' that Chinese spying 
continues to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is you had Kosovo, Littleton, and now you have China,  
which is quickly overcoming both of them,'' said McCain spokesman 
Howard Opinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush used the issue to offer his sharpest  
criticism yet of Clinton, saying the White House failed to take the 
reports seriously and was slow to react. ``I'd do something about 
it immediately,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush acknowledged that the problem has been going on for years,  
including the 12 years when his father was vice president and 
president. But he said he doesn't believe that gives Clinton an 
excuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that China has been stealing secrets during  
Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton. But there is only one 
administration that has been given the news; only one 
administration knew, and that's the Clinton administration. The 
interesting question is, when did they know?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, who has made China policy a cornerstone of his  
campaign, accused the administration of failing in ``its most basic 
duty to protect our nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time for new American leadership, it is time for a new  
foreign policy, and it is time for new congressional hearings to 
investigate who is directly responsible -- politically and 
commercially -- for endangering America's national security,'' he 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes said the administration had demonstrated  
``incompetence, ineptitude and insincerity on a scale never before 
witnessed in the history of U.S. defense,'' making a point to 
target not just Clinton but also Vice President Al Gore, who is 
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The espionage report sounds a clear warning, said Rep. John  
Kasich of Ohio. ``Only time will tell if we take heed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamar Alexander has called for an independent, blue-ribbon  
commission to ``get to the bottom of the current China mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire is urging creation of a Senate  
select committee to investigate Chinese espionage. ``We will get to 
the bottom of this,'' he said. ``Nobody in this Senate worth his or 
her salt should have any objection to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also called for a congressional investigation into ``what  
went wrong and why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the balance of power is going to shift as a result of  
this,'' Bush said. ``I think it's going to accelerate China's 
emergence as a nuclear power. And the next president and presidents 
after that are going to have to deal with that.''
