<HEADLINE> EU President Pledges Efforts to Avert Human Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 15 (Xinhua) -- President of the European Union
John Bruton said here today that necessary conditions should be
created for essential humanitarian tasks to be carried out in
eastern Zaire as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the on-going World Food Summit, Bruton, who is also
prime minister of Ireland, said, "The tragic situation in the
Great Lakes Region is an affront to the entire international
community."
</P>
<P>
He said, "The European Union will continue our intensive
efforts to assist in averting further human tragedy in eastern
Zaire and in voiding a potentially catastrophic humanitarian
disaster developing in the region."
</P>
<P>
Bruton called for the creation of conditions necessary for the
essential humanitarian tasks to be carried out as quickly as
possible and for the process of dialogue and reconciliation to be
advanced.
</P>
<P>
He deplored that in recent years man-made emergencies such as
civil wars and ethnic violence have severely disrupted food
production and distribution, leading to hunger and malnutrition
even in previously food abundant areas.
</P>
<P>
"We must spare no effort in our attempts to prevent conflicts
and to ensure the peaceful resolution of any difficulties should
they arise," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of food security, Bruton said, "Poverty is a major
cause of food insecurity since it prevents people from producing
food for themselves and from buying it from available supplies."
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU countries are convinced that the Rome
Declaration and the Plan of Action adopted at the World Food
Summit provide a sound basis for moving towards the objective of
eradicating hunger and providing adequate food for all.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Refugees Return to Rwanda in the Thousands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The refugee crisis in the Great
Lakes region seems to be entering a new phase as thousands of
Rwandan refugees are entering Rwanda from the Zairean border area
around Goma, said reports of the Agence France Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The AFP quoted Rwandan Minister of Social Rehabilitation,
Patrick Mazimahka, as saying in Gisenyi bordering Goma that the
plan to dispatch an international intervention force is from now
on "useless" because of the new influx of refugees into Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that a human tide is surging toward Goma from the
Mugunga refugee camp 15 kilometers west, which was reportedly
taken by the Banyamulenge Tutsi rebels today.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government has moved to Gisenyi to focus all their
means to receive the refugees, AFP quoted Rwandan government
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 400,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees, infiltrated by Hutu
extremists, had stayed in the refugee camp since July 1994. The
camp was used in the past two weeks as a resistance base by Hutu
militias against the Tutsi rebels after Goma fell to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The refugees converging on Goma also include those from a small
bay by the side of Lake Kivu, where some 700,000 refugees were
reportedly stacked over the past two weeks after being driven out
of their refugee camps by fightings between Zairean troops and
Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) said
that some 15,000 refugees entered Rwanda by this afternoon today.
</P>
<P>
The AFP said that the biggest reason for the massive return of
refugees to Rwanda is that they would have food on the Rwandan
side of the border while all international humanitarian aid
workers have quit Zaire.

<HEADLINE> SADC Leaders Plan Summit on Zaire Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) are planning a summit to
respond to the troubled Great Lakes Region, according to a report
from the Zimbabwe National News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
It is also possible for the 12-member SADC to play a
peacekeeping role in the Zairean crisis, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Botswanan President Ketumile Masire said
the political instability caused by the civil conflicts in
Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire was unacceptable to the southern
African region which is beginning to enjoy peace for the first
time in decades.
</P>
<P>
Masire was speaking after meeting Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, current chairman of SADC's Organ on Politics, Defense and
Security, in Rome where both are attending the World Food Summit.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe had earlier discussed the SADC role with Namibian
President Sam Nujoma and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders condemned the stance by the United Nations
Security Council that the proposed multi-national peacekeeping
force to be deployed in the Great Lakes Region should be on a
voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to support the OAU in its quest to have the whole
of Africa cooperating to end the conflict in central Africa under
the U.N. sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
"Any peacekeeping forces to that area should be financed by
the U.N.. We are in full support of OAU Secretary-General Salim
Ahmed Salim who will discuss the issue with U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope our discussions will yield a SADC force that
will be combined with other African forces to help consolidate
peace in that region," said the Zimbabwean president.
</P>
<P>
He added that SADC would also support the stance by leaders in
central Africa that any peacekeepers should come from "neutral
countries".

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Declines in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Industrial production in
the U.S. declined by 0.5 percent in October, the first drop in
seven months, U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed said that output at the U.S. factories, mines and
utilities was down from the revised 0.3 percent advance in
September. It was also the first drop since an identical 0.5
percent decrease last March.
</P>
<P>
The report said that sharp drop in auto production accounted
mainly for the decrease. But the industrial production was still
down by 0.2 percent even excluding the motor vehicle component.
</P>
<P>
The report said that motor vehicle assemblies dropped more than
7 percent from their September level resulting largely from
shortages of parts made at strike-affected plants in Canada and
from a strike that had shut down some domestic assembly plants
late in the month.
</P>
<P>
Other factors which attributed to the decline were attempts by
businesses to trim some of the inventories that accumulated during
the summer as consumer demand shrank, the Fed report said.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output fell by 0.5 percent, erasing a 0.3 percent
advance in September. Production of durable goods -- items
expected to last more than three years -- was down by 0.7 percent.
Output of nondurable goods declined by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Output at the utilities in the country was unchanged after
gaining 0.3 percent in September. But mining production fell 1
percent after slipping 0.1 percent the previous month.
</P>
<P>
However, industrial production in October was still 3.6 percent
higher than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
There was little indication of price pressures in the report.
The Fed said the nation's industries were operating at 82.7
percent of capacity, down from 83.4 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
That is less than the 85 percent capacity utilization that
analysts say threatens productions bottlenecks that could lead to
shortages and higher prices.

<HEADLINE> Washington Informs Lebanon of Participants in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher send a letter today to Lebanese Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz, informing him of participants in a
conference of donor countries due in Washington on December 16.
</P>
<P>
Richard Jones, U.S. ambassador to Beirut, visited the
Lebanese Foreign Ministry this afternoon and delivered to Boueiz
the letter from the U.S. secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his meeting with the Lebanese foreign minister,
the U.S. diplomat announced that the letter contained a list of
those who would participate in the "conference of Lebanon's
friends," a conference especially held to discuss aids to
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that 30 foreign ministers, in addition to a
number of representatives of international organizations,
including the World Bank and regional banks for development,
would take part in the conference.
</P>
<P>
Jones described outcomes of the Middle East and North African
economic conference, which ended in Cairo Thursday, as "good."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, along with Syria, boycotted the Cairo conference on
the grounds that it was equivalent to multilateral peace talks
between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria refuse to participate in multilateral peace
talks, or any international forums attended by the Jewish state,
as long as no tangible progress is achieved in the bilateral
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries boycotted the previous two Middle East and
North African economic summits in Casablanca in 1994 and in Amman
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The conference of Lebanon's friends, which is better known as
the consultative committee, was called for by a cease-fire
arrangement brokered by the U.S. between Lebanon and Israel,
which ended a 17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Washington has invited the European Union countries, Canada,
Japan, Malaysia, the Gulf oil-rich states and others to attend
the next month's gathering.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the donor countries and international
financial organizations will work out how to help Lebanon repair
and reconstruct its war-devastated infrastructures and the sums
it needs.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon hopes that the conference will mark a start of
massive foreign assistances and investments to the country's
ambitious reconstruction scheme, which, Lebanon has estimated,
would need 5 billion U.S. dollars in the next five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today lodged protest
to the United Nations and the five permanent members of the
Security Council over new violations of its airspace by six
Turkish fighters.
</P>
<P>
The violations took place earlier today during a parade in
Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia to mark the 13th
anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence (UDI)
by Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Acting President of the Republic and House President Spyros
Kyprianou today summoned Gustave Feissel, resident
representative of U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
and the ambassadors of the Security Council permanent members,
namely the United States, Russia, Britain, France and
China, to made the representations.
</P>
<P>
"We protested very strongly the violations which are a
flagrant provocation, as they come on the anniversary of the
Turkish Cypriot secessionist act 13 years ago," Kyprianou said.
</P>
<P>
The acting president underlined to all ambassadors the
peaceful nature of the students' demonstrations in
government-controlled areas in sharp contrast to the brash
provocations by the Turkish aircraft.
</P>
<P>
He expected the ambassadors not only to convey the protests
to their respective administrations, but also "to undertake the
necessary measures to make Turkey see sense, if the initiatives
to push for an agreed solution in Cyprus are to have any chance
of success."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Cypriot students, carrying flags and banners
and chanting slogans, peacefully gathered at mass rallies in
central Nicosia and other towns in demonstration against the
Turkish Cypriot UDI announced on November 15, 1983.
</P>
<P>
In their petition addressed to the U.N. secretary-general,
the students call for the independence and unity of Cyprus,
where all its people will live in peace.
</P>
<P>
The police have taken strict measures to make sure that all
protests and demonstrations are kept at a safe distance from the
167 kilometer-long demarcation line to avoid incidents.
</P>
<P>
The Nicosia buffer zone was set up in 1964 when conflict
between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities broke out.

<HEADLINE> (Urgent) Clinton Says U.S. to Extend Mission in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced today that U.S. prepared to extend military mission in
Bosnia to consolidate the gains made in the war-torn Balkans
during the past year's NATO peace-keeping mission.
</P>
<P>
Clinton says a formal commitment of troops depends on carefully
spelling out their mission. And he says the mission should wrap up
by July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Clinton says NATO's original year-long peacekeeping mission in
Bosnia has been a success. But he says the country still needs an
outside security force to watch things as new public institutions
take hold.
</P>
<P>
He did not say how many U.S. troops will stay in Bosnia, but
U.S. officials said that the nation would keep 5,000 to 10,000
soldiers in the region after the present 14,000 troops ends their
mission by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana told reporters Thursday
that all the NATO allies, including the United States, were lining
up behind peace-keeping forces in Bosnia. The mission would involve
30,000 troops from 30 countries, half the size of the peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) that occupied Bosnia this year.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The leading indicators
prepared monthly by the New York based Conference Board will have
some changes, including a new measure of the yield curve.
</P>
<P>
The new index will be effective with its release on December
30, covering November data, according to the private research
group.
</P>
<P>
The new leading index will have ten components instead of 11.
Two of the eleven series will be deleted. They include the change
in sensitive materials prices and the change in manufacturers'
unfilled orders, durable goods.
</P>
<P>
The changes are meant to provide fewer false signals of
recessions but also will make the index more sensitive to the bond
market. The Conference Board said that the yield curve measure
will be the spread between the federal funds rate and the 10-year
Treasury note as reported by the Federal Reserve.

<HEADLINE> Gap between UK's Rich, Poor Stops Widening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The gap between Britain's rich
and poor has stopped widening for the first time in 20 years,
according to government figures released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest edition of the government's Households Below Average
Income shows that since 1990 the share of total income taken by
the bottom 10 percent of the population has remained static at 2.5
percent after housing costs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the share taken by the top 10 percent up to March
1995 remained constant at 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1976, inequality had been narrowing in the UK for a
century or more, but since then it has widened dramatically, with
the poorest 10 percent of the population seeing their share of
total income fall by 40 percent from 4.1 percent in 1979 to 2.5
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the richest 10 percent saw their share
increase by nearly a third to 26 percent of total after-tax
income. Since 1990, however, those positions have remained
constant.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics said that the main reason for inequality
in the 1980s was the greater dispersion of earnings as skilled
jobs became more highly rewarded and unskilled ones either
disappeared or became poorly paid.
</P>
<P>
Other factors were tax cuts which disproportionately benefited
the better-off, persistent unemployment and the increasing
division of households into those with two earners or none.
</P>

But since 1990 real earnings had increased more slowly, holding
back earnings dispersion. Tax increases and boosts to in-work
benefits for the low-paid also contributed to the change of trend.

<HEADLINE> Ground-Breaking Ceremony Held for Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat broke ground for the Karni Industrial
Zone in the Gaza Strip today.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he hopes that the industrial park at Karni
will start operation in six months and will eventually
employ some 17,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Development and Investment Company (PADICO)
has announced that it will invest 30 million U.S. dollars to
develop the industrial park. The U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) has pledged 6 million dollars for the park.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a USAID-aided PADICO housing project was also
inaugurated by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The two ceremonies were attended by senior Palestinian
officials and senior U.S. officials, including U.S. Ambassador
Martin Indyk, Consul General Edward Abington and USAID Director
Christopher Crowley.
</P>
<P>
Crowley delivered a speech on behalf of the U.S. government,
reaffirming U.S. support for off-site physical infrastructure
development at the Karni and for the creation of the appropriate
environment to encourage potential investors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in his address to
the just-concluded Middle East and North African economic
conference in Cairo, said that the U.S. has a deep interest in
helping the Palestinians set up a string of industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
He called the parks "magnets for investment, jobs, and
especially for hope" as he urged quick improvement in the
economic conditions in the West Bank and Gaza "if we are to give
Palestinians a full and tangible stake in peace."

<HEADLINE> Prince of Monaco Praises China's History, Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sovereign Prince of Monaco,
Rainier III, today praised the history and the present momentum of
economic development of China during a meeting with Chinese Consul
General to Monaco, Xie Xieho, in his residence in the
principality.
</P>
<P>
Rainier said that China was a very fascinating country, was
full of dynamism, had a very ancient history and immense
potentials, as well as an important political, economic and
cultural position in the world.
</P>
<P>
Xie presented to Prince Rainier III a message of national day
congratulation from Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who expressed
his wish for the prosperity of Monaco and happiness of its people.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang also expressed his wish for a day-by-day
deepening of mutual understanding between the two peoples of China
and Monaco, and further development of friendly cooperations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Xie expressed his admiration for the 30,000 people of Monaco,
who he said did not yield to the limited space of their territory
and underprivileged geographical condition of their country by
carrying out large-scale urbanization programs, some of them
underground, some of them extending to the sea.
</P>
<P>
He also presented the prince with a traditional Chinese
painting depicting a thousand crayfish swimming freely in the sea,
to express his admiration for the endeavors made by the prince in
maritime environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Relations between China and Monaco have developed smoothly
since they established diplomatic relations on January 16, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government of Monaco regards China's consul general as the
consular representative of the only legitimate government of China
in the principality.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Economic Embargo at World Food Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 15 (xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha
Muhiddin Marouf today vehemently condemned the embargo imposed on
his country as having causing enormous sufferings to the Iraqi
people who have been deprived of the right to obtain food
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the on-going World Food Summit in Rome, the vice
president urged the summit to produce positive results, including
a condemnation against the use of economic embargos, and in
particular starving the people, to serve political and economic
aims.
</P>
<P>
He complained that President Saddam Hussein was unable to
attend the summit simply because of the embargo imposed on Iraq
and due to the non-permission of the use of Iraqi civilian planes.
</P>
<P>
He said that the forcible sanctions imposed on states in the
name of the United Nations have resulted in the spread of famine,
poverty, diseases and pests leading to the greater backwardness of
the people on whom the sanctions were imposed.
</P>
<P>
"The embargo imposed on Iraq has resulted in the destruction of
the infrastructures of all the main sectors of production and
services." he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iraqi people have been deprived of the right
to import basic materials for agricultural production and of one
their most basic rights -- to obtain sufficient food, because they
do not have cash to buy food due to the freeze of their assets and
the ban on exporting their natural riches.
</P>
<P>
He specificly denounced "a Great Power" for placing various
obstacles before and after agreement on the "oil-for-food" formula
was reached within the framework of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Each day that passes under the circumstances of the present
embargo increases the suffering of the Iraqi people and the number
of victims of this unjust embargo," he told the summit which is
specially devoted to the issue of food security and the
eradication of hunger and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that hundreds of millions of people in the world,
particularly in the southern hemisphere, are suffering from famine
and poverty because of the hegemony, impoverishment and wars waged
by some states of the north towards the states of the south in
order to subdue them and prevent them from arriving at greater
collective self-reliance.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Operations Get Under Way in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) Friday launched an appeal for 49 million
Swiss francs (38.5 million U.S. dollars) to cover the cost of its
operation to assist some of the two million people affected by the
conflict in Eastern Zaire for three months.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said it had just obtained confirmation from the Zairan
government that it may work throughout the country to provide aid
to the refugees and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
An ICRC-chartered Hercules cargo aircraft left Nairobi Friday
morning with 14 tons of high-energy biscuits, two tons of medical
supplies and 2,000 blankets. It landed in the Zairan capital of
Kinshasa Friday morning before going to Kisangani, 500 kilometers
west of Goma, where a team is already setting up logistics base.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said its delegation in Zaire had drawn up a plan of
action for the provision of humanitarian aid. Existing health
facilities in the areas affected by the conflict will receive
support, and medical teams will be sent to hospitals in Kivu
province and in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
A field hospital available in Nairobi could very quickly be set
up in Zaire. Teams of specialists will make sure that drinking
water is available in places where large numbers of refugees and
displaced persons have gathered. Should reports of epidemics be
confirmed, the ICRC would be able to treat 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC also said it was in a position to provide non-food
relief supplies for 525,000 people, and food for 250,000 per
month. It explained that the aim was not to set up new camps, but
to distribute survival rations and water to displaced people on
the move or making their way home.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC is also planning a resettlement program from displaced
Zairans returning to their homes.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based humanitarian agency said it would work in
close coordination with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR). A coordination unit is to be set up, comprising
representatives of the main humanitarian organizations and of the
multinational force which is about to become operational.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the World Health Organization (WHO)
Friday confirmed the existence of cholera among refugees in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
A WHO spokesman told a news conference here Friday morning that
laboratory tests had confirmed 14 cholera cases in hospitals in
Goma, all of them from the Sake region west of Goma. WHO said they
were infected because of the deteriorating sanitary conditions.

<HEADLINE> Belarus President Calls for Support in Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko today called on the nation to back his version of the
constitution at the ongoing referendum, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a mass rally in Mogilyov, northwestern Belarus,
Lukashenko warned that the opposition may use the referendum
results to demand his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Belarussians to vote before the deadline of
November 24, if they could.
</P>
<P>
Voting began on November 9 and will last until November 24.
Voters should vote for Lukashenko's version or the Parliament's
one on the country's constitution. The president wants to enlarge
his powers, while a great number of lawmakers intend to reduce the
presidential duties.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko explained that he "did not know what the opposition
forces will do after one of the opposition's activists was ousted
from his post," referring to Thursday's dismissal of Viktor
Gonchar as chairman of the Central Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Gonchar repeated his statement that the referendum
on constitution, initiated by the president, had been invalid.
</P>
<P>
The opposition will undertake a number of political steps to
disrupt the referendum in the near future, Lukashenko warned
today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the parliament's presidium passed a resolution
criticizing two of the president's decrees, with one invalidating
the Constitutional Court's verdict on the advisory nature of the
constitutional referendum and the other sacking Gonchar.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's presidium described the two presidential
decrees as "anti-constitutional."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Semyon Sharetsky, speaker of the parliament, accused
Lukashenko of trying to seize more power and establish the
president's dictatorship in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets PM of Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that the European
Union (EU) will take a positive attitude in altering its
restricted and even discriminative measures in trading with China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng made the remarks at a meeting with John
Bruton, Prime Minister of Ireland, here today. Both the leaders
are here attending the World Food Summit.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-EU economies are supplementary and great potential is
yet to be tapped in the two-way trade, the Chinese Premier said.
EU is at present one of China's major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
China and EU have different social systems, ideology and
economic development levels, thus "we can respect each other and
seek common ground while putting aside the differences in handling
these differences," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng defined the relationship between China and EU as
"generally good", and said that China welcomes the proposal by EU
to develop a long-term relationship with China independently and
in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng also hoped that Ireland can play certain role in
helping establish an equal, mutually beneficial and friendly
relations with China when it assumes the EU chairmanship portfolio.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Li Peng said China is satisfied with the
advancement of the bilateral relations over the past years and with
increasing exchanges between the two countries in various fields
and at various levels. China wishes to maintain the developing
trend of the good bilateral relations, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Irish economic and trade relations have been
developing continuously, Li Peng said, However, he added, there is
still great potential yet to be tapped. Ireland has much advantage
in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy.
Some of these aspects are among China's priority development
areas, thus the necessity to further probe new ways for
cooperation, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Bruton said Ireland appreciates and congratulates China on its
achievements in food production and in the overall economic
development. Ireland will take measures to increasingly involve
itself in China's economic development so as to increase its share
in the Chinese market in the intense global competition.

<HEADLINE> 700,000 Refugees Are Moving towards Rwanda from Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- About 700,000 Rwandan Hutu
refugees are on the move in the province of North Kivu, eastern
Zaire, almost all toward the Rwandan border, the Agence France
Presse (AFP) quoted officials of the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) as saying this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ray Wilkinson, spokesman of the UNHCR in Goma, said that some
30,000 refugees crossed the border into Rwanda by this afternoon,
over the "small barrier" between Goma and the Rwandan city of
Gisenyi, where the Rwandan government is idesperately working to
receive the sudden huge influx of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government said this afternoon that the dispatch of
an international intervention force is from now on "useless"
since the refugees are coming home from Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"There is no more need for an international force as has been
defined. The job it is supposed to do is done," AFP quoted
Patrick Mahimpaka, minister of rehabilitation of Rwanda, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that Rwanda is very happy to see its people come home,
after two years of exile in refugee camps in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said that the massive wave of refugees is like an
unstoppable tide surging toward the Rwandan border.
</P>
<P>
"Surely this is a political decision (made by the refugees)
and if it goes on like this, all the people can go home by this
weekend," said Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
He also said that 29 people, most of them women and children,
were today found to have been massacred in the Mugunga refugee
camp 15 kilometers from Goma, which was evacuated by refugees
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu extremist militias, who used the camp as a resistance
base against Tutsis over the past two weeks, are widely believed
to be responsible for the massacre.

<HEADLINE> Russian Security Chief Comments on Galkin's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Federal Security
Service (FSB) chief Nikolai Kovalyov today said the arrest of
former Soviet KGB staffer, Vladimir Galkin, showed the
"short-sightedness of some representatives of the U.S. secret
services."
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Itar-Tass news agency,
Kovalyov said Galkin's arrest on the eve of presidential elections
in the United States clearly shows it has a "political hidden
motive."
</P>
<P>
He does not exclude possible U.S. hopes for "adequate reaction,
which could spoil the Russian-U.S. relations and influence the
outcome of the elections."
</P>
<P>
Galkin, who arrived in the United States with a visa issued by
the State Department, was arrested on October 29 at New York's
international airport by the U.S. authorities and charged with a
conspiracy aiming to collect classified information.
</P>
<P>
The Russian counterintelligence was prepared for adequate
measures right after the arrest of Galkin in the United States. It
even made a "retaliation target list." Kovalyov suspended
preparations for these measures immediately after Thursday's
meeting of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and US.
Vice-President Albert Gore, who reached a basic agreement on
settlement of the problem.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans kept their promise, and we keep ours," the FSB
director said.
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday night, all charges brought against Galkin were
canceled by the federal district court in Worcester, U.S.
Massachusetts. Galkin was freed in the court hall at that time.
</P>
<P>
According to Kovalyov, after the strong protest launched by
heads of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service and the FSB to
official representatives of the U.S. CIA and the FBI in Moscow,
who are visiting Russia to coordinate efforts against
international terrorism, arms and drug contraband and other
international crime. It took the U.S. side some time to find a way
out of the complex situation created by the Galkin arrest.
</P>
<P>
Now the incident is settled, and the U.S. businessmen from
amongst former staffers of U.S. secret services "can further
involve in business, commerce and consultative services," Kovalyov
said, adding "I can only wish success" to them.
</P>
<P>
He also hopes the relations between Russia and the United
States will not change. "Such incidents in the work of secret
services should have no influence on economic and cultural
relations," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Refugees Heading home Toward Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Hutu refugees are seen
trekking through Goma toward Rwanda braving light rain today to
the land they fled in panic after the genocide against tutsis in
1994, reports from Goma, an east Zairean town, said.
</P>
<P>
"We've got at least 250,000 on the move and there are another
500,000 out there," Stefano Severe, head of the U.N. High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in Goma, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are moving past two once-teeming Mugunga camps at
the rate of 30,000 an hour and trudging back along the road as
far as 20 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Mugunga camps, a major base for Hutu militia and former Hutu
government troops as well as 400,000 Rwandan refugees since the
1994 exodus into Zaire, was said to have been deserted -- burnt,
looted and ransacked.
</P>
<P>
Hutu fighters, blamed for the genocide of over 500,000
Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis in 1994, were reported to have
fled into the bush, and they have been accused of preventing
ordinary refugees from leaving the sprawling camps.
</P>
<P>
The exodus followed six hours of fierce bombardment of Mugunga
by a coalition of Zairean rebels, including ethnic Tutsis on
Thursday. The rebels have seized a strip of Zaire's Kivu
Provinces along its eastern border in a month of fighting against
Zairean troops, militia and Rwandan Hutus.
</P>
<P>
"We left Mugunga an empty camp, we all fled because of the
fighting yesterday," a refugee named Vincent Nzehsi said. "I am
going back to Rubavu, Rwanda," he added.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR officials considered that the impasse has been broken
because people are moving in the right direction, going home
toward where they came from in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The mass movement occurred as the U.N. Security Council
prepared to vote on a resolution to send a multinational force to
ease the plight of about 1.2 million Hutu refugees from Rwanda
and Burundi scattered in refugee camps across eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It is good news for the international community which has
warned it would not take on the armed Hutus -- members of
Rwanda's defeated ex-army and the dreaded Interahamwe militia.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the U.N.'s World Food Program, waiting on the
Rwandan side of the border with food previously used to attract
the refugees back, said up to 10,000 have already crossed with a
further 275,000 backed up along the road.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, himself a Hutu, went to
the Gisenyi border post to welcome the Hutu refugees.
</P>
<P>
The United nations said it is delighted that the refugees are
heading home from eastern Zaire, but said a multinational force
is still badly needed to help provide aid and logistics.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets FAO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that the so-called China threat to world food security is
totally unfounded.
</P>
<P>
As a populous country, China for the time being does not have
the capability to provide food aid to other developing countries,
but it is confident of securing self-sufficiency in food on the
basis of domestic resources and self-reliantly, said Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
This is in itself a contribution to the world cause of food and
agriculture, said the Chinese premier at a meeting with
Director-general of the United Nations Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) Jacques Diouf at the FAO headquarters here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li Peng expressed appreciation over the
efforts made by FAO in convening the current World Food Summit,
which he said is of importance to each country and to the
international community as a whole.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Diouf gave a high appraisal of a speech made by
Li Peng at the summit.
</P>
<P>
He said China has been successfully tackling the food problem,
which he said constitutes a huge contribution to world food
security.
</P>
<P>
He said that some people in the mass media had raised a
question to him about China's capability to feed its people and
that he had made it clear to them that he does not understand such
a question.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that China is fully capable of resolving its
own food problem and therefore there does not exist at all a China
food threat to other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed thanks to China for its support for the work
of the FAO.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng arrived here this morning to attend the
World Food Summit. Before the meeting with Diouf, he delivered a
speech entitled "China is an important force dedicated to
maintaining world food security" at the summit.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Freeze Public Sector Hiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government today
tabled a bill in parliament which effectively puts a freeze on
public sector hiring until the end of 1999, since the ratio of
retirements to hiring during the period will be five to one.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions on hiring will apply to state-controlled
banks, public enterprises and corporations as well as municipal
enterprises. Under the bill, any new hiring beyond the ratios laid
down must first be approved by the national economy, finance and
interior ministries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, pensioners who are appointed as chairpersons or
members of the board of administrations of public sector
organizations will no longer be able to receive both emoluments
and a pension. They will have to choose between one or the other.
</P>
<P>
Excluded from the provisions of the bill, which aims at cutting
public spending, are teachers of all grades, the security forces,
the coast guard, medical and nursing staff.
</P>
<P>
In these sectors the ratio of retirements to hiring will be one
to one.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Uganda, S. Africa Transport Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian, Ugandan and South
African transport ministers are expected to meet in Kampala, Uganda on
November 25, to review the African Joint Air Services (AJAS) agreement
which was signed here December 12, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Communicaions and
Transport, Salim Msoma, told the official Daily News here today that
the move was aimed at strengthening the AJAS pact for the benefit of
all parties involved.
</P>
<P>
AJAS is a joint venture of South Africa Airways (SAA), Air Tanzania
Corporation (ATC), Uganda Airlines (UA) and the governments of
Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
SAA holds 40 percent shares in the venture and 60 percent shares are
held by ATC, UA, the two governments, and the private investors from
Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Msoma said that the council of ministers meeting would be attended
by management teams of ATC, UA, SAA and AJAS.
</P>
<P>
He said that after what appeared to exist a misunderstanding among
the AJAS partners the government appointed a neutral body -
the Directorate of Civil Aviation (DCA) - to look into the issue and
recommend how best a solution could be sought.
</P>
<P>
Msoma said that when the parties differed on cetain clauses of the
agreement (AJAS) they should have addressed the matter to the
appropiate forum instead of going wild to the public through the
media.
</P>
<P>
"Good partners can not behave that way if they are to achieve
meaningful results, partners should sit together, iron out differences
and sought solutions for the benefit of both parties," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The pricipal secretary said that the AJAS issue featured
prominently during talks between President Benamin Mkapa and President
Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, when the latter visited the country last
month. enditem

<HEADLINE> Moi Frowns on UN Action for Zaire Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today told the Rome Food Summit that he is surprised to
learn about international intervention in the Great Lakes region
without consultations with the Nairobi Summit participants.
</P>
<P>
In an address at the summit available here tonight, the
president noted that the United Nations was expected to consult
with the Secretary general of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) before taking any action.
</P>
<P>
At the regional summit held on November 5 in Nairobi, eight
African leaders urged the formation of a multinational neutral
force to be sent to eastern Zaire and the setting up of refugees
corridors so that over a million refugees could go back to Rwanda
on a voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader stressed that the recent Nairobi regional
summit on east Zairean crisis passed resolutions which among
others called for humanitarian support for the more than one
million refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi summit came out with practical ideas on how to
handle the crisis in eastern Zaire to avoid a Somalia-like
intervention which was too expensive in human and material terms,
Moi added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the on-going food summit is taking place
against the background of the worsening crisis of the refugees
around the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
However, it is reported that the U.N. Security Council will
vote on a resolution to send a multinational force to eastern
Zaire after the U.S. at long last promised to take part in the
force.
</P>
<P>
This will be done without consultations with the Nairobi
summit participants, including leaders from Kenya, Uganda,
Tanzania, Rwanda, Zambia, Ethiopia and Cameroun, as well as OAU
chief Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
Moi said man-made factors such as armed conflict and its
attendant problems of refugees presented more devastating causes
of food security especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The President noted that Kenya is committed to peace and
stability which must be seen as part and parcel of food self
sufficiency efforts.

LUSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today rejected suggestions by his South African
counterpart Nelson Mandela that the November 18 elections be
postponed.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said here today that Mandela has sent him a fax
message asking him to declare a state of emergency to facilitate
a possible postponement of the elections for the sake of former
president Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said there is no crisis in his country and therefore
there is no need to declare the state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba reiterated that the elections will go ahead as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Monday's elections will be held under the new constitution,
which bars in fact Kaunda from standing in the presidential polls
because his parents are foreign immigrants.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the move, Kaunda's party has declared
boycott of the elections.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Rejects Mandela's Plea to Postpone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba has rejected a call from South African
President Nelson Mandela to postpone monday's elections.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said in Lusaka today that opposition parties wanted
the vote to take place as scheduled on November 18, the state-run
Zambian Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
A Zambian government official today criticized South Africa
for its interference in that country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
But the criticism was today dismissed by the foreign ministry
in Pretoria as not reflecting the spirit of discussions between
the two countries' presidents.
</P>
<P>
Mandela earlier in the week sent judge Rihard Goldstone to
Lusaka to discuss the possible postponement of Zambia's general
elections.
</P>
<P>
The move came after a meeting between Mandela and Chiluba in
Pretoria on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said on Tuesday he asked Chiluba to postpone the vote,
either by declaring a state of emergency or simply using
presidential powers, to try to end boycott and prevent possible
violence.
</P>
<P>
At least one opposition party, the United National Independent
Party (UNIP) of former president Kenneth Kaunda, is boycotting
the elections.
</P>
<P>
Others joined UNIP in an unsuccessful court motion to postpone
the vote, but it was unclear how many would follow through on a
boycott.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 72, who ruled for 27 years from independence until
losing to Chiluba in the country's first multiparty elections in
1991, is protesting constitutional amendments that forbid him
from competing in presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, South African foreign ministry
said these remarks made by Zambian official Vernon Mwanga were in
fact not "consistent with the accommodating approach" adopted by
Mandela and Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is executive chairman of the 12-nation Southern
African Development Community (SADC) that includes Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Russian Lawmakers Ask Yeltsin to Investigate Into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma, the lower house
of the Russian parliament, today proposed that Russian President
Boris Yeltsin urge the prosecutor general to step up investigation
of a criminal case opened this summer.
</P>
<P>
The case, which was mentioned in today's issue of the Moskovsky
Komsomolets daily, involved two activists of Yeltsin's campaign
committee, who were detained as they carried 500,000 U.S. dollars
in cash out of the government building on June 19.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Chubais, chief of the Russian Presidential
Administration, was the head of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The 450-seat lower house discussed the case today and passed a
resolution with a vote of 267 for and three against.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution proposed by the Yabloko faction, the Duma
asked Yeltsin "immediately and unambiguously to lay down his
position on illegal activities by state and private special
services, involving complete eavesdropping, corruption of senior
officials and opening of criminal cases against them as well as
the criminalization of the state as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Duma Security Committee Viktor Lyukhin said the
package of dollars carried out of the government building featured
New York labels. "There is a suggestion that they were delivered
from there to finance the presidential campaign of Boris
Nikolayevich (Yeltsin)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the article published in the Moskovsky Komsomolets
today, Chubais said, "The article is part of an orchestrated
campaign to discredit presidential power after the successful
operation on Boris Yeltsin."
</P>
<P>
"Some circles are against strong power and order in Russia,"
Chubais said. "Chaos and confrontation in the top echelons of
power are more to their liking," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Behind all this, there is an explicit goal to distract society
from the urgent tasks facing the country by trading compromising
materials," Chubais said, not ruling out that similar falsehoods
may appear soon. "I'm prepared for them," he stated.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has an estimated population
of 25 million sickle cell carriers, with about three million
of them having developed the disease, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sickle cell disorder is an inherited disease of the red blood
cells, the agency said, quoting Professor Charles Wambebe,
President of the Sickle Cell Club of Abuja.
</P>
<P>
According to the professor, ''most patients of the disease
do not live beyond their 40th birthday. During their short life
span, sickle cell patients live tortuous lives of
excrutiating pains and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
The professor said the club is busy preparing the sickle cell
week scheduled to be held in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, from
November 25 to 30. Eminent Nigerians and physicians from other
countries, including the United States, are expected to present
papers highlighting various aspects of the disease so as to
stimulate public interest in it.
</P>
<P>
The club was formed in 1994 to promote public enlightenment and
create general awareness of the disease and its spread as well
as how to prevent and manage it.  enditem

ATHENS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Five thousand Greek policemen
will be on duty Sunday when events marking the anniversary of
the 1973 student uprising against the military junta then ruling
the country culminate in a march to the U.S. embassy in Athens.
</P>
<P>
The police have managed to secure the postponement of several
first division basketball games scheduled to be held Sunday at
stadiums in or near the center of Athens in order to release more
officers for march security duty.
</P>
<P>
The police have also asked the Association of Traders to
persuade shop owners in the vicinity of the Polytechnic Building
to remain closed on the eve of the march.
</P>
<P>
Masked youths, many of whom are self-styled anarchists, used to
create disturbances and engage in street battles with riot police
on the November 17 anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Plans drawn up by the police to prevent disturbances include
continuous patrols by 70 police motorcyclists and 50 police cars
on the roads adjacent and near to the route of the march.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, squads of riot police will be stationed at
points along the route where certain buildings and offices used
to be the targets of attacks by youths hurling rocks and petrol
bombs.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of plain-clothes men will also be monitoring the
march at a discreet distance, both on foot and in patrol cars.

<HEADLINE> Rival Iraqi Kurds Fail to Decide on Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Rival Iraqi Kurdish
factions agreed here today to consolidate the current cease-fire
but they were still far apart on vital issues like revenue
sharing which was one of the main reasons for the bloody clashes
between them.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the second meeting said that the two
sides agreed that the "Supervisory Peace Monitoring Group" would
meet in Ankara next week.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the United States, Britain, Turkey,
Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) and the Turkoman Front participated in the
meeting which started this morning.
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks last month produced a document
listing steps to re-establish a joint regional administration.
</P>
<P>
It was obvious that there was serious disagreement between
the KDP and PUK delegations on how to take new steps to mend
fences because the statement did not set a date for peace talks
for a settlement to the outstanding issues and the final
communique only said that such talks would be held "in the near
future."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that all the participants confirmed their
committment to strengthen and make permanent the cease-fire
between the two rival Kurdish factions.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "the KDP and the PUK renewed their
commitment not to disrupt civilian services for political
reasons. They undertook to implement earlier commitments to cease
media attacks against each other, as well as exchange detainees
and the remains of those killed in previous fighting."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert
Pelletreau, who chaired the second meeting in Ankara, told
reporters that the U.S. would provide northern Iraq an aid
package.

BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The watchdog China Securities
Regulatory Commission has punished 12 bank branches and brokerages
for illegally bidding for shares on credit, the Shanghai

imposed on a Hainan international trust and investment
company.

<HEADLINE> China The Growing Marker for Microwave Cookers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China has set up more than 30
microwave cooker plants, forming a yearly manufacturing capacity
of three million, according to "China Electronics News."
</P>
<P>
About two thirds of China's microwave cookers are exported. In
Chinese cities, less than one-in-ten families have bought the
cookers, leaving a big scope for the market demand to grow, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The country's annual demand for microwaves will reach 20
million by the year 2000, and the microwave cooker industry will
witness a rapid growth over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The biggest microwave maker is the Jianhua Company in Guangdong
Province, with a production capacity of 1.2 million cookers a year.
</P>
<P>
The home markets are dominated by the Chinese cookers, which
are 20 to 30 per cent cheaper on average than foreign brands,
according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordan Hails Economic Results of MENA III </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan considered its
performance at the third Middle East and North Africa (MENA Three)
economic conference which concluded in Cairo Thursday as "very
successful."
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian official, who represented the kingdom at the MENA
conference expressed satisfaction with its performance in the
international gathering, saying that it boosted the kingdom's
economic profile.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom was not expecting dramatic announcement of business
deals from the conference, but it had achieved the basic goal of
reaffirming its economic course and business potentials.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt made the best out of the conference, stemming from its
role as host, but Jordan came in as a close second," said Jordan's
Minister of Industry and Trade Ali Abul Ragheb, who led the
Jordanian delegation to the conference.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the kingdom's presentation was well
received by the gathering, both in terms of its economic
restructuring program and the business potential it offers.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy was to update the international business
community on what Jordan achieved in the one year since it hosted
the last MENA conference," the minister was quoted by today's
English-language daily Jordan Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We accomplished it very well," he added.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank of Jordan Governor Ziad Fariz said he believed
that Jordan had "consolidated its position on the regional
economic map."
</P>
<P>
"That was our main purpose and we have served that purpose
very well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Basem Awadallah, advisor at the Prime Ministry who presented
Jordan's project proposals to the conference, noted that
conclusion of business deals at the meeting itself was illogical
to expect.
</P>
<P>
"We presented ourselves well, and we can expect to see the
results in the days ahead," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan maintains that "the thrust of the Jordanian
presentation was the strength of its economic course" supported
by legislation aimed at attracting foreign capital and facilities
offered to investors under a firm commitment to a free market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The daily described Jordan as the silver-medal winner at the
MENA Three, saying that it was now looking forward to concrete
results following action at both private and public sector levels
in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that Jordan was reasonable to "feel
free and satisfied" at the current pessimistic situation
prevailing in the region. They noted that it had neither the
pressure the Egyptians shouldered to act on behalf of the Arab
world, nor the uneasiness the Palestinians, the Syrians and the
Lebanese faced to regain their territorial integrity and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanians, who signed their historic peace treaty with
the Jewish state in 1994, could focus their attention and
resources on the development of its national economy by
attracting the lion's share of foreign investments in the
region.

<P>
ROME, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met here
today respectively with Catherine Pertini, executive director of
the World Food Program, and Fawzi H. Al-Sultan, president of the
International Agricultural Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Pertini, Li expressed his thanks to the
Program for its aid and support to China's poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
As a friend of the Chinese people, Li said, Pertini has done a
lot in pushing the cooperation between the Program and relevant
departments of China.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the director on efforts to eliminate poverty in the
underdeveloped areas, Li said the Chinese government is taking
necessary measures to help people rid themselves of poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts to support the poor is to help them to eliminate
poverty by ways of development, rather than to aid them merely to
make a living," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
China now still has about 65 million people who have no ample
food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Pertini thanked Li's appreciation of her Program's work and
promised that her Program would continue to cooperate with the
Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and other departments.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Sultan, Li said International Agricultural
Development Fund have been effective in helping China's
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
He added that projects for economic development which were
funded by the Fund have played important role in the economic
development of the recipient areas.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the Fund and Chinese Ministry of Agriculture
signed an agreement on loans to the comprehensive development
projects in China's Sichuan and Qinghai provinces.

<P>
CANBERRA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- American Jenny Thompson won
the women's 50 meters freestyle Saturday at the inaugural Qantas
Skins swimming tournament in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The multiple Olympic champion beat Le Jingyi, who had claimed
her world and Olympic 100m titles as well as her 50m and 100m
world records within the past two years, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the competition, a maximum of six swimmers
would contest each event with the last placed finisher dropping
out of each heat until the final two raced off the first prize
with the runner-up to pocket 1,700 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the swimmers were allowed only two minutes of rest time
between each heat meaning the finalists had to swim five times in
10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Le crashed out in the third heat after easily winning the first
two races while Thompson, who had survived the first round when
she finished fifth, went on to beat Australia's Sarah Ryan in the
final.
</P>
<P>
Thompson was one of only four non-Australians winners at the
meet which was the first major swimming event to be staged since
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's Danyon Loader, who won the 200m-400m freestyle
double in Atlanta, finished third in the men's 400m freestyle,
which had only one race but 850 U.S. dollars bonuses for the
leader after each 100m, while Germany's former 400m-1500m world
champion Jorg Hoffmann placed second.
</P>
<P>
Liu Limin of China, the 100m butterfly world record holder,
could only manage second in the 50m butterfly while Australia's
Susie O'Neill, who took gold over 200m in Atlanta, finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
Marianne Limpert of Canada, who finished second behind
Ireland's Michelle Smith in the Olympic medley final, won the 200m

victims of one of the worst air disasters that occurred in
northern India Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency reports quoted Saudi insurance officials in
the Saudi capital city of Riyadh today as saying that the
insurance policy for the Saudi Airliner would stand at around 69
million U.S. dollars, while 37 million dollars would be paied for
the Kazakh plane and about 24 million U.S. dollars for the
victims.
</P>
<P>
But it did not say which insurance company would pay the
insurance money.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 13 of the 14 bodies including those of the crew and
one Saudi passenger have so far been transported back to Saudi
Arabia and buried. The other body of a security man on board has
yet to be found.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Castro Slams Hegemonism and Capitalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
today said hegemonism and capitalism are the cause of millions of
people dying of hunger and injustice in the world.
</P>
<P>
"It is capitalism, neo-liberalism, the laws of a wild market,
the external debt, underdevelopment and the unequal terms of
reference that are killing so many people in the world," Castro
said while addressing the five-day World Food Summit which is now
in its fourth day.
</P>
<P>
"Why is it that 700 billion dollars are invested every year in
the military instead of investing a portion of those resources in
fighting hunger, preventing the deterioration of the soils, the
desertification and deforestation of millions of hectares every
year, the warming up of the atmosphere and the greenhouse effect
that increases the number of hurricanes, the scarcity or excess of
rain, the destruction of the ozone layer and other natural
phenomena which negatively affect food production and man's life
on the earth ?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"Why are increasingly sophisticated weapons still being
produced after the Cold War is over? What are those weapons for if
not to dominate the world? Why that ferocious competition to sell
to the underdeveloped countries weapons that will not make them
more powerful to defend their independence while they would rather
be killing hunger?"
</P>
<P>
"Let the truth prevail and not hypocrisy and deceit. Let's
build an awareness on the fact that hegemonism, arrogance and
selfishness must cease in this world," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He deplored that while the world is rightly moved by accidents,
and natural or social catastrophes that bring death to hundreds or
thousands of people, it is not equally moved by the genocide which
is taking place every day.
</P>
<P>
"Intervention forces are organized to prevent the death of
hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Zaire. What are we
going to do to prevent the starvation of one million people every
month in the rest of the world ?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientist on Plants Resistance To Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli scientist has
achieved results in his research on how plants develop
resistance to unfavorably environmental conditions, according to a
report published by Weizmann Institute of Science in its latest
issue of Science Tips.
</P>
<P>
Plants cannot run away from danger as animals do, but
they have therefore evolved various mechanisms to protect
themselves against environmental stresses such as heat, cold,
drought, mechanical pressure and lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, one such protective measure is a
slackening of their growth rate, which prevents them from
reaching full size and may facilitate their survival in stressful
situations.
</P>
<P>
One of the plant enzymes that rapidly swings into action in
response to environmental stresses is glutamate decarboxylase
(GAD), which stimulates the production of a substance known as
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Dr. Hillel Fromm of the Weizmann
Institute's Plant Genetics Department was the first to clone the
GAD gene from plants and to identify the mechanism that activates
this enzyme in response to stress.
</P>
<P>
Now, Fromm's colleagues have reproduced this growth-suppression
phenomenon under lab conditions. They have genetically engineered
a model tabacco plant lacking a protein segment that normally
limits GABA production. The mutant plants are thus forced to
overproduce and accumulate GABA. As a result, cells in the plant
stem fail to expand, and plant growth is stunted.
</P>
<P>
Fromm's next challenge is to determine whether and how the
surplus GABA and the resultant curtailment of growth endow the
plant with protection. This information might make it possible
to genetically engineer crops with better resistance to
environmental threats.
</P>
<P>
Certain aspects of this study were recently described in
the EMBO Journal, while other aspects will soon be published

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The income of China's peasant
farmers has gone up by more than ten percent this year, thanks to
a bumper harvest.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that in the first nine months this year
the average per capita cash income for Chinese farmers increased
by 223.7 yuan, compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
After allowing for pricing factors, the actual average per
capita income for farmers is up by 10.2 percent to 1,348 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that the gap of income growth rate
between farmers in the eastern, central and western parts of China
has been further narrowed.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita cash income for farmers in eastern China
was 1,908 yuan, up 20.6 percent over last year. In the country's
central areas it averaged 1,124 yuan, 19.8 percent higher, while
in China's poorest region in western parts, it was 810 yuan, a
rise of 17.9 percent.
</P>
<P>

standards have been improved. The average per capita living
consumption expenditure by farmers in first nine months topped
788.2 yuan, or an actual increase of 16.6 percent over the same
period of last year, marking the largest increase since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Stage Large War Games in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that
it will stage one-week grand military maneuvers involving 10,000
soldiers and 1,000 warships in the Persian Gulf on November 21.
</P>
<P>
Navy Commander Ali Shamkhani said at a one-hour press
conference that the military maneuvers will include amphibious
operations, missile launching, surface and subsurface operations.
</P>
<P>
This would be the 35th military maneuvers the Iranian Navy
has conducted since the beginning of this Iranian calendar year
starting from March 20.
</P>
<P>
He said there will be 12 more such war games in the last four
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old commander said that the maneuvers will stretch
from the Sea of Oman to the Island of Siri. "All the seven forces
of the army and the Islamic Revolution's Guard Corps will be
taking part in it."
</P>
<P>
Another report said the services plus paramilitary Islamic
Revolution's Guards Corps will jointly launch the war games.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani said "the number of our maneuvers is small as
compared with that of the United States and other western forces
in the Persian Gulf.+
</P>
<P>
"There are 99 warships belonging to the western forces in the
Persian Gulf. The majority of them belong to the United States,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
For small waterway such as the Persian Gulf, he said, the
presence of 99 warships amount to virtual occupation. "This
occupation is illegitimate."
</P>
<P>
As to the question on whether Iran would send a message to
the United States through this military maneuvers, he said, "we
have no message to any foreign force in the Persian Gulf. Our
maneuvers have no aim in sending any message that would entail
any tension for any party."
</P>
<P>
"The aim of these maneuvers is to preserve defensive
capability and boost the Navy's readiness," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the question of potential military confrontation between
the Iranian forces and the U.S. forces, he said, "We are trying
to be alive and deterrent. We are not after any conflict with any
party."
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "the army people should be prepared for
the worst. The conditions of the region have no room for
conflict. We have no bad intention."

LUSAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said here today that his South African counterpart Nelson
Mandela has not interfered in Zambia's internal affairs but only
tried to help promote dialogue between himself and his rival
former president Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
He told a news briefing at State House that Mandela has the
right to ask about matters in a friendly country like Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Mandela has never interfered in his country's
affairs but only wanted to ensure that all parties participate in
the November 18 elections.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said no Zambian government ministers and ruling party
officials are allowed to comment on statements by leaders of
other countries in the region on Zambia's affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said from now on issues that are raised by other leaders in
the region will only be commented on by himself.
</P>
<P>
Zambia wants to maintain good relations with neighboring
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday Chiluba turned down a suggestion from Mandela that
the elections be postponed, saying there is no crisis in his
country and therefore there is no need to declare a state of
emergency to facilitate the postponement.
</P>
<P>
On the same day Defense Minister Benjamin Mwila told
neighboring countries to stop meddling in the internal affairs of
Zambia, saying that they have no right to tell Zambians what to do.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Accuses Netanyahu of Disappointing Arab Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said Saturday that hatred against Israel was rising in the Middle
East as its Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was losing the
confidence of Arab leaders committed to peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Financial Times published Saturday,
Mubarak said Netanyahu replaced confidence with a wall of
suspicion and bitterness, which created a very dangerous situation
for moderates in the region and might lead to a new outbreak of
violence.
</P>
<P>
Even Egypt and Jordan, which signed peace deals with the Jewish
state, were taking a risk in dealing with Netanyhu's government,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"In this status quo of doubt and suspicion, it will be very
difficult to deal with the Israelis on the level of governments,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the land-for-peace principle cannot be altered,
he described as a "timebomb" the recent decision by Netanyahu to
build new Jewish settlements on the Palestinian land around the
occupied Arab eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president urged Israel to honor the Oslo peace
accords and redeploy troops in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
He told the British daily that Egypt gave Netanyahu enough time
and he has to make decisions.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these decisions are risky but when it comes to peace,
decisions should be taken," he said, warning that violence and
destruction will be back if the Jewish leader fails to end this
situation soon.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak regretted that nothing has happened since Netanyahu
told him he wanted some time to sort out things during a visit
here in June immediately after he took power.
</P>
<P>
The president also warned against the disastrous consequences
of the Israeli demands in the Hebron deal, describing the demands
as a "new sort of racial segregation."
</P>
<P>
Even if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accepted the Israeli
requests, the Palestinian people would certainly refuse them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators ended their sixth week of
talks on the fate of the West Bank town of Hebron without
clinching deal over Israel's demand to allow its troops to enter
PLO-run areas in Hebron, where over 400 Jews live amidst 120,000
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic
conference, concluded here on Thursday night, focused on economic
intergation among the Arab states, not the new Middle East
project, preached by the former Israeli Labor government to boost
trade and investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
In another interview with the BBC, Mubarak said that the
Israelis will not be able to stop the peace process, but warned
against fresh violence if the Palestinians and Israelis fail to
reach an agreement to implement the long-delayed troop
redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
He addeded that the Israeli businessmen who attended the MENA
conference were worried at the peace stagnation because they
realized the link between peace progress and economic prosperity.

<P>
CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt managed to clinch deals
and investment accords worth 10 billion Egyptian pounds (about
three billion U.S. dollars) at the just concluded regional
economic conference here, said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, playing host to the three-day Middle-East and North
Africa (MENA) economic conference, submitted a total of 188
projects at a total cost of 33.5 billion Egyptian pounds (about 10
billion U.S. dollars) to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told local reporters Saturday that the private sectors
are important to Egypt's economy. If without privatization, he
said, the loss of the public sector companies would have swallowed
all Egypt's revenues.
</P>
<P>
A strong private sector representation made the Cairo gathering
more business-oriented than its predecessors in Amman and
Casablanca. It hosted 2,600 business participants from 87
countries and regions and 52 business organizations.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Be China's Leading Optic Fiber Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has become the major
supplier for China's optic fiber market, producing 230,000
kilometers of fiber a year.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, Shanghai has installed its optical
fiber to five of the country's 22 long-distance cable trunks, and
successfully survived rigorous competition from a dozen foreign
telecom giants, such as Siemens, AT&AMP;T, Philips, Japan's NEC and
Fujitsu, and Samsung of South Korea, said the journal "China
Telecomworld."
</P>
<P>
By absorbing the technologies of Lucent Technologies, former
system and network business of AT&AMP;T, the city has formed the
largest base for optic fiber manufacturing in the country. Its
production capacity will hit 600,000 km of fiber next year.
</P>
<P>
The city will also take the lead in China to produce sub-marine
optical cable next year, forming a fiber manufacturing capacity of
1,000 km annually.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Shanghai Optic Telecom Company, the city's leading
optical fiber and cable maker, has won a 40 per cent share of the
country's optical cable projects. And the city's market share of
optical transmission equipment in China now exceeds 30 per cent.

Additionally, the government will map out plans to clarify

marine resources. The plans will serve as the basis for the
coordinated development of marine economies, and rational
utilization of marine resources, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "China will manage the ocean by using the law based on
the principles put forward by the United Nations' Convention on
Law of The Sea."
</P>
<P>
China will continue to implement prevention-oriented policies
to curb ocean pollution, Chen said, adding that an
approval-before-use, and pay-after-use mechanism has been
introduced to regulate the explorations.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he explained, the government will launch fewer
polluted or pollution-free ocean industries, support the
development of clean technology, and exercise strict control
over discharges into important seas and waters.
</P>
<P>
And the country will continue to establish various kinds of
marine natural reserves and special protection zones to protect
important marine ecosystem, natural resources, natural scenery and
important species.
</P>
<P>
The development of ocean technology is a part of China's high

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia and Indonesia are
teaming up to host talks on turtle protection in a bid to stop the
loss of marine turtles in the Indo-Pacific region, Australian
Environment Minister Robert Hill said today.
</P>
<P>
Hill said the seminar, scheduled for November 18-22 in Java,
Indonesia, would be attended by officials, scientists and
non-government organization representatives from Indonesia,
Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the event would result in a clear direction
for the future of marine turtle research and management in
Indonesia through collaboration with Australia and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Marine turtle species like the green turtle are important in
the diets and economies of many coastal societies in the
Indo-Pacific region, so cooperation between these societies is
essential for the effective management of turtles," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The uncontrolled exploitation of marine turtles will
ultimately result in the demise of the species and the loss of
livelihood for fishermen and traders, so sustainable use should be
the goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first joint exercise between the conservation
agencies of Australia and Indonesia since the signing of a
memorandum of understanding on the issue last year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Election Campaigns Close in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The month-long campaigning for
Thailand's 19th general elections came to a close at 6 o'clock
this afternoon after campaigners' last efforts at wooing votes at
mid-day today.
</P>
<P>
Canvassers then disappeared from the streets and gathered at
restaurants to have a feast and a bout of drinks just before the
alcohol ban in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Thai law forbids people to sell, distribute, give away or
drink beverages containing alcohol in public places from 6 o'clock
today till midnight Sunday. The regulation is intended to prevent
violence on the election day.
</P>
<P>
The canvassers not only celebrated the end of their hard work
in the last four weeks, but also their survival.
</P>
<P>
The local press described the campaigns this year as the
"dirtiest" and the "most violent" in Thailand's 64 years of
constitutional monarchy because of rampant vote-buying and
campaign-related murders.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people, mostly canvassers, were killed and some 20
others wounded in election-related violence across the country.
</P>
<P>
Pollwatch, a neutral election supervision agency, estimated
that between 20 billion and 30 billion baht (800 million and 1.2
billion U.S. dollars) was spent on campaigning, including buying
votes and bribing former MPs of other parties.
</P>
<P>
The price of a vote has risen from about 50 to 100 baht (2 to 4
U.S. dollars) in the last election in July 1995, to between 100
and 500 baht (4 to 20 U.S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
In some constituencies where the contest is red hot, the price
can be as high as 1,000 baht (40 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the New Aspiration Party and the
Democrat Party are the two front runners racing neck-and-neck in
Sunday's elections, with each of them possibly bagging 120-130
seats.
</P>
<P>
A coalition government is possible as none of the political
parties is expected to win a clear majority.
</P>
<P>
By normal practice, the party with the largest number of seats
will become the core of the new government and its leader the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party led by outgoing Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa is expected to rank fourth in the
election, while the Chart Pattana (National Development) led by
former prime minister Chatichai Choonhavan could rank third.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Two singers of the French rap group, NTM, Kool Shen and Joey
Starr, were condemned Thursday by the Grand Investigation Court of
Toulon to six months in jail and six months of banning of
performing in France for "outrageous remarks" toward police during
a concert show. One has to check the history of the 19th century
to find a similar case of persecution against musicians.
</P>
<P>
-- From Sake -- a small bay beside the Lake Kivu -- to Goma,
700,000 Rwandan refugees are on their way home trekking on a
30-kilometer long road. The children, too tired to walk on, were
crying as they were pushed forward by the huge human tide surging
on the Rwandan border. Zairean Tutsis opened the way for the
refugees to go home after taking the Mugunga refugee camp from the
Hutu extremists on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Rwandan government said that the international intervention
force to be deployed in eastern Zaire is no longer needed because
all the Rwandan refugees are going home. About 700,000 Hutu
refugees are going home, after the Zairean Tutsis took the refugee
camp of Mugunga from the Hutu extremists on Friday, said the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
-- Kool Shen and Joey Starr, two singers of the rap group NTM,
were condemned Thursday by a court in Toulon to six months in jail
for insulting police during a concert show. In one of their songs,
which is a real appeal for murder, the rappers expressed their
"hatred for the cops." The condemnation came at the same time
when a rare violent attack on a policeman in uniform took place.

<HEADLINE> Symposium Held on Wireless Telecom Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Mobile phone experts have
recommended China to introduce a new sophisticated system to
overcome a bottleneck in cellular communications.
</P>
<P>
They say that CDMA - code diversion multiple access - is a
good alternative to a cellular system because of its wider range
and bigger capacity.
</P>
<P>
Their call came at a high-profile symposium held in China to
discuss CDMA, one of the most sophisticated wireless
telecommunications models in the world.
</P>
<P>
The event drew senior officials from Chinese government and
foreign telecom companies.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, decision makers from China's ministry of posts
and telecommunications (MPT), wireless technology management
committee, big name foreign companies, such as Motorola, Nortel,
Samsung and Lucky Goldstar, exchanged ideas on the prospects of
CDMA in China and other technical problems in promoting the model
here, according to "People's Posts and Telecommunications News."
</P>
<P>
So far, China has six million mobile phone users, and the
figure is expected to exceed 18 million by the year 2000. But the
bottlenecks in frequency resources and switching capacity has
worsened as market demand for mobile phones grows rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggested that the CDMA model, which has a bigger
switching capacity, and wider coverage, could be a good
alternative to the existing cellular telecom models used
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Gao Huigang, vice director of MPT Telecommunications
Directorate, and Li Xiuchuan, vice director of MPT Mobile
Telecommunications Bureau, attended the symposium.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Dictionary of Its Most Famous Ancient Novel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China has published a
dictionary of its most-famous ancient novel "A Dream of Red
Mansions" to help readers and researchers study the masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
The dictionary collects 25,000 words and expressions used in
the novel, giving ideas on how the ancient Chinese language has
developed into a modern one.
</P>
<P>
"A Dream of Red Mansions", written by Cao Xueqin in the
mid-18th century, depicts the lives of a big feudalist family, and
its collapse. The work is considered as the greatest achievement
in ancient China's literary creations.
</P>
<P>
An executive at the Commercial Press, publishers of the
dictionary, said that the new book is of great significance
because modern readers have difficulty understanding and analyzing
the novel.
</P>
<P>
"A Dream of Red Mansions" has a large number of readers both at
home and abroad. The fans of the novel include late Chairman Mao
Zedong and other Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
The book is a myth to scholars and ordinary readers because of
its complicated theme and sophisticated characters. The study of
"A Dream of Red Mansions" has been a school of thought for many
years.
</P>
<P>
Scholars spent 10 years compiling the dictionary.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Official Blames Hebron Impasse on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Egyptian official today
blamed the current stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli talks on
Israel's failure to implement concluded peace accords with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry First Undersecretary Osama el-Baz told Sawt-el
Arab radio that the peace process is currently in a stalemate due
to the procrastinating Israeli stance, which has led to repeated
falure in implementing the previously-concluded agreements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators Saturday ended their sixth
week of talks without clinching a deal on the fate of the West
Bank town of Hebron, where 450 Jews live among 200,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Overnight talks failed to break an impasse over israel's demand
to have the right to re-enter the PLO-run areas in Hebron in
pursuit of suspected guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Baz, who is also a senior advisor to President Hosni Mubarak,
voiced his hope that the Palestinians and Israelis would reach an
agreement on the Israeli redeployment in Hebron to pave the way
for setting a timetable to expedite the peace march.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the necessity of making progress in the
Arab-Israeli peace process, in line with the Madrid peace
conference principles as well as the land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
"Regional cooperation can never be realized except through
promoting the peace process," said Baz, who is also director of
the president's office for political affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Plague has killed
over 600 people in Lushoto district, northeastern Tanzania since
its outbreak in 1980, and is likely to get worse in the next few
months because of the sudden rise of rodent population, warned
the local media today.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Bukaat Kilonzo of the Sokoine University of Agriculture
(SUA) was quoted as saying, "the rodents are roaming eveywhere in
Lushoto and just like insects and this is a crucial indicator
that the situaion would soon get worse."
</P>
<P>
He was addressing a medical conference which was organized by
the Tanzania Public Health Association (TPHA) and attended by
over 100 health and medical experts in the town of Morogoro on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Plague, caused by a bacterium known as "Yersinia Pestis", is
transmitted in human being through fleas carried by rodents
including domestic rats.
</P>
<P>
At least 6,300 cases of plague have been recorded in Lushoto
district since 1980, with a death toll of 8.9 percent of them.

<HEADLINE> S.African Finance Minister Warns of Growing Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNEBURG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Debt would become the
single largest item in South Africa's budget unless it was curbed
in time, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel was quoted by today's
"the Citizen" as warning.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual congress of the Federation of South
African Labour Unions on Friday in Pretoria, Manuel said the
country's debt would be 311 billion Rand (about 66 billion US
Dollars) by the end of the current fiscal year, in comparison
with that of 20 billion Dollars in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Debt service has taken 36 billion Rand (about 7.8 billion US
Dollars) off the budget of this year, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Unless checked, debt will become the single largest item in
the budget," Manuel warned.
</P>
<P>
The Minister blamed the former apartheid government for the
excesses, saying the new government inherited a state which saw
its mandate as primarily dealing with a minority of the
population.
</P>
<P>
Between 1975 and 1983, the apartheid regime spent some 32.5
million US Dollars on the security establishment only, said
Manuel.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that the country had an annual population
growth of about 2.4 percent between 1980 and 1993, while the
economy was shrinking at 0.2 percent a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would only
contribute military troops to refugee mission in Zaire if they
were placed under African command, President Nelson Mandela has
said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the decision on Friday after hearing reports
about talks between South African officials and former Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Mandela sent a high-level delegation to
Dar-es-Salaam to discuss details about a possible peacekeeping
force in strife-torn eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the latest development in the region, where
thousands of Hutu refugees are streaming from Zaire back to
Rwanda on their own, might make an international peacekeeping
force unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
This was in sharp contrast with the decision made at the
recent regional summit in Nairobi, Kenya, to create an
international peacekeeping force in Zaire, aimed to provide safe
corridors for refugees to return unhindered.
</P>
<P>
South Africa did not feel comfortable with the idea of
Canadians, Americans and the French taking charge of peacekeeping
force on the African continent, according to South African
officials.
</P>
<P>
Zaire on Friday asked South Africa to play a leading role in
the planned international peacekeeping mission in Zaire to secure
the safety of aid supplies to Africa's worst refugee disaster.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Solves Bread Price Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Bread prices will be reduced
in Turkey next week as the government has solved controversy with
bakery owners.
</P>
<P>
The bread prices will be reduced to 15,000 Turkish Liras (0.15
U.S. dollars) from 18,000 TL (0.18 dollars) as part of the
economic program intended to benefit low-wage earners, who
provide the bulk of support for Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan's party.
</P>
<P>
The government failed to implement the price reduction Friday
as was announced by Erbakan earlier, because bakery owners
complained that it was unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
But late Friday the government succeeded to persuade bakery
owners to reduce the prices from next Wednesday by offering lower
priced wheat, according to officials from the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Affairs.

<HEADLINE> National Unity Government Suggested in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior member of Israel's
ruling Likud group has suggested the establishment of a national
unity government ahead of permanent status talks with
Palestinians, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Dan Meridor, a known dove in the hardline
Likud, explained that such a government will be the best way to
obtain successful results in the final stage Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu Friday night also raised the
possibility of including the Labor Party, but without its leader
Shimon Peres, in his coalition after the partial Israeli army
withdrawal from the West Bank Palestinian city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In a speech broadcast by satellite to a U.S. Jewish conference
in Seattle, Netanyahu said that Israel must be as united as
possible when it comes to the negotiations on a permanent
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the idea of joining the current Likud-led rightwing
government. Labor Party Secretary-General Nissim Zvilli said that
his party will not enter into partnership with Likud.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who is now in Seattle attending the U.S. Jewish
conference, told the Jewish leaders Friday night that he sees a
historic window of opportunity in next four years to achieve a
lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and 1997 is
going to be a crucial year.
</P>
<P>
If the Jewish people lose this opportunity, the former prime
minister said, "our children will never forget it."
</P>
<P>
Peres said that negotiations with Syria will have to involve
giving part of the Golan Heights. He warned that, without a
territorial compromise, there will not peace.
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Prize laureate said that Israel could postpone it
for 10 years, but the price would not go down.
</P>
<P>
Israel has precedent of forming a national unity government
at a time of government crisis. During the last Likud government
led by Yitzhak Shamir from 1988 to 1992, Likud formed a national
unity government with Labor.

<HEADLINE> US Gives Non-NATO Ally Status to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan welcomed U.S. President
Bill Clinton's decision to name the Kingdom as a major non-North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally of the United States,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move will entitle Jordan to "priority consideration"
for military aid and equipment, Deputy Spokesman for U.S. State
Department Glyn Daviesa was quoted by today's English
daily Jordan Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the designation did not carry with it
any new or expanded U.S. commitment to come to Jordan's
defense in a time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Davis said the special status was warranted because of
Jordan's place in the Middle East and U.S.-led peace making
there.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the United States Information Service said
the status also facilitated bilateral military training, research
and stockpiling agreements and permits Jordanian companies to bid
on certain U.S. Department of Defense contracts.
</P>
<P>
A non-NATO ally status would also allow for the positioning of
U.S. military equipment in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Daviesa stressed that Jordan and the United States
have not discussed the positioning of U.S. weapons in the country.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the U.S. had undertaken several joint military
exercises in the Kingdom this year and, for the first time,
hosted the U.S. aircrafts which flew surveillance in the no-fly
zone in the south of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Amman also received 16 F-16 fighters from Washington earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. move was widely believed here as the formal
recognition of Jordan by Washington as a major partner in
U.S. "strategic landscape" in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
A strategic specialist, who asked not to be identified, told
Xinhua that the U.S. move marks the completion of forming the
so-called U.S. Middle East strategic triangle, which groups
Jordan, Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Other countries granted the status in the world include
Australia, Egypt, Israel, Japan and the Republic of Korea.

<HEADLINE> Iran Buys Submarine from Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced today that it
has bought a new submarine from Russia, the third of the kind
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Navy Commander Ali Shamkhani told a press conference the
delivery of the submarine is expected late this month, but
stopping short elaborating the deal.
</P>
<P>
A foreign military specialist told Xinhua that the deal is
estimated at 130 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the submarine, the third of the kind, has been
delayed for more than one year due to the economic crisis in Iran
and the two countries' disagreement on ways of payment.
</P>
<P>
Iran first wanted to buy the Russian submarine on barter
trade basis. But Russia did not agree upon it.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador Sergei M. Tretyakov has told Xinhua that
Iran must pay in cash for Russian submarines.
</P>
<P>
Russia had delivered two Kilo-class submarines to the Iranian
Navy. The first one was delivered 1992 and the second in 1993, at
the prices of 100 million and 115 million dollars
respectively. They are now based in southern Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The 18,000-personnel-strong Iranian navy force now has three
destroyers and six bases of Bandar Abbas, Bushehr, Kharg, Bandar
Anzeli, Bandar Khomeini and Chah Bahar.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani said Iran is to make its navy powerful enough to
challenge any military threats in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the navy has purchased missile launchers and
upgraded existing fleets during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's defense expense is the lowest compared with
other countries in the Gulf. But he refused to give figures.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to the conclusion that we should not enter
the arms race since our resources are limited," he added.

<HEADLINE> 400 Foreign Workers in Kuwait Found Carrying AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 440 expatriate
workers in Kuwait were found to be AIDS virus carriers in the past
five years, the health ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Rashed Al-Owaish, director of the health ministry's Community
Health Department told local daily Arab Times in an exclusive
interview published today that all those who were found
HIV-positive were deported immediately.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait hosts a total of 1.2 million foreign workers and
their families in the country, about 63 percent of the Kuwaiti
present 1.9 million population. Most of the workers come from
Egypt and south Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is one of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries
which attracted millions of foreign laborers to do manual and
service work mainly with their private sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said GCC countries, which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, have set up joint
medical check-up centers in various Asian countries to unify
criteria of medical fitness for labor being supplied to GCC
states.
</P>
<P>
He said such medical centers had been established in big
cities of India, Pakistan, the Philippines and Bangladesh. He said
all persons coming to GCC countries would have to be examined
thoroughly at these newly established medical centers.
</P>
<P>
He said "the aim of such centers is to minimize the
number of rejected foreign workers," adding that if there was
no check-up in those countries, the number of deportation would
be proportionately higher.

<HEADLINE> South China Subway Project Goes Ahead In Spite Of Cave-in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Construction work on a
subway in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, is going ahead
in the aftermath of a cave-in.
</P>
<P>
The walls of nine two-story apartment buildings on Huagui
Street suddenly started cracking on the morning of Nov. 9, and it
was reported to the government.
</P>
<P>
A study of the situation revealed that the damage was caused by
subway work. Investigators said that a tunnel boring
machine had encountered some unforeseen geological changes, but
had failed to revise its calculations and had caused the ground to
sink 146 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
Steps were taken to raise the ground ten millimeters on Nov. 9
and the ground has been stabilized, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
Because of complicated geological conditions in the section of
the road, bids were solicited from international companies for the
construction work, with the Aoki Corporation of Japan winning,
using the tunnel boring method for the project, sources of the
subway authorities said.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the Japanese constructors were to
hold ground fluctuations to within 40 millimeters. The Chinese side
now is consulting with the Japanese side and will file claims for
the housing damage, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Hebei to Eliminate Poverty Before The Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province is to launch a campaign to help its 3.5 million
impoverished people shake off poverty within the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Since the province began an aid-the-poor project in 1994, it
has aided nearly 3.6 million poor people in more than 1,200
villages.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Hebei poured nearly 1.5 billion yuan
into poverty-relief programs, and issued a series of preferential
policies, covering finance, taxation, revenue, transportation and
energy, for the local poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
In order to guide poor villages to the road to prosperity,
Hebei has held scientific and technological training programs for
cadres and village leaders. In the past three years, the province
has helped train nearly 10,000 leaders in rural areas, promoting
more than 200 new agricultural technologies.
</P>
<P>
In that same period, Hebei invested nearly 300 million yuan in
developing economic cooperation between poor villages, and setting
up 122 large-scale commodity development zones.
</P>
<P>
Annual average income per capita in the province's 46 poor
counties has risen from 435 yuan in 1993 to the current 1,142
yuan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Japanese Researchers to Help Deaf Children Hear, Speak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese
scientists and technicians are to work together to develop a
system that can help deaf children to learn to speak.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Matsushita Electronic
Industrial Company of Japan have signed a cooperation contract. It
will be the first time that Matsushita cooperates with China to
develop a new technology.
</P>
<P>
About 20 million people in China have hearing and speech
deficiencies. Many children can not speak normally because of
deafness or partial hearing problems.
</P>
<P>
If these children can receive hearing and speech training when
they are very young, they can recover part of their hearing and
speech abilities. Such training is seen as significant to the
children in terms of education, working and living normal lives.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are nearly 2,000 institutions providing
recovery training for deaf children across China.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from CAS and Matsushita will develop a
Chinese-version system to train deaf children to hear and speak,
based on the study of the peculiarities of Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the technology will promote the
application of modern information processing technology, and make
a major contribution in recovery for Chinese disabled
people.

<HEADLINE> China to Wipe Out Cigarette Advertisements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China, the country with the
world's biggest number of smokers, is planning a nationwide ban on
cigarette advertising.
</P>
<P>
Cao Ronggui, vice-minister of Public Health, said that the
ultimate aim of an activity to establish cigarette
advertisement-free cities is to completely wipe out cigarette
advertising throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Cao made the remark at the Seventh China Symposium on Smoking
and Health, held in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Cao said that in recent years, western tobacco companies have
spent huge amounts of money on cigarette advertising in China, in
an attempt to transfer the cigarette consumer market to China.
</P>
<P>
He warned the tobacco industry that China will by no means
allow such a thing, and will resist the trend with all-out efforts.
</P>
<P>
A number of Chinese cities, including Beijing, Zhuhai in south
China's Guangdong province, and Zhangjiagang in east China's
Jiangsu Province, have already stubbed out cigarette
advertisements. Earlier this year Beijing imposed a ban on
cigarette smoking in public places, with on-the-spot fines for
violators.

<HEADLINE> China Looking For Ways To Ease Yellow River Water Shortages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have begun
looking for more scientific and efficient ways to use the
resources of the Yellow River, China's second longest, to halt the
decrease in the volume of water.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Yellow River water accounts for only two
percent of the combined volume of the country's major rivers, and
is only one-twentieth that of the Yangtze, the country's longest,
but that its utilization ratio is 52 percent, the highest among
China's seven biggest rivers.
</P>
<P>
This means that out of an average annual flow of 58 billion
cubic meters of water, over 30 billion cubic metres get used, much
of it for irrigating 7.4 million hectares of farmland. The
remaining water goes to factories and homes in dozens of cities in
China's energy and chemical industry bases along the river.
</P>
<P>
Over time, industrial and agricultural consumption of Yellow
River water has increased, reaching a total of 30.7 billion cubic
meters per year, and approaching the total utilization capacity,
leaving little water for other use, although there should be 20
billion cubic meters to wash the great quantity of silt the river
carries from the Loess Plateau down to the sea, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The growing demand for water is in stark contrast to decreasing
water resources. From 1972 to 1996, there were numerous instances
of water drying up in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as China shifts its economic focus from the east to
central and western parts, and social and economic development in
the Yellow River Valley continues, the contradiction between
supply and demand in water resources will become more acute.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, water control experts suggest that more
reservoirs be built on the Yellow River's main stream to regulate
the volume. They also propose that people be made more aware of
saving water, to improve water utilization efficiency in areas
irrigated by the river, and to have a unified administration to
control water use.
</P>
<P>
The experts say they believe that such measures can help
maintain current water flow until the year 2010. But, they point
out, in the long run, the solution to Yellow River water shortages
is to divert water from the Yangtze in the south, to the north, a
necessary and feasible plan, according to ten years of study and
research.

<HEADLINE> Candidate Nomination Represents Real Democracy: HK Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- With the three candidates
for the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) nominated Friday, local newspapers hail the event
as the beginning of a new era for Hong Kong's democracy.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial, Wen Wei Po said that the first meeting of the
Selection Committee held in Hong Kong and the process for the
committee to vote for the candidates mark a milestone in the
development of Hong Kong's genuine democracy.
</P>
<P>
It said that over the past 150 years, Britain had appointed 28
governors but never listened to Hong Kong people's opinions.
</P>
<P>
It is only in Hong Kong's transition period that the Hong Kong
people gain their democratic rights unimaginable under the
British colonial rule, the editorial noted.
</P>
<P>
It said the establishment of the Selection Committee represents
the real participation of the Hong Kong people in decision-making
process for Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
Sing Pao Daily News said that the nomination of the Chief
Executive candidates was quite fair and open.
</P>
<P>
It said that just as Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said, it
is unprecedented in Hong Kong's history for Hong Kong people to
elect their own Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
It said that the 400-member Selection Committee is broadly
represented in Hong Kong, adding that the formation of the
Selection Committee and the nomination of the Chief Executive
candidates mark the first step in genuine democracy.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Daily News said that the three candidates elected by
the Selection Committee reflect Hong Kong people's will.
</P>
<P>
It said that Hong Kong people are expecting the Selection
Committee to elect a qualified Chief Executive and Provisional
Legislative Council to fulfill its historical mission.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao said that the whole process of the nomination of
the candidates for the Chief Executive represents the
implementation of the principle of "Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
It said facts show that in the nomination of the Selection
Committee, there were no so-called black-box operations and
preordained persons for the candidates.
</P>
<P>
It said that all citizens wishing Hong Kong a smooth transition
and long-term stability and prosperity should be happy with their
genuine democratic rights acquired through the work of the
Selection Committee.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Calls for Pushing Forward Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen today appealed for national reconciliation and
eternal peace here.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the appeal at a peace rally held in the Olympic
Stadium by the Cambodian Students and Youth Federation, which was
attended by 10,000 including students, soldiers and over 60
breakaway Khmer Rouge soldiers who have joined the Royal Cambodian
Armed Forces (RCAF).
</P>
<P>
"We should put an end to the bitter past when people were
separated and labeled as communists, liberals and nationalists,"
Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that any political party or politician that take the
attitude of the past are equal to national conflict instigator.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen urged the nation to firmly continue peace efforts in
the area still held by the Khmer Rouge in order to finally realize
real national unity and territorial integrity of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"Peace process must continue toward Anlong Veng," where the
Khmer Rouge is headquartered, said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for solidarity of the RCAF and national police
while praising the role of the armed forces in bringing peace to
the country.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen asked the students to give honors to the armed forces
instead of any political party.
</P>
<P>
He also highlighted the support of the National Assembly, King
Norodom Sihanouk, whom he called an umbrella of national
reconciliation, and Prince Norodom Ranariddh in peace making.

<HEADLINE> Second Prime Minister Apologizes to King Sihanouk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen today made a public apology for reportedly
violating the dignity of King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
"I seemed to be violating His Majesty the King's dignity and
his credit in my proposal for granting amnesty to Ieng Sary,"
Hun Sen told a peace rally in the Olympic Stadium in Phnom Penh of
the Cambodian Students and Youth Federation.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Sary, a former Khmer Rouge leader, was granted amnesty
about a month after he broke away from his former ranks in August
this year.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said that after learning Ieng Sary was waiting for a
document from the Royal Government to hold a press conference, he
drafted a decree on granting amnesty to Ieng Sary and submitted it
for approval and signature by the King after First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh agreed on the document.
</P>
<P>
The King signed the document which stipulated that the royal
decree could only take effect after being signed in support by two
thirds of the parliament members.
</P>
<P>
"That day happened to be a holiday and the National Assembly
was in recess," Hun Sen said, "I made copies of the signed royal
decree and had it sealed and registered in the Royal Palace."
</P>
<P>
Eager to bring more Khmer Rouge forces to the government side,
and knowing the feelings of the parliament members, he ordered a
general to hand over the royal decree to Ieng Sary on the day when
the number of parliament members who signed in support of the
decree did not reach the needed two-thirds of the total, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The press seemed to say that I violated the dignity of His
Majesty the King and his credit", Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen noted that he acknowledged his fault and made a distant
apology to King Sihanouk, who is now in Beijing for a medical
check-up.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 23 people were killed
and more than 50 missing after an explosion wrecked a building in
a southern Russian republic early Saturday, news agencies said.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which took place at about 2:00 a.m. local time
(2300 GMT Friday) wrecked a nine-story building in Kaspiysk, a
town in the southern republic of Dagestan, housing Russian army
officers, boder guards and their families, ITAR-TASS news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The building housed 82 apartments, about 130 people.
</P>
<P>
Kaspiysk lies 12 kilometers from the Dagestani capital
Makhachkala.
</P>
<P>
ITAR-TASS quoted local officials as saying that 23 bodies had
been pulled from the debris by 10:00 a.m. local time (0700 GMT).
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situation
confirmed that 20 people were hospitalized, more than 50 were
missing and forty-six people were rescued from the debris.
</P>
<P>
High concentrations of TNT residues were found at the blast
site, which became a hindrance to the rescue efforts, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the explosion is under investigation.

<P>
Lenoid Golovyov, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in
Moscow, said officials believed that the explosion was caused by a

<HEADLINE> ASEAN All Set for Myanmar's Entry: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Ajit Singh said
today that Myanmar would have no difficulty in joining ASEAN as it
has met some of the basic "technical requirements" of the regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar would also have no problem participating in the ASEAN
Free Trade Agreement (AFTA), Ajit Singh, who concluded a week-long
mission to Myanmar recently, said at the second international
forum themed "Towards One Southeast Asia In The 21st Century" in
Subang Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
He said Myanmar already had transparency in its laws and
regulations and had also met the ASEAN low tariff requirements
apart from having English, an ASEAN language of communication,
widely spoken in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN secretary general said as far as transparency,
Myanmar's laws, rules and regulations including those pertaining
to taxes, tariffs, trade and finance are published in English and
are readily available.
</P>
<P>
On tariffs, he said Myanmar's tariff lines were well below the
ASEAN average and he expected very little problems in the country
achieving AFTA's goal of an average of five percent tariff by the
year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's average tariff rate is currently six percent compared
to ASEAN's average of seven percent, according to Ajit Singh.
</P>
<P>
Ajit Singh said it would also be quite easy for Myanmar to
adapt to AFTA as it is already a member of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Ajit Singh, who said he was impressed with the commitment from
Myanmar to transcend as an ASEAN member, would present a report on
his findings during his trip to Myanmar to the ASEAN foreign
ministers meeting in Manila on Wednesday, ahead of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' informal meeting.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's entry into ASEAN is expected to be discussed at the
ASEAN informal summit in Jakarta on November 30.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, which was granted ASEAN observer status last July, has
submitted its formal application for ASEAN membership to Malaysia,
which currently chairs ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia and Laos are expected to join the regional grouping
next year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Air Asia Launches Inaugural Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Air Asia, Malaysia's
second national carrier, today launched its inaugural chartered
flight to Pattaya, Thailand, at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport near here.
</P>
<P>
The airline, to be known commercially as Pacific Eagle, is
scheduled to start with three international destinations, with
scheduled chartered flights twice weekly from Kuala Lumpur to
Pattaya, Subic Bay in the Philippines, and Kaohsiung in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The airline uses a Boeing 737-300 aircraft for the Kuala
Lumpur-Pattaya route.
</P>
<P>
Launching the inaugural flight, Malaysian Transport Minister
Ling Liong Sik said Air Asia is expected to expand its operations
to Europe and the United States in the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
The airline, he said, would have gained enough experience and
expertise by then to penetrate into more challenging international
routes.
</P>
<P>
He said it was imperative for airline companies to look into
new and viable sectors of operations in view of the wide air
travel market and vast areas that could be exploited.
</P>
<P>
Airlines should plan ahead and capitalize on the increasing
passenger volume particularly in the Asia-Pacific region which
recorded an annual growth rate of 7.5 percent between 1995 and
2000 and is expected to grow by seven percent annually from 2001
to 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the airline could also tap the Asia-Pacific market
after obtaining landing rights from countries in that region.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Air Asia could operate chartered flights from
foreign countries to Malaysia to bring tourists to visit tourist
attractions in the country.

<HEADLINE> China, Sweden Sign Anti-doping Memorandum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Olympic Committee
(COC) and the Swedish Sports Confederation (SSC) on Saturday
signed a memorandum on joint efforts to combat doping in sports.
</P>
<P>
China has earlier signed such memorandum with Australia and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Convinced that international cooperation aimed at combating
doping in sport should derive from a spirit of mutual trust and
shared values between nations," the memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also said that the COC and the SSC should
"respect that both parties appraise the results achieved by each
other in anti-doping work and build on any successes."
</P>
<P>
The two nations' sports governing bodies have agreed on free
and continuous exchange of information on a range of anti-doping
subjects including:
</P>
<P>
1. Development of education programs;
</P>
<P>
2. The content of, and outputs from research projects;
</P>
<P>
3. The structure and approach adopted by participating states
to administer anti-doping policies and implement effective testing
programs.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum came into effect upon signature and will run for
a period of four years as long as neither side has indicated, by
means of six months written notification, its intention to
terminate it.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shaozu, COC president and Chinese sports minister, and SSC
president Arne Ljungqvist signed on the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China will have a better cooperation with Sweden
on the anti-doping efforts and Ljungqvist made the same promise.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese athletes competing in Sweden will receive doping
checks there, and the Swedish athletes competing in China will be
tested here," the Chinese sports minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Since there are more Chinese athletes competing in Sweden than
the Swedish athletes coming here, we have got a very good deal,"
Wu added.
</P>
<P>
The cost of one doping test in China is 1,000 yuan (120
U.S. dollars) and the same test in Sweden costs about 1,400 yuan
(170 dollars), according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Ljungqvist said he was impressed with the progress China has
made in the fight against doping.
</P>
<P>
"I said this because of what I have seen, not out of
politeness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ljungqvist, member of the International Olympic Committee as
well as member of IOC Medical Commission, criticized western
newspapers of leveling drugs accusation against Chinese athletes
including women distance runner Wang Junxia during the Atlanta
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"Only when you can prove drugs are in someone's body, or you
have a positive case, you can say he or she is using drugs," said
Ljungqvist, also vice president of the world athletics governing
body IAAF and chairman of the IAAF Medical Commission.
</P>
<P>
"What western newspapers had done (during the Atlanta Olympic
Games) was unfair," he added.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF vice president also told Xinhua that successful
staging of the world athletics championships by Athens will help
the city's bid for the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"The world championships can test the city's ability of
organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
IAAF president Primo Nebiolo has earlier made such warning,
threatening that Athens won't win the right for the 2004 Olympics
if its doesn't have a successful world championships for track and
field.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Share prices at the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) extended last week's gains on mild
buying by both local and foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the benchmark Composite Index (CI) was at its
highest position in two years and looks set to break the
1,200-point target soon.
</P>
<P>
The CI rose 12.56 points to end the week at 1,092.16.
</P>
<P>
The all main board share Emas Index closed at 340.05, up 2.20
points from last week while the Industrial Index rose 27.02 points
to 2,229.93 during the week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the country's sound economic growth coupled with
the winning streak on Wall Street pointed to a market rally.
</P>
<P>
On the note that concerns of the external account trade
imbalance eased when a trade surplus was reported for September
of 668.442 million ringgit (about 267.37 million US dollars)
against 604.5 million ringgit (about 241.8 million dollars) in
August, with expectation for a further surplus in October, dealers
said it was not surprising that foreign funds entered the market,
albeit in small amounts.
</P>
<P>
An analyst said some of the counters were overvalued and bound
to correct downwards and generally, the market would be buoyed
when key finance stocks are requoted sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
The weekly main board ready turnover dwindled to 558.261
million shares worth 3.6983 billion ringgit (about 1.479 billion
dollars) from 661.813 million shares valued at 4.4583 billion

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Crude palm oil
(CPO), tin and rubber markets closed the week mixed with CPO and
tin higher and rubber mixed.
</P>
<P>
The positive trend on CPO futures helped the CPO physical
market to finish steadier this week on huge demand especially.
</P>
<P>
Expectations of lower production as well as
higher-than-expected palm oil exports for November sparked buying
activities.
</P>
<P>
Player's reaction were neutral when private crop forecaster
Ivan Wong and Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority
(PORLA) released their crop figures on Thursday and Friday
respectively.
</P>
<P>
PORLA put end-October palm oil stocks at 953,241 tons, up from
894,438 tons at end-September. Output in October was 883,579 tons,
against 864,730 tons in September, and exports were 727,629 tons
versus September's 649,688 tons.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Wong's estimates of Malaysia's palm stock and output for
October at 965,000 tons and 880,000 tons respectively, which were
about the same level as the previous month.
</P>
<P>
November finished the week at 1,187.50 ringgit (about 475 US
dollars) a ton, against the previous week's close of 1,167.50
ringgit (about 467 dollars) a ton.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, backed by improved buying activities, the Kuala
Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) also closed slightly higher this week in
moderately active trading.
</P>
<P>
The metal ended 10 sen higher from the previous week's close at
14.80 ringgit (about 5.92 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The strong market was also in line with a firm performance of
the London Metal Exchange (LME) throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
A bullish LME provided strong encouragement for local traders
to load in fresh positions.
</P>
<P>
Weekly turnover stood at 329 tons, which was sharply lower than
that of the last week's 641 tons, with buyers mostly being
Japanese, European and locals.
</P>
<P>
However, the Malaysian rubber market, pressured by weak
participation by traders, closed mixed this week with prices
moving within narrow ranges.
</P>
<P>
December RSS One lost 2.50 sen from last week's close to settle
at 317.50 sen (about 127 US cents) per kg while SMR 20 finished
unchanged at 310.50 sen (about 124.2 US cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Given the underlying bearish market, there was continued lack
of demand, with prices expected to be maintain at the current
levels next week, dealers said.

<HEADLINE> City Beside Famous Mountain Focuses on Tourism Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Baishan city at the foot of
the Changbai Mountain is developing environment-friendly tourism
focused on the wide forests on the nearby mountain in northeast
China.
</P>
<P>
"Baishan city aims at becoming a national-level scenic and
tourist city," said Zhang Enxiang, secretary of the City Communist
Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
At the west foot of one of China's eight most famous mountains
and neighbor to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea across
the Yalu River, Baishan boasts rich tourism resources, comprising
not only natural scenery of lakes, forests, waterfalls, hot
springs, karst caves, canyons in the Changbai Mountain, but also
sites of historical interest, such as the Lingguang Pagoda built
in the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and the site where China's last
emperor abdicated the throne, in the city area.
</P>
<P>
Zhang listed three advantages Baishan city enjoys for
development of its tourism industry: two of the three major rivers
originating in the Changbai Mountain flow through the city; two of
the three paths for climbing the Changbai Mountain start from the
city; and two-thirds of the total area of the Changbai Mountains
National Natural Preservation Zone, which is part of the United
Nations' preservation zones network, are under the city's
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a tourism rim around the Changbai Mountains,
along the Yalu River and striding over the borderlines between
China and DPRK has been established, "laying a foundation

He said overseas investment is welcome for the development of
Baishan's tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> More Overseas Investment to Shanghai's Retail Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A survey shows that more and
more overseas businesses are coming to the east China metropolis
to set up chain stores.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the business area of overseas-funded chain
supermarkets grew at 150 percent each year, according to the
survey jointly conducted by Raine Horne &AMP; Uni-Trust and Shanghai
Uni-trust Property Trust &AMP; Consultants Ltd.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last August, there had been 40 overseas-funded
chain supermarkets in Shanghai with a business area close to
50,000 square meters. About 30,000 square meters were added during
the first eight months of this year, almost double that during the
same period of last year, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Yaohan from Japan was the first overseas company to launch
retail business in Shanghai. In co-operation with a local
company, Yaohan opened the city's first overseas-funded
supermarket - Bailian Supermarkets Guangling Store - back in May
of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture now operates more 21 chain stores in
Shanghai's various residential areas, with a total business area
of over 20,000 square meters. And Yaohan plans to set up 175 chain
supermarkets in the city by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Other leading goods distribution businesses such Carrefour of
France, and Park'n Shop of Hong Kong have also set up joint
ventures with local partners in Shanghai, and Wal-Mart of the US
and Ahold of the Netherlands are planning to set up outlets in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the majority of the overseas-funded
retail businesses are aimed at providing daily necessities for
local wage-earners.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of these overseas-funded chain stores has
introduced new ideas in management, marketing, arrangement of
goods, and service to the local retail business, said Chen Ming,
deputy general manager of Shanghai Uni-Trust, and is expected to
accelerate the development of the business.
</P>
<P>
It is reported there are at least 1,000 supermarkets in
Shanghai, the Hualian Supermarket Group, the biggest chain,
operates 100 stores across the city. A sample survey shows that 40
percent of the daily necessities purchased by local residents come
from supermarkets.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Chain Businesses Enter Rural Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Ask any people living in the
suburban areas around Dongguan city, Guangdong province, where
they get groceries and articles of everyday use, most of them will
probably reply: "In Meijia chain stores."
</P>
<P>
The Meijia (meaning beautiful and nice) chain established in
December of 1990 has focused on setting up businesses in rural
areas. Of the 40 Meijia stores already opened, 31 are in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the chain reported a sales volume of 136 million
yuan, in which 109 million, or 80 percent, came from the rural
market.
</P>
<P>
Its general manager, Zhang Li, said the chain is to open ten
more outlets, all in the suburban areas around Dongguan.
</P>
<P>
Meijia is a pioneer of the large amount of chain businesses
expanding their operations from downtown to suburban areas, from
cities to rural areas in this south China province.
</P>
<P>
Huarun Supermarket Co. Ltd. based in Shenzhen operates 26 out
of a total of 41 chain stores in villages and towns around the
city and across the Pearl River Delta area. And two chain
businesses based in Zhongshan and Zhaoqing cities have opened
seven and eleven stores respectively in rural Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of more chain stores in rural areas represents a
major trend for the development of the retail business in
Guangdong, said an official with the provincial chain business
association.

<HEADLINE> Preferential Treatment For Laid-off Workers In North China </HEADLINE>

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The restructuring of
China's economy has had some unfortunate consequences, leaving an
increasing number of people without jobs.
</P>
<P>
In Hebei Province, however, these people get help if they look
for a job on their own, with a series of preferential
policies, including tax exemptions and fee waivers when they
obtain a job on their own.
</P>
<P>
Some 110,000 people were laid off last year in the
province, which has, as a result, opened training courses for
these people, and provided lectures on practical skills and
management to help in re-employment.
</P>
<P>
Qianxi County has opened a trading market where the unemployed
are exempt from all taxes and fees and can get a booth to do
business rent-free.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 37,000 people have found jobs on their own,
accounting for 21.5 percent of all re-employed people.
</P>
<P>
In China's rigidly planned economy of the past, all its
citizens were provided with an "iron rice bowl", meaning lifetime

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. to Extend Military Mission in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
announced today that the United States has agreed in principle to
extend its military mission in Bosnia to consolidate the peace
gains achieved in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the new U.S. force in Bosnia would be about 8,500
troops, a part of the new international peacekeeping mission to
run through to mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to instruct the United States representative to
NATO to inform our allies that in principle, the United States
will take part in a follow-on force in Bosnia," Clinton told a
news conference at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the size will be about 8,500," he said. "There will
be an American commander and tough rules of engagement."
</P>
<P>
He said the total would be reviewed every six months and halved
by the end of 1997. "We will propose to our NATO allies that by
June of 1998, the mission's work should be done and the forces
should be able to withdraw," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, the new
NATO-led force in Bosnia will be around 30,000 troops from 30
countries, including NATO members. The size of the new force will
be half that of the present peace Implementation Force.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had kept 14,000 troops in Bosnia, and had now and
begun to withdraw them. But it is currently sending in about 7,500
troops to help protect the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Much of that cover force is already scheduled to remain until
March and will apparently become part of the new force.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia Needs One Vision to Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim today stressed the need for Southeast Asia
to have one vision to address the challenges of the future as the
region moves ahead to become a major political, economic,
cultural and moral force on the global stage.
</P>
<P>
As the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grows,
inequalities in regional development would occur but these
inequalities need to be corrected, he said at an international
forum in Subang Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia, he said, therefore needs a vision, not one
filled with platitudes but one that can address the challenges of
the future.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that ASEAN, which began with five members in 1967,
will have 10 members and a population of over 450 million by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN at present groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam. Cambodia and Laos are
expected to join the grouping next year while Myanmar has also
submitted its formal application for membership.
</P>
<P>
The regional grouping should not tolerate the existence of two
regions, one prosperous and developed centered around the older
members of ASEAN who had a head-start, and the other poor and
technologically handicapped made up of the new member states,
Anwar stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader pointed out that it would be an irony to
see ASEAN in the 21st century divided not ideologically, but
along socio- economic lines, saying "we cannot be oblivious to the
problem of underdevelopment of the other members."
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that ASEAN was cognizant of the fact that despite
their handicap, both Cambodia and Laos have expressed their
willingness and readiness to meet the obligation of ASEAN
membership which he termed as an enormous sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
He said the admission of Cambodia and Laos into ASEAN in July
next year would further enhance the international image and
standing of ASEAN as a whole and at the same time contribute to
consolidating regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the two countries, as members in ASEAN, would further
consolidate the peace to build a better future for the peoples of
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN countries should also endeavor to make the
integration of Cambodia and Laos into the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) to be as painless as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
Later, Anwar presented two reports of the Study Group on
Cambodia and Laos (SGCL) which was set up to help them prepare to
join ASEAN and AFTA next year -- "Dictate of Partnership,
Cambodia, Laos and ASEAN in One Southeast Asia" and "Towards A
Southeast Asian Community: A Human Agenda", to representatives of
the ASEAN governments.
</P>
<P>
The one-day conference was attended by about 150 participants.
Among those present were Laotian Deputy Prime Minister Bounnhang
Vorachit and ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit Singh.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Bangladeshi Opposition Activists Allegedly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has claimed that 900 cases have been
lodged against 10,000 leaders and activists of its youth front,
the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD), and 1,200 of them arrested
since the Awami League (AL) government came to power on June 23
this year.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech published here today, BNP Chairperson Begum
Khaleda Zia also alleged that over 100 JCD leaders and workers
were murdered in the past four and a half months.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda addressed JCD's 184-member newly-formed Central
Committee last night, demanding the government to release JCD boys
immediately and withdraw false cases against them.
</P>
<P>
Submitting a 10-point charter of demands to Speaker Humayun
Rashid Chowdhury last Sunday, the BNP lawmakers started their
indefinite abstention from the parliament until the demands are
met to protest against the ruling party's unfair treatment of the
opposition MPs.
</P>
<P>
"No fresh contacts were made from either side" Friday for a
dialogue to resolve the impasse, BNP Secretary General Abdul
Mannan Bhuiyan said, adding that "We have already made it clear to
them (AL) that a congenial atmosphere must be created first for
holding any sort of discussions."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the ruling AL has offered an unconditional dialogue to
solve the problem in the House. But the BNP reacted with a 3-point
precondition for the dialogue, which includes release of all its
detained leaders and workers, starting implementation of the
party's 10-point demand and creating a congenial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the BNP Steering Committee will meet this
morning, which is expected to decide its fresh strategy against
the government -- the street campaign.

<HEADLINE> Thai Army to Stay Neutral in Politics: Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- the Thai Army has turned down
requests from a number of provincial governors to use military
installations as balloting stations for Sunday's general election.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason, Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chestha
Thanajaro said that the Army wants to be completely neutral,
adding, "I simply want the elections to be fair and clean."
</P>
<P>
"Although the Army had never rejected such requests in the
past, political issues at this time are very sensitive," the local
press today quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the last six decades and more, there have been at least
17 military coups d'etat in the country, of which most were staged
by the Army.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, however, the military is trying to stay
neutral and steers away from politics. Politicians also often warn
military officers not to interfere in politics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Army chief said he had told all Army officers
and men to cast their votes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to an opinion survey conducted among 360 officers and
men in the Army Secretariat, 85 percent said they will vote, 12
percent are undecided, and only 3 percent will not exercise their
voting rights.
</P>
<P>
By law, the military should stay neutral in general elections
and cannot help any political party in its campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Flood Control Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Local governments were urged
to step up their work to renovate a large number of water-control
works damaged by floods this summer, according to the "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
This year's flood, which caused a record 220 billion yuan worth
of loss, damaged more than 130 large and medium sized reservoirs,
over 4,000 small ones and 20,000 km of levees, more than eight per
cent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the safety of China's cities and effective irrigation
system of its farmland next year, Chinese senior leaders urged the
the local governments to complete renovation of the damaged water
conservation projects before next year's flood season, which
usually begins in June in the south and in July in the north.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 reservoirs in the country have been reinforced
since last winter, but the work remains unfinished at quite a few
of them, including 39 major reservoirs listed by the Minister of
Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
The local governments were also called on to dredge river beds
and remove obstructions which have silted up within flood-storage
and diversion projects in a bid to ease the growing threat of
flooding caused by sediment in some of North China's rivers,
particularly the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
One major action to be taken by the central government in the
years to come will be the introduction of 100 high-powered ships
to dredge the country's major water ways.

PRAGUE, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Czechs went to polls today in
the nation's first Senate elections which began this afternoon and
will end Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The new 81-member Senate was provided for in the new
constitution of the Czech Republic which came into force in 1993
after the breakup of Czechoslovakia. But only now is the Senate
being elected after much political foot-dragging.
</P>
<P>
With opinion surveys indicating many Czechs are sceptical
about the need for the new upper house at all, President Vaclav
Havel called on citizens to vote in large numbers for the sake of
national stability.
</P>
<P>
But opinion polls suggest this time Czechs may not heed his
call for a high election turnout. A survey showed that only 57
percent planned to vote in the first round and 52 in the second
runoff on November 22 and 23.
</P>
<P>
However, politicians and pundits are eager to scrutinize the
results to see how well the Civic Democratic Party of Prime
Minister Vaclav Klaus and its two junior coalition partners do
following the loss of their lower house majority in June.
</P>
<P>
If they do well, Klaus may be tempted to provoke early lower
house elections in an attempt to regain the majority lost in a
surge in support for the opposition Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
But if the Social Democrats win the Senate race, Klaus might
be forced to resign.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Approves Zaire Multinational Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today approved of a multinational force to go to
eastern Zaire to enable the feeding of more than a million
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Under a unanimously adopted resolution, the Council designated
two main tasks for the force, which is estimated to have over
10,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
One of the tasks is to facilitate the immediate return of
humanitarian organizations and the effective delivery of
humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced
persons, refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The other is to facilitate the voluntary, orderly repatriation
of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the ill-fated Somalia mission, the Zaire force has no
mandate for disarming the the warring factions. It cannot use
force unless for humanitarian reasons. Its mission shall
terminate on 31 March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The council also stressed the need for all states to respect
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the states in the
region in accordance with their obligations under the Charter of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The force, which includes soldiers mainly from Canada, the
United States, Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, South
Africa and Senegal, will be commanded by Lt. General Maurice Baril
of Canada.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the council, the Chinese U.N. Envoy, Ambassador
Qin Huasun, expressed grave concern over the huge humanitarian
crisis caused by the escalation of violence in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary to to provide humanitarian
aid to the refugees in eastern Zaire and that out of respect for
the desire of African countries for a multinational force, China
voted for the resolution.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the force could only be used for humanitarian
purposes and that it must be put under the political leadership of
the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Aims at World's Top Tourist Attraction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China's capital Beijing has
unveiled plans to become one of the world's top tourist
attractions in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will take advantage of the city's 3,000 year
history as a major urban community, along with its rich cultural
legacy.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government wants the capital to take
full advantage of rich tourist resources and strengthen the city's
status as the top tourist attraction in China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, with 3,040 years of urban history and 800 years as the
country's capital city, has vowed to be listed among the world's
top cities for profound history and culture, and a modernized
international metropolis.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the city plans to boost its economy, maintain an
even more stable social order, and improve its infrastructure and
environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the new strategy, by the mid-21st century, Beijing
should serve as a world-wide tourist attraction, featuring the new
socialist images and its profound oriental flavor.
</P>
<P>
Local tourist administrators said that by the year 2000, the
city will play host to 2.4 million overseas tourists a year,
earning 2.5 billion US dollars worth of foreign currency, and
receive 93 million domestic visitors, earning 54.9 billion yuan
(about 6.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
And by 2010, Beijing is expected to play host to 152 million
domestic visitors and 3.23 million overseas tourists a year,
earning 4.12 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the city had only 2.07 million overseas tourists and
gained 2.2 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> New Progress Made in Ancient City's Opening Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The ancient capital of Xi'an in
northwest China's Shaanxi province is fast developing trade and
economic co-operation facilitated by improvement of infrastructure
and investment environment.
</P>
<P>
With the gap widening between eastern and western China in
economic development since the beginning of 1990s, the city
authorities set the strategy of building an economy closed related
to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
To make the city more attractive to overseas investment, Xi'an
has focused on improvement of its infrastructure in recent
years. Three high-grade highways have been built to link up the
city with Lintong county where the mausoleum of the first emperor
of the Qin Dynasty is located.
</P>
<P>
With the expansion of its railway station, both passenger and
cargo flows to the city have almost doubled. A new railway line
to connect Xi'an and the Eurasian Continental Bridge is under
construction. And the Xi'an-Xianyang International Airport now
operates 88 domestic and international air routes.
</P>
<P>
The city has also become the biggest telecommunications hub in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
City authorities have issued a series of policies and
supporting measures to encourage the inflow of overseas fund, and
set up special offices to deal with overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the city authorities' efforts, more than 1,500
overseas-funded businesses with capital from more than 40
countries and regions had been established by the end of last
month. Some 2.7 billion of the 40 billion US dollars invested in
these businesses came from overseas, 15 times the total amount
from 1984 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a joint venture with a Belgium
company, have ranked among the ten best joint ventures in the
country in terms of business performance for four consecutive
years. And transnationals such as Coca Cola, Shell, Siemens have
come to invest in the city's hi-tech zone.
</P>
<P>
At present, exports from local companies go to more than 100
countries and region.

<HEADLINE> Ancient City Sees Booming Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The commercial sector has
registered healthy growth in this ancient capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi province, local commercial sources reported.
</P>
<P>
The growth was attributed to the city authorities efforts
to reform the business mechanism of commercial enterprises and
build more goods distribution facilities.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an is one of the pilot cities for a comprehensive economic
reform package sponsored by the central authorities. In recent
years, nine large state-owned stores were reformed into joint
stock companies, which help expand their business scale and
enhance their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
For smaller businesses, a system called "owned by the state and
run by individuals" in which counters are leased to individual
business people has been introduced.
</P>
<P>
The reform has so far yielded good results. Six of the nine
joint stock companies have become big profit earners and tax
payers and three have been listed, while 90 percent of the smaller
businesses leased out have begun to make money or have reduced
losses.
</P>
<P>
The city has also focused on building of new goods distribution
facilities. Last year, some 170 million yuan was invested in
expanding or building 211 wholesale and retail outlets, 458
trading markets, which added 1.78 million square meters of
business area.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, the city's retail sales increased from seven
billion to 18 billion yuan with an annual growth of 20 percent,
accounting for 45 percent of the total for the five provincial
capitals in northwest China.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Goes on with Purchasing F-16 Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will go on with the
purchase of nine of the highly sophisticated F-16 jet aircraft
from the United States next year, a high-ranking military officer
said.
</P>
<P>
There was no longer any problem between the governments of the
two countries with regard to the purchase, Air Force Chief of
Staff Vice Marshal Sutria Bagus said Friday in Solo, Central Java,
reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
In September, Washington said it would review the sale of the
F-16s to Indonesia because of human rights issues in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, from the very beginning there has been no change in
the plan. A handful of US Congressmen have merely made some
unfavorable comments on the purchase suggesting their government
not to sell the jets to Indonesia," Sutria said.
</P>
<P>
He said the price of the F-16s was still being negotiated by
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said Indonesia chose F-16s because other
ASEAN member countries, such as Singapore and Thailand, also have
F-16s, and this would facilitate cooperation with these countries,
including in aircraft maintenance.

<HEADLINE> More Complains About Foreign Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Consumers complaints about
imported and locally made foreign products are increasing sharply
in China, according to today's "China's Daily".
</P>
<P>
Although they make up a very small proportion of total consumer
complaints, grievances about foreign products hit 1,894 in the
third quarter, an increase of 55.8 per cent over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Wang Peng, an official with the China
Consumers Association (CCA), as saying that "most of the
complaints came from big cities, and concerned electrical home
appliances including TV sets, stereo equipment, air-conditioners,
wrist-watches, cameras and some food products."
</P>
<P>
Many complaints focused on product quality, some consumers
complained about poor after-sales service, which sometimes takes a
long time and costs too much, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He said some consumers have also criticized foreign products
that failed to provide documentation in Chinese or did not live up
to manufacturers' claims.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, consumer associations handled 135,314
complaints, up 20.6 per cent from the same period last
year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Poor Areas In China Benefit From Tourism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Four million Chinese peasants
have escaped the poverty trap, by cashing in on China's tourism
boom.
</P>
<P>
The seeds of success were firmly planted late one night in 1986
for one farmer in Yeshanpo Village, in the country's Hebei
Province. He recalled reporting to his village-head that a group
of more than 40 people had arrived at his house asking for food
and lodging.
</P>
<P>
At first, the poor farmers in the remote mountain village were
suspicious about the visitors. Though the village is only about 70
km away from the center of capital Beijing, where tourism is well
established, the villagers had never seen a tourist in their lives.
</P>
<P>
With the tremendous changes that have taken place throughout
the country, including many remote and unsophisticated regions,
Yeshanpo has now become a prosperous tourism site.
</P>
<P>
Using local resources to develop tourism has helped local
people in many undeveloped areas to finally bid farewell to
poverty.
</P>
<P>
For many years, travelers in China had to first obtain approval
from local public security authorities before starting their
journeys. Those who moved about without official permits risked
bei0ng picked up by police or militiamen.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from State Tourism Administration,
nearly four million people in 10,000 poverty-stricken villages
have cast off poverty by developing tourism, based on local
resources.
</P>
<P>
A national conference on the impact of tourism on poverty
alleviation was recently convened in Zhangjiajie City, Hunan
Province. The city used to be poor, and is now an attractive
destination for many domestic and foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Sun Gang, Deputy Director of the administration, speaking at
the meeting, said that in recent years, the government has exerted
special efforts to develop tourism to help drive out poverty in
many regions.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have carried out large-scale
explorations of local resources, and constructed infrastructure in
the areas, realizing that developing tourism can bring fortunes to
the local people.
</P>
<P>
Lijiang Prefecture, in Southwest China's Yunnan Province,
opened up its tourism industry in 1992, and has since then
received one million domestic and overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Lijiang's tourism earnings amounted to 200 million
yuan, accounting for 13 percent of the prefecture's total
income, while 25 percent of the prefecture's revenue
came from taxes paid by the tourism sector.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Poor Areas In China Benefit From Tourism (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The poverty-stricken areas in China are mostly located in
mountain areas, and areas densely populated by ethnic minorities,
where primitive landscapes and traditional lifestyle are well
preserved. But in those areas the local economy has lagged behind,
according to officials with the administration.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to exploit local tourism resources in
these regions to accelerate economic development in central and
western parts of the country, and to help reduce economic gap
between the east and west.
</P>
<P>
Poor areas generated a big portion of the country's tourism
income, which stood at 210 billion yuan last year, the officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that, in recent years, many poor areas have
developed local industries by boosting their tourism sectors.
</P>
<P>
Zhuanghe city, in Northeast China's Liaoning Province, has
become a tourist spot since it adopted a strategy to bolster its
tourism industry. A number of Sino-overseas joint ventures, and
many rural households, have reaped the benefits and become
well-off by cashing on the tourist trail.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest gain for locals is probably the ideological
change," said government officials in Nanyue district of Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the annual average per capita income of local
farmers in this mountain area was less than 180 yuan per year, but
in recent years, the district has developed not only tourism, but
also industrial, agricultural and service industries.
</P>
<P>
At present, the annual average per capita income of local
farmers has climbed to 2,048 yuan, and the average per-capita
savings by local farmers exceeded over 3,500 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism has not only enriched us, but has also made us aware
of the outside world and has brought new ideas," said a young
farmer who has opened a handicraft store at the foot of the Nanyue
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
Due to the booming tourism, many overseas-founded firms have
entered poor areas to set up hotels, including some star-rated
hotels.
</P>
<P>
In Zhongwei County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, some 10,000
local residents are earning their livings from the tourism
industry, and so far, the city has built eight foreign-invested
companies with overseas capital of over 20 million yuan. It has
created employment for over 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile more than 200,000 farmers in Zhangjiajie city, Hunan
Province, have made a good fortune from the local tourism sector.
Last year, the tourism industry made up almost half of the city's
total production output value.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city has established economic relations with more
than 20 countries, and has set up 32 overseas-funded firms, with
an overseas investment of 52.7 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> French PM Stresses Aid for Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 15 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
today stressed that the developing countries must be able to count
on the aid of the international community in their efforts to
ensure food security for their people.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the World Food Summit in Rome, the prime minister
said that progress made by many developing countries in Africa and
elsewhere provided justification for persevering with this aid.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that food aid must also be adjusted. What was
needed was to boost local purchases, make the best use of funds
and preserve the temporary character of food aid.
</P>
<P>
He said that the situation of hundreds of millions of men and
women around the world suffering from starvation or malnutrition
called for renewed aid mobilization by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Juppe noted that the Plan of Action adopted at the World Food
Summit well expressed the joint commitment of the developing and
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
While aid made an important contribution to the developing
countries -- accounting for nearly 10 percent of the grain
imported by the poorest countries -- such aid could compete with
local production if it was not properly planned and managed.
</P>
<P>
Juppe also called on the developed countries to help the
developing ones to trade on the international agricultural
products market. This was an essential factor in security of
supply, he said.

<HEADLINE> Court Condemnation of Rap Group Raises Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A condemnation made Thursday by
a court in the southern French city of Toulon on a militant rap
music group for insulting police has caused a political storm in
France.
</P>
<P>
Two singers of the group, Nique Ta Mere (NTM), were condemned
by the Grand Investigation Court of Toulon to three months in jail
and six months of banning of performing in France for calling
police "fascists who assassinate" at a concert in the department
of Var on July 14, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The court decision, made in a city governed by a mayor of the
far right National Front (FN), was welcomed by some rightwing
groups and police unions, while raising condemnations from
leftwing parties, trade unions and artists groups, who regard it
as a violation of the freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
The judgement was made 48 hours before the holding of the first
round of municipal elections in Dreux, 80 kilometers west of
Paris, in which the FN candidate, Marie-France Stirbois, is posed
to win.
</P>
<P>
The two singers condemned by the court, Kool Shen and Didier
Morville, are now staying in the United States and Britain and
have made an appeal to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
The court decision will be reexamined by an appeal court in the
department of Aix-en-Provence before it can go into force.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party accused the court of adopting a "double
measure" when applying the law, saying that the president of FN,
Jean-Marie Le Pen, had never been punished for publicly spreading
the ideas of racism.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Francois Mancel, general secretary of the ruling
Rassemblement pour la Republique, also described the sentence as
"uncontestedly very severe," but warned against generalization
of this individual case.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that the rap group NTM is one of
several radical rappers in France who imitate the style of black,
and usually anti-establishment, gangster rap groups in the U.S.
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
The NTM"came out of the department of Seine Saint-Denis near
Paris with the first wave of French rap groups in the late 1980s,
and belongs to the "hardcore" of this genre of music groups.
</P>
<P>
The court decision was welcomed by Francois Leotard, president
of another party of the ruling coalition, the Union pour la
Democratie Francaise, who described the sentence as "an excellent
decision which will allow the punishment of those appeals for
hatred and violence."
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture Philippe Douste-Blazy said that the freedom
of expression must be protected, but expressed his opposition to
any agitation of hatred and violence through the form of music
performances.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Jacques Toubon said that he respected the
decision by the court of Toulon.

<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- England's Aston Villa
goalkeeper Mark Bosnich has been fined 1,000 pounds (about 1,600
U.S. dollars) by the Football Associaltion (FA) following his
Nazi-style salute to soccer fans during a match at Tottenham.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Australian was found guilty of misconduct by a
three-man FA commission at a hearing held earlier Friday in London.
</P>
<P>
Bosnich was also severely censured and warned about his future
conduct, but escaped a suspension over the incident.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double said that it has been an "act of
stupudity", but Bosnich had not intended to to cause offence,
adding that he was unware of Tottenham's Jewish following.
</P>
<P>
Bosnich described the FA decision as a victory of common sense,
saying "I hope to put this incident behind me and go forward with
my career. It's time to put this behind."
</P>
<P>
"There are far more important things going on than this case
and to be honest," he added. "I'm sick of hearing my own voice."
</P>
<P>
The Aston Villa soccer star is stil waiting to hear if he will
face court action over the incident.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Leader Assesses Paris Conference Positively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian presidency Serb
member Momcilo Krajisnik today assessed favorably the Paris
conference held Thursday to consolidate the peace process in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik told reporters in the Serb administrative center of
Pale that the conference summarized the results of a year-long
implementation of the Dayton peace accords and created the basis
for its further elaboration.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference also pinpointed problems of the
constitution of a ministerial council, return of refugees and
displaced persons, cooperation with the Hague war crimes tribunal
and prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton agreement, reached one year ago to end the bloody
civil war in Bosnia, has been implemented successfully in the
military respect. It has encountered many difficulties in terms of
civilian matters, such as return of refugees, reconstruction and
establishment of joint institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb delegation backed the international
community's option, Krajisnik said, adding the Serbs would insist
on a consistent implementation of the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton accords, Bosnia remains to be a one country
with two equal entities -- Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat
federation.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the three members of the Bosnian presidency, the
one-day conference in Paris was attended by foreign ministers of
17 countries and representatives of some key international
organizations.

<HEADLINE> No White Water Kayaking at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 15 (Xinhua) -- White water kayaking will
not be included in the Sydney 2000 Olympic programme after the
International Olympic Committee upheld an official request by
games organizers, it was announced in Cancun, Mexico on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Olympic officials (SOCOG) had hoped to avoid the 15
million dollar cost of constructing white-water facilities.
</P>
<P>
The association of national Olympic committees (ACNO) ratified
the decision during their annual general meeting.
</P>
<P>
Officials also decided to restrict the number of participants
in the 2000 games to 10,200.
</P>
<P>
That will cover the 28 sports programmed, including new
additions tri-athalon and Tae-kwon-do.
</P>
<P>
Softball and beach volleyball, which were introduced at this
year's Atlanta games, will be maintained for the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no further reduction of sports from Atlanta,"
said IOC director- general Francois Carrard.
</P>
<P>
"The IOC is yet to decide the balance between men and women's
events, but the tendency is to increase the number of women's
events," added Carrard.
</P>
<P>
Women made up a total 37 percent of athletes at the Atlanta
Olympic games.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Departs on Asia-Pacific Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
left today for a brief vacation in Hawaii before his Asia-Pacific
trip to Australia, the Philippines and Thailand, aimed at
promoting U.S. economic ties with states on the Pacific rim.
</P>
<P>
When he is in the Philippines, Clinton will attend the fourth
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum at which he is expected to
meet with leaders of China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The first leg of his 12-day trip is Australia where he is
scheduled to arrive Monday.
</P>
<P>
Australia is seen as an anchor ally of the United States in the
Pacific and Clinton will use the opportunity to address a joint
session of parliament in Canberra, to enhance the progress the two
countries have already made in building the Asian Pacific
community, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
But the centerpiece of his trip will be to attend the APEC
summit, which will begin on November 24.
</P>
<P>
Before the summit conference, Clinton will hold talks with
China's President Jiang Zemin. It will be the fourth meeting
between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will cover a broad range of strategic issues on
bilateral relations, the U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past year, we've turned a corner in the relationship
and dealt successfully with some very difficult issues.... That
progress demonstrates that we can work together and work through
our differences as great powers must," said Samuel Berger, the
deputy national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will discuss with Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto on the U.S. military presence on Okinawa and "ways to
modernize the relationship between the two militaries when they
meet in Manila.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Kim Young-sam, the president of South Korea,
Clinton will discuss prospects for his proposed four-party talks
including the two countries on the Korean Peninsula, and China and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
After the Manila APEC meeting, Clinton completes his trip with
a stop in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will be the first American president to visit Thailand
since President Richard Nixon visited there, and his visit
reflects the importance the United States is attaching to as it
has emerged as a key strategic ally for its facilitating U.S.
aircraft and ship visits and for its magnet for U.S trade and
investment, the U.S. officials said.

<HEADLINE> Johansson Can Hardly Become World Soccer Chief, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Reports that UEFA president
Lennart Johansson made racist remarks while on a visit to South
Africa will hardly help him become head of world soccer ruling
body FIFA, a soccer official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although the Swede said Friday he couldn't recall making
comments about "blackies", some sources say he shouldn't even have
his current job.
</P>
<P>
"If these comments are accurate, then Johansson has got serious
problems," Gordon Taylor, chief executive of England's
Professional Footballers Association was reported as saying in the
tabloid Daily Mirror Friday.
</P>
<P>
"If he really holds those views, there can be no part in
football administration for him. I cannot believe the president of
UEFA would say such things," said Taylor, who has many black
players among his membership.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported Johansson's comments
in an interview which followed the South African visit.
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived in South Africa, the whole room was full with
blackies and it gets damned dark when they're sitting together,"
Aftonbladet quoted Johansson as saying. "If they also are angry,
then it's not so damned cheery."
</P>
<P>
When confronted with the comments, Johansson, currently
vacationing in Bairsbronn, Germany, apologized but said he
couldn't believe he made the comments.
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember that I used the word `blackie' but on the
other hand I can't exclude that I did," Johansson told Afonbladet
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I beg everybody's forgiveness. I am not a racist. I am sorry,
my wife is sorry ... this is a business I got myself into and so I
must bear it."

<HEADLINE> European Shares Up Sharply, Boosted by US Economic Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets
rose strongly today, with Frankfurt and Paris ending at record
closing levels, boosted by new U.S. economic data showing a U.S.
interest rate rise is less likely.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index ended the session 32.1 points higher at
3,958.2, which were close to the week's highest levels and also a
rise of 47.4 points from last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market today was no longer affected by recent
domestic interest rate worries and was cheered by Wall Street's
continuing bullish run as well as by sharply higher government
bonds.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt were 18.79 points up at the close at
2,795.80, a new record close and 55.97 points higher on last week.
</P>
<P>
Trading was quite heavy in major German banks, such as
Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerzbank due to takeover and merger
rumors.
</P>
<P>
The Paris market had hit a trading high of 2,250.29 earlier in
the day before ending at a new closing high, 22.15 points up on
the day and 35.13 points higher on last week at 2,240.33 on the

during the afternoon.

<HEADLINE> US to Build Air Bridge for Relief Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States is going
to build an "air bridge" between Europe and Central Africa by
sending a wide array of transport aircraft to several bases in
Europe to undertake the relief mission for the refugees in eastern
Zaire, military officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force transports include C-141s, C-17s, C5s and KC-10s,
which are cargo and long-haul aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Some special operations soldiers have left Fort Bragg, North
Carolina, for bases in Germany and Italy. They will set up
distribution plans and are not part of a larger troops deployment,
one military officer said.
</P>
<P>
Special operations soldiers are organized as teams with special
language training to work with local populations or provide
security and communications to help place troops at airports on
special missions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reaffirms Commitment to Zaire Relief Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today reaffirmed that the United States will commit its troops in
the humanitarian intervention in eastern Zaire despite encouraging
signs Rwandan refugees have begun heading home.
</P>
<P>
"The mission Canada proposes to lead, and that I believe
America should take part in, would provide security for civilian
relief agencies to deliver the aid these people must have and to
help the refugees who so desire to return home to Rwanda," Clinton
told reporters at a White House news conference.
</P>
<P>
"The world's most powerful nation must not turn its back on so
many desperate people and so many innocent children," he added.
</P>
<P>
It took a very long time before the Clinton administration
agreed in principle and "in limited fashion" to dispatch around
4,000-5,000 troops to the central Africa country, where more than
1 million refugees living in U.N. camps are languishing without
food and water because of fighting among warring ethnic factions.
</P>
<P>
Before dispatching troops, the Clinton administration set
several strict conditions for the American troops to take the
relief mission including the duration and the scope of the
mission.
</P>
<P>
They will neither disarm ethnic combatants nor separate them
from the refugees.
</P>
<P>
And they demand an informal cease-fire among the warring
factions and an acquiescence of these factions before they
consider entering the ravaged area.
</P>
<P>
It was because the Clinton administration feared a repetition
of disasters in Somali peacekeeping operations when 18 american
soldiers were killed in a fire fight with one of the local warlord
groups in the capital of Mogadishu in 1993.
</P>
<P>
And now there are reports of a sudden mass movement of Rwandan
refugees toward home, which raised questions of whether this might
eliminate the need for an international relief mission. But
Clinton said it would be premature to draw any such conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to be prepared for the prospect that we will
still have to have some presence there to facilitate this (relief
operation) and to make sure as quickly as possible to get
everything that is needed to them," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia, Croatia Introduce Customary Visa Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The customary visa regime in
passenger travel was introduced today between Yugoslavia and
Croatia, officials of the two countries announced.
</P>
<P>
After their meeting, Yugoslav Interior Minister Vukasin
Jokanovic and his Croatian counterpart, Ivan Jarnjak, told
reporters in Belgrade that they had agreed on cooperation between
their police forces and measures to ease the flow of people,
vehicles and goods across the mutual border.
</P>
<P>
Other administrative barriers regarding the crossing of state
borders had also been removed, Jokanovic said, adding the
normalization of relations between the two countries had created
conditions for such cooperation between these two ministries.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Croatia, the two major powers in the Balkan
region, normalized their relations in August of this year after
five years of hostility since Croatia gained independence from the
former Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to Jokanovic, the talks underscored the need for
introducing passenger travel without visas, which would depend on
the development of the overall relations between Yugoslavia and
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Agreement had been reached on the need for cooperation in the
struggle against international terrorism and crime because no
single country can act by itself in this sphere, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that cooperation in this field would certainly
contribute to the overall development of the two neighbors' mutual
relations.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Interior Minister Jarnjak told reporters that Croatia
wished to continue the cooperation between the two ministries
under the framework of the Yugoslav-Croat agreement on the
normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The overall security situation in both countries and the
struggle against terrorism, drug smuggling and international
organized crime had been discussed and cooperation agreements in
these spheres would be signed by December 15 during Jokanovic's
scheduled visit to Zagreb, Jarnjak said.

</P>
<P>
In the middle of 1996, the world population stood at 5.77

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Italian Premiers Talk on Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi today pledged to encourage
more enterprises in the two countries to enter into cooperation in
a way to strengthen bilateral economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
They made the pledge during talks held here this evening.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Li said China attaches great importance to
economic and trade cooperation with Italy, which has remained
China's second largest trade partner among European Union
countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction over the development of economic
and trade ties between the two countries, which are marked by
a continued increase in the bilateral trade volume and remarkable
growth of Italy's envestment in China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said his government encourages Italian enterprises,
especially small and medium-sized ones, to invest in China and
also welcomes Chinese enterprises to invest in Italy.
</P>
<P>
He said some Italian enterprises are familiar with the Chinese
market and they have had good cooperation projects in China.
</P>
<P>
He said there exists great potential for enlarging areas of
cooperation, especially in the field of aerospace, as Italian
enterprises have showed a strong interest in investment in China.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Li Peng said the cloth-making and leather
industries are highly developed in Italy, their products sell well
in China and therefore more Italian entrepreneurs are welcome to
invest in China.
</P>
<P>
He said new ways of cooperation should be explored between
enterprises of the two countries to complement each other and
gain common development, which he said is more important.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Sino-Italian mixed economic
and trade commission will endeavor to accelerate the cooperation
between the two countries so as to maintain the momentum of
sustained development of such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed Prodi of the economic development in China.
</P>
<P>
The Italian prime minister expressed his admiration over the
success gained in the economic construction in China, saying
that it has provided a good opportunity for the development of
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng arrived here this morning to attend the on-going
World Food Summit and pay a visit to Italy.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China and Italy today said they
share the view that they have had no problems to be tackled
between them and they have every reason to develop a cooperative
relationship of mutual benefit on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
This view was expressed by Chinese Premier Li Peng and Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi in their talks here today. Li Peng
is here attending the World Food Summit and visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
Li said China gives much heed to developing its friendly and
cooperative relations with Italy. Italy, as a member of the
European Union, has been playing an increasingly important role
in European and international affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
China and Italy have shared or have similar views on quite a
few international issues. In the present international
situation featured by complexity and changes, the development of
a "long-term, friendly and cooperative bilateral relationship"
towards the 21st century conforms to the interests of the two
peoples, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the maintenance of frequent contacts between leaders of
the two countries to exchange views would be of important
significance to the smooth development of bilateral relations and
to the strengthening of coordination and cooperation in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Prodi spoke highly of Li Peng's address to the World Food
Summit this afternoon. "Your speech is indeed very convincing," he
said. "China has based on its own resources to feed its 1.2
billion people through self-reliance. This is an outstanding
achievement and constitutes an important contribution to the food
security of the whole world."
</P>
<P>
Prodi also shared Li Peng's view on strengthening bilateral
relations. He thanked Li's invitation to visit China at his
convenient time.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Wants No More IMF, WB Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will not take loans from
either the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank in its
economic recovery drive, a Nigerian official said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Aluko, the Chairman of the National Economic
Intelligence Committee (NEIC) of Nigeria, was quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria as saying that the committee is able to work
out alternative solutions to the economic recovery of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Borrowing from any of the international financial organizations
would not result in rapid economic recovery, rather, it would worsen
the living standard of the people, he said in Ado-Ekiti,
capital of the newly created Ekiti State in southern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the decision is connected with the alleged
failure of the Structure Adjustment Program sponsored in Nigeria
by the IMF, and maybe also with the mounting pressure of its foreign
debt, which is expected to hit 38 billion US Dollars by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also claimed that the committee has identified areas
of wastage of financial resources in the country's public institutions
and has devised means to control it.
</P>
<P>
He blamed corruption, the lack of maintenance as factors
responsible for the economic woes of the country. enditem
