<HEADLINE> Amman-Tel Aviv Flights Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Royal Wings, Jordan's airliner for
short-haul flights, launched its inaugural flight to Israel today.
</P>
<P>
It was the first flight by commercial airliners between the
two countries since the founding of the Jewish State.
</P>
<P>
The plane carried a high-level Jordanian delegation led by
Prince Faisal Ben Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The flights would cut down several hours from the cumbersome
overland crossings in the north and south of the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Royal Wings will use its 50-seat plane for the 35-minute
flights which will take off from Marka Airport in Amman at 6:05
p.m. on Friday, Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The return flight will be on the same day. It is scheduled to
take off from Tel Aviv at 7:15 p.m. and land at Queen Alia
International Airport(QAIA) 35 kilometers south of Amman.
</P>
<P>
The flights will bear the numbers of Royal Jordanian (RJ), the
national carrier, since RJ will be the contractor for managing
the flights for Royal Wings," according to a senior RJ official.
</P>
<P>
The Arkia airliner, Royal Wings' Israeli counterpart, will
begin five weekly flights to and from Jordan on April 28. The
airliner will bear the numbers of the Israeli national airliner
El Al.
</P>
<P>
RJ and El Al will offer ground services to Royal Wings and
Arkia in Amman and Tel Aviv on a reciprocal basis.
</P>
<P>
Opening of air routes between Jordan and Israel is part of a
transport and civil aviation agreement signed by the two
countries in line with the peace treaty they inked in October
1994.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also offers overflight rights for the airlines
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Royal Jordanian flights use Israel airspace, but El Al is
not using Jordanian airspace because it has not reached
agreements with the Gulf countries on using their airspace for
its flights to Asia and the Far East.

</P>
<P>
The same sources said discussion will revolve around the
promotion of economic cooperation and development in the Balkans,
Greek-Turkish relations, the Cyprus problem, Greek-U.S. economic
cooperation and the role of the Greek-American community.

<HEADLINE> Boueiz Says Lebanese Trapped in Liberia Are Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said today that some 1,500 Lebanese, who were trapped in a
new eruption of fighting in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, were
in safety.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference in Beirut that he had asked
Washington to help evacuate these Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Lebanese Embassy in Monrovia had been
blockaded and fighting was continuing just 300 meters away from
the embassy premises.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz added that some 100 Lebanese had fled to the embassy to
seek refugee.
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia, thousands of people fled their homes as fighting
raged between government troops and rebels today.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, the worst in this Western African country in more
than three years, first erupted Saturday morning to arrest warlord
Roosevelt Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said fighting was continuing in downtown
Monrovia and the airport has been closed.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has an estimated 50,000-strong community in
Liberia. Boueiz said Lebanon has asked the United States to help
evacuate the Lebanese community in Lebanon if Washington sends
ships to this Western African country.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also announced that he had contacts
with Nigeria, which has a contingent in the international
peacekeeping forces in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz noted that the commander of the Nigerian contingent had
informed him that steps would be taken in several hours to
redeploy the peacekeeping forces to every corner in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
And the commander underlined that the multinational
peacekeeping forces would manage to get in control of the
situation in the Liberian capital in 48 hours, the Lebanese
foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian commander promised to send troops to safeguard
the Lebanese Embassy in Monrovia, and he also promised to take
measures to secure the Lebanese interests in that country, Boueiz
said.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in the Beirut Foreign Ministry quoted
earlier information from Monrovia as reporting that the Lebanese
in the Liberian capital had fled their houses and most of them had
sought refugee in the Lebanese Embassy.

<HEADLINE> AL Regrets Perry's Implicit Threat to Use Force against Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) today expressed
regret over U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's remarks
insinuating a threat to use force against Libya.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that Libya was building a large underground plant
designated for producing chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based AL said that Perry's remarks came at an
inappropriate time, when intensive international peacemaking
efforts are being made in the Middle East region, Egypt's
state-run Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Egypt Wednesday, Perry said that the United
States would not allow Libya to complete a large underground plant
to produce chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the U.S. government is considering using force to
stop the alleged project, Perry said he "wouldn't rule anything
out or anything in."
</P>
<P>
Libya has repeatedly said that it has no intention to produce
chemical weapons and denied the existence of any chemical weapon
program in the country, the AL said.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member AL also said that the Libyan stand conforms with
the league resolutions on scrapping all weapons of mass
destruction from the Middle East to realize peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, who arrived in Cairo Saturday
on a three-day visit to Egypt, said today that he did not have
any information on whether Libya has a program for producing
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said that he had
asked Perry to present pictures and reports to verify his
information about the project.
</P>
<P>
Taking any decision in this connection necessitates a lot of
information, he said.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Qatar Eager to Solve Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Qatar agreed
today to hasten work on the demarcation of their joint border and
resume activities of a joint technical committee within two weeks,
Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Saudi Foreign Ministry statement said
that the committee will choose an international surveillance
company and set technical standards to survey the land and specify
the border points between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement, carried by the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), was
made during a visit to the Saudi capital by Qatari Foreign Minister
Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute between the two countries got worst in 1992
when crossfire on the border killed two people.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had mediated an agreement in
which the two countries gave themselves one year to settle the
dispute. But the goal had not been reached when the deadline
passed.
</P>
<P>
Last July, the new Qatari emir, who deposed his father in a
bloodless coup on June 26, 1995, had said he was hopeful of
solving the border dispute.

<HEADLINE> Makwetu Denies Leadership Crisis In PAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 7 (Xinhua)-- Pan Africanist Congress (PAC)
President Clarence Makwetu had denied rumors of a leadership
crisis in the organization, the South African Press Association
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a briefing at the PAC national
conference in Bloemfontein, Makwetu said he was prepared to step
down as a leader if his supporters felt he was no longer fit for
the role.
</P>
<P>
The PAC held its Fifth National Conference in Bloemfontein
during the Easter weekend.
</P>
<P>
However, closing the conference early today, Makwetu said
anxiety about the future of the PAC was legitimate, saying he was
not sure if the party was ready for the 1999 general elections.
</P>
<P>
The party had to upgrade existing branches and build new ones
in order to remedy this anxiety, he said.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu added that a national convention would be held not
later than June this year, during which clear policies on all
issues would have to be developed.
</P>
<P>
Opening the conference on Friday, Makwetu called on party
members to ''pull up their socks'', saying the leadership alone
could not be held responsible for the party's problems.
</P>
<P>
''If there is a leak in the boat, no matter how good the
captain is, the boat is sure to sink,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
About 300 delegates from all over the country attended the
three-day conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,000 people here took
to the streets today to mark the World Health Day.
</P>
<P>
The walkers were drawn from among Ethiopian governmental
organizations, women's associations, and the office of the World
Health Organization (WHO), including WHO representative here
Widson Mwabazi.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Adem Ibrahim, Ethiopian Health
Minister, said that it was decided that this year's World Health
Day be observed under the theme "Healthy Cities for Better Life",
adding that the major causes for health problems particularly in
developing countries are a lack of sanitation, malnutrition and
shortage of potable water supply.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, environmental health problems contribute
to the occurrence of 80 percent of the communicable diseases in
the cities.
</P>
<P>
It said unplanned establishment and development of the towns
and uncontrolled waste disposal systems as well as the absence of
sufficient water, food, shelter and basic social service
facilities in developing countries are becoming issues of
concern.

<HEADLINE> US-Greece Summit Meeting to Discuss Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Prime Minister Costas
Simitis will raise the Cyprus problem during his talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton at the White House on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Greek government spokesman Demetris
Reppas in a statement Saturday to the Cyprus' Greek daily
Simerini, which was published here today.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton-Simitis meeting will take place ten days after
President Clinton had talks in Washington with Turkey's President
Suleiman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Washington has repeatedly urged Greece and Turkey, both NATO
allies, to show restraint and solve their differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Reppas told the Cypriot paper that Premier Simitis would
underline to President Clinton that it is up to Turkey to respect
the U.N. Charter and international law, as far as its relations
with Cyprus and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem is on top of the agenda of Greece's
national issues, Reppas said, adding that Athens was seeking to
find a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"Such a solution will be to the benefit of Greco-Turkish
relations, something that Turkey should recognize," the spokesman
remarked.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
take control of one third of the island's territory following a
coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Israel Arrests Iran-Trained Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli General Security
Service (GSS) has arrested a Palestinian, who had received
military training in Iran on behalf of the Islamic Jihad, Israel
Radio reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Khalel Suleiman, 24, a resident of
the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, was arrested on
March 12, when he returned to Israel from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Senior GSS officials told Israel Radio that Suleiman was
intending to carry out violent operations against targets in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The report said Suleiman was studying medicine in Turkey when
he was approached by Islamic Jihad representatives there, and then
it was suggested that he would undergo military training in Iran.
</P>
<P>
He was flown to Iran on forged documents with the help of an
Iranian Embassy employee in Turkey, and was trained in a camp in
Iran alongside other people from the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The report said that investigation of this case is still under
way.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres revealed today
that Belgium authorities uncovered large quantities of explosive
materials on board an Iranian ship in the port of Antwerp several
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Labor Party delegates this afternoon, Peres said
that it was believed that the shipment was designed to be used
for attacks against Jewish targets.
</P>
<P>
Israel, as well as the Palestinian National Authority, had
accused Iran of being behind a series of suicide bombing attacks
in late February and early March, which killed some 60 people and
wounded over 150 others.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran denied all the charges.

BEIRUT, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has asked help of the
United States to evacuate more than 1,000 Lebanese trapped in
Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, well-informed sources in the
Lebanese Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources reported that the Lebanese in the Liberian capital
had left their houses, and most of them had sought sanctuary in
the Lebanese Embassy which had been blockaded.

<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz carried out, in the past
hours, intensive contacts with Counselor Mansour Abdullah in the
Lebanese Embassy in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz also asked, through the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, the

from Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister also conducted contacts with the
Nigerian authorities, which have peacekeeping forces in Liberia,
and asked them to interfere to secure the safety of the Lebanese
in the blockaded embassy.
</P>
<P>
No immediate information on the situation in the Liberian
capital was available, due to the lack of contacts from the
outside.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Accredits New Envoy To US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has accredited Alhaji
Hassan Adamu, President of the Manufacturers Association of
Nigeria, as Ambassador-Designate to the Unitbed States, a move
which is seen by observers here as a sign of partial thaw of the
frosty relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Foreign Ministry has confirmed that Alhaji Adamu,
a non-career ambassador, has been accepted by the United States,
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Adamu is to replace Alhaji Ahmed Kazaure, who has been
reposted to China as Ambassador-Designate, they said.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Nigeria and the US became sour last
November after the killing of Ken Saro Wiwa and eight other Ogoni
activists. After that, the US, along with other western
countries, recalled its ambassador to Nigeria and has since
imposed sanctions on the West African country.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the sanctions, Nigeria cherishes very much the
relationship between Nigeria and the United States and we cannot
underestimate the powers, strength and influence of the United
States in world affairs," Nigerian Foreign Minister Chief Tom
Ikimi said during a recent meeting with US Ambassador Walter
Carrington after his return from Washington.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on a new ambassador to the US, according to
observers, is a major indication that both countries appreciate
the need for diplomatic relations under the present
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
To improve relations with the western world, Nigeria has
changed ambassadors in Germany, France and Britain. Last week,
Nigeria appointed another businessman Alhaji Shehu Malami as High
Commissioner to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Together with Malami's appointment, yesterday's accreditation
of Adamu appeared to show a trend whereby influential businessmen
are being posted to high-brow diplomatic centers.
</P>
<P>
This was interpreted last night as an indication of the
government's new policy thrust of reviving economic diplomacy
which might blunt the sharp edge of the sanctions imposed on the
country in the wake of the Ogoni executions. enditem

superiority in the event by clocking 24.93 seconds for the title

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Condemns Armed Fundamentalist Attack on Newspaper Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today condemned
Saturday's attack by five persons against the English-language
Daily Arab Times, the Kuwait News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
During its weekly session, the Kuwaiti cabinet was briefed by
Interior Minister Sheikh Ali al-Sabah al-Salem on details of the
attack which was carried out by five Moslem fundamentalists, one
armed with a pistol. The five stormed into the building of Arab
Times and threatened the staff inside.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ali gave names and nationalities of the attackers to
the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet called for respecting the country's laws and urged
the interior minister to continue investigation in the attack.
</P>
<P>
An Interior Ministry statement said that one of the staff at
the Arab Times managed to overpower one of the attackers, while
the rest fled.
</P>
<P>
The four others, who were later arrested by police after a car
chase, were referred to the relevant authorities for interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The five fundamentalists Saturday stormed the building of the
newspaper to protest the publication of a "Hagar the Horrible"
cartoon which they believed was sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper ran an apology Thursday, 11 days later. The
newspaper said the "inclusion of the cartoon was inappropriate but
unintentional and done without malice."

<HEADLINE> Irish Republicans Commemorate 1916 Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Irish republicans today marched to
commemorate a 1916 uprising against British rule, which led to an
independent Irish republic, and accused Britain of crippling the
Northern Ireland peace process, according to reports from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Marching behind bands and republican flags, demonstrators
paraded on both sides of the Irish border, with Belfast and
Londonderry giving the biggest displays.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally in Londonderry, Gerry Adams, leader of the
political wing Sinn Fein of the Irish Republican Army, demanded an
unconditional seat at the Anglo-Irish sponsored all-party peace
talks on the future of Northern Ireland scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
He said that British Prime Minister John Major had "subverted
and frustrated the widespread desire in Ireland and Britain for
the peace process to be consolidated" by not admitting Sinn Fein
to talks.
</P>
<P>
"We know that real negotiations, real dialogue will mean change
and we know they (the British) are against change," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was also critical of Dublin's handling of the process for
all-party talks, accusing Irish Prime Minister John Bruton of
allowing his British counterpart, John Major, to set an agenda
favoring the Protestant majority who want to remain British.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Bruton has not so far risen to the challenge presented by
British duplicity and bad faith," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba today called on the local business community to find
a way to check the rising imbalance of the country's foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an annual general meeting of the Nepal Chamber of
Commerce, Deuba said that the increasing trade deficit in the
country had become a matter of great concern of the government as
imports grew more rapidly than exports in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nepalese businessmen should increase their exports
to the international market, identify new exportable items to
replace traditional goods and search for new markets for local
products.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called on the Nepal Chamber of Commerce to
conduct a study on which goods could be exported for maximum
benefits and provide guidelines to local entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Nepal saw a trade deficit of 866 million US dollars last year,
about 44 percent over the previous year, according to a
government-released economic survey for the 1994-95 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
While Nepal's total exports declined 7.7 percent last year, its
imports increased 25 percent during the same period, the survey
said.

HONG KONG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Hong Kong residents
who have undergone HIV tests may have to repeat the procedure if
the Department of Health finds a faulty test kit has been used,
according to a report in today's "Sunday Morning Post".
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Department of Health was quoted as saying
that test kits made by the company which produced the faulty kit
-- Abbot Laboratories in the United States -- had been used.
</P>
<P>
But so far no staff were available to say whether the kit found
to produce "false negative" results was among them, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman would not rule out re-testing of patients if the
kit was found to have been used, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross Transfusion Service chief of service Dr. Lin Che-kit
said the test had not been used in blood donations.
</P>
<P>
Abbot withdrew its "Imx HIV1/HIV2 3rd Generation plus" kit
after reporting that a small number of people whose blood had been
declared HIV-negative later turned out to be HIV-positive.

<HEADLINE> New Faces Make Splash in Chines Olympic Trials  By Sportswriter Yan Xiaoxian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, North China, April 7 (Xinhua) -- New faces have thrust
their ways into the domains held by world-famed veterans in
China's National Champions' tournament, or the Chinese Olympic
trials, which ended here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Brand-new stars have showed their talent and potential, as well
as their nerve while facing the country's best known swimmers in
the week-long 32-event meet.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the women's 100 and 200-meter freestyle world
champion Le Jingyi only finished second in 100 and third in 200
underlines how strong Chinese young swimmers have become.
</P>
<P>
Le, world record holder in the 50- and 100-meter freestyle, was
touched out in the 200 meters which was won by Chen Yan, a
teenager from North China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Chen, almost unknown before the meet, emerged
as the most prolific swimmer with four gold medals from five
events she entered. Her previous appearance at the major
competition was last October's Chinese Urban Games in Nanjing,
where she chalked up three golds.
</P>
<P>
"She is an all-around swimmer," said Chen's coach Han
Bingyan. "Her superiority lies in the middle and long distance
freestyle event."
</P>
<P>
Le wasn't the only veteran upset by youngsters.
</P>
<P>
He Cihong, world record-holder in the women's 100-meter
backstroke, was beaten by a 17-year-old, also named Chen Yan, from
Southeast China's Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
He, China's top women's backstroker, clocked almost three
seconds slower than her own world mark, set at the Rome World
Championships in 1994, to settle for runner-up behind Chen.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lin, coach of He, explained that lack of major
competitions was the main reason for her failure.
</P>
<P>
The disheartened He refused to comment on her performance and
she then withdrew from the 200-meter backstroke, alleging illness.
</P>
<P>
Another disappointed veteran was butterfly specialist Liu
Limin, who struggled to win the 100 meters in a slow time of one
minute 1.61 seconds. Cai Huijue, a 14-year-old from Shanghai,
gave Liu a scare, touching the pad just 0.04 seconds adrift.
</P>
<P>
"I am not happy with my time," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Liu ended China swimming gold drought in 1995 by winning a
title from the World University Games in Fukuoka, Japan, and moved
to second place at the year-end world rankings.
</P>
<P>
"It isn't the time for attempting records," said Liu's coach
Zhao Ge, hinting that the trials were not a showcase for fast
times.
</P>
<P>
"That's nonsense," former head coach of the Chinese national
team Chen Yunpeng talked back. "No one would run the risk of being
kept out of the Olympics, especially those veterans," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lin Senlin, team leader of the Chinese Olympic squad, expressed
disappointment about the competitions.
</P>
<P>
"Results in most of the events here were slower than
expectation," he complained.
</P>
<P>
A seven-member working group has been set up to select Chinese
swimming Olympians and they are expected to announce the roster by
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Olympic women's champion Lin Li, 26, the oldest swimmer here,
is expected to compete in her third Olympics while veteran men
swimmer Lin Laijiu, the national champion at the 100- and
200-meter backstroke failed to reach his third Games after placing
fourth in the 100 meters. Only top two finishers qualify for the
Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Lin Li, world record-holder in the women's 200-meter individual
medley who came back from a four-year layoff, was beaten into
second at her specialty event by Wu Yanyan from South China's
Guangxi province.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Wu clocked 2:12.87, the world best time of the
year, slicing four seconds off her personal best. "I knew I would
do it," she said after the competition.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Visits Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 7 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat arrived in Riyadh today for
talks on the situation in the Palestinian territories following
the latest Israeli siege.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA), Arafat was met at
the airport by Deputy Amir of the Riyadh Region Prince Satam Bin
Abdul-Aziz, Member of Parliament Musa'ad Al-Aiban and Palestinian
Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mustafa Hashem Deeb.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Palestinian Embassy in Riyadh told the KUNA that
the Palestinian Leader was expected to meet later today with the
Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister and Head of the National
Guards, Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's two-day visit is part of a tour that includes a
number of Gulf and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Arafat started his tour in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in
late March. He will also visit Egypt, Morocco and other Gulf
states.
</P>
<P>
The tour is aimed at briefing these countries' leaders on the
poor living conditions of the Palestinians in the self-rule areas
following a tight Israeli political and economic closure.
</P>
<P>
The closure came in the wake of four Palestinian suicide
bombing attacks on Israeli targets in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and
Ashkelon in late February and early March, which killed 58 people.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also deal with the effects of these attacks on
the Palestinian and Syrian tracks of peace negotiations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will discuss granting more aid to the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian people whose
economy has suffered greatly since the siege was imposed nearly
one month ago.
</P>
<P>
This is Arafat's second visit to Saudi Arabia this year, the
first one in the middle of January.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has financed the PLO with 400 million U.S. dollars
and offered 100 million dollars to the Palestinian self-rule areas
in January.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Regional Commander Reprimanded for Shelling South Lebanese Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military authorities
have reprimanded the regional commander, known as Colonel Z, for
the shelling of the south Lebanese village of Yatar last weekend,
reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The shelling left two Lebanese civilians dead and sparked
Hezbollah (Party of God) Katyusha attacks in the Galilee Panhandle
and Western Galilee, northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to prevent the situation from worsening on the eve
of the Jewish Passover Holiday, Prime Minister Shimon Peres said
that the shelling was a mistake and that Israel regretted civilian
casualties. Major General Amiram Levine, head of the Northern
Command, ordered an inquiry into the shelling.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry put the blame on the regional brigade commander,
who gave the order to open fire. "The brigade commander deviated
from a number of regulations on opening fire," the inquiry
said. But it noted that these deviations had no bearing on the
result of the shelling.
</P>
<P>
The army decided to keep the colonel's reprimand within the
framework of the Northern Command and not to seek alternative
punishment, such as court martial. This is, perhaps, because the
Northern Command still believed that those killed were not
innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
However, U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) spokesman Timur
Goksel said the Lebanese civilians who were killed were known to
members of the international peacekeeping force. They had been
working for the past fortnight on a Lebanese government project to
construct a water tank in the Yatar village area.

<HEADLINE> Slovak President on Strengthening Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Slovak President Michal Kovac said
today that his country hopes to further promote cooperation with
China and to expand trade relations and exchanges in industry,
culture and education.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is scheduled to visit China April 10 to 15,
told Xinhua that the two countries have enjoyed traditional
friendship and noted that China is among the first few countries
to recognize Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
There are no disputes in bilateral relations at all and no
impediments to the development of cooperation between the two
sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kovac noted that Slovakia established diplomatic relations with
China as soon as it became independent in 1993 and recognized that
there is but one China, which is represented by the government of
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Kovac said, in accordance with the one China policy, Slovakia
does not develop official relations with Taiwan. He said his
country believes that the unification of China is China's internal
affair.
</P>
<P>
The president said China is one of its major partners in Asia,
to which Slovakia attaches ultimate importance.
</P>
<P>
China's economy has witnessed rapid growth in recent years and
its successful economic reform has most impressed the world, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Kovac expressed satisfaction with the development of the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the political dialogues between leaders of
the two countries. The Chinese trip of Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar in February 1994 laid a foundation for bilateral
cooperation between the two sides and the visits of Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and a delegation of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference all expressed the good
will of the Chinese side to strengthen cooperation with Slovakia,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kovac said that his government supports the expansion of
cooperation between the two sides in the fields of scientific
research and education. He also expressed the hope that the two
countries could expand trade on the basis of cooperation in
science and technology.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Sees Steady Growth of Economic Ties With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- This north China port city has in
recent years seen steady and substantial growth of bilateral trade
and economic co-operation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, a major industrial city and the biggest overseas trade
port in north China, achieved an export volume of 25 million US
dollars with Russia last year, a growth of 80 percent over the
previous year. The import volume reached over 20 million US
dollars, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
A dozen Tianjin businesses have set up branch companies or
representative offices in Russia, while Russian businesses have
invested about 10 million US dollars in over 20 Tianjin
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Well connected by air, sea and land transport routes, Tianjin
and Russia have long done business through barter trade and
economic co-operation in other fields. But the traditional barter
trade has been gradually replaced by ordinary trade, the volume of
which has kept rising in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Binhai International Airport in Tianjin now receives the
biggest number of chartered flights from the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) to China, and handles the biggest number
of Chinese exports to CIS nations among Chinese airports. Last
year, the two figures reached 4,241 takeoffs and landings and
42,000 tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin and Russia well complement each other in economic
structure, said an official of the local foreign-trade department.
</P>
<P>
Half of Tianjin's exports to Russia last year consisted of
light industrial products, foodstuffs, animal products, and 60
percent of its imports from Russia were steel products and
non-ferrous metals.
</P>
<P>
With Russia's increasing demand for higher-quality industrial
products, local joint ventures are busily seeking entry into the
Russian market, and some large Chinese foreign-trade companies
have launched special promotion projects for Chinese goods in
Russia since the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Denies Having Information on Alleged Libyan Chemical Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
here today that he does not have any information on whether Libya
is building a large underground plant to produce chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
"I do not have information on this issue and I can not comment
on it," he said at a press conference after meeting with his
Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The United States has accused Libya of trying to produce
chemical weapons. During his visit to Egypt Wednesday,
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said his country would not
allow Libya to complete the plant, indicating a threat to use
military force.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told the press conference that he had asked Perry to
present pictures and reports to verify his information about the
Libyan program for producing chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said that taking any decision in this connection
necessitates a lot of information.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who arrived here Saturday on a three-day visit to
Egypt, held talks with Mubarak this morning on bilateral
relations, the Middle East peace process and a number of other
regional and international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is keen on promoting trade and cultural
ties with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
On the Arab-Israeli peace process, Chirac said that France has
called for implementing U.N. Security Council resolution 425,
which demands that Israel withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
France is ready to participate in any security arrangements on
the Lebanese-Israeli borders and extend more economic aid to the
Palestinian Authority, he said.
</P>
<P>
The French president said that his country tops the list of
countries assisting the Palestinian self-rule areas, emphasizing
the importance of giving the Palestinians hopes for a better and
brighter future.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that progress would also be achieved in
the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that peace talks should not be suspended because
of the upcoming elections in Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said at the press conference that the suspension of talks
would complicate the peace process and lead to a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told reporters that France supports efforts by Egypt to
render the Middle East and Africa free from all weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
He voiced France's keenness on promoting ties with the Arab
world. "France's positive relationship with the Arab world is a
very important and solid element in France's foreign policy," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds Contribute to Guangdong's Forestry Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
signed 33 agreements on forestry projects, involving more than
three million US dollars each, at an investment tendering fair in
Hong Kong last May.
</P>
<P>
The contracted overseas investment surpassed 1.2 billion US
dollars, more than the province's investment in afforestation in
the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funds are playing an increasingly important role in
forestry development in Guangdong, which has more than 8.8 million
hectares of forests and a forest coverage rate of 54.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years Guangdong has planted 127,000 hectares
of forests with 27.4 million US dollars-worth of World Bank
loans. Meanwhile, aid projects from the United Nations Development
Program have also promoted the modernization of the province's
forestry.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investment has expanded to forestry-product
processing and the construction of forestry-product bases. In May
last year a company from Singapore signed agreements on 300,000
hectares of rapidly growing forests with the authorities of
Shaoguan, Qingyuan, Zhaoqing, Yunfu and Zhanjiang cities. Under
the agreements, the company will invest more than 200 million US
dollars and co-operate with the cities in forestry for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
At present, overseas investment from Hong Kong, Japan and
Canada covers more than 50 forestry projects throughout the
province.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua/OANA) -- August First claimed the
title of the 1995-1996 Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) League
for the second straight time on Sunday by beating Guangdong
Hongyuan 88-74 in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
August First is the only unbeaten team in the 12-team league
this season in its all 26 games.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion trounced Hongyuan 97-63 in the lopsided
first game of the two-leg finals last Sunday on the road in
Dongguan, Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhizhi, voted as the center of the league's
Best-Five-Player team, scored 20 points and made three blocks for
August First, which led 51-32 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Hongyuan finished runner-up for the first time in the CBA
League after straight wins over Liaoning Angang in the two-leg
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Hongyuan posted a 20-4 win-loss record in the CBA's first
over-year season which began on November 10, last year.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, host Shougang edged out Angang 73-62 without its
2.14-meter center Shan Tao in the second game of the two-leg
play-off for third place.
</P>
<P>
Shan was suspended for exchanging blows with Wang Shouqiang of
Liaoning last Wednesday in their first game in Anshan and set to
miss Tuesday's All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning won the first game 75-72.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, the fourth-place finisher last season, moved one spot
up for winning more points in the play-off. The defending
runner-up Liaoning was fourth.
</P>
<P>
Shougang went ahead 34-28 before the interval and extended
their lead as many as 20 points with 7:12 left.
</P>
<P>
Forward Liu Hongwei topped Shougang with 17 points and 2.10
center Bateer added 13 points and got a game-high 19 rebounds in
40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"We were prepared well," said Yuan Chao, head coach of
Shougang. "But I had never expected a runaway victory in this
game. We put up a very good defense and got most of the rebounds."
</P>
<P>
Liaoning guard Wu Qinglong netted 19 points including four
three-pointers and Zheng Yonggang contributed 14 points.
</P>
<P>
"We were defeated by ourselves, not our rivals," said Liaoning
head coach Li Ge.
</P>
<P>
"Our players were too anxious to control the game," he
said. "We had the worst play with only 24 of 68 against Beijing's
26 of 56 in the shots and 27-42 in the rebounds."

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Employees in the economic and
technological development zone in this north China port city do
not have to worry about their old-age pensions or the consequences
of work injury, illness or unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone has
established a fairly complete social security system for workers.
</P>
<P>
It includes old-age pension, injury and illness coverage, and
employment and maternity insurance.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that soon it will cover all contracted laborers.
</P>
<P>
Over 600 foreign funded-enterprises have bought insurance for
their 20,000 employees so far. The amount of premiums totals over
100 million yuan (12.05 million US dollars), and 40 percent of it
has been used to compensate several thousand unemployed workers,
nearly 100 injured workers and several hundred others suffering
from illnesses.
</P>
<P>
A supervisory board for the insurance fund will be set up to
ensure that the premiums are collected on time and used properly
for the betterment of the social security system in the
development zone.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin development zone has attracted six billion US
dollars of foreign investment since its foundation and its
industrial output reached 26.5 billion yuan (4.21 billion US
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of the social security system will further
promote the development of this development zone, a local

<HEADLINE> WHO Official Warns of Deteriorating Situation in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- An official of the World Health
Organization (WHO) in Baghdad today warned that the serious
shortage of necessary health care facilities in Iraq has worsened
the situation of the country caused by financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press here, WHO representative Habib Rajb said
that the deteriorating situation in Iraq could be improved only
through lifting the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its
August 1990 invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said that WHO has made great efforts in acquainting the
world community with the suffering of Iraqis under the U.N.
sanctions by publishing leaflets and other means.
</P>
<P>
He added that he will present a report on the health care
situation in Iraq when WHO convenes a meeting in Geneva at the end
of this month.

<HEADLINE> Somali RRA Regains Control Of Huddor From Aidid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A military communique issued
by the Somali Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) said today that
their forces have regained the strategic town of Huddor last
night from Genral Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The RRA forces killed three militiamen loyal to Aidid and
captured a large amount of ammunition in the fighting, during
which the RRA met little resistance, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The RRA, which lost two men in the fighting, is advancing to
Baidoa and the rest of the land occupied by General Aidid since
last September, according to the communique from the RRA's
largest military base in the central Somali town of Beletuein.
</P>
<P>
The RRA made the comeback only a day after General Aidid
arrived in the Somali capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Huddor said Aidid's men were ready to leave
Huddor for Mogadishu at the time of the attack for a possible
offensive against Osman Hassan Ali Atto, who used to be Aidid's
financier, but turned against him early last year.
</P>
<P>
There has been no word from the Aidid's self claimed
government about the fall of Huddor.

BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Guo Qinghong, former stage
champion of the Tour de France, sprinted home to take the
100-kilometer road race after a blood-tainted pack fight to the
finish in the Chinese Women's Cycling Olympic trials on Sunday.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's overseas contracting
business has entered most Asian countries and regions, and over 80
percent of its business volume last year came from the Asian
market.
</P>
<P>
Last year Shanghai's overseas contractors undertook contracts
worth a total of 351.2 million US dollars, for a business volume
of 243.8 million US dollars. Some 14,460 people had worked
overseas for these contracts by the end of the year, according to
local officials.
</P>
<P>
The traditional markets for the city's overseas contracting
business include Macao, Japan, Singapore, Iran, the Philippines,
Hong Kong and Thailand. New markets have been developed in
Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia and the Republic of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Overseas contracting has stimulated exports of Shanghai-made
equipment and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Most of the workers sent abroad used to be employed as common
laborers in the tailoring, building, fishing and catering
businesses, but there are now more technical and managerial
staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- This, China's largest metropolis
has chalked up a 64.3-percent increase in the collection of
individual income tax in the first three months of this year, as
compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu Zichong, deputy-director of the municipal tax
bureau, the city has launched a vigorous drive to give publicity
to the Law on Individual Income Tax since the beginning of the
year and has put forward a series of enforcement rules and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the tax departments have stepped up efforts to
collect taxes levied on high-income earners in highly profitable
trades and sectors, particularly among artistic and literary
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The municipal tax bureau has worked out a series of rules and
regulations governing collection of taxes in the sectors of
construction, taxi, foreign trade enterprises and theater troupes
as well as other sectors and has remarkably improved tax
collection.
</P>
<P>
The municipal tax departments also pay great attention to
checking up on taxation in the sectors of finance, real estate,
advertising and trade, and practise a system of deducting
individual income taxes on behalf of the concerned tax-payers.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Protest over Turkish Map-Drawing Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government will
protest to the U.N. and the European Union (EU) against what
it called a new provocative act by the Turks, who have drawn
up a map of the off-coast "boundaries" of the breakaway state
in the Turkish-occupied northern part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides today was quoted as saying
that the Turkish act was just for "internal consumption" since
the Turks know very well that such an act would never be
recognized by anyone.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cyprus government would protest against this
new Turkish move to the U.N. and the EU.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish press, the map, which claims to
outline the extent of its off-coast boundaries, was drawn up
by cartographers on behalf of the so-called "Interior Ministry"
of the Turkish Cypriot regime with the help of Turkey's
Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
The line extends from near Dhernyia on the east coast of
the island all the way to Kokkina in the west.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time such marine boundaries have been
defined by the Turkish Cypriot regime, and the maps will be
sent to the U.N. and made available to "other interested
parties," according to Turkish TV reports.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized 37 percent of its territory following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
In November 1983, the Turkish Cypriot regime unilaterally
declared independence in the occupied northern part of Cyprus,
which was recognized only by Turkey.

<P>
FUZHOU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Yongquan Temple in east China's
Fujian Province has become the first Buddist monastery in the
country to buy TV ad time, on a morning program of the provincial
TV station.
</P>
<P>
The monastery offered 200,000 yuan, the highest price among all
the bidders for the ad time of "Good Morning, Fujian", a program
broadcast at eight o'clock each morning.
</P>
<P>
The ad time will be used to promote Mount Gushan, which is a
leading tourist spot in Fujian and where the Yongquan Temple is
located, according to Master Pufa, abbot of the temple.
</P>
<P>
He said the primary object of the advertising is to extend the
monks' greetings to Fujian and its people, and express their best
wishes for more rapid and better development of the province and a
better life of the local residents.
</P>
<P>
Master Pufa said the spread of Buddhism benefits from social
progress and prosperity, so that monks should do something to help
promote social development.
</P>
<P>
Having taken the first step to involve itself with social life
through the media, the abbot said, the monastery will buy more ad
time to better communicate with the outside world.

<P>
To prepare for blackouts many government agencies, factories
and institutions have diesel generators to supply electricity for
lighting and making buttered tea for their Tibetan employees.
</P>
<P>
And some families have their own generators.
</P>
<P>
Soinam Wangdui, a truck driver in his 30s, spent 4,000 yuan on
a diesel generator for his family of four.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to worry about my refrigerator and electric
butter mixer when there are blackouts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Standing atop the famous Potala Palace one can see rows of
solar-powered equipment to supply hot water. Lhasa is a city with
plenty of sunshine all the year round, but the residents are not
content with this present from the nature, and many have bought
electrical heating machines.
</P>
<P>
Basang Zholma said that hot water from a solar-powered machine
is not enough today to supply showers for his family of four.
</P>
<P>
A Lhasa shopkeeper said that, in addition to electrical
gadgets, househood equipment using gas have become popular items.
He said half of the households in the city use gas for cooking.
</P>
<P>
The dried-up butter bucket is a sign that many old,
inconvenient aspects of Tibetan life -- such as using cow dung for
fuel -- are on the way out.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Employs Subsidized Loans to Boost Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Subsidized bank loans have
enabled over 15,000 people to be employed in east China's Zhejiang
Province since 1987, a provincial labor official said.
</P>
<P>
Government subsidies for bank loans, intended to help people in
areas or state-owned enterprises with surplus labor forces to find
jobs, have amounted to nine million yuan (over one million US
dollars), said the official, according to whom Zhejiang is the
first place in the country to provide such loans.
</P>
<P>
In Zhoushan City and Wencheng and Taishun counties subsidized
loans have been used to establish or support 65 enterprises,
thereby providing jobs for 4,000 people, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Jiande, subsidized bank loans have enabled over
500 redundant workers in state-owned enterprises to be re-employed.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the amount of subsidized loans will be
increased during the Ninth Five-Year Plan, which runs through the
year 2000.

LHASA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Modernization in daily life does not
always please Tibetans, and one of their common "grievances" today
is that they sometimes can not get buttered tea for breakfast when
there is a power failure.
</P>
<P>
Most of their traditional butter buckets used to make buttered
tea stand dry, as they have been replaced by electrical machines.
</P>
<P>
Buttered tea is a traditional Tibetan drink and a necessity in
every household. The procedure is to first boil brick tea in
water, add butter and salt and stir the mixture in a long, narrow
bucket made of wood or bamboo.
</P>
<P>
Daje, a government employee, said that he is no longer
satisfied with merely owning a big television set, hi-fi stereo
system and refrigerators -- his pride and joy is an electrical
mixer to make buttered tea.
</P>
<P>
Daje's family, with a regular monthly salary of around 1,000
yuan (about 120.34 US dollars), and other income from part-time
work, is typical of Lhasa residents.
</P>
<P>
"Using an electric mixer saves me much time and effort, and the
buttered tea made by it is more homogeneous and savory than the
traditional type," Daje said.
</P>
<P>
But power failures are what he worries about most, as then the
electrical mixer becomes useless, and the butter bucket has dried
out long ago, making it useless.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the government of the Tibet Autonomous
Region has taken measures to build more power plants, the rapid
economic development puts a severe burden on power resources.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Towards Healthy Cities, Healthy Islands (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- As the world health day is observed
today, the World Health Organization (WHO) emphasized the need to
take positive action to protect environment and enhance the
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
This year's world health day theme "healthy cities - healthy
islands," focuses on activities that communities need to ensure a
clean environment and encourage individuals to adopt healthy
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, WHO estimates, in many developing countries,
more than half of the population will live in and around urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
In the Western Pacific region, the overall urban population is
growing at an annual rate of 3 to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
If the growth continues at this pace, urban populations in the
region will double in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Economically, the Western Pacific is the most dynamic and
rapidly developing region of the world and cities in the region
are the focus of much of the economic development.
</P>
<P>
However, WHO fears that accelerated growth of urban areas will
result in severe overloading of urban infrastructure and services
such as housing, transportation, water and energy supplies,
domestic and industrial waste management systems, parks and
recreational areas.
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true where development does not adequately
account for health and environment considerations, WHO says.
</P>
<P>

In brief, he indicated that individual and community efforts
need to be supported by commitment from the government through
appropriate policies and resources.

"No one person or group of people alone can ensure the success
of the 'healthy cities - healthy islands' initiative," he said,
"let us therefore work together - wherever we are, and whatever we
do."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Ankara-Tehran Relations Turn Cold (2) (by Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iran and Turkey are not in any way similar politically. Iran is
a religious theocratic society whereas Turkey is secular since the
time of Ataturk.
</P>
<P>
Turkish authorities are worried about the Iranian influence on
the Turkish Islamists. The rise of Welfare Party that almost formed
its own government is haunting the Turkish secularists.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the Islamist Welfare party in Turkey was welcomed
by Iranian officials. But much to the disappointment of the
Iranian authorities and press, the Welfare Party could not form a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Turkish authorities are alert against
the danger of terrorism. Late January, Turkish security sources
claimed that Iran was sending arms to the Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) based near Turkey's border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Turkish security authorities said that six trucks, which were
seized in Turkey late January, were loaded in Iran's religious
city of Qom with military equipment, including rockets, bullets,
TNT and small types of cannons.
</P>
<P>
Just recently, Turkish press reported that some terrorists were
arrested and confessed to the involvement of Iranian diplomats in
terrorist activities in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Religious differences play minor role in the rift here, even
though Iran is Shi'ite majority and Turkey is Sunni majority.
Since the Turkish officials follow Ataturk's secular ideology,
religious differences cannot play any significant role in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
From the standpoint of economic rivalry, both countries are
involved in a fierce competition to reap the benefits from the
vast market offered by the members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
Iran has mobilized all of its resources to establish close
ties with the CIS countries while Turkey is establishing ties with
most of the CIS countries based on the common racial and Turkic
identity.
</P>
<P>
Historically the two countries were sworn enemies. The wars
between the Ottoman rulers and Iran's Safavid kings claimed
hundreds of thousands of lives on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said although the relations between
Iran and Turkey have turned ice-cold, the two neighbors seem to
want to curb the deteriorating trend. Local press reported that
Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Toygan will pay an official
visit to Iran next week.
</P>
<P>
Official reports said that Toygan will meet Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and discuss "bilateral relations as
well as the latest regional and international developments."
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Turkey's agreement with Israel would
be on top of the agenda during the discussions. However, they
added that other problems to be discussed between the two sides
included the issue of terrorism.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Ankara-Tehran Relations Turn Cold (1) (by Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ankara-Tehran relations have
turned cold due to a number of factors, including the latest
accord signed by Turkey and Israel, under which the Israeli air
force is allowed to carry out training maneuvers in the Turkish
sky.
</P>
<P>
Even though the Iranian government has still remained quiet up
to this moment, the Iranian press are harshly attacking Ankara,
warning the agreement on military cooperation would provoke the
anger of the Turkish people and Moslem countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Jomhuri Islami today said the recent military
agreement between Turkey and Israel endangers the national
security of Iran.
</P>
<P>
"From now on we have to be expecting Israeli war planes
outside our borders, who knows, maybe tomorrow the Israeli spy
planes will start flying over our border regions," the daily
said.
</P>
<P>
It called on the Iranian Foreign Ministry to immediately
summon the Turkish Ambassador to Tehran to ask for "serious
explanations."
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Akhbar today warned Ankara in its editorial
that Iran would not take the issue of agreement with Israel
lightly.
</P>
<P>
"If Turkey is selling its airspace cheaply, it has to know
that its neighbors do not take this move lightly and they reserve
the right to take similar security measures," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Kayhan International said in its editorial
that "one common purpose of Ankara and Tel Aviv is to put
political as well as military pressure on their neighbors by means
of intimidation. This, no doubt, will propel the region toward
more tension," it said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times, another English morning daily, expressed Iran's
deep worries about the security, saying that "through the accord
(with Israel) Turkey has in fact brought the Zionist regime to
our doorsteps."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that there are certain reasons behind the
military accord between Turkey and Israel and the deteriorating
relations between Turkey and Iran.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank's
branch in east China's Jiangsu Province will over the next three
years grant loans worth 300 million yuan (about 35.7 million US
dollars) to the Suzhou Industrial Park, a joint venture sponsored
by the Chinese and Singaporean governments.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed between the two sides, the
loans will be used for infrastructure construction in the park.
</P>
<P>
An official source here said that banks and other financial
institutions in Jiangsu have provided the park with syndicated
loans valued at a total of 136 million yuan since it was launched
in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
To give firm financial backing to the construction of the park,
in which the Chinese side has a 35 percent stake, almost all major
domestic commercial banks have established subsidiaries there, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that construction of residences for relocated farmers,
with a total floor space of 350,000 sq m, and apartments inside
the park totalling 200,000 sq m, has already started. So has the
construction of factory and office buildings.

MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Filipino overseas contract workers
(OCW) remittances reached 6.8 billion US dollars in 1995,
according to an estimate made by HG Asia Securities Co.
</P>

This figure is 1.9 billion dollars more than the official

</P>

The Central Bank figure covered only remittances made through

But the HG Asia estimate is based on studies showing that only
70 percent of OCW remittances are coursed through banks.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank figure for 1995 is 64 percent up from the 3.01

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Scores Success in Curbing Jobless Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
has scored a major success in curbing its rising jobless rate and
re-allocating redundant state employees.
</P>
<P>
The urban unemployment rate in this, China's most prosperous
province is 1.86 percent, much lower than the national level of
3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is also making headway in solving the problem of
redundant employees in its reform of state-owned enterprises, as
in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 the number of local redundant workers reached over one
million, accounting for 17 percent of the urban employees.
</P>
<P>
When the province started to enact the labor contract system
decided by the central authorities in 1994, the 5,647 state
enterprises surveyed by the provincial government planned to fire
27,800 workers, or 3.9 percent of their total.
</P>
<P>
The redundant workers are re-allocated among different
industries, and the local government encourages the unemployed to
set up their own businesses with the help of the local communities.
</P>
<P>
In recent years over 130,000 workers in state-owned enterprises
have lost their jobs in Guangdong. Most of them are elderly and
poorly educated, but many have found employment in the service
trades.
</P>
<P>
The local governments provide a certain amount of money for
those willing to start up new ventures, and adopt preferential
taxation policies toward them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 100,000 workers in money-losing enterprises
have been re-employed after their enterprises were merged by
others.
</P>
<P>
The labor departments also organized redundant workers in one
place to another, or from one industry to others, where more
laborers are needed.

ISLAMABAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- At least Two people were killed
and 12 others wounded in rocket attacks on the Afghan capital of
Kabul last night, according to reports from Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
A seven-year-old boy was killed in a gunfight early Sunday
while a woman was killed in a rocket attack on the city, said the

Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Other shells struck the presidential palace in the city center,
but there were no civilian casualties, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
As usual, the Kabul government blamed the Taliban religious
student movement for the attacks, but no independent confirmation
was available.
</P>
<P>
Kabul has been subjected to almost daily shelling and rocket
attacks since the Taliban has sieged the city last October in a

<HEADLINE> Technology to Help Inner Mongolia Boost Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Inner Mongolian Autonomous
Region in north China hopes to increase its grain output by one
million tons by resorting to state-of-the-art agro-technology in
the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xuemin, director of the regional scientific and
technological committee, told Xinhua that over the five-year
period the total grain production of the region is expected to
increase by 3.5 million tons, 29 percent of which will be achieved
through the use of agro-technology.
</P>
<P>
The added grain output for the entire country is projected to
be 50 million tons, and Inner Mongolia will take seven percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, advanced technology will be mainly used to
grow quality corns, rice, and soybeans in the eastern part of the
region, and wheat in the west.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the pastoral and agricultural production has been
growing steadily in Inner Mongolia, making its per capita grain
output rank first among the country's five autonomous regions
inhabited by ethnic-minority people.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Yungco, a 60-year-old Tibetan woman,
does not have to worry about her illness any more even though she
lives in an isolated village, thanks to Zham Song, a woman
horseback doctor who often visits patients in the village.
</P>
<P>
Patients used to have to ride for at least one or two days if
they wanted to see a doctor because Ridung Township, situated in
Qamdo County in east Tibet, is surrounded by high mountains and
deep rivers.
</P>
<P>
Zham, director of the local hospital which only has five
medical workers, visited more than 5,000 patients last year on
horseback.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to provide more convenience for patients, Zham has to
spend at least six months patrolling the nearby villages each year.
</P>
<P>
Because state-allocated medicine can only meet one third of the
actual need, when July and August come Zham leads her colleagues
to collect medicinal herbs in the mountains to make medicines
which are renowned in eastern Tibet for their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
More than once she has rejected offers of high-salaried jobs
from outside the county, saying, "As a Communist, I should stay
where I am most needed by the masses."

<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered a thorough investigation of the outbreak of fire on
board a ferryboat shipping holiday travelers between Ormoc city in

ANKARA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier

</P>
<P>
Official sources here said that Solana would pay his visit to

<HEADLINE> PNA Says No More Dialogue with Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) says that it is no longer seeking an agreement
with the Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, and the Islamic
Jihad.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Saturday by the Palestine News Agency
(WAFA) following a weekly cabinet meeting in the West Bank town of
Nablus, the PNA said it was not considering holding any more
dialogue with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Hamas Friday issued a leaflet in the Gaza
Strip, attacking the PNA and demanding apology from PNA President
Yasser Arafat for arresting Hamas members.
</P>
<P>
The PNA, under Israeli pressure, has arrested dozens of Hamas
activists in the West Bank and Gaza Strip following a series of
Hamas suicide bombing attacks in Israel since February 25, which
killed at least 60 people and wounded over 150 others.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian official delegation was due to visit Jordan
today to meet with the Hamas leadership there in an attempt to
persuade it to call a halt to suicide attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The delegation Thursday met Arafat in Gaza to receive his
blessing. However, Hamas rejected any commitment in its leaflet to
end attacks on Israel on the following day.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told the cabinet meeting Saturday that he no longer
trusts Hamas to control its armed wing.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was quoted by PNA Secretary Tayeb Abdel Raheem as
saying that "Hamas has tried more than once to conduct coup
against Palestinian legitimacy after receiving external orders."
</P>
<P>
He also told the cabinet that the Palestinian police had
uncovered Hamas plans to carry out four new suicide bombing
attacks in Israel recently, and had foiled them all.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is traveling to Saudi Arabia today to discuss with Saudi
leaders about the five-week long closure imposed on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip by Israel following the suicide bombing attacks,
and the overall status of the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Vows to Capture Fugitive Bankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government pledged
today to capture fugitive bankers who embezzled 8 billion U.S.
dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Wherever they might be, we will look for them," said Attorney
General Ivan Dario Badell.
</P>
<P>
Badell noted that several countries, especially some European
countries, have offered assistance for Caracas' action.
</P>
<P>
The country will also seek help of the Inter-American
Convention Against Corruption, which allows signatory countries to
reveal banking secrets in the pursuit of fraud by government
officials and others.
</P>
<P>
The escaped bankers are accused of pocketing the funds which
were distributed to rescue Venezuela's largest bank, Banco Latino,
after it collapsed in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
Local media assume that the bankers are hiding in either the
United States or Europe, though the attorney didn't make any
suggestion on their dwelling.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, one of the fugitive bankers Orlando Castro,
was arrested in Miami on charges of bank fraud and malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
However, Castro, who was alleged to have embezzled 800 million
dollars, denied all the charges, saying he was the only banker in
Venezuela who made appropriate use of the funds.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Launch Anti-TB Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Health Ministry is
reportedly ready to launch a national program to combat the
increasing tuberculosis (TB) disease that was widely thought to
have been eliminated for decades.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, between 1987 and 1995, the rate of new cases per
year ranged from 3.5 to 10.2 per 10,000 residents. Between 1990
and 1994, 230 to 500 new cases were reported to the Health
Ministry annually. The 1995 figure was 346 new cases.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of the lung disease is increasing both in Israel
and around the world largely due to increased travel and
immigration, the AIDS epidemic and growing resistance of the
bacteria to penicillin.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared for the
first time that the TB situation was a "global emergency." Last
year, the disease killed three million people throughout the world
and was contracted by eight million others. The WHO projected last
week that 500 million U.S. dollars would be needed a year to bring
the epidemic under control.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, Israeli Health Minister Ephraim Sneh
appointed a committee headed by Ministry Director General Meir
Oren to treat and prevent the disease. The measures taken by the
committee include increasing public awareness, improving
information among doctors about TB, treating TB patients in nine
special centers, as well as performing tests in one national lab
and establishing a computerized AIDS-TB department in the
ministry's Public Health Department.

<HEADLINE> commentary: High-Level Exchange Promotes Sino-EU Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng's
up-coming visit to France is regarded by observers here as another
important direct contact between the leaders of China and European
Union (EU) countries, following the Asia-Europe Meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
The past two years have witnessed fast progress in Sino-EU
ties, during which Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other top
Leaders toured most of the EU countries including France and
Germany, while the leaders from EU states also made their
footprints in this "last land with most market potential".
</P>
<P>
The frequent high-level exchange of visits has produced
favorable conditions for deepening Sino-EU mutual understanding,
establishing mutual trust and expanding cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The growth of Sino-EU ties is the result of the change of
international situation after the "Cold War", and China's rapid
economic development as well as the adjustment of EU's China
policy, which reflects the common aspiration of China and EU to
build a new partner relationship.
</P>
<P>
As two major forces in the current world that is turning to the
direction of multi-polarization, Sino-EU cooperation will not only
benefit the two economies, but also contribute to the
establishment of new international political and economic
orders. This is the understanding shared by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Economic ties account for an important part in the overall
Sino-EU contacts.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese customs statistics, the trade volume
between China and the EU in 1995 reached 40.38 billion US
dollars-worth, an 18.7 percent increase over 1994. EU is now
China's fourth largest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
The EU nations have invested in 5499 projects in China,
involving a contracted investment of 17.1 billion US dollars and
actual investment of 5.3 billion US dollars by the end of last
September.
</P>
<P>
The EU is also the major supplier of China's imported
technology. China introduced 2,374 items of technology from the EU
countries up to last September, with a contracted capital of 20.7
billion US dollars, which accounts for 40 percent of China's total
imported technology, leaving the US and Japan behind in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
But the level of the current Sino-EU economic exchange only
represents the primary stage of bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, indicating enormous potential ahead. China is
focusing on the development of such areas as agriculture,
communications, energy and telecommunications, which are the EU
member countries' "strong points". Once the EU's technology and
capital are combined in a larger scale with China's market and
resources, their collaboration would see a new leap forward and
greater benefit for both sides.
</P>
<P>
Sino-EU links are obviously not limited to economic and trade
exchange. As observers here see it, the two sides also have much
to do in political, cultural and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have emphasized on many occasions that the
divergence in social systems, culture and values should not
obstruct the development of state-to-state links. The EU also
proposed to foster closer ties with China, in its document of
long-term policy for EU-China relations.
</P>
<P>
All these indicate that Premier Li Peng's France tour will be a
success.

<HEADLINE> 30 Percent Rise in Bank Frauds Recorded in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A 30 percent increase in bank
frauds involving foreign and national banks in India has been
detected by the union Finance Ministry since the implementation of
the new economic policy.
</P>
<P>
In connivance with the senior bank managers, more than 8,000
million rupees ( 266.67 million US dollars) has been siphoned off
between 1991 and 1994 and the trend is showing an increase,
Finance Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Most of this money in foreign exchange is believed to have
found its way to the tax havens of Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Some of the fraud cases related to misappropriation through
manipulation of the book of accounts, perpetration of frauds
through clearing transactions, misutilization of delegate powers
and opening or issuing letters of credit and bank guarantee, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of India was taking a serious view of the
situation and is contemplating action against the erring banks.

WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- One goal by Eric Wynalda inside

Defenseman Ben Ihora sent a pass down the left side of the

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Won't Stimulate Inflation (Part Two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From 2003, generators of the hydro-electrical project will go
into operation successively. They can generate electricity to
repay 15 percent of the total investment before 2007. It is
expected that by 2007 the project's money demand and supply will
have struck a balance.
</P>
<P>
According to authoritative forecasts on future prices, exchange
rates and loan interests, the project is still short of 40 billion
yuan before 2007.
</P>
<P>
But it is not difficult to raise 40 billion yuan. Major
financial sources include export credits, overseas stock issues,
overseas commercial bank loans, issuing of bonds at home, loans
from domestic commercial banks, exclusive loans from state foreign
exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of floating stock on overseas markets to raise
money is not excluded, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Several financial giants, like Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley,
J.P. Morgan, Daiwa, Normura, used to design plans for YRTGPDC to
issue bonds.
</P>
<P>
As for raising money by the means of issuing bonds, Li said in
the near future his company desires to entrust China's present
debt issuing organizations to do the job.
</P>
<P>
From a long-term point of view, the company is considering
acting as the issuer of bonds on the international capital market,
in line with international practice.
</P>
<P>
In the process of raising money for the project, the notable
characteristic is that during the first half of its construction
period, money is slightly short of supply; in the second half,
money supply has a large surplus.
</P>
<P>
The surplus can repay interest and principal, and guarantee
high returns for securities investors.
</P>
<P>
After China embarked on the project, people both at home and
abroad had widespread worries on it as an investment, fearing that
the investments will get out of control.
</P>
<P>
But China has successfully put the investment amount under
control during the first three years of construction. The success
has dismissed people's worries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the amount of static investment was planned on
the basis of May 1995 prices. At that time China's building
materials prices were slightly higher than expected. Some of them
were even higher than present market prices. So the total
investment scale left some margin.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 and 1995, due to inflationary reasons, China put an
additional investment of 930 million yuan in the project, 370
million less than expected.
</P>
<P>
Li said the state capital comprises most of the project's
financial supplies, with interests of loans only accounting for 16
percent. So interests factors hold little influence in the total
investment.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has introduced market competition
systems, which has greatly reduced costs.
</P>
<P>
So far the construction is going according to schedule, and
some projects have been completed ahead of schedule, Li
said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Drivers Urged To Use Speed Governors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has backed
down on its earlier order to fix speed recording devices (SRDs)
(black box) on all public service vehicles (PSVs) and, instead,
it is urging all PSVs to fit speed governors.
</P>
<P>
To end the weeks long controversial "black box" debate,
President Daniel arap Moi on Saturday dismissed the SRDs, saying
it is not useful to Kenyans as its sole purpose is to detect an
offence committed after the accident.
</P>
<P>
President Moi was addressing a huge rally at Nyahururu
Municipal Stadium, some 200 kilometers northwest of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
He said speed governors are more suitable as they will control
speeding in PSV vehicles and eventually reduce road accidents.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the black box is very expensive, with a market
price of up to 1,000 U.S. dollars. During the debate, many PSV
vehicle owners and drivers threatened to block the Ministry of
Transport if forced to fix it.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Won't Affect Inflation (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The multi-billion dollar Three
Gorges Project, the world's-largest water-control scheme, will not
hit inflation in China, a senior company official has assured.
</P>
<P>
Li Yong'an, vice-president of the Yangtze River Three Gorges
Project Development Corporation (YRTGPDC), the major undertaker of
the massive scheme, said China has enough power to complete the
project.
</P>
<P>
During three years of construction, money supply for the
project has been "stable, timely and sufficient," said Li, who is
in charge of the company's financing affairs.
</P>
<P>
Based on May 1995 prices, static investment in the project is
90 billion yuan, equivalent to 10.8 billion US dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 50 billion yuan was planned for the project
itself, while 40 billion yuan is for resettlement schemes.
</P>
<P>
But the project is expected to continue for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Considering inflation, loan interest and other factors,
investment may involve 200 billion yuan by the time the project is
completed in 2009, he said.
</P>
<P>
The total investment is huge, but since it is a project that
takes 17 years to complete, investment in the project annually is
insignificant in the country's budget. In 1995, China put 6.5
billion yuan into the project, which only accounted for 0.11
percent of the country's Gross National Product (GNP), Li
explained.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this February, China had poured 13 billion yuan
into the project, but the country has actually raised 14.2 billion
yuan for it.
</P>
<P>
Money supply exceeding money demand has been rare in the
country's history of capital construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the project's money supply mainly depends on the Three
Gorges Foundation and bank loans. The foundation's income comes
from two sources: first, the government imposed tax payments for
the consumption of electricity; second, the government has placed
the Gezhouba Power Station, China's largest so far, under the
YRTGPDC. Through these two measures, the country is able to raise
about 100 billion yuan, or half of the total investment.
</P>
<P>
The project has won full support from the country's financial
circles. The State Development Bank, one of China's three major
policy banks, has promised to extend three billion yuan loans to
the project each year from 1993 to 2003. Over the past two years,
the bank has been fully committed to its promise. Other policy or
commercial banks have also extended loans to the project.
</P>
<P>
Foundation and bank loans will contribute more than 130 billion
yuan to the project, or 65 percent of the total investment.

<HEADLINE> Personal Cheque Service in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Personal checking in China's
capital city is expected to grow this year after three months of
trial operation at the Bank of China's Beijing branch outlets.
</P>
<P>
By last Tuesday, 46 personal cheque accounts have been opened
at the bank, involving 2 million yuan (241,000 US dollars), an
official with the branch was quoted as saying by today's "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
Formal operation will begin after the People's Bank of China's
Beijing branch promulgates a planned provision on the personal
cheque business this year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that besides the Beijing branch of the Bank
of China, the business is expected to be joined by the Beijing
branches of other three State-owned commercial banks -- the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of
China, and the China Construction Bank -- and some other
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of more business people and more high-income
earners necessitates personal cheque use, which provides a safer
and more convenient means of payment than cash, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, bank officials have suggested that
related departments streamline the procedures involved in opening
personal cheques, to promote smooth development of the business.
</P>
<P>
This English newspaper learned that total turnover of the
personal checking accounts had amounted to 7 million yuan (843,000
US dollars) since the beginning of the experiment.
</P>
<P>
Previously, such business has also been opened in Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang and Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka To Set Up Gem Development Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 7 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lanka's State Gem
Corporation (SLSGC) has planned to set up a Gem Development Bank
to regularize gem transactions in the gemming areas of the
country, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The SLSGC which was established in 1971 to coordinate gem
exports and prevent smuggling, has been able to generate a large
sum of money for the country during the period of its existence.
</P>
<P>
Under the planned Gem Development Bank, the gems of middle and
small scale traders will be purchased and disposed in bulk in a
more profitable manner with the intervention of the bank through
the owners themselves.
</P>
<P>
Those who deposit gems in the bank will be able to obtain 60
percent of the value as loans, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Bank will develop a systematic
mechanism for sales operations making available gems in large
quantities for foreigners who are at present reluctant to come
here as gems are now available only on a piecemeal basis.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka was referred to as an "island of gems" and historical
evidence shows that gems were an important product of trade during
 early times.
</P>
<P>
The gem is an important mineral export of Sri Lanka. however,
the foreign exchange it earned last year is less than one tenth of
the total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
To use the full potential of the gem resources of the country,
a set of proposals have been reportedly put forward by the State
Gem Cop including the development of an international gem cutting
and polishing center, technological improvement in the sphere of
polishing and cutting of local gems and to step up marketing
efforts in foreign countries.

HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also be responsible for carrying out
research on the properties of some herbs, which may have some
impact on the deadly virus, such as sansok, a plant found in the
eastern province of Rayong.
</P>
<P>
The committee will establish guidelines for Thai traditional
medicine and supervise safe and standardized care of Aids patients
using those treatment, according to Dr Vithoon Sangsingkeo, the
ministry's permanent secretary.
</P>
<P>
Several individuals and monks claim that they have found herbal
remedies for HIV/Aids and provided medical care without a proper
license.
</P>
<P>
A pilot herbal research program will take place soon, which
will need 150-300 volunteers who test HIV/-positive.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary laboratory studies shows that sansok appears to
have a property which improves the appetite, but more research is
needed to determine its effects on the immune system, Vithoon
said.
</P>

potential, but 60 percent of the oil-bearing strata lied 5,000
meters deep underground.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has set up a bidding committee for the tapping of oil
resources in the Black Sea and established a British-Ukrainian oil
company, the first of its kind in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine produced 4 million tons of oil every year, accounting
for only 10 percent of its domestic consumption, while the rest
depended on foreign supplies, officials said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that some 1.7 billion tons of oil remain to be
tapped in Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> 110 Bhutan Refugees Arrested at Nepal-India Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- 110 Bhutanese refugees were
arrested Saturday by Indian police at Nepal-India border as
bilateral talks on the refugee issue were underway here between
Nepal and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese refugees were intercepted at Nepal's eastern
border by Indian police when they were trying to cross into the
Indian territory on their way to Bhutan, Nepal's official news
agency RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Bhutanese refugees' organizations in Nepal have organized a
peace march movement to Thimphu, capital of Bhutan, via India from
 January to appeal for the free repatriation of more than 100,000
Bhutanese living in exile, mostly in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
But no peace marcher had managed to cross the Nepal-India
border as Indian police stopped and arrested them time and again.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 1,000 Bhutanese refugees had been arrested at
the Nepal-India border and some of them were released after an
Indian court ruled their arrests as illegal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, bilateral talks between Nepal and Bhutan on the
lingering Bhutanese refugee problem in Nepal continued Saturday
between foreign ministers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is the fist bilateral talks on the issue at the foreign
minister level. Earlier, six rounds of talks at the home minister
level had not made any progress to settle the controversial
problem.
</P>
<P>
Although Nepali Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani and his
Bhutanese counterpart Dawa Tshering Saturday agreed that their
talks were in a good spirit, local analysts saw no possibility of
the final solution of the problem as the two sides still insisted
on their earlier stances over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The talks were expected to be concluded late today.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has maintained that all Bhutanese refugees in Nepal
should be repatriated but Bhutan only agreed to take back those
it considered to be genuine Bhutanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
As most of these refugees are of Nepalese origin, the two
countries have differed on how to identify them as Bhutanese
citizens.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, India To Hold Talks on Air Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian transport minister
Ling Liong Sik said today that Malaysia and India will hold
bilateral talks on the need to increase air traffic and
destinations in each other's country in New Delhi tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for New Delhi for a three-day visit, Ling said
the revision of the current agreement on flights between Malaysia
and India was badly needed following the increase in air traffic
in both countries due to increased investments and the number of
tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that among the issues that would be discussed
during his visit to India are additional flights for the existing
Kuala Lumpur-Delhi and Kuala Lumpur-Madras routes and the new
Kuala Lumpur-Bombay sector.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Malaysian Airlines and Indian Airlines
(domestic carrier) operate six flights each week on the Kuala
Lumpur-Madras sector, while the Malaysian Airlines and Air India
(international carrier) operate two flights each week on the Kuala
Lumpur-New Delhi route.
</P>
<P>
Ling said there was a need to increase flights to southern
India because 85 percent of the two million Malaysian Indians were
Tamils with family connections there.

<HEADLINE> India to Remove Software Import Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
expected to remove software import duty soon for enhancement of
the country's software industry, it is learnt here today.
</P>
<P>
In India the duty on software imports in 1991-92 was 270
percent and due to hectic lobbying with the government agencies it
was brought down to 10 percent in January 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
The government has identified the software industry as the
thrust area. It has decided to take a number of steps to help the
country earn billions in revenue from software and services
export. Some of these steps are liberalizing and simplifying
strict policies and procedures of doing business in the country.
This would attract foreign investment and help the already
existing units, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
In software export, the government has provided supportive
environment through the establishment of the export processing
zones, 100 percent export oriented units scheme, etc. to promote
exports.

<HEADLINE> BJP's Foreign Policy for Partnership, Not Patronage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- If the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP), the biggest opposition party in India, comes to power, its
foreign policy will be based on "partnership" with everyone,
without any patronage, BJP's election manifesto says.
</P>
<P>
"India's strategic frontiers lie where our vital national
interests do. In the realm of strategy, compartmentalization into
the purely diplomatic, economic or military is both unwise and
ineffective," the manifesto says.
</P>
<P>
India's relations with the US will be based on mutual respect
and inter-dependence. While India and Russia have a lot to gain
from the compatibility of their geo-political interests in Asia,
the BJP will endeavor to explore the avenues of bilateral
cooperation in this direction.
</P>
<P>
The BJP feels that "India's relations with China offer an
opportunity now to put them on a footing of friendship and
cooperation and for this the border question has to be resolved in
a fair and equitable manner."
</P>
<P>
As Pakistan continues to follow a policy of creating
instability and unrest in India, the BJP affirms that India's
sovereignty over all of Jammu and Kashmir is beyond question and
it will not accept any interference in India's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The BJP has also promised to formulate a scheme to attract
substantial investments from non-resident Indians.

WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The bodies of U.S. Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown and 32 other victims of a plane crash last

<HEADLINE> 1995 Sees Slower Economic Decline in CIS States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The year 1995 saw a slowed-down
economic decline in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
countries due to recovery of industrial and foreign trade
activities and lower inflation rates, according to a CIS
Inter-State Statistical Committee report today.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, CIS members still need more efforts
to bail themselves out of the current economic difficulties after
suffering an annual average gross domestic production (GDP)
decline of 10 percent from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there was a smaller drop in the countries' GDP,
gross industrial and agricultural output value as well as in the
investment sector as compared to the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Their GDP declined an average of five percent, down 10 points
from 1994's 15 percent, with Moldova having the biggest share of
28 percent and Tadzhikistan the smallest of only 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, their industrial production decreased by 6
percent, 17 percentage points down from 1994's 23 percent while
agricultural production decreased by 10 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade increased sharply to 179 billion U.S. dollars,
with exports worth 106 billion U.S. dollars and imports 73 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report found that unemployment increased and
people's living standards decreased last year because of the
critical economic conditions among the CIS states last
year.

<HEADLINE> India Getting 2 Billion US Dollars  in Foreign Investment in 1995-96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- India is expected to get 2 to
2.5 billion US dollars in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the
financial year of 1995-96 (from April 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996),
a record year for foreign investment in the country, Industry
Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
From June to December 1995, there had been no flagging in
investor interest in both foreign direct investment and foreign
institutional investment (FII).
</P>
<P>
This compares well with 300 to 400 million totted up in
1991-92. 75 percent of FDI flowed not from multinational companies
but from smaller companies .
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that India has attracted about 10 billion US
dollars in foreign investment during the past three years and a
third of it is in the form of FDI, the same sources said.

<P>
Dhaka, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Chief Election
Commissioner (CEC) Justice A.K.M. Sadque has resigned amidst
persistent demand from former major opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
According to an official announcement, the CEC resigned last
night and was accepted by President Abdur Rahman Biswas.
</P>
<P>
A new CEC is likely to be announced today, official source

suggested names for Sadque's replacement during their separate
meetings with the Chief Adviser of the caretaker government
Habibur Rahman last week.
</P>
<P>
Justice Sadque was appointed as the CEC on April 27 last year
by President Biswas after consultation with Former Prime Minister
Begum Khaleda Zia who stepped down on March 30 in the face of
opposition parties' non-cooperation movement.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of CEC Sadque, the BNP held the 6th
parliamentary elections on February 15 this year despite all
opposition parties' boycott.

League, the Jatiya (national) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami
"breathed a sign of relief at the news of Sadque's resignation"

<P>
BANGKOK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of protesting farmers
in front of Thai Government House is likely to grow as talks
between representatives of the rally and government officials have
so far failed to reach an agreement on any of the issues involved.
</P>
<P>
Another 10,000 protesters are expected to join the existing
13,000 who camped outside the Government House under thousands of
plastic sheet awnings on narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators demanded that Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa personally hold talks with them and that the
government come up with practical measures to resolve their
problems.
</P>
<P>
Their demands involve various issues, including dam site
relocation compensation, land rights and environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
A senior official at the Prime minister's office said Saturday
that the rural demonstrators' demands are exaggerated, which
obstructed both sides from reaching a quick settlement.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 of the protesters participating in the week-long
demonstration have been hospitalized for illnesses caused by
inadequate sanitation, hot temperature and rains during the past
few days.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan has advised Banharn

<HEADLINE> Poland: Substantially Less Pollutants in Air, Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Polish Government has recorded
substantially less pollution in the country's atmosphere and water
sources over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics released by Poland's Central
Planning Office, 1995 saw a great improvement in the country's
natural environment.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1989, the atmospheric release of sulfur dioxide,
an acid rain gas, was down by 38 percent; the release of nitric
oxide, a gas that contributes to smog in urban areas, down by 29
percent; and industrial soot, by 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period of time, the discharge of industrial waste
into surface waters, mainly reservoirs, rivers and streams,
decreased by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the volume of solid waste from industrial
production fell by one-third.
</P>
<P>
Francisrek Krawozyiski, a division head with the Central
Planning Office, attributed the improvements to increased capital
input into environmental protection efforts, industrial
restructuring and tighter restrictions on polluters, plus enhanced
public awareness about the environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Polish government's total environmental protection
spending accounted for 1.3 percent of the country's gross domestic
product, as compared to the 0.7 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts noted, Poland still lags behind other
European nations in many areas of the environment, and is far from
achieving the goal set by its own government.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, heavily polluted areas accounted for 11
percent of the country's territories, and one-third of the Polish
population were living in areas where water, air and ground-based
pollution far exceeded government standards.
</P>
<P>
The most seriously hit was Silesia, in the southwestern part of
Poland, where the release of industrial soot accounted for 70
percent of the country's total; the emission of pollutant gases,
80 percent; the discharge of industrial waste into surface waters,
60 percent; and the production of solid industrial waste, 94
percent.

<HEADLINE> France Denies Exchanging Arms for Downed Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Ministry today denied
a media report that France had provided arms to Bosnian Serbs in
exchange for the release of two French pilots downed on a NATO
raid mission last year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry said there was no
arms-for-prisoner swap, nor was compensation demanded for freeing
the two French soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The French Presidency also dismissed the report of Premiere
Chaine de Television that the pilots were released after
negotiations between a French presidential envoy and the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The talks were mediated by a Russian intelligence officer, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
It said the Bosnian Serbs agreed to release the French pilots
on condition that Paris supply arms to the former. The weapons
were shipped to Bosnia by Russia with France footing the bill.
</P>
<P>
The two French airmen, held after their Mirage-2000 jet fighter
was shot down by the Serbs in August last year, were released and
sent home in December.
</P>
<P>
France had repeatedly warned that it might take some actions to
retaliate the Serbs, including blocking the signing of the Dayton
peace accord in Paris if the pilots were not released.

BANGKOK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai Supreme Commander Viroj
Saengsit has said that he doubled the opposition would find any
issue to attack Defense Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh in the
forthcoming no-confidence debate.
</P>
<P>
Viroj made this remark before he left for the United States on
Saturday against reports that the opposition might target at the
military's arms procurement plan, which is being pushed ahead by
Chavalit.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit has not made any mistake in his work, Viroj said,
adding that he was just fulfilling his duty by proposing the plan.
</P>
<P>
The opposition reportedly has prepared to censure about 10
Cabinet members in the no-confidence motion scheduled for May 7-9
and key members of the opposition today are holding a meeting to
discuss whether Chavalit will be included in the censure list.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis:  Sino-French Relations Heading for Broad Prospects  (by Yang Qi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- When Chinese Premier Li Peng arrives
here next Wednesday for a three-day official visit, fresh vitality
will be injected into the Sino-French relations.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li's trip will also add strategic weight to the
Sino-French rapprochement in the coming century, just as what
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe described as a goodwill visit
that will usher the bilateral relations into a new era.
</P>
<P>
The visit, at the invitation of the French government, is
hailed as scheduled for a time when both countries aspire to
further expand exchanges and cooperation, economically as well as
politically, and for a time reminiscent of General Charles de
Gaulle's.
</P>
<P>
In 1964, France ventured off to become the first Western power
to set up full diplomatic relations with China and ice thawed for
political contacts and a burgeoning exchange of trade and culture,
which all culminated in positive outcomes in the era of de Gaulle
and Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-French relations came out of a low ebb in 1994 when
the two governments issued a joint communique on normalizing
relations.
</P>
<P>
The thaw was soon followed by a shuttle visit of senior
officials of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
French Senate Speaker Rene Monory and then Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur visited China while Chinese President Jiang Zemin
paid a state visit to France, all in 1994.
</P>
<P>
French and Chinese leaders reached a consensus after many
meetings that their countries, both permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council and nuclear powers in the world, have to
commit themselves to maintaining world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president noted in Paris that France and China
should view their bilateral relations from a perspective looking
beyond the 20th century and on a long-term strategic footing.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should overcome obstructions to ensure a
sound development of the bilateral relations, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
The aspirations of state leaders and ordinary people of the two
countries can be justified by the fact that China and France have
no fundamental conflict of interests because they do not have any
geographical dispute or outstanding problems left over in history.
</P>
<P>
What they have, mostly, is a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
And what's more, France is expected to benefit a great deal
from normalized relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Though it ranks as the fourth economic power worldwide and its
trade volume with China increased 30 percent in 1995 to reach
almost 5 billion U.S. dollars, France enjoyed only a humble 1.9
percent share of the Chinese market, compared with Japan's 16
percent, United States' 8 percent and Germany's 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The French have a saying which goes "toute medaille a son
revers," meaning each and every medal has its undesired reverse
side.
</P>
<P>
Though the head side of the medal demonstrates the headway
France has made in economic cooperation with China, the tail side
shed light to what it still lags behind the world's top three
economic powers -- the United States, Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leaders have always believed that the economies of
China and France are strongly complementary and have encouraged
Chinese enterprises, large and small alike, to cooperate with
their French counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The French leaders and business executives have come to realize
that the economic takeoff in China and in the Asia-Pacific region
as well will serve as a big incentive for the sustained
development of French and global economies.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have found that their willingness to cooperate in
the economic field is solid and that there is a great potential
for such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation, however, will not stop short of permeating through
the sectors of culture and education.
</P>
<P>
Both China and France boast of a long history and a
well-established culture.
</P>
<P>
The French and Chinese people have a lot to learn from each
other, which makes room for still more exchanges and cooperation.

<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Sweden and France claimed the
semifinal places in the Davis Cup on Saturday when they took
winning 3-0 leads in their world group quarter-final ties.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic took a surprise 2-1 lead over defending
champions the United States and Italy gained a similar edge over
South Africa after Saturday's doubles, with the reverse singles to
decide the outcome on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
France, champions in 1991, profited from the absence of
Michael Stich and the indisposition of Boris Becker to oust
former holders Germany in Limoges.
</P>
<P>
Arnaud Boetsch and Guy Forget clinched a French home victory
with a 7-6, 6-4, 7-6 win over Marc Goellner and Becker, who was
weakened by a bout of bronchitis which had ruled him out of
Friday's singles.
</P>
<P>
In Calcutta, Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti recovered from a
poor start to beat Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupati 6-7, 6-3, 6-4
6-1 and see Sweden, five times Davis Cup champions, through to
the last four.
</P>
<P>
The tie was overshadowed by a row between the two nations
after the Swedes, annoyed by customs delays which held up special
food and equipment, upset their hosts with remarks about India.
</P>
<P>
India complained to the International Tennis Federation after
Swedish captain Carl-Axel Hagekog said the tie could become a
"hate match".
</P>
<P>
In Prague, Petr Korda and Daniel Vacek, nominated just before
the match, overwhelmed seasoned Americans Patrick McEnroe and
Patrick Galbraith 6-2, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Czech captain Vladimir Savrda decided at the last minute to
bring in Korda and Vacek for Jiri Novak and Martin Damm and the
gamble paid off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
In Rome, Andrea Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso staged a dramatic
comeback from two sets down to overcome brothers Wayne and Ellis
Ferreira 5-7, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6, 6-2 and give Italy, conquerors of
1994 and 1995 runners-up Russia in the previous round, a 2-1 edge
over South Africa.

facilities in the western part, gas supplies in the downtown area,
and two porcelain kiln projects.
</P>
<P>
The local government has followed the project closely and set

<HEADLINE> Athens Marks Centennial of first Modern Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Athletes from 10 nations gathered
here on Saturday to re-enact the first Olympics in front of a
boisterous crowd of 30,000 at the marble Panathenean stadium where
the Games were revived a century ago.
</P>
<P>
The participants competed in the original 12 sports, including
the traditional marathon race which was won by Australian Gary
Henry.
</P>
<P>
A host of prominent officials from the Olympic movement from
around the world joined the festivities in honour of the 100th
anniversary of the Olympics at the Atlanta Games this summer.
</P>
<P>
Marching bands and a flag parade of the 197 International
Olympic Committee members opened the celebrations attended by IOC
President Juan Antonio Samaranch, Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos and hundreds of other celebrity visitors.
</P>
<P>
Athens put up thousands of Greek and Olympic flags around the
city and Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos ordered the illumination of
the city's famous ancient monuments to honour the centennial
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Fears of a rainstorm that would have ruined the party were
quickly forgotten as winds pushed the heavy clouds away from the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
The winners were awarded silver and bronze medals and olive
wreaths as there were no gold medals in the 1896 games.
</P>
<P>
Competitors in the 1896 Games came from Australia, Britain,
Chile, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Sweden and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic flame, lit by the sun's rays in Olympia, southwest
of Athens, last week, was to arrive at the Stadium to be carried
by Olympic and world champions representing the 22 cities that
have staged the summer Games.
</P>
<P>
The athletes, which include two-time U.S. gold medallist Roger
Kingdom, will carry the Olympic flame -- to burn in the Atlanta
Olympics in July -- 200 meters each around the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Kingdom, who will represent the 1984 Los Angeles Games, will
be joined by other top athletes like Germany's three-time Olympic
winner Renate Stecher representing the 1936 Berlin Games and
Italian Livio Berruti, gold medalist in Rome in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic flame, symbolising peace and life, will travel
2,500 km through Greece, carried by 800 relay runners, and will be
flown to Los Angeles on April 26 for another circuitous relay of
24,000 km to Atlanta to open the Olympics in July.
</P>
<P>
The Olympics began in Ancient Olympia in 776 BC and were
revived in Athens in 1896 by French Baron Pierre de Coubertin.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch invited Stephanopoulos to attend the opening
cerermony in Atlanta on July 19 and had sympathetic words for
Athens' bid to stage the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
His remarks put an end to a two-year period of cold relations
between Greece and the IOC over the host city of the centennial
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Greece was angered by the IOC vote to choose Atlanta instead
of Athens and had vowed never to bid again and to shun the
Atlanta celebrations. But relations began to ease this year and
Athens has bid to stage the 2004 Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Makinen Maintains Lead in Safari Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Tommi Makinen of Finland
maintained his two minutes lead over his nearest rival Kenneth
Eriksson of Sweden after the second stage of the world
championship Safari Rally on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Mitsubishi Lancer driver arrived in Nairobi two minutes and
11 seconds ahead of Eriksson in a Subaru Impreza.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Ian Duncan in a Toyota Celica GT4 was placed third,
ahead of world champion Colin McRae of Britain in a Subaru
Impreza. Piero Liatti of Italy in another Subaru Impreza was
fifth.
</P>
<P>
The Subaru World Rally Team hold three of the top five places
in the Safari, one of the world's toughest rallies.
</P>
<P>
Eriksson, 1995 Asia-Pacific champion heads the Subaru assault,
followed by McRae and Liatti. He had a relatively easy day
Saturday, after being hampered by a cutting-out engine and
punctures during the first leg on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was not a lucky day for McRae. He had to drive without a
right rear wheel for nearly 100 kilometers and had two punctures
in a 10-kilometer stretch. He also hit a child.
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old girl sustained a broken leg. Initial reports
had said the victim was a boy.
</P>
<P>
The Ford team said Spaniard Carlos Sainz's Ford Escort Cosworth
had its compression strut bracket dislodged, ripping off the
chassis. Temporary repairs were carried out by a helicopter
service crew, but major repairs would be necessary before the
start of the third and final stage on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Paraguayan driver Marco Galanti was forced to pull out of the
Safari after his Toyota Celica Turbo rolled over several times
while speeding near Elburgon in the Rift Valley.
</P>
<P>
Galanti and his Argentinian co-driver Martin Christie suffered
minor injuries in the accident and were evacuated to Nairobi by
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Rudi Stohl of Austria in a Audi Coupe S2 also "limped" into
Elburgon check point on three wheels after one of the rear tyres
came off. A spectator sat on the rear spoiler to balance the car.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, three British citizens resident in Kenya drowned
when the service car they were in was swept downstream in a
flooded river.
</P>
<P>
They were named as Mark Trower, his business partner Mark
Thomson and Thomson's step daughter Pascale.
</P>
<P>
They were providing technical support to British drivers Robin
Boyd and Boyd-Moss.

PARIS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The last minute inclusion of Boris
Becker, suffering a viral infection, was not enough to boost the
Germans who lost Saturday's doubles tie against France to bow out
of the Davis Cup in Limoges, France on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Guy Forget and Arnaud Boetsch won two decisive tie-breakers in
the first and third sets to defeat Becker and team-mate Marc
Goellner 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, 7-6 (9-7) in two hours and 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The world number five was well below his peak, landing very few
first serves and rarely finding a rythm with his partner Goellner.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the French passed up five opportunities to break
serve in the first set and had to climb beck from trailing 5-2 in
the tie-break before winning the first set.
</P>
<P>
Becker was the first to have his service broken in the second
set.
</P>
<P>
On a high, the French raced to a 5-1 lead in the third set
before losing 13 points consecutively to allow the Germans back to
5-4.
</P>
<P>
Becker appeared to refind form in the ensuing tie-breaker until
a shot from Forget that only just popped over the net apppeared to
disrupt the come-back and allow the French to take out the game.

RIO DE JANIERO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Football legend
"Pele" would become a father for the fourth time after doctors
announced on Saturday that his second wife Asiiria Seixas was
pregnant by in-vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first child between 55-year old Pele and his

Doctor Roger Abdelmassih said the "pregnancy has a 33 per cent
likelihood of success."
</P>
<P>
Pele, who is now Brasil's minister for sport, underwent a
vasectomy several years ago having fathered three children to his
first wife, from whom he separated in 1978. One of his sons from
that marriage is goal-keeper for the former footballer's Santos
club.
</P>
<P>
Following his marriage with Assiria in April 1994 he underwent
an operation to reverse his sterility.

<P>
NEW YORK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Firms have established 10
auto plants in the United States with a total annual production
capacity of 2.5 million vehicles, according to the Association of
International Automobile Manufacturers, Inc. (AIAM).
</P>
<P>
AIAM reported that though overseas firms began their presence
in the United States in the late 1940s, they started to establish
manufacturing arms in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The nine international auto makers in operation built nearly
1.8 million passenger cars in 1994, or one in four manufactured in
the United States that year. The Mercedes-Benz plant, the tenth,
went into operation in 1995, according to the information released
at the New York International Auto Show opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The new manufacturing facilities, with a combined investment of
12 billion dollars, have streamlined the the U.S. auto
manufacturing by introducing techniques such as lean production,
just-in-time delivery, quality groups, and employee participation,
AIAM reported.
</P>
<P>
The international automakers have also bettered the caliber of
the U.S.-made vehicles by introducing technological breakthroughs
that make vehicles more fuel-efficient, and more environmentally
sound and help them enter market of Europe, Asia and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, international automakers support the jobs of over
575,000 American workers. They also spent 39 billion dollars,
including 29 billion dollars in goods purchases, in the United
States in 1994, AIAM reported.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Americans Critical of Television </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- More than two-thirds of
Americans believe television contributes to violence, erodes
family values and fosters a distrust of government, according to a
poll released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The public also is deeply worried about increasingly graphic
portrayals of sex during prime time, said the poll, which will
appear in the U.S. News &AMP; World Report issue on newsstands Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a separate survey by mail, nearly 80 percent of Hollywood
executives questioned agreed there was a link between TV violence
and violence in real life.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three percent of the executives said TV contributed to
distrust of government, and 46 percent thought it contributed to
the decline of family values. Thirty-four percent believe TV
played some role in America's divorce rate.
</P>
<P>
"Strong majorities also supported the installation of a V-chip
on TV sets to allow parents to block out shows to which they
object," the magazine said. "Eighty-three percent of the public
backed the V-chip, and 62 percent of the Hollywood elite did."
</P>
<P>
The magazine looked at a week's worth of prime-time programs on
ABC, CBS, NBC and the Fox networks in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
Of the 58 shows monitored, almost half contained sexual acts or
references to sex.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Unlikely to Make Concessions in Talks with UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Western diplomatic sources expect
Iraq to go to the third round of talks with the U.N. due to resume
Monday in New York without making any concessions.
</P>
<P>
However, they added, the Iraqi negotiators are likely to offer
new ideas on how to overcome the obstacles hindering the progress
of the talks.
</P>
<P>
In recent statements, Deputy Prime Minister Aziz affirmed that
Iraq's talks with the U.N. on how to implement U.N. Security
Council Resolution 986 were coming across considerable obstacles.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a French newspaper Thursday, Aziz said
that Iraq's coming round of talks with the U.N. might not be
decisive, and a fourth and even a fifth round of talks might be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Iraq considers its talks with the U.N. crucial because they are
related to the future of its oil export, which has been embargoed
by the U.N. since 1990.
</P>
<P>
But the attitudes of the two sides are still wide apart on the
provisions of the resolution and Iraq agreed to hold talks with
the U.N. in the hope of easing some of the conditions on the sale
of a limited amount of Iraqi oil, according to diplomatic sources
in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Officially, Iraq still rejects the U.N. oil-for-food formula
proposed last April, which allows Iraq to export 1 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every three months under
U.N. supervision to raise money for imports of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. Security Council resolution 986, some of the money
would go to the U.N. to finance its post-Gulf war operations in
Iraq and some toward war reparations which Iraq has been ordered
to pay.
</P>
<P>
Iraq repeatedly rejected the offer, saying that it refringed on
its sovereignty. But amid increasing hardship it agreed to discuss
the offer.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi mass media have recently intensified their attacks on
the U.S., accusing it of trying to destabilize the Baghdad
government, violate Iraq's national sovereignty and prevent the
U.N.-Iraqi negotiations from securing some progress.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there is no sign to indicate that Washington
is prepared to modify its interpretation of items of U.N. Security
Council resolution 986.
</P>
<P>
Yet U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who described
Aziz's statements as pessimistic, expressed hope that the U.N. and
Iraq would come to an agreement soon.
